Jetro said China-bound exports from 14 Japanese prefectures facing the Japan sea jumped 36.5 percent in value to 106.5 billion yen last year due chiefly to strong demand for Japanese-made machinery. Imports from China which arrived in the 14 prefectures, however, declined 4 percent to 162.0 billion yen as growing domestic energy demand there resulted in fewer exports of crude oil and petroleum products to Japan. The Jetro report also said exports to and imports from South Korea, the biggest trading partner for the 14 prefectures, dropped 8.3 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, reflecting Japan's economic recession. As a result, the regions' exports to four countries on the other side of the sea -- China, South Korea, North Korea and Russia -- increased a paltry 1.7 percent to 404.4 billion yen, while their imports from these nations were down 4 percent to 697.7 billion yen. Of the 14 prefectures, Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan is the biggest exporter for the four countries, followed by Yamaguchi Prefecture, also in western Japan, and Hokkaido. Yamaguchi was atop the other 13 prefectures in terms of value of imports, trailed by Fukuoka and Hokkaido, according to Jetro.
