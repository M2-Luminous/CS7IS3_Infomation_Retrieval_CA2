Sergey Shakhray Advises Attending to Chechen Problems"] [Text] The "roundtable" on nationalities problems in Moscow yesterday heard statements by Ramazan Abdulatipov, Federation Council speaker; and Sergey Shakhray, nationalities and regional policy minister. According to Ramazan Abdulatipov, in the present situation it is necessary to study the problem of self-determination of the Russian people and to devote a separate scientific conference to the Russian question in Russia. Sergey Shakhray formulated three principles of his department's activity: National parity, self-organization, and national paternalism. "I do not agree with the thesis that the curve of interethnic conflicts in Russia is falling," Sergey Shakhray stated. In his words, the ongoing division of portfolios at the center has left the Russian regions to their own devices. The nationalities minister believes that self- organization by part of the Russian population in crisis areas can bring about a situation where Russians also become an armed party to interethnic conflicts. He said that the ministry will form three subdivisions on three blocks of problems. The first will deal exclusively with nationalities issues; the second, with the financial and economic aspects of regional policy; and the third, with northern problems. Responding to a question about his attitude to Chechnya, Sergey Shakhray stated that the federal power bodies must finally express their position on this issue, not sweep it under the rug. He thinks that at present the Chechen Republic is part of the Russian Federation de jure but in fact has no economic or political links with Russia, only criminal ones. A preliminary condition for the start of negotiations with Groznyy, according to the minister, should be free democratic elections to power bodies in the Chechen Republic, necessarily with opposition participation. Sergey Shakhray cited the pending treaty with Tatarstan as an example of constructive cooperation between the center and the regions and the building of a new federal policy. In his opinion, such treaties are the sole possible method of removing contradictions between the Russian Federation constitution and the constitutions of the republics.
