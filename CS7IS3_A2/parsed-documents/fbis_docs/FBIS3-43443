However, many of these candidates, including a former Springok rugby player, have not yet accepted their nominations. On the line now, we have ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus. Mr. Niehous, good morning. How predictable are these nominations? Were most of them expected? [Niehaus] Good morning. Actually, the nominations have been a very wide group of people that all the different Mass Democratic Movement organizations in South Africa have come forward with. So one would get a much wider net than just simply members of the ANC, and I suppose in that context some of the names that have been proposed may be surprising to members of the media. [Trudgeon] How significant is it that a lot of these pople have not yet accepted their nominations? [Niehaus] Well, I think that indicates that the lists that have now become public are only provisional lists; that one cannot at this stage say that any particular person is yet going to stand as a candidate for the ANC, or is in fact going to be elected to Parliament. All of that depends on whether those candidates are prepared to accept their nominations, and then of course there are still provincial lists conferences this coming weekend, where the 14 different regions of the ANC's nominations will be consolidated into the 9 provinces, and then of course there will be a national list conference on 15 January, where the final lists will be consolidated, and they will be made public on 18 January. So only on 18 January will we be able to present to South Africa a final list of candidates which will stand for the ANC and would have actually accepted their nominations. [Trudgeon] Now a feature of the nomination list is, quite a few media and sports personalities. I'm thinking of people like Bruce Fordyce, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, Jacqui Mofekeng, the Miss South Africa. This aspect of the list has in fact been criticized, for example, by the National Party. [Niehaus] Well, you know, the National Party can express their criticism, but the fact of the matter is that there are many people, prominent persons in South African society, who associate themselves far more with the ideals of nonracialism and democracy, as the ANC has fought for it through all the decades, and one will probably find that some of these prominent personalities will accept nomination. That is also not anything new. Throughout the world, for example in the United States, there have been, from time to time, members of the cultural community, actors, etcetera, who have shown their support for a particular political organization, because they share those ideals. But I must emphasize that many of the persons who are mentioned there -- sportsmen, actors, etcetera -- have not yet been approached, and their nominations still have to be checked with them, and only after they have made a decision can one actually say that they have accepted it, and that they are prepared to associate themselves, on that particular level, with the ANC. [Trudgeon] Perhaps one of the most important omissions, which I notice newspapers and the media have taken up in general, is that Winnie Mandela is absent from both lists. Is there any significance in that? [Niehaus] Well, I don't think one should read too much significance in it. The lists that you have received now are a list for the provisional parliament candidatures of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and also the PWV region's nominations for the National Assembly. But there is also a general National Assembly list which has been voted on, but that counting has not been finished yet, and therefore it has not been made public, and on that list, as one of the nominees, Mrs. Mandela did appear. So her name can still appear, depending on how the voting went on the national list for the National Assembly. [Trudgeon] There has also apparently been sweeping support for Peter Mokaba, the youth leader. [Niehaus] Yes. That is the situation, that there has been strong support for Mr. Mobkaba. [Trudgeon] Mr. Niehaus, one of the criticisms leveled at your list came from Wits [Witwatersrand University] political analyst Professor Tom Lodge, who mentioned that the list is perhaps a little short of business talent. Now I know you have people like Sam Motsuenyane being nominated. How do you feel about the lack of business talent? [Niehaus] Well, I don't think there is a lack of business talent. Again, it is unfortunate that categorical statements about these lists are being made at a stage when, really, only the list of the PWV region is now public. There are namy, many other provinces and regions that have made nominations, and there are also a considerable number of busines people on the national list for the National Assembly. So I would caution that analysts must wait until the final list comes out, before they can make those kinds of deductions. [Trudgeon] It's also significant that some of the people who have been nominated are not really standing, because they belong, now, to other organizations. I'm thinking of Rev. Frank Chikane, and also Mr. Zwelakhi Sisulu, who has been appointed Mr. Harmse's assistant here at the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. [Niehaus] Well, what has happened is that we left the nomination process open, so that anyone could be nominated, and then we leave it up to those particular individuals, in consultation with the ANC, to accept their nominations or to decline. Rev. Chikane has already indicated that he declines because he is not eligible to stand for any political organization, because of his position as a member of the Independent Electoral Commission. I believe the same will account for Mr. Sisulu, who is now the deputy to Mr. Harmse, or at least the nominated deputy to Mr. Harmse at the SABC.
