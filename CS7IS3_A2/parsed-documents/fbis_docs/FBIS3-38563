The seven were all employed by Sisde, the domestic intelligence agency, including former Sisde director Riccardo Malpica, his secretary Matilde Martucci, and Sisde's former comptroller Maurizio Broccoletti. The missing money was tracked down through bank accounts in San Marino whence much of it was said to have been whisked away to South America. Preventive detention warrants were issued in the case from June last year. The suspects were released, but further enquiries turned up new facts and new warrants were issued. Judicial sources said Malpica's had changed as a result of recent testimony. Initially, he was believed not have touched any of the money himself, but he is now said to be one of the team of embezzlers. The new evidence was said to have come in particular from Broccoletti, who was taken into custody on June 25 and whose testimony claimed that Interior Ministers over 10 years, including President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, were in on secret service scams. Preliminary Investigations Magistrate Vincenzo Terranova is now being asked to file formal indictments for association to commit embezzlement and reuse the money through banking and real estate investments.
