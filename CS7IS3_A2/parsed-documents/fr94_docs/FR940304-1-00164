The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for fluorescent lamp ballasts is ballasts for two F40 lamps, which is the most prevalent class. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by assuming energy-efficient magnetic ballasts with a heater cutout; levels 2 and 3 correspond to efficiencies achieved by rapid start electronic ballasts. Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes, except that for the F&hyph;32 classes level 3 corresponds to efficiencies achieved by instant start electronic ballasts.
