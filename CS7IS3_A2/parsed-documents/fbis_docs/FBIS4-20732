The members of the IMF mission, who recently published their report on the Israeli economy, worship economic theories that they want to carry out in every single country, no matter whether it is Indonesia, Italy, or Israel. Desmond Lachman has already returned to Washington. He presented the 10-page report at the beginning of the week, after toiling two days on its formulation. Lachman, a professional economist, was this year's head of the four-member mission the IMF sends to Israel every year to check out our economic situation. The mission spent two weeks in Israel, during which they had 35 meetings with top leaders of the Bank of Israel, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, banks, the Histadrut, the Industrialists' Union, and academia. The four members of the mission treated every meeting seriously. They asked a great many questions, and one of them carefully recorded all the answers. The written material grew into a large stack, but they were not worried. Lachman knew that just one meeting would be really important, the one with Bank of Israel president, Professor Ya'akov Frenkel. Up until three years ago, Frenkel served as head of the research department, and economic adviser, at the International Monetary Fund, a very, very senior position. His name goes before him in Washington as a professional, as a gifted economist who knows how to combine theory with practical knowledge of the international scene. Desmond Lachman tends to adulate Frenkel. He does not imagine even for a moment that it is possible to disagree or argue with him, and we see the results well in the report. If Lachman had not signed the report, I would swear that Frenkel had written it himself. Although it is true that Frenkel is the most well-known and accepted in Washington of all the Bank of Israel presidents we have had up until now, during Mikhael Bruno's time as president, too, the IMF mission wrote exactly what Bruno what told them to write, because Bruno also has a good professional reputation at the IMF. The members of the mission are economists who see the world through the lenses of economic figures. What the theory book says is sacred to them, and they want to carry the theory out in every single country, no matter whether it is Indonesia, or Italy, or Israel; the blueprints are the same. They see politicians as people to be wary of, and businessmen, they categorize as special interest groups. Therefore, the second they meet a Bank of Israel president who is also a famous professor of economics, they adopt his opinions and recommendations without hesitation, and all that remains for them to do is put his words on paper. They open the report with a positive and encouraging statement about the Israeli economy, which continued to grow impressively in 1993, too, along with a drop in unemployment. Afterwards, they go on with such superlatives that I almost blushed reading them, although I have no part in the great success. Next, the mission reports joyfully on the even rosier future awaiting us, "due to the acceleration of the peace process." Apparently they did not hear the radio or watch TV the entire time they were here, and never heard about the slaughter in Hebron and its ramifications for the peace process. After these words sweeter than honey, they turn to real economics and begin to deal with inflation. Here we have the opportunity of reading the president of the Bank of Israel's exact position on inflation, how it slows down growth and it is worthless to try it as a cure for unemployment. The report also points out that it is worthwhile paying special attention to the fast growth in the amount of money and credit in the economy, as well as the sharp rise in the prices of shares on the market, which has brought the public great financial wealth, and that these two phenomena constitute a danger of inflation. In these descriptioms, the self-abnegation of the IMF economists before Frenkel is so extreme as to be almost ridiculous. They speak of the rise in the amount of money in the last third of 1993 and the sharp rise in the market then, as though the Bank of Israel had no connection to it. Who gave the banks the tremendous monetary loans? Who was responsible for the growth in the amount of money in the economy, if not the Bank of Israel? Who could have stopped the credit the banks were pushing on their customers to use in buying shares and trust funds, and thus have partially prevented the rise in prices on the market, if not the Bank of Israel? But it is not nice to raise such impolite questions. Instead, Lachman chose to praise the Bank of Israel for raising interest. Right after this, the mission goes on to laud the exchange rate policy, which the president of the Bank sees as his own personal baby. There is not a word of criticism of the bank's excessive control over the rate of exchange. After this, we are privileged to read the rest of the Bank of Israel's positions on deficit reduction in the State budget, on the dangers that too generous wage agreements can pose, on the importance of expanding outlays on infrastructure and education and reducing taxes, and the whole list of structural reforms that the Bank advocates. The mission even takes the trouble to point out that there is room to give all the "savings mechanisms" a try, i.e., to include the stock market, too, also a well-known position of the Bank of Israel. At this point, we may well ask: what do we need all this for? Why do we need these four scholars to come and write up this superficial report that is nothing but a list of slogans? Anyway, how can anyone come to any country for two weeks and understand what is really happening there? It is true that the extent of their understanding of the complicatedness of the Israeli economy comes to about zero; but on the other hand, why torture four good men like this? After all, they have a good place to work, nice paychecks, travel all over the world; so what if their report is a joke? The main thing, anyway, is that someone has told us how well we are doing.
