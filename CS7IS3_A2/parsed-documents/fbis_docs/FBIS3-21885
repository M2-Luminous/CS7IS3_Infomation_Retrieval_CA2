Whereas, during 1992, 6,400 kg of hashish were confiscated, in 1993 that number rose to 49,000 kg. However, 19 of those 49 tons were taken from containers discovered at sea, near the port of Ponta Delgada, on Ilha de Sao Miguel, in the Azores. As for marijuana, the seizures tripled from one year to the next: from 8.5 kg in 1992 to 24 kg last year. The figures on cocaine declined, but this is nearly all explained by the fact that the confiscation of 1,800 of the 1,886 kg of cocaine seized in 1992 was due to a single operation to combat the international traffic. During 1993, the volume of cocaine seized was approximately 167 kg. In the case of heroin, the figure rose: 87 kg last year, versus 53 kg in 1992. As for barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquillizers/hypnotics, the annual confiscation numbers have not even exceeded hundreds of grams. It should be noted that the 1993 statistics for all drugs relate to the amounts tallied from January to November. Major Confiscations The largest of the cocaine seizure operations resulted in the discovery of nearly 2 tons of the white powder in June 1992, when the PJ [Criminal Investigations Police] dismantled an international drug trafficking network in cooperation with several European police forces. This occurred along Cabo de Sao Vicente. During one week of February 1993, the Criminal Investigations Police conducted two operations leading to the confiscation of a total of 26 kg of heroin in the Greater Lisbon area. This was the largest store of heroin seized last year. During 1993, many hashish confiscations were made south of Setubal. In just nine operations, an equal number of tons was seized. In October of that year, the PJ in Setubal seized 8.5 tons of hashish being transported on two TIR [International Road Transport] trucks on the Aguas de Moura-Pegoes highway. This was the largest hashish confiscation ever made on continental territory. Red Zones In other words, these are districts overrun with vice and addiction. In Lisbon, the notorious Casal Ventoso should be carefully avoided. This claim is made by one who knows: Jacinto Meca, an ex-officer in charge of the PJ's Central Directorate for Drug Trafficking Investigation: "We conduct operations there almost every week. It's a difficult, complicated district, because it has its own very special connections for protection and complicity." It is also the area of the capital in which the largest number of needles can be found per square kilometer of roadways. Also in the capital area, Picheleira, Estoril's Fim do Mundo district, Olivais, and the vicinity of Damaia de Baixo are some of the convenient havens for drug addicts. In the north, the Porto districts of Cerco and Se are not advisable for anyone merely wishing to walk his little dog after 2200. Consumers and Traffickers Prominent among the 1,899 consumers arrested in 1992 were 465 manual workers, 92 street vendors, 90 students, 40 female domestics, 34 public servants, and 400 without occupations. There were also musicians, paramedics, members of the military, and teachers, as well as a theatrical performer who was arrested for playing his part. Over half of those arrested lived in their parents' homes; 43 percent were unemployed, without children; and only 2 percent of the total lived in rural areas. Most of the drug addicts were aged between 16 and 45 years, and only 7 percent of all those arrested were women. There were all types among the 931 traffickers arrested in 1992. The most significant figures indicate 228 manual workers, 101 street vendors, and, once again, female domestics: 60 ladies faithfully devoted to the drug traffic. Of this group of persons arrested, 61 percent had received primary or preparatory schooling, and only 1 percent had reached the university level. There are foreigners for all tastes participating in the drug traffic. The majority are Brazilians, Venezuelans, and Spaniards, followed closely by Guineans, Cape Verdeans, and Angolans. By November of last year, 1,209 traffickers had already been caught in the police trap, and 70 percent of them are in preventive custody. The municipalities in which this breed abounds are those of Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Loule, Faro, Porto, Gondomar, Lisbon, Loures, Oeiras, and Sintra. Anyone desiring drugs in Angra do Heroismo, Braganca, or Guarda has to sweat a little. They are the national municipalities in which the incidence of drug trafficking is slighter. However, crime sometimes compensates for this: at least until the criminal is caught. A few months ago, a female heroin trafficker operating in Casal Ventoso, and considered the leading one in the district, was arrested. This businesswoman's profits: 5,000 contos per day. As for "superstars" of the Portuguese-style drug traffic, not many names are known; but there are enough to cause headaches for the forces of order. During the 1980's, the Galician clan of the Charlines and Laureano Oubina were the precursors for the landing of hashish on Portuguese shores. The Viriatos group, among those appearing in the newspapers, is the owner of one of the largest establishments for landing and transporting drugs to Galicia. Also known are sporadic links between small-scale Portuguese from the forest area and Sito Milanco's drug trafficking "super-gang." However, some months ago, one of Casal Ventoso's major traffickers was arrested: aged 37, he was employed in the hotel business in his spare time, and had the code name "O Aleman" [The German]. Informants The PJ has agents specializing in these activities, who sometimes infiltrate the gang of criminals itself. "We also receive anonymous reports, or information given in person. For example, it may come from someone who knows in detail what is going on in his district or area, and who considers it a good idea to give valuable information to the police. There have been instances in which the network of informants has crossed borders. During an investigation that ended in February 1993, the Criminal Investigations Police received the cooperation of two infiltrated agents from the Bundescriminalamt [(German) Federal Criminal Bureau]. As a result of the operation, over seven kg of cocaine were seized." Shootings The death of a trafficker during an operation occurred only once in recent years. He drew his weapon, aiming at a policeman, and had to be brought down. Homicides: "One case directly linked to the drug traffic may have appeared within the past two years." Another known shooting took place during the October 1993 operation: the one involving the 8.5 tons of hashish. In order to halt the suspects, the Criminal Investigations Police proceeded to fire a few shots, wounding a Galician "narco"-criminal in the leg. However, "the methodical, time-consuming manner in which our investigations are conducted doesn't give rise to large-scale shootings." This is fortunate, because seizures of hunting rifles, machine guns, and other heavy-caliber weapons are common. In the drug underworld there are "authentic weapons of war," as Jacinto Meca warns. Parallel Businesses The most common is money laundering. There has been legislation in Portugal to combat it only since February 1993. The smuggling of gold or various types of equipment may also occur. It should be remembered that many of the national drug trafficking networks resulted from the reconversion of the traditional contraband networks. Prostitution, not a parallel business, is an old, faithful friend.
