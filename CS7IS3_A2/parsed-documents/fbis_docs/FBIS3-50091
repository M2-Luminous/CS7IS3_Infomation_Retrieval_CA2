No country, no significant political power, no noteworthy politician has any claims against us. The minister pointed out that treaty obligations on the inviolability of borders, the renouncement of claims, and the protection of minorities (the exception here is Lithuania, with whom we will sign a similar undertaking soon) are linking Poland to all of our neighbors. As of February, an agreement on the association with the European Union [EU] will come into force. Structures of the regional cooperation are developing, albeit slowly: the Visegrad Group, the Council of the Baltic States, the Central European Initiative [CEI]. The CSCE, where we distinguish ourselves with activity, has already borne fruit, with a significant collection of pan-European military and political obligations. "Poland is not alone; Poland has good relations with its neighbors; Poland is not threatened with war," Olechowski stated. As far as the threats are concerned, in the minister's view, "There can be attempts to exert political and economic pressure, to weaken the feeling of security, threats to economic and civilization development as well as to the international position of Poland. We can find ourselves in the direct proximity of a reborn empire, which may make efforts to extend its sphere of influence also to Central Europe. The situation on the post-Soviet territory can rapidly be destabilized. Conditions for the trade exchange and economic cooperation may become worse. Nationalities' problems and rivalry may increase in this region. Our ecological security may, as a result of the course of events, be threatened." While referring to the Brussels summit of NATO states and the meeting of presidents in Prague, the minister said that, as a result of both of these events, "Poland is more secure today than it was yesterday." Olechowski underscored that the statement on opening NATO to new members from East Europe was the decision to which we attached the greatest importance. "This fundamental decision on opening the alliance, closed so far to new members, has been clearly favorable to Poland. It makes our future membership possible and increases the sense of purpose for actions in that direction. "However, the decision is imperfect in two aspects: It defines neither a date for accepting new members nor the criteria they will have to meet; it conditions the acceptance of a new member not only to the degree of its readiness to join, but also to the assessment of European security as a whole. This gives rise to suspicions as to the significance of the possible opposition by Russia, although the statements clearly point out that `no (third) country is to have a right to veto NATO's decisions on the issue.'" According to Olechowski, the Partnership for Peace initiative has established a new form of cooperation with NATO. It also has a "significant political dimension as it is linked to the acceptance by participating states of important obligations to protect democracy in internal relations and to observe international law in external relations. It gives particular emphasis to the commitment to restrain from a threat of the use of force against territorial integrity and political independence of states and to respect existing borders and solve disputes by peaceful means. "The states participating in the initiative will also confirm their commitment to observe CSCE principles and adopt obligations concerning disarmament and arms control. Furthermore, in the military sphere, the initiative obligates, among other things, the clarification of military planning and budget and the ensuring of civilian control over the Armed Forces. The countries that will not observe the above-mentioned principles will be subject to negative reactions by NATO." According to the minister, this important political dimension of the initiative, for which Polish diplomacy was striving vigorously, "will improve the state of security on our continent, and, for that reason alone, it is favorable to us. However, the main benefits from the Partnership for Peace initiative are: First, it will ensure our closer cooperation with NATO than to date; second, it will bring us closer to membership in this institution (in accordance with the summit decisions, active participation in the program will be one of the criteria for new members); and third, it will improve the level of our security. Referring to other decisions taken at the Brussels summit to which we attach significance, the minister said that Poland "consistently believes that the U.S. presence in Europe is necessary for the security of our continent. We recognize statements like `nothing is more important for our (American) security than the relations with Europe,' as well as decisions to maintain the presence of 100,000 U.S. soldiers as unequivocally beneficial for us," he stated. Olechowski pointed out that "Poland is interested in seeing the Western European Union [WEU], which is an institution for the military cooperation of the members of the EU, becoming more significant and effective. Achieving the status of an associated member, we have the right to make efforts to obtain the same status in all institutions created by the union. Then, with the progress of integration with the EU, we will be tightening our cooperation with the WEU until our full membership, which is linked to NATO membership. The WEU security guarantees are much more categorical than the NATO guarantees." Pointing once again to the "clearly positive balance for Poland" of decisions made by NATO, the minister recalled that the Council of Ministers expressed on the 10th of this month "a will and a readiness for active participation in the implementation of programs linked to the Partnership for Peace scheme and to obligate the ministers of foreign affairs and national defense to prepare proposals for appropriate actions, including legal acts connected with Polish participation in its implementation. These actions should ensure that full advantage will be taken from the opportunities created by the scheme (...) to tighten the links between Poland and NATO and to increase the level of external security of the Polish state." According to Olechowski, the Council of Ministers confirmed "that our strategic objective (...) was and has been Polish membership in the North Atlantic Alliance." He added that it seemed important that the Sejm also expressed a similar view. "If today we can say that, albeit to an insufficient degree, Poland after all managed to exert influence on the final shape of the NATO summit, then it all happened to a large extent thanks to the wide political support the president and our diplomacy enjoyed in the world. Such a consensus, this impressive support, are still needed in the difficult efforts to join NATO and the WEU. A lack of consensus makes these efforts worthless." In the final part of his speech, the minister said: "An active policy of developing friendly relations with all of our neighbors, patient and consistent promotion of regional cooperation, a policy toward ethnic minorities that is in keeping with European standards, active participation in European initiatives, and economic initiatives such as the partnership for development scheme that was formulated by the prime minister are examples of other significant actions. Although the world around us is changing and proceeds in an unknown direction, and although we have only limited influence on the course of events, all of these actions result in the fact that we do not have enemies around us."
