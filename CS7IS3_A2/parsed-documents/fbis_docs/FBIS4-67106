FBIS4-67106 "jptdd020__l94091" JPRS-TDD-94-020-L JPRS Narcotics 9 May 1994 NEAR EAST & SOUTH ASIA EGYPT Authorities Searching for `Most Dangerous' Arms, Narcotics Authorities Searching for `Most Dangerous' Arms, Narcotics Smuggler NC3004193394 NC3004193394 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 25 April publishes on pages 14 and 15 a 2,200-word investigative report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi under the headline: "Top Secret and Published for the First Time." "Arrest of a Kuwaiti in Cairo on Charges of Financing Terrorism, and Search for Saudi Arms Dealer." Under this banner headline, the writer says that on 1 April the State Security Investigations Department arrested a Kuwaiti called 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil in a furnished apartment and took him for questioning on charges of "financing terrorism and supporting the extremists." During his interrogation, al-Mujaybil said that he is a member of an officially registered Kuwaiti society called "the Society for the Revival of Islamic Heritage." This society is headed by Shaykh Khalid Sultan Bin-'Isa and is managed by Shaykh 'Abdallah al-'Atiqi. He said he came to Egypt a few days ago to extend some aid to a number of benevolent enterprises in Egypt. Egyptian security sources, according to the writer, have denied the story that al-Mujaybil came to extend aid to benevolent enterprises, saying that he was arrested red-handed. He was arrested in Cairo after several days and not when he arrived. The investigation sources revealed that a member of an extremist group who was under surveillance and owns a printing press for printing and publishing religious books and leaflets was seen more than once meeting with the Kuwaiti 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil immediately after the latter's arrival in Cairo. When the security forces stormed the house of the printing press owner, they discovered a check for a large sum of money paid to him by 'Abd-al-Rahman al- Mujaybil, as well as large sums of foreign currency. Al-Mujaybil claimed under interrogation that he gave the check to the printing press owner to pay for printing a book because the cost in Egypt is less than any other place, and that his relationship to the man is purely professional. However, the security authorities were not convinced and the investigation is continuing. Meanwhile, the writer continues, the security authorities in Egypt and in more than one Arab country--such as Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan--are looking for a Saudi arms dealer called Nasir Mashhur al-Ruwayli, classified as the "most dangerous arms and drug smuggler across Arab borders." He uses drug smuggling to conclude arms deals. He smuggles these arms to Arab countries where there is intensive extremist activity, particularly Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. The writer says that al-Ruwayli is wanted in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.
