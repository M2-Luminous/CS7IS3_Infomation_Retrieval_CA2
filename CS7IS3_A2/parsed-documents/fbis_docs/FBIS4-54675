According to the speaker, Solidarity has been deliberately avoiding negotiations with the government. It has announced the escalation of strike action because the aim of the union is to overthrow Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet. Jozef Oleksy said that trade unions should primarily fight to resolve problems of employees and not play political games for their own benefit.
