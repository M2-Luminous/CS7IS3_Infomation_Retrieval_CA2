FBIS4-20023 "drweu080_e_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Hurd, Christopher Warn Serbs `To Do More' Hurd, Christopher Warn Serbs `To Do More' LD2604102494 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1009 GMT 26 Apr 94 LD2604102494 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today warned Bosnian Serb forces that they needed to do more to avoid the risk of NATO air attacks. After brief talks at the Foreign Office in London, the two men underlined the need for total compliance with a NATO ultimatum, which demands that Serbs have until 0001 GMT tomorrow to withdraw heavy weaponry at least 12 miles (20 kms) from the ravaged Bosnian Muslim enclave or face air strikes. As the clock ticked towards the deadline, Mr Christopher told reporters: "The information I have this morning is that the Serbs have moved a number of heavy weapons outside the 20 km zone, but there are a number still there. It is clear that today will be an important day to see if they really will comply with requirements." Mr Christopher said: "There's been some movement but not enough yet." Foreign Secretary Mr Hurd said it was a "critical period," and reiterated his hope that there would be no need for air strikes. "There should be no difficulty in working out in the course of tomorrow whether there is a need for air strikes or not. I hope there won't be. I hope the Serbs will comply with the requirements of NATO and the Security Council. If they don't, then they know there will be air strikes against them." Mr Hurd and Mr Christopher met as a new international effort was launched in London to promote peace in Bosnia. Officials from Russia, the United States and the EU [European Union] were meeting together for the first time as part of a new "contact" group with the aim of developing a co-ordinated approach to the former Yugoslavia. Their aim is to seek a four-month "cessation of hostilities" -- an expression which will be increasingly heard in relation to Bosnia rather than "ceasefire" -- while work begins in shaping a new map of Bosnia. During that period, the group would work with the Serbs and Bosnian Muslims on the map, the key to an overall settlement. Implicit in this is that the map -- if it is agreed by the Serbs, the Muslims and the Croats -- will involve a "roll-back" by the Serbs from some of the positions they have occupied as a result of the hostilities. Also during this period, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, would decide whether he wants to put troops in between the warring parties. An official said: "It is virtually impossible to negotiate on the map and towards a peace settlement while people are killing each other." Lord Owen will be represented on the contact group by three Europeans, British, French and German. The British representative is David Manning, head of the Foreign Office Eastern Department. Today's meeting follows yesterday's high level discussions at Downing Street with ministers from Russia, the United States and France, where it was regarded that the bringing together of key players in the diplomatic arena would provide an additional "political punch" to the quest for peace. The aim is to find a unified diplomatic position which will satisfy and influence the warring parties.
