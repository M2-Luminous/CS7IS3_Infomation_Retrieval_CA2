According to Rutilio Aguilera, no challenge has been received so far against the final vote tally. If this holds true until the official deadline expires on Monday, it will allow the TSE to announce the official call on Tuesday. Aguilera noted that the four principal shortcomings detected in the 20 March elections will be averted in the runoff because corrective measures have been taken. [Begin Aguilera recording, in progress] ...fortunately there has not been any challenges, and also because of the delay with which the political institutes, via their representatives, are conducting them. As for your question, we have clearly seen that as of last Wednesday -- the date the final vote tally document was signed -- political groups were given 72 hours to submit requests to nullify the results. Because no such request has been presented, as I noted earlier, the TSE will have 48 hours to issue the decree after the deadline expires. The TSE will first confirm the results. Second, it will issue the decree calling for a runoff election. [end recording] For his part, Eduardo Colindres, the Christian Democratic Party's TSE magistrate, noted that the organization has initiated a campaign to urge citizens to notify the TSE of any problems encountered in their electoral districts or any problems with their electoral identification cards. He also said plans are being made to prepare identification and electoral identification cards. [Begin Colindres recording, in progress] ...the preparation of the citizens' identification and electoral identification cards. In other words, these new documents will replace the electoral identification cards and the people's personal identification cards. We have implemented an information campaign to advise citizens where they can vote and how to vote in an effort to avert problems that occurred in San Salvador. We will conduct an orientation and information campaign on how and where to vote. [end recording] The call for the presidential runoff election will be made officially on Tuesday, provided the departmental electoral boards in San Salvador and Cuscatlan turn in the consolidated results of the 20 March elections for deputies in accordance with the electoral code.
