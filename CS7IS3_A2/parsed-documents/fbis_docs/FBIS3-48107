The speakers said that the New Year address of President Kim Il-song is a highly important guideline to which the Korean people should hold fast this year. They called for stepping up the general onward march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and hard struggle by further strengthening the might of singlehearted unity. They said that they would successfully fulfil this year's plans for socialist economic construction by making continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" under the militant slogan "Let us hasten the general march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude". They declared that they would, with unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader, make continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in the fighting spirit which was displayed during the rigorous war and in the same spirit and stamina with which they brought about a great upsurge of Chollima in the difficult post-war period and thus make 1994 a year of historical advance in the Korean revolution and construction.
