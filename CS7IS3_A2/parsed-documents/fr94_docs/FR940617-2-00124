Allocation Amounts The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available $80,802,000 in FY 1994 refugee social service funds as part of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112). Of the total of $80,802,000, the Director of ORR will make available to States $68,681,700 (85%) under the allocation formula set out in this notice. These funds would be made available for the purpose of providing social services to refugees. In addition, the Director of ORR is making available $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula in this notice for additional services to former political prisoners from Vietnam. ORR intends FY 1994 to be the last year in which a special set-aside will be allocated for additional services for former political prisoners from Vietnam. A. Discretionary Social Service Funds for Vietnamese Political Prisoners In recognition of the special vulnerability of refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director of ORR has set aside $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula set forth in this announcement, based on the number of actual political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993. This formula allocation is shown separately in Table 1 (cols. 7 and 8). States are required to use this allocation to provide additional services, as described below, to recent arrivals from Vietnam who are former political prisoners and members of their families. Allowable services for the above-cited funds for political prisoners include the following direct services: (1) Specialized orientation and adjustment services, including peer support activities; and (2) specialized employment-related services, as needed. Adjustment services include any service listed under 45 CFR 400.155(c) of the ORR regulations. Under no circumstances may these funds be used for direct cash payments or stipends, or for the purchase of advertising space or air time.
