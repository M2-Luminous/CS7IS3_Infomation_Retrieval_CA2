Local yeshiva students blame the Palestinian policemen for the act. Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, visited the place and said the issue is under investigation. Answering a question, Maj. Gen. Biran said that according to the agreement, every Israeli citizen is entitled to carry arms in Jericho. Our correspondent notes that the yeshiva students in the synagogue are armed. Meanwhile, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is banning Israeli vehicles from entering Jericho. Even the passage of military vehicles through the city requires a special permit. Our correspondent Moti Amir assesses that this is done in order to prevent unnecessary friction during 'Id al-Adha and the celebrations accompanying the opening of the Palestinian security service office in the city.
