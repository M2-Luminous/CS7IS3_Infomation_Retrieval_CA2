FR940119-0-00028 FR940119-0-00005 By letter dated August 25, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;567), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded that it found the changes to Colorado's Coal Mining and Reclamation Regulatory Program to be satisfactory. By letters dated April 15 and August 24, 1993 (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;542 and CO&hyph;566), the U.S. Forest Service responded that it had no comments concerning the amendment. By letters dated April 12 and August 26, 1993 (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;540 and CO&hyph;568), the U.S. Bureau of Mines responded that it had no comments. By letters dated June 10 and August 27, 1993 (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;549 and CO&hyph;571), EPA's Region VIII office responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. By letter dated September 1, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;572), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded that it had no comments. By letter dated August 27, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;569), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), responded that it had no comments. By letter dated June 24, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;551), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) responded that the proposed amendment did not appear to conflict with any current MSHA regulations. By a second letter dated October 15, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;579), MSHA commented that while no direct conflict between Colorado's proposed changes to its rules and current MSHA regulations can be found, one item may cause future concern. Specifically, MSHA commented that Colorado's proposal to allow partial reclamation of highwalls means that any remnant of a highwall remaining after final reclamation creates the potential for misinterpretation to the extent that a mining company may not consider a [highwall] remnant to be a highwall while MSHA may, in certain situations, consider a remnant to be a highwall. The Director agrees with MSHA that no direct conflict exists with Colorado's proposed amendment. In addition, OSM refers MSHA to the discussions at finding Nos. III.3. and 4. above, wherein Colorado's proposed Rule 4.14.1(f)(iii), regarding continuously mined areas, and Rule 4.14.1(g)(iii), regarding remining operations, requires highwall remnants to be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. The operator must also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall remnant is stable. Colorado's proposed rules are substantively identical to the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b)(3) and 817.106(b)(3). Although a mining company may not consider a remnant to be a highwall, the company must, upon approval of this amendment, comply with Colorado's proposed rules addressing performance standards for highwall remnant stability. Consequently, the potential for misinterpretation of what constitutes a highwall remnant is minimal. The Director notes that if MSHA's regulations contain additional performance standards regarding highwall remnants, MSHA is not precluded from applying them. 3. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), the Director is required to solicit comments from the SHPO and the ACHP for all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties. Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP responded to OSM's request. 4. EPA Concurrence Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). None of the changes that Colorado proposes to its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. Nevertheless, OSM requested EPA's concurrence on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. CO&hyph;562). EPA did not respond to OSM's request.
