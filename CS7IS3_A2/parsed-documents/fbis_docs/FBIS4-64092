According to preliminary data of the Central election committee as of Thursday morning (the information was received after the verification of the ballot papers with the signatures of the republic's citizens in support of this or that candidate to the presidency in the regional and city electoral commissions and annulment of signatures recognized invalid), it appeared that about 364,000 citizens of the republic have nominated Vyacheslav Kebich. (The minimum number needed for the contenders to be registered in the Central election committee as an official candidate to the presidency is 100,000 - Interfax). In addition, the constitutional majority of the parliament, 236 people's deputies under the necessary minimum equal to 70 votes, are in favor of Kebich's promotion. Leader of the opposition Belarussian Popular Front Zenon Poznyak occupies the second place. His initiative group has collected as many as 215,000 signatures. Vasiliy Novikov, who was nominated by the Party of Belarus' communists, is on the third place with 180,000 signatures. Leader of the former parliamentary commission to combat corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko who has managed to collect 152,000 signatures follows Novikov. Ex-speaker of the Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich occupies the fifth place in the list of contenders (as many as 122,000 signatures). Representative of the Agrarian party Aleksandr Dubko is not far behind (113,000 signatures). The team of the chairman of the Party of Popular Accord Gennadiy Karpenko handed over 109,000 signatures to the electoral commissions. However, after invalid ballot papers were annulled there remained only 86,000 votes; that's why he has no juridical right to continue the struggle for presidency. Karpenko's hopes to become the parliamentarians' nominee failed as well. Though he managed to collect signatures of 78 deputies, on Wednesday as many as 11 of them, predominantly representatives of the Social Democratic party, unexpectedly recalled their signatures. IF Note: During his conversation with our Interfax correspondent leader of the Belarussian social-democrats Oleg Trusov who heads the initiative group of the ex-speaker explained this behavior of his single minded deputies by the revenge for the "gentlemen agreement" between the candidates representing the right-wing forces not to interfere with signatures collection which was allegedly violated by Karpenko. In Trusov's words, Karpenko managed "to appropriate" several thousands of signatures collected in support of Shushkevich. Belarus' Central Elections Commission reported to Interfax that the final results of signatures' collection for the promotion of the candidates to the presidency would become public in the evening of May 27.
