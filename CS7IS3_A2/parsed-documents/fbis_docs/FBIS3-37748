The note to be passed over to the Afghan leaders says the Afghan side violates the bilateral treaty on friendship, cooperation and good-neighbourly relations signed in December 1993. In the opinion of the Tajik side, the accusations are grounded with the assignment of Afghan border territories to militants of the Tajik opposition, who systematically shell Russian border posts and Tajik villages together with Afghan mujaheddin not controlled by the official Kabul authorities. Several populated localities of the border Shuro-Abad region in the Tajik south were shelled on February 21 from Afghan territory, says the document. A many-hour fighting was imposed on the 12th border post of the Moscow border unit by a mixed group of Tajik militants and Afghan mujaheddin who infiltrated inside Tajikistan. The Tajik government also has information on preparations for terrorist acts and acts of sabotage in the border Shaartuz, Kabodien, Pyandzh and some other regions in the Tajik south. The Tajik side demands that the Afghan leadership take the most decisive measures to prevent hostile actions against sovereign Tajikistan and the Russian border units, says the document. Otherwise, the Tajik government preserves the right to stop armed provocations up to destruction of Tajik militants' bases on Afghan territory.
