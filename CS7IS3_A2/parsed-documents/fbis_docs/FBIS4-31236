Minister Olechowski emphasized that the building of democratic structures in the east is a lot more difficult and that delays in the process are inevitable. When asked by journalists whether certain developments in the situation in Russia could constitute a danger to Poland, Minister Olechowski replied: [begin Olechowski recording] From that direction--often say this--neo-imperialism, if it was stepped up; we do not overdramatize this in any way [sentence as heard]. We can also see very positive signals coming from that direction. One should mention, for example, Russia's role in the recent Ukrainian conflict or the role played in the internal Ukrainian difficulties. One could mention the Latvian-Lithuanian Treaty. We are awaiting a similar treaty for Estonia. It will be an important litmus test for us. Chaos and further economic disintegration are certainly bad for us. If the situation were to deteriorate even further, it would obviously make our lives very difficult. [end recording]
