Police authorities told a subsequent news conference they believe the accused are responsible for the bombing incidents that have taken place in different places in Songkhla, Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces over the past two years. The worst of these incidents was the explosion at the railway station in Hat Yai District where three people were killed and seventy others injured. During the arrests the police gathered more evidence -- including firearms and documents in foreign languages -- with which to incriminate the four preachers. The accused deny the charges, however, insisting that they have no connection with the movement responsible for those terrorist activities, which were designed to show off to some Middle Eastern countries and hence draw their assistance. All four teachers are reportedly graduates from schools in the Middle East. Police authorities are still looking for their accomplices; some have reportedly fled and taken refuge in Malaysia. It should be noted that the authorities have no evidence to link the four preachers to last year's torching of 35 schools in the four southern provinces. Some suspected arsonists have already been arrested, but the investigation has made very little progress. The authorities were very careful in handling this case. The presence of senior police officers and the governor of Songkhla Province during the arrest of the four was an indication that the authorities must have sufficient evidence. The detention of the four preachers, though, has caused suspicion and resentment among some local Muslims as well as their students, who are very likely to hold a protest rally. Hopefully, such a rally will be peaceful, allowing justice to take its course. In any event, at this point the accused are still innocent because a court has not found them guilty. We believe the arrests are a manifestation of the authorities' determination to punish the culprits and will serve to inform the general public about the Interior Ministry's endeavors in this particular case. Unlike the school arsons, the Interior Ministry has made progress. We firmly believe that if the suspects have not committed the crimes they are accused of, the court of justice will set them free. The court's decision will depend entirely on the evidence both sides present during the trial. We therefore appeal to people who disagree with the arrest of the four suspects to be patient until the trial. We also appeal to the authorities to make sure they have sufficient evidence before they take anyone into custody, because they are playing with other people's freedom and could sabotage the people's faith in government.
