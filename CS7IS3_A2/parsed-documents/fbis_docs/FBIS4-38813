Now $1 is valued at 1,100 manat. As Abdulla Melik-Aslanov, deputy chairman of the board of the National Bank, informed a correspondent of the ANS-PRESS agency, the new exchange rate is more realistic and acceptable under today's critical economic conditions. A. Melik-Aslanov believes the increased bank exchange rate will not be accompanied by significant changes on the currency black market. He emphasized that "more surprises lie in store" with respect to official currency exchange rates.
