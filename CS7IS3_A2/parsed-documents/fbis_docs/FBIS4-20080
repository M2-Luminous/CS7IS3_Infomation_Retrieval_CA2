Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou could possibly meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday [27 April]. On that same day, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a meeting with Butrus-Ghali. Today, Foreign Minister Papoulias met with Cyrus Vance, UN special mediator on the Skopje issue. In the previous few days, Vance had meetings with Matthew Nimetz, U.S. envoy on the Skopje issue, and Skopean Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. Vance will again meet the Skopjean foreign minister in the coming days. Furthermore, Vance will meet Papoulias again before Thursday. I expect goodwill moves from both sides, Vance said during his arrival for the meeting with Papoulias. Following are the remarks of the two men after their meeting, which lasted for one hour. [Begin recording] [Kambouriani] Both Vance and Papoulias said that the effort will continue and that they are in continuous contact. When Vance was asked whether there will be an end to the impasse before the end of the week, he said: I do not want to guess when that will take place. Asked whether a new formula for a solution of the Skopje issue is being examined, Foreign Minister Papoulias said: [Papoulias] Various proposals are under examination, but in general the effort centers on overcoming the impasse. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Vance earlier talked about goodwill moves by both sides. What is your comment? [Papoulias] Look, the position of the Greek Government is known and I think that Vance's goodwill services continue and this is the positive at this time. [Kambouriani] Vance said that there are no plans for a meeting with Prime Minister Papandreou, and Papoulias ruled out a meeting, at this stage, with Skopjean counterpart Crvenkovski.
