Doan Ngoc Bong, first vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, made the remarks to some 200 Japanese business people at a seminar on investment in Vietnam held at the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). He said that as of mid-March, there were 897 licensed foreign investment projects, with a combined capital value of 8.47 billion dollars. With 56 investment projects capitalized at 542 million dollars, Japan trailed in fifth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia -- despite its being Vietnam's largest trading partner and aid donor. Among the Japanese investments are 26 industrial projects, five oil and gas projects, five bottling or canning projects, four agriculture or forestry projects, three service sector projects, one fisheries project and one housing construction project. At a bilateral economic conference held in Ho Chi Minh City last month, Japanese investors were invited to put money into industrial and export-processing zones as well as such priority areas as oil and gas, cement, food processing and manufacturing for export. Doan Ngoc Bong said Vietnam also welcomes more investment in the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which Hanoi will treat as a special priority. He noted that the speed of Vietnam's absorption of foreign investment funds has been rapid, rising at an average 52 percent annually. Vietnam received 70 percent as much investment in 1992 as it attracted during the previous four years, while the total investment in 1993 was 40 percent more than that in 1992, he said. But he acknowledged that Vietnam has much to accomplish if it is to continue attracting foreign investment in the face of increasing competition from other countries in the region. Among impediments that have been cited by potential investors are the country's weak infrastructure, shortcomings in the legal, financial and accounting systems, and poor local working conditions.
