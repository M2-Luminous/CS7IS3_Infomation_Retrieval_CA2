Under the wise guidance of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song the flag of the Saenal Juvenile Union, the first communist juvenile revolutionary organisation of our country, was carried forward by the anti-Japanese Children's Corps and then by the Korean Children's Union after the liberation and the Korean children have vigorously traversed the road of victory and glory under this flag, the editorial says, and goes on: The congress will be a congress of loyalty which will demonstrate the fervent and strong will of the 3 million members of the Korean Children's Union to walk with fortitude under the guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il the road of Paektu hewn by the anti-Japanese guerrillas and anti-Japanese children's corps members under the guidance of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song. In order to smash the anti-DPRK campaign of the imperialists and the reactionaries of the world and defend and exalt our-style socialism centering on the popular masses, it is imperative to direct efforts to preparing not only the party members and the youth but also the children. There are no more important task and no greater honour to our Children's Union members today than to become true guards of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. The Children's Union members should become loyal and filial sons and daughters who follow General Kim Chong-il with pure heart and remain loyal and dutiful to him. Strictly abiding by the study-first policy of the party, the Children's Union members should study hard, cultivate communist moral traits and build their physical strength. And they should actively participate in socio-political activities and the do-good-things movement and have the spirit of safeguarding the motherland against the aggression moves of the enemies and the readiness to be rifles and bombs as members of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] do. All the members of the Children's Union should, in the future, too, as in the past, vigorously advance for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of chuche which started from Mt. Paektu, flying the red flag of the Children's Union as true young guards of the party, following the WPK and LSWYK members.
