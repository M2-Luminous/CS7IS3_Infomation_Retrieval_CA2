The treaty will come into full force only after this is done. The treaty will be ratified but, for the time being, it is important that the treaty serve as an incentive on these issues and not a substitute. [Correspondent] In Sochi you declared that Russia had legal, historical, and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus. How will these interests reflect on the Abkhaz issue? [Kozyrev] This issue should be regulated in such a way that would allow Georgian integrity. At the same time, the status of Abkhazia will be defined so that peace is established in Georgia. [Correspondent] How can that be done? [Kozyrev] It is an issue for negotiation.
