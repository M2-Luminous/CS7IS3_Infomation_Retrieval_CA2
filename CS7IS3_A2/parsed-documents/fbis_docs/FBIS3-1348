As the only party which realised this, the National Party [NP] had to gain enough representation in a future cabinet to communicate this concept successfully. Mr Keys, who is standing in the April election as an NP candidate, gave Port Elizabeth businessmen his reasons for optimism and caution. "Although this is a minority opinion, my view of a future economic policy under a government of national unity is very good.... Every participant in the government is agreed on an issue of primary importance: the achievement of social objectives is the ultimate test of the validity of any economic policy. There is total agreement on the no. 1 social objective -- jobs. Nothing else, nothing complicated. Jobs. Now we know, and our future partners know, you cannot create jobs unless you have growth. We know, and they know, that you cannot have growth unless you have investment." The public sector could not produce growth or sustainable job opportunities. "Only the private sector operates in a stingy enough fashion to achieve that." South Africa needed an economy which was friendly to investors and entrepreneurs, in which the private sector would not only survive but flourish, said Mr Keys. The business community had performed magnificently and since 1989 commodity prices had fallen drastically. In addition, the outflow of capital had lessened since December. "I think the worst is over." In multiparty talks negotiators had managed to achieve an institutional framework which secured property rights and protected the independence of the Reserve Bank. But a future government would have to trust participants in the economy such as bankers, mining houses and trade unions to get the best results. And it should learn that the creation of job opportunities was not a "zero sum game". "We are the only party which realises that creating job opportunities for one section of the population doesn't mean that you have to deprive someone else of opportunity. We have to make sure we can communicate this concept successfully in the government of national unity. The extent to which we can win these arguments will depend on our representation in cabinet."
