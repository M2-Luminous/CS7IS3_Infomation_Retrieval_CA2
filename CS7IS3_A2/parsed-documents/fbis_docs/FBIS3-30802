[Koljevic] Good day. [Jankovic] We begin this conversation with an unfortunately grave fact, and that is that prior to every round of negotiations -- from Lisbon to the present -- war drums have accompanied the peace process, along with stimulation for continuing the civil war between the three peoples. Mr. Koljevic, tell us exactly what is being planned at the moment. What are we preparing for Geneva? [Koljevic] Well, to be brief, we are setting out for Geneva with, like always, our readiness for peace; of course, a just peace, and one that will be equal for all three sides in the conflict. Concretely, in this case, we are prepared to discuss the internationalization of the Sarajevo region; we need to approach this theme very seriously and keep in mind all its present and future implications. [Jankovic] How far do the Serbian side's concessions reach? Is there a limit to the negotiations when -- just prior to this round of negotiations, so to speak -- something in the vein of the Sarajevo Markale market happens? Is this actually a forced concession? [Koljevic] I do not think that this is a forced concession if it concerns peace, even a partial peace, but there can be no doubt that this represents certain pressure. However, I think that this pressure, in the form of such a large-scale and scandalous tragedy, cannot be real political pressure on us, because in this tragedy, this two-day tragedy -- first in the Dobrinja district, followed by the market -- the scenario was so familiar that we cannot even accept this as political pressure; actually, we can only accept this, treat this, as a great crime, accompanied by a scandal. When I say scandal, I have two things in mind: Primarily I mean that General Rose did not react on the first day but on the second day with his statement concerning Dobrinja -- that the shell came from the direction of Serbian positions. Whether he did this because he is new or for some other reason, I do not know. However, this is not the first time that a shell came from the direction of Serbian positions but not from Serbian arms. The simplest way -- employed at least 10-15 times so far -- is for the Muslim forces to position themselves on the same direction with the Serbian forces but farther back and to fire from that direction. Therefore, this is not proof as far as the first day and the first accident, first tragedy, is concerned. As far as the second one is concerned, I believe that it is a true and real scandal that such a crime was not prevented -- that is, that people, experts whom we offered, were not allowed to simply seal off the area so they could swiftly and objectively investigate who was the perpetrator of such a terrible crime. [sentence as heard] This proposal of the Serbian side -- I myself was at the airport and five minutes after receiving the news, we immediately proposed this; our people were ready to go to the site -- was unfortunately rejected, and the first, most basic ways, so to speak, which allow the culprit responsible for causing such a tragedy to be identified, were undermined. I believe that regardless of the fact that this first state of affairs was covered up, destroyed, so to speak, we have to go on insisting on this [words indistinct], and one which would establish not only the military but also the pathological aspect of this act. [Jankovic] Thank you.
