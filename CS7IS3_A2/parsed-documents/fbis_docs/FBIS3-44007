It was on occasion of the opening of the electoral campaign for the legislative elections slated from 6 to 24 February. In his message, the head of state recalled the promise he made solemnly after his election as first president of the Fourth Republic to rally together all Togolese within the new democratic institutions. President Eyadema also recalled that the legislative election campaign should be the framework of a debate that would guarantee transparency in all proceedings. President Eyadema called on all sides taking part in the parliamentarian election to respect the freedom of one another, to abide by the principle of non-violence, and the acceptance of differences. Recalling his responsibility as guarantor of national unity, the head of state called on voters and through them, on all Togolese to make their differences an asset and not a liability. He called on all sides to strictly abide by the rules of democracy and called on Togolese to contribute to the success of the legislative elections. General Eyadema further said that Togolese were all equal before the laws of the Republic, laws that are imposed on them. The head of state recalled the consensus spirit that prevailed during the preparation of the vote and recalled the difficult trip of our country on the path towards democracy and that was marred by an unprecedented sociopolitical and economic crisis. He called on all Togolese to get down to work with courage and to work with a spirit of sacrifice in order to relaunch our country on the path of development. The head of state expressed his gratitude to the workers who, despite the difficulties from all fronts, continued to go to their work. That is why Gen. Eyadema called on all the sons and daughters of the country to initiate forgiveness and reconciliation and he then solemnly pledged to respect the will of the people, that is, to bow to the results of the forthcoming elections.
