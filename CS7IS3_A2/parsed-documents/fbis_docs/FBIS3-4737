FBIS3-4737 "dreas040_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 North Korea Reports of Country's `Economic Crisis' Refuted SK2802233694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 2327 GMT 28 Feb 94 SK2802233694 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Base Misrepresention of DPRK's Developing Economy" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The United States, Japan and the South Korean puppets are reportedly getting overheated in spreading rumors about the "economic crisis" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the mobilization of their paid media. They are grossly misrepresenting the situation of our developing socialist economy by abusing the communique of the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea on the fulfilment of the Third Seven-year Plan (1987-1993). They allege that "North Korea is in a serious condition, undergoing enormous trials for its failure to attain the targets of industrial production" and "its self-sufficiency in food has come a cropper from a long ago." This is an intolerable distortion of the invincible might of the socialist economy of the DPRK, which is vigorously advancing along the road of independence and self-reliance, unaffected by whatever fluctuation of the international situation and of our reality in which all the people of the country fully enjoy an abundant material and cultural life. It is also a despicable political propaganda offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK. As was reported by the afore-said communique, we made a new great progress in all sectors of the socialist economic construction during the Third Seven-year Plan in spite of the collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and other European countries, the disappearance of the world socialist market and a chain of other international events and changes in the complicated external environments. In this period, the industrial output jumped 1.5 times and its average annual growth rate reached 5.6 percent in our country. The power, coal and non-ferrous metal ore output increased respectively 1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 times, with the result that the nation's material and fuel bases have been expanded and strengthened. The steel output increased 1.3 times and all the sectors of the machine-building industry rapidly developed to achieve a great progress in the mechanization, automation, robotization and computerization of the production processes. The output of chemical fertilizers went up 1.5 times, their qualitative composition was further improved and solid foundations for the completion of the chemicalization of agriculture have been laid. A great progress was also made in light industry to bring about a new turn in the production of consumer goods. Garment, food and daily necessities industries rapidly developed, locally-controlled industrial factories were updated and dependable local raw material bases built, with the result that the local industrial output jumped 1.7 times. In agricultural domain, 10,400 kilometres long waterways were excavated and more than 12,400 pumping stations and 192 reservoirs were built. The amount of chemical fertilizers applied to agriculture was raised 1.4 times and their qualitative composition improved. In our country where the objective of ten million tons of grain was attained already in the '80s, irrigation, electrification, mechanization and extensive use of chemicals have been realised and farming has been placed on a scientific and technical basis as required by the chuche method of farming to reap a rich harvest every year. In fisheries, more than 1,100 fishing boats including stern trawlers of 3,750 tons and above were built and fishing boats and fish processing facilities briskly modernized to further consolidate the material and technical foundations of fisheries. In the period, Kwangbok and Thongil Streets took shape and more than 100,000 modern flats were built in Pyongyang, which means that residential houses for more than one million families were built in towns and rural communities of the country. Our people are leading a happy material and cultural life, enjoying free medical care, free education and other socialist benefits, without worries about food, clothing and housing. The consolidation of our socialist economic and material foundations and the considerable improvement of the people's living clearly prove the invincible vitality of our independent national economy, which is developing on the basis of the chuche idea, unaffected by the imperialists' economic blockade and the worldwide fluctuation. Nevertheless, the media serving the imperialists are zealously spreading rumors about our "economic crisis," motivated by a foolish attempt to undermine the external authority and prestige of our Republic, tar the image of Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses and crush the hope and confidence of the world progressive people in socialism. They must look squarely at the unshakable will and faith of our people, give up the foolish dream of stifling our Republic and promptly stop the anti-DPRK false political propaganda.
