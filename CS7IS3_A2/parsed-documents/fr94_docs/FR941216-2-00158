FR941216-2-00158 FR941216-2-00092 [Release No. 34&hyph;35077; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;68] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to a Three Month Extension of the Interim SOES Rules December 9, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on December 7, 1994, 2 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 The NASD initially filed the proposed rule change on December 1, 1994. On December 7, 1994, the NASD filed Amendment No. 1 to remove the short sale prohibition from its proposal to extend the Interim SOES Rules. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change On December 23, 1993, the Commission approved on a one-year pilot basis changes to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s (``Nasdaq'') Small Order Executive System (``SOES'') that: (1) Reduced the maximum size order eligible for execution through SOES from 1,000 shares to 500 shares; (2) reduced the minimum exposure limit for ``unpreferenced'' SOES orders from five times the maximum order size to two times the maximum order size, and eliminated the exposure limits for ``preferenced orders''; (3) implemented an automated function for updating market maker quotations when the market maker's exposure limit has been exhausted; and (4) prohibited short sales through SOES (collectively referred to hereinafter as the ``Interim SOES Rules''). 3 Except for the short sale prohibition, the NASD proposes to extend, until May 1, 1995, the effectiveness of the Interim SOES Rules. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33377 (Dec. 23, 1993), 58 FR 69419 (Dec. 30, 1993) (``Interim SOES Rules Approval Order''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Propoed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On December 23, 1993, the SEC issued an order that approved the Interim SOES Rules on a one-year pilot basis effective January 7, 1994. In response to two applications requesting a stay of the Interim SOES Rules Approval Order, however, the SEC granted a partial stay of the effective date of the order until January 25, 1995. 4 Thus, since the Commission approved the Interim SOES Rules for a one-year period and this one-year period did not commence until the Commission's order approving the rules became effective on January 25, 1994, it is the NASD's understanding that the Interim SOES Rules will expire on January 25, 1995, absent further Commission action. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33424 (Jan. 5, 1994). As described in more detail below, because the NASD believes implementation of these rule changes has been associated with positive developments in the markets for Nasdaq securities and clearly has not had any negative effect on market quality, the NASD believes it is appropriate and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the protection of investors to extend the effectiveness of the interim SOES Rules (without the short sale prohibition) until the rules governing the operation of The Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution System (``NPROVE'') have been approved by the SEC and implemented. 5 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34145 (June 1, 1994), 59 FR 29649 (June 6, 1994) (notice of original filing and Amendment No. 1), Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34453 (July 28, 1994), 59 FR 39808 (Aug. 4, 1994) (notice of Amendment No. 2), and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35024 (Nov. 29, 1994), 59 FR 62755 (Dec. 6, 1994 (notice of Amendment No. 3).
