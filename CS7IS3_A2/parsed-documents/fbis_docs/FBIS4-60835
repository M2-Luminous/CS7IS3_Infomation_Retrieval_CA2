FBIS4-60835 "drsov084_a_94026" FBIS-SOV-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Foreign Ministry Spokesman on North Korean Logger Issue Foreign Ministry Spokesman on North Korean Logger Issue SK2904011994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0108 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904011994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Moscow, 29 April (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government said Thursday [28 April] that any foreigners staying in Russia "legally" are free to leave the country, indicating Moscow has no intention of tuning in to Seoul's bid for an early resettlement in South Korea of North Koreans who have escaped from Siberian logging camps. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said at a routine news briefing, "Russia will not prevent foreigners from leaving for any country if they did not commit particular criminal offenses, are not on a police wanted list and possess legal immigration documents. In such cases, we do not have to discuss with their countries of origin (on allowing them to leave Russia for any destination)." Karasin's remarks were taken by diplomats here as an explicit expression of Moscow's intention to have North Korean loggers, most of whom have no passport or travel documents, apply for a permit to stay in Russia before trying to fly to Seoul. Karasin also said it is not within the Russian Government's authority to issue visas or departure permits to foreigners wishing to leave the country. Moscow was astonished by the recent media fuss in South Korea about the North Korean escapees, said the spokesman, who feared any distortion of Russia's position on the matter could damage its relations with third countries. The Russian Government has yet to receive any applications from North Korean loggers seeking help to go to Seoul, Karasin said. The South Korean Embassy here also said no North Koreans have contacted it since Seoul announced 15 April that it would accept all willing North Korean loggers. At the time, the Seoul Government revealed around 100 North Korean loggers had contacted Seoul missions in Russia seeking refuge in South Korea.
