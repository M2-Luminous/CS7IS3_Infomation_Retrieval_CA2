[paragraph as received] Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Wang Senhao, said at a national working conference on coal production held here today that the output of raw coal in the country last year increased by 25.5 million tonnes over the year before. State-owned enterprises turned out 470 million tonnes of coal, a drop of 12.5 million tonnes, resulting in a sales volume of 412 million tonnes, a drop of 19.49 million tonnes. The output of local state-owned enterprises was 198 million tonnes, down 4.3 million tonnes. The volume of coal transportation made up 40 percent of the country's total volume of railway shipments and problems faced in shipping coal was one of the major factors accounting for the drop in coal production. Owing to the rising of prices, collectively-run coal mines and township ones saw their production last year accounting for 472 million tonnes, close to that produced by state- owned ones. Last year, the coal industry made progress in the drop in loss- making and redundancy action with its loss being reduced by RMB 2 billion or 30 percent less than the previous year and 120,000 staff made redundant while another 130,000 transferred to other jobs. According to the minister, the industry has in recent years made achievements in its industrial adjustment, paying much attention to the development of its diversified interests. The industry has, besides coal production, business covering power generation, chemical industry, construction materials and commerce and trade. Its output earned from its diversified interests reached RMB 18 billion and its profits tax from this sector RMB 900 million, increase of 20 percent and 22 percent over the year before.
