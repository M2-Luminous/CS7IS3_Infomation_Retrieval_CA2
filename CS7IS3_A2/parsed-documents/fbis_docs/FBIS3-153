Yesterday, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the government met and made additional progress. We have learned that consensus has been reached on UNITA's role in central and provincial governments and in the news media, and on changes to the existing constitution. More than 70 percent of the 16-point document on national reconciliation submitted by the mediator has been dealt with. All that is left now is to approve the modalities on the implementation of specific principles, as well as the status to be accorded to His Excellency Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, president of UNITA, and the return of UNITA property.
