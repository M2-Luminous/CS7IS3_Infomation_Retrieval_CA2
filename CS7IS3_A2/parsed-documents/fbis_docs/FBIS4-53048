About 20 of Nagoya City's principal convention centers such as the Nagoya City International Display Center and Fukiage Hall will be linked with optical fiber cable, enabling broadcasting firms, including urban cable television firms, to utilize two-way image transmission services. CTC was established in 1988 and has already installed an optical fiber cable network in the Chubu region which extends for 6,000 kilometers. The highway concept will include the existing network to form one which circles the inner city. The network will link the principal convention centers and the respective broadcasting firms will be able to transmit images by merely plugging cameras into the image-transmitting cable outlets. Installation costs will total 200 million yen and the project is scheduled for completion in two years. CTC expects annual usage to hit 1,000 transmissions and hopes to set rates at a lower point than that which is feasible with dedicated lines. Dedicated circuits exist in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas to link convention centers, but CTS claims, "There are no other networks which cover such a wide area as the `Nagoya Information Highway.'" CTC says that if this concept works well, it will consider building a "long-distance information highway" which will operate on an intercity basis.
