What is your view of that? [Walesa] People think up different things. I am a practical politician. The theoreticians have to do something, so they fantasize. But, as a practical man, I understand that the exhortations of the new era are different. Such comparisons, "buffer zones" and so forth, mean that we have still not broken away from the past. All of this is still a case of thinking in the category of the "division of the world" into two parts. But the world does not divide like that, of course. The differences are beginning to disappear. Of course, the world can be divided into the more developed and the less developed, the richer and the less rich. I think that, in this case, it is illogical now to speak of various zones. Even if everything were fine with us--that is, with Russia, Ukraine, and Poland--it would still take us 20 years to catch up with the West. Yes, there are 20 years of development ahead of us. But the West is choking; it is suffering from overproduction. It needs us to enable it to develop at all. The West needs us more than we need the West! [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Were your previous hopes of Western aid justified? [Walesa] I have never counted on Western aid. History has taught us quite well that we cannot seriously count on the West. We have received no aid from it apart from promises, and they were late, what is more. But you cannot complain about that--such is the way of the world. Business is business. What has sentiment got to do with it? Sentiment gets in the way. But, if you are talking about my disappointment with the West, well, of course, that is real. But it exists in completely different categories: The West does not understand what is going on here, it does not see us as partners. We and you, we do not need anything. All that we want is that they should recognize our equal rights and potential. Just as soon as that potential is opened up, we will sort things out ourselves. But the West opens itself up only if it stands to gain, and it does so using its surplus products, its best goods, which we lack. But when our goods are competitive and cheap, barriers are set up. So the West is very nationalistic; it is just that this a different class of nationalism. No, we do not count on any aid. We count on equitable and serious partnership. Then we will cope with the rest by ourselves. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] At the same time, the impression is being created in Russia that what we are seeing in Poland is simply some kind of NATO-mania. How do you reconcile this with your critical attitude toward the West? [Walesa] Right now, after the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, what is left is the NATO alliance--a stable, clear, and comprehensible alliance. Meanwhile, all that was left from the Warsaw Pact is unreliable. I have always had a great fear of the unreliable. I do not like being caught unawares. At such a moment as this, I would like the West to reduce the zone of distrust by accepting us and other countries. Then we would all be on the same side. We would sit down and talk about how things should be and what NATO should be like. But, because we are leaving the whole territory in a state of unreliability, there is no knowing what might arise here: nationalisms and all kinds of other demons, like in Yugoslavia. Anything could happen, but we have abandoned it all: We disbanded and we destroyed, but we did not manage to create anything. This is not directed against Russia. This is an approach to the creation of a united security. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] So, you do not rule out the possibility of postcommunist revanche in some part of Europe? [Walesa] If we leave this zone of distrust, life will find a solution, and it might not be one we like. And the West's attitude is facilitating such a possibility. We are already seeing its snobbery and arrogance today. And, indeed, something might happen that would recreate the old order. Why should we repeat that lesson? [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In other words, the West must insure East Europe against possible postcommunist relapses? [Walesa] I say again: The point is to reduce this zone of distrust. We have not thought up anything new yet. I am certainly not saying that the West is so good, that its solutions are so good. We have no alternative. As Churchill said: Democracy is the worst of all systems, but no one has thought up anything better. If, at the moment, we do not have a security system, if we have no other economic system, we must affiliate to what there is and then think about it. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When reading the Polish press, you realize that Kaliningrad is virtually the most acute question in relations between your country and Russia. [Walesa] Kaliningrad, of course, is a relic of a bygone era, like Britain's colonies. Nothing can be changed because no one wants to fight or create a dangerous situation. Kaliningrad could now become a linking bridge, a unique bridge at the junction between two cultures, the peoples, and economic concepts, but not a military base because today this is indeed a colonial base protecting goodness knows whom and goodness knows why. It is dreadfully costly and absolutely senseless. I know that there is nowhere for the soldiers to be taken to. I understand all that. it is just that we must think about how to live not on a basis of struggle but on a basis of logic. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] But why must this base be regarded as an attack on Poland? [Walesa] I am not criticizing. I am simply asking the question: If we are saying that there are no enemies and that we do not want to struggle--either NATO against Russia or Poland against Russia--why do we need this? An army should be stationed where the land is poor, not in a port where there is grain to be shipped and trade to be conducted. [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Mr. President, what priorities would you highlight in Poland's eastern policy and in Polish-Russian relations? [Walesa] In our era, nothing can be imposed on people. As politicians, we must encourage, offer incentives, remove barriers, and open up all ties. Life and the economy, businessmen and industrialists must do their job. We can only repeat to them: "Gentlemen, Moscow will always be nearer to Warsaw than to Washington." And, therefore, cooperation will always be more reliable and advantageous with Warsaw than with Washington: nearer, cheaper, and quicker. You cannot move either Russia or Poland to America. We are forced to depend on one another, we let everyone profit from this illogicality, from our squabbles. Let us come to our senses, turn this to our own advantage, and then invite others to join in.... [passage omitted]
