Luis Becker of the URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission confirmed that government and guerrilla delegations are studying the Norwegian Government's invitation to meet in that European nation. Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egelan said yesterday that the two parties would meet under UN mediation at a residence in the forest near Oslo, the same site where Palestinians and Israelis met secretly in 1993. "In principle, the URNG does not have any objections to meeting in Oslo at the invitation of the Norwegian Government," Becker stated. According to the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, the purpose of the round of talks in Norway would be to discuss the mechanisms for forming the so-called Truth Commission. On another topic, the guerrillas accused Guatemalan soldiers of killing a peasant in a village in Peten Department in northern Guatemala. They said the man was killed in the presence of townspeople, whom the soldiers threatened to kill if they cooperated with the URNG. In a communique issued in Mexico City, the rebels said the crime was committed by government troops a few days after the signing of the comprehensive agreement on human rights on 29 March "to prevent the fulfillment of that agreement." The guerrillas demanded that the document signed in Mexico City be "totally honored without reservations." "We again urge the United Nations to send a verification mission as soon as possible before the crisis of ungovernability worsens and opens the door for even more repression," the URNG stated. There was an increase in attacks on politicians, judges, legislators, reporters, and foreigners in Guatemala last week, a situation that created a climate of violence and insecurity. The guerrillas stated that "there is no respect for human rights and there is no justification for the reemergence of genocidal practices by the Army in our country. Guatemala needs peace and respect for human rights, especially the sacred right to life." Guatemalan Government and URNG delegations have been negotiating since April 1991 to end an internal armed conflict, the only ongoing one in Central America. The conflict has claimed approximately 175,000 lives in 33 years.
