The report was submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata at a meeting of the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters headed by the premier. The administrative reform task force has been studying deregulations in wide areas of industry to give foreign firms greater access to Japanese markets, and consequently to help reduce Japan's massive trade surpluses. The report reviewed current regulations in the telecommunications and broadcasting fields, and said deregulation should be designed to create advanced systems for the 21st century like the "information superhighway" plan by the United States. It particularly stressed the necessity of removing barriers between domestic and international telecommunications businesses. Regional telecommunications service operators should be encouraged to participate in the field of long-distance services, which would increase sound competition, it said. The report's recommendations will be included in a larger deregulation plan to be compiled by the end of June. Sources at the panel said Hata voiced eagerness to carry out the deregulation plan, saying the telecommunications and information areas are vital for the world moving to a new century, and also important for Japan itself to create new businesses. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also participated at the panel meeting and said Japan should take part in the worldwide race of building new telecommunications and broadcasting systems. Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British Broadcasting Corp. are strengthening their footholds in Asia and Japan should join them, he said.
