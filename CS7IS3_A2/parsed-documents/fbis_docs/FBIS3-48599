Announcing this to Singapore reporters covering the Prime Minister's visit here Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said yesterday that the fund will also have a unique component -- it will also target budding entrepreneurs. Mr Yeo said the fund will in essence, operate like any other venture capital fund, but with a regional focus. A private sector fund manager will be appointed to manage it. Investments will be made in private companies which are "regional" or "going regional" and whose projects will benefit the Singapore economy. In return, equity participation will be obtained in the companies. The fund was recommended originally by the Committee to Promote Enterprise Overseas chaired by Minister of State (Finance) Teo Chee Hean. The unique part of the scheme lies in its additional goal -- to bring together budding entrepreneurs with the projects that have been identified by the fund manager. Low cost funds will be made available to the entrepreneurs to help them obtain a stake in these companies-- up to S4 for every dollar from the entrepreneur. Mr Yeo told reporters that this was to encourage budding entrepreneurs to venture into the region. "We'll work through the private sector to identify projects and potential entrepreneurs who wish to go abroad but lack the financial means to do so, although they have the expertise," he said. If they succeed, the intention of the scheme is to help them gain a significant stake in the companies after three to seven years. Existing entrepreneurs already in business but who lack the means to expand abroad are also eligible for such assistance. This component of the fund is targeted at those who have the characteristics of entrepreneurship: a practical vision or a good track record but lack the means to carry out their ideas or expand their businesses overseas. They can be from the private or the public sectors. The Economic Development Board Investment Pte Ltd [Private Limited] (EDBI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDB [Economic Development Board], will oversee the fund through the private fund manager. The fund is expected to exceed $150 million [Singapore currency], with the Government contributing more than $100 million. Private sector funds will also be sought. Mr Yeo pointed out that the Government was not giving away "free money" to any entrepreneur. "We're participating with him. He must first be prepared to put his own money on the line," he said. Replying to a question on why the scheme was necessary when there were private venture capital companies around already, Mr Yeo said that a different set of criteria would apply for the Government- inspired scheme. Private fund managers, he added, might only want to support those with a proven track record. Thus, those who were working in companies but had never set up their own might not qualify. Yet they might be precisely those whom the Government was trying to encourage as they had the expertise. An MTI [Ministry of Trade and Industry] official said it had consulted the private sector on the scheme and the feedback had been positive. "Our business leaders agree that there are many people out there who have the bright ideas and the ability and drive to carry them through, but for the lack of financing and opportunity," he said. While some will make it in any case, this "matchmaking" scheme broadens the net. If, by providing the extra push and financial backing we can increase the pool of entrepreneurs, it will be good for Singapore, he said.
