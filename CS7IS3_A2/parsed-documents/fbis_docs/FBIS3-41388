Officials of the Schwechat drug police thought the route of the 24-year-old U.S. citizen James R. highly unusual. The man arrived on Aeroflot flight SU 261 from Brazil via Moscow at Vienna's Schwechat Airport at noon on Wednesday [16 February]. During a careful check, 4 kg of heroin was discovered in the false bottom of his bag. When he was interrogated, James R. claimed that he was only the courier, and that he had received the drugs in Brazil. His statements led to the arrest of three Nigerians in Vienna on the same day. For technical reasons, the police declined on Thursday [17 February] to disclose their names and the functions within the drug ring. Yesterday the fingerprints of the arrested drug dealers were checked. Results are expected today, Friday. Moreover, an exact analysis of the impounded drugs is not yet available.
