FR940124-1-00002 FR940124-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;189&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in tension ties. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension ties and the resultant rapid decompression of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;189&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;189&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;189&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion Recently, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracking in the tension ties on several Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. Most of the cracks were found in the aft channel of the tension tie. These cracks usually occurred in the upper flange of the aft channel of the tension tie. Only one crack was found in the forward channel of the tension tie. The cause of this fatigue cracking has been attributed to the tension ties bending under cabin pressurization loads. This condition, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane in the event of failure of two or more tension ties. These reports of fatigue cracks were received in response to the Supplemental Structural Inspection Program, which was required to be implemented by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993). The purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program that detects the potential for cracking in specific areas of the airplane that are critical for flight safety. Whenever cracks are found in a Structural Significant Item, the FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition. This proposal is in response to such a finding. On September 4, 1984, the FAA issued AD 84&hyph;19&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;4913 (49 FR 36365, September 17, 1984), to require inspections of the tension tie at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes, and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes. The inspections proposed by this rulemaking action do not retract the inspection requirements of that AD. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993, that describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. This modification entails trimming the cracked portion of the channel of the tension tie. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
