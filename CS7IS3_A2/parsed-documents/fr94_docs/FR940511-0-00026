SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this in-season action pursuant to IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State of the United States of America (59 FR 22522, May 2, 1994). On behalf of the IPHC, this in-season action is published in the Federal Register to provide additional notice of its effectiveness, and to inform persons subject to the in-season action of the restrictions and requirements established therein. Inseason Action 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 1 Northwest Treaty Tribes Fishery in Area 2A Northwest treaty Indian tribes were allocated a total allowable catch of 192,500 pounds (lbs) (87.3 metric tons (mt)) in subarea 2A&hyph;1 (northern Washington coast) in 1994. Of this total, 16,000 lbs (7.3 mt) are reserved for ceremonial and subsistence purposes, leaving 176,500 lbs (80 mt) for the commercial fishery. Poor weather on the March 1 opening date resulted in canceling the fishery until March 5. Three fishing periods of 84 hours, 96 hours, and 30 hours respectively between March 5 and March 26 resulted in a total catch of 187,700 lbs (85.1 mt), exceeding the commercial catch limit by 11,200 lbs (5.1 mt). Non-Treaty Commercial Fishing Period Limits in Area 2A The Commission has determined that fishing period limits will be required during the 10-hour, July 6 non-treaty commercial fishing period in Area 2A to avoid exceeding the 178,750 lbs (81 mt) catch limit. The following table of fishing period limits reflects the average catch by vessel class from openings without trip limits in Area 2A, adjusted by anticipated fleet size to avoid exceeding the catch limit: ␣ 1Vessel class 2Length 2Letter 1 Fishing period limit 2Dressed, head-on 3Pounds 3Metric tons 2Dressed, head-off1 3Pounds 3Metric tons ␣0&hyph;25 A 195 0.09 170 0.08 26&hyph;30 B 240 0.11 210 0.10 31&hyph;35 C 380 0.17 335 0.15 36&hyph;40 D 1,050 0.48 925 0.42 41&hyph;45 E 1,130 0.51 995 0.45 46&hyph;50 F 1,350 0.61 1,190 0.54 51&hyph;55 G 1,510 0.68 1,330 0.60 56+ H 2,275 1.03 2,000 0.91 1Weights are after 2 percent has been deducted for ice and slime if fish are not washed prior to weighing. The appropriate vessel length and letter are printed on each halibut license. Decals showing the letter have been supplied with the license and should be displayed on the vessel. The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight although fishermen are reminded that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with their heads on. The July 6 fishing period will begin at 8 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. The fishing period limit applies to the vessel, not the individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to forfeiture and fine. Canadian Commercial Fishery in Area 2B Canadian halibut landings from Area 2B have totaled 2.4 million lbs (907.2 mt) between March 1 and March 31. This fishery will continue until all Individual Vessel Quota's have been filled or November 15, whichever is earlier.
