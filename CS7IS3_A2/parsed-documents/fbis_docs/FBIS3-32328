Three subsidiaries of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, namely the Venezuelan Bauxita Company, Interalumina, and Venalum, owe the Treasury about 820 million bolivares for the 1990-93 period. This debt accumulated as a result of delays in the payment of customs duties, which amounts to 700 million bolivares, and the value-added tax, VAT, which amounts to 120 million bolivares owed by Interalumina alone. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p 2-4) The General Bank Superintendency in 1993 signed several adjustment plans with credit institutions to ease the financial intermediation caused by increases in interest rates and by a reduction in the credit demand. Such plans call for capital increases, review of managerial processes, rationalization of expenditures and expansion programs, as well as the required modification of the data included in financial statements. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p E-1) Superintendent Anselmo Chuecos Perez has said that although the Foreign Investment Superintendency, Siex, is in charge of monitoring foreign investments, it is also responsible for evaluating which sectors should receive more investments. This facilitates an in-depth analysis of investment behavior and ensures the allocation of funds to sectors that need them most. He added that many foreigners are investing in the cement, steel, and iron industries because Venezuela has enough exploitable resources. He pointed out that $6 billion have been invested in the country and that the Netherlands was the country that invested the most in 1993. Siex does not monitor the hydrocarbon, banking, and insurance sectors. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Jan 94) It was officially reported that foreign investments decreased by $1.676 billion in 1993. Siex Superintendent Anselmo Chuecos reported that foreign investments amounted to $256 million in 1993. Investments in the manufacturing and financial sectors increased by 58 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Investments in the tourism sector increased by only 1 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1606 GMT 26 Jan 94) Central Statistics and Data Processing Office figures show that Colombia became the main market for non-traditional Venezuelan exports in 1993. Exports, other than oil and iron, to Colombia amounted to $765 million, which is a 64-percent increase from 1992. Meanwhile, Colombian imports amounted to $409 million, which is a significant decrease from 1992. (Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p 18)
