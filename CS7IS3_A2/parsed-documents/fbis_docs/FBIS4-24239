An early morning survey by KTN in Lurambi, Ikolomani, and Shinyalu constituencies revealed that all the polling stations opened at 0600. By 1000 very few stations had registered more than 20 voters. The three constituencies have between 20,000 to 30,000 registered voters. Throughout the constituencies, people went about their normal activities as if they were not aware of the by-elections taking place. However, KTN noted some encouraging turnouts in a few polling stations, particularly in Ikolomani constituency followed by a few polling stations in Kakamega town which is largely in Lurambi constituency. Most of the voters seen were women and youth who came trickling in small groups or singly. KANU [Kenyan African National Union] and FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya officials who had been on an early morning roundup of the polling stations in the three constituencies told KTN that they were satisfied with the polling arrangements except for a few anomalies which they had detected in some polling stations. In Kakamega town's industrial area, the town's mayor, (Morgan Magaga), alleged that FORD-Kenya youth were intimidating voters, asking them to vote for their party.
