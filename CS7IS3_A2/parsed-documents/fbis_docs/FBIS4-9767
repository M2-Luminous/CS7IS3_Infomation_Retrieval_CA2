[Begin recording] [Parinello] We cannot rule out that possibility. We have given this issue broad discussion, and we cannot discard it. [Unidentified reporter] The government communique states there are groups instigating all this commotion. Do you believe any specific group is responsible? [Parinello] At this specific moment, no, but we are investigating. We have several investigation teams working all over the country trying to determine who might be responsible for this and initiating the appropriate legal action. [Reporter] Is there any relation between this case and the incidents at Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa due to the instigation factor? [Parinello] This could be part of a collective psychosis that stems from this campaign, which is not spontaneous, including graffiti in cities, along highways, walls, and so on. Things such as this have happened all throughout history and all over the world whenever someone manages to agitate the people enough to create a type of collective psychosis. [end recording]
