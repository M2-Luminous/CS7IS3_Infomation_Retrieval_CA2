For example, a bank must hold regulatory capital equal to 8 percent of the carrying value of a purchased subordinated position at the 100% risk-weight, whereas a retained subordinated position is subject to a capital requirement against the full value of all the assets enhanced. (In contrast, the OTS treats both of these positions in the same way, requiring capital against the full value of the assets enhanced.) The proposed new rules would eliminate such disparate capital treatment by focusing the capital charge on the risk of recourse arrangements or credit substitutes, rather than the manner in which they are acquired. Note, however, that other rules restricting banks from purchasing or holding securities that are of less than investment grade quality already limit the opportunities to exploit the disparities present in existing capital rules.
