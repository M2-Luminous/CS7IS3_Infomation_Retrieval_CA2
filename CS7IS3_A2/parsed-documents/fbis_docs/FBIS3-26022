"Only after the legal framework for the futures market is in shape, financial reforms are carried out and China's economic strength substantially enhanced, will the country be ready to open up its futures market," said Lu Jian, president of the China International Futures Co. Ltd (CIFCO). He explained that futures trading involves high risks and high profits, which require solid economic and legal foundations. The country's current policy to bar overseas traders from entry into the country's futures market is not intended to close it, but to prepare for its opening up at the earliest possible date, Lu said. According to CIFCO estimates, China's futures trade reached 1.3 to 1.5 million deals last year, compared with 200,000 deals in 1992. However, the number is only tiny when compared with developed countries, Lu Jian said, noting that nearly 400 million futures deals were made in the United States last year. He compared China's futures industry to a "sampan", and the industry in developed countries to a "gigantic ship." "How can the gigantic ship be allowed to sail in China when the country has yet to dig the channel?" he said. China now stresses "an active but safe approach" in developing its futures market. A government regulation for the country's futures operation is expected to be issued before April this year, and Lu said that "to his knowledge" the futures law is in the making. He said a nationwide futures craze emerged last year when too many trading companies and commodity centers were set up. Some profiteering merchants from outside the chinese mainland took advantage of the confusion to drain off Chinese revenue. This led to massive waste and several unusual financial frauds in the country, Lu Jian said. Disorder in the country's futures market obstructs entry of trading companies or clients with high credibility, Lu said. As a pilot futures company, CIFCO is the only Chinese company to have bought broker's seats in the three largest commodity exchange centers in the U.S. and also in the world: The Chicago Board of Trade, the Commodity Exchange Inc of New York and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It is also one of the 160 futures trading companies qualified in the country's just finished reshuffle of futures trading companies and exchange centers. The CIFCO president said he is optimistic about the development of China's futures market, since its functions to find prices and avoid risks will be of importance for China's market economy. "It will also help to link China's economy with that of the world," he said. Lu said the volume of China's futures trading will continue to rise, in line with the healthy development of China's economy. State-imposed prices are being cancelled as part of China's market-oriented economic reform, prompting enterprises to safeguard the value of products by engaging in futures trading, Lu said. The better equipped futures organizations and well trained personnel will also stimulate the rise in trading volume, he said. Dr. Lu Jian, 39, an Oxford educated economist, is a renowned management expert in the futures trade in China. He conducted intensive and extensive investigation and research work on major futures organizations in the U.S., the U.K. and Hong Kong.
