Failure by Mr Hurd to prevail would set the stage for Britain's influence to grow ever more marginal. It is, in fact, a desperate struggle to preserve what remains of British sovereignty in an ever-expanding Community. Since 1987, when Mrs Thatcher signed the Single European Act which first made it possible for Britain to be out-voted, the majority of EC decisions have been taken on the basis of Qualified Majority Voting (QMV). Major issues -- such as taxation, budgets and foreign policy -- are still taken by unanimous vote. But lesser decisions, such as permitted food colourings, maximum working hours, water quality or the fitting of catalytic converters, are all taken by QMV, the scope of which was greatly extended by Maastricht. Each country has a number of votes very approximately determined by its population, the big countries getting 10 votes, and the smallest, Luxembourg, only two. To prevent large countries dominating completely, QMV gives the small countries more votes than their population merited. So Britain has one vote per 5.6 million people, while Ireland has one per 1.1 million. With 12 EC members there are 76 votes. To pass a directive requires a qualified majority of 54 votes -- 70 percent. So 23 votes constitutes a "blocking minority." Yesterday's arguments which were suspended last night after 10 hours, arose because the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, planned for 1995, will raise the total number of votes to 90. The dispute was where to set the blocking minority. Everyone except Britain and Spain wants to move it to 27, thus keeping it at 30 percent, because of a fear that retaining it at 23, which would be 25 percent of the votes, would lead to more decisions being deadlocked. Britain argues holding the blocking minority at 23 is vital to reverse the erosion of the large countries' voting shares brought about by the entry of small countries. Raise the minority to 27, Mr Hurd says, and it becomes possible for countries with 41 percent of the EC's population to be outvoted. If that argument were as strong as Mr Hurd claims, France and Germany would be behind him. But they are not. It is only the British who want the EC to slow down: the rest of the Community believes in pressing ahead. Mr Hurd's strongest argument is that Westminster may refuse to ratify the enlargement treaty, which needs to be approved by all 12 members and the European Parliament if the minority is raised to 27. However, if Britain holds the minority to 23 the European parliament might throw it out. Were Britain to climb down now, the effect on Conservative morale in the run-up to June's elections would be catastrophic. At a stroke, Mr Hurd's attempt to draw a line in the sand against further "deepening" of the EC would be invalidated. Britain would also set a bad precedent for 1996, when an inter-government conference is to review the entire institutional framework of the EC, with a view to letting eastern Europe countries join the EC over the following 10 years. As the row wears on, the procedures for incorporating the four new members are held in limbo. This can hardly endear their electorates, who have to approve entry by referendum, to the Brussels way of doing things. Compromises litter the conference tables in Brussels. Mr Hurd said yesterday none was acceptable, presumably including a Spanish one which would set the blocking minority at 27 in general and at 23 where three countries could muster that number. None of the other members like Madrid's solution either.
