A nearby elementary school advises students against wearing "alien" bags and clothes. These "indoctrinated" children complain when their parents casually buy goods bearing foreign brands. Even from childhood, Korean children are blindly taught to buy only Korean goods and shun alien goods rather than being trained to compare them for quality. In the eyes of foreigners, the episode symbolizes how hollow President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization drive is. The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said in its bulletin that internationalization is not a "zero sum game" but a "positive sum game." It is also a process of "give and take." But in Korea, internationalization still seems to mean "to take much and give less." Many foreign businessmen are skeptical about Korea's much-touted internationalization campaign and believe there are a host of ingrained anti-internationalization practices. For example, it is legal for foreign religious organizations to donate whatever amount of money to their Korean counterparts to build churches or finance missionary activities here. But it is illegal for a Korean religious organization to send overseas more than 5,000 dollars without authorization from the authorities. Ford has an equity stake in Kia Motors but Ford faces difficulty in selling its cars through Kia sales outlets in Korea. Consequently, Kia is unable to sell its cars through the Ford network in the United States and thus has to spend a huge amount of money in establishing its sales network in America. Many Western businessmen said transforming Korea's producer-oriented economy into a consumer-oriented one is one of the essential tasks Korea must tackle if it is really dedicated to internationalizing the economy and its society. Any talk of importing foreign agricultural produce raises emotions here and invites noisy opposition from farmers and politicians for that matter. But Korea's economy loses more than it gains just because of the import ban on farming products, they say. According to the EPB, consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent from January through February. More than 50 percent of the rise is attributable to an increase in agricultural products and service charges, it said. The solution to arresting inflation is quite simple: The imports of cheap foreign farming products. Nonetheless, the government has been hesitating to take action out of concern not to antagonize farmers, who account for less than 15 percent of the population. The government has used other tools, squeezing money supply, which has the chain effect of raising interest rates, depressing the stock market and stifling manufacturing investment. In addition, the government mobilizes tax officials to conduct an audit of businesses not following the anti-inflation campaign. Om Pong-song, advisor to the finance minister, said the government needs to be more internationalized in managing inflation as the old-style method of curbing money growth puts a strain on the overall sector. Korean consumer electronics goods are more than two times as expensive as foreign goods of the same quality. The wide price gap is due to the government's high tariffs on imports. Even when imports are allowed, prices of foreign goods shoot up due to lack of efficient distribution channels, expensive office rental fees, high wages and bureaucratic red tape. As Korean manufacturers are not exposed to hectic competition with foreign brands in the domestic market, they have a tough time in competing with foreign rivals outside Korea. In the area of technology, the government had tightly controlled the imports of foreign knowhow. So, Korean makers could not freely buy much foreign technology which would improve their product quality as the government scrutinized prices and contents of technology inducement contracts. A Western diplomat complained that Korea keeps tight grip on the opening of the distribution market out of concern not to damage "unclean and expensive" small-size sundry shops. But if foreign retailers open shops and clean their floors, he said, Korean sundry shops will also clean their floors and lower prices to compete with their foreign rivals. This is also good for Korean consumers, he said. The problem does not end here as far as foreign investment is concerned. As the United States submitted to the Korean government a list of industrial sectors, including cable TV equipment that American businessmen have shown a great interest in investing here, the local media interpreted this as an "intolerable U.S. pressure." The U.S. action was in response to the Korean government seeking to attract foreign direct investment, an embassy official noted. A U.S. State Department official said while on a visit here, "Whenever I read translated versions of Korean language dailies about Korea-U.S. trade issues, I never fail to notice such words "U.S. pressure, American threat, demand, meddle in internal sovereign affairs." Whatever foreigners talk or propose, it is regarded as a "demand, threat, or pressure," which blurs the true meaning of the agenda, he complained. As Korea has such a xenophobic attitude toward foreign direct investment, multinational enterprises shun investing in Korea and instead team up with other "hospitable" Asian countries and move to third countries for profitable business expansion. It is Korea and its companies that lose most due to foreign hesitancy in initiating ventures here, a Western journalist here said. Yi Chong-ku, a director at the Ministry of Finance, said, "By internationalization, we mean internationalization of the industry, system and practices and people." In his view, Korea had made significant progress in internationalizing industry and its practices and system, but it may take time for the Korean people to become internationalized. The EPB said that the government alone cannot internationalize Korea. It requires joint efforts by the government, private companies, farmers, consumer goods and grass roots people. It is the people, not the system or industry, that will internationalize Korea, a Western diplomat said. Thus unless the Korean people change their narrow-minded, mercantilistic and xenophobic attitudes, Korea cannot be truly categorized as an internationalized country, a Seoul professor said.
