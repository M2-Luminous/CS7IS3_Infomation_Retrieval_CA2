FR940620-0-00027 FR940620-0-00009 The centerpiece of the NAFTA involves the granting of preferential tariff (duty-free or reduced-duty) treatment on goods imported into a NAFTA country from another NAFTA country. As a general rule, such preferential tariff treatment may only be accorded to goods that satisfy the rules of origin standards set forth in Chapter Four of the NAFTA; such goods are referred to as ``originating'' goods for NAFTA purposes. The NAFTA Chapter Four rules of origin are set forth in section 202 of the Act which is codified at 19 U.S.C. 3332. Under Chapter Three of the NAFTA, Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B provides for an exception to the general rule regarding the granting of NAFTA preferential tariff treatment only to originating goods. This exception concerns specified textile and apparel goods which, because of the origin of the materials used to produce the goods in a NAFTA country and/or the nature of the processing used to produce the goods in a NAFTA country, do not meet the Chapter Four rules of origin standards and thus do not qualify as originating goods under the NAFTA. For such non-originating goods, Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B provides that they may nevertheless be granted preferential tariff treatment (that is, the duty-free or reduced-duty treatment that would be accorded to the same type of good when it qualifies as an originating good) up to specified annual quantitative ``tariff preference levels'' (TPLs). Once a TPL applicable to a NAFTA country's exports to another NAFTA country has been reached, any further exports of goods of that TPL category to the same NAFTA country during that year may not be accorded NAFTA preferential tariff treatment but rather will be subject to duty at the most-favored-nation rate. The TPL quantitative limits are set forth by category in Schedules 6.B.1. through 6.B.3. of Annex 300&hyph;B with reference to imports into each NAFTA country from each of the other NAFTA countries. For U.S. import purposes, the TPL provisions of Appendix 6.B. and Schedules 6.B.1. through 6.B.3. are also set forth in Additional U.S. Notes 3 through 6 to Section XI, HTSUS. The basic procedures for filing a claim for NAFTA preferential tariff treatment, set forth in §181.21 of the NAFTA implementing regulations (19 CFR 181.21), are generally applicable in the case of goods for which preferential tariff treatment is sought under the TPL provisions described above. However, there is one principal exception to those procedures as regards goods to which Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B applies: as stated in paragraph (a) of that section, there is no requirement that the written declaration (which constitutes the claim for preferential tariff treatment) be based on a Certificate of Origin in the possession of the importer. This exception is necessary because a NAFTA Certificate of Origin has reference only to originating goods (that is, goods which comply with the Chapter Four rules of origin standards) and thus does not cover TPL goods which are, by definition, not originating goods. In this regard, §181.21(a) also contains a cross-reference to §12.132 (19 CFR 12.132) which was added by T.D. 94&hyph;1 to clarify the application of the already-existing §12.130(f) (19 CFR 12.130(f)) country of origin declaration requirements in the context of textile and apparel goods which are subject to the provisions of Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. Following the publication of T.D. 94&hyph;1 and the entry into force of the NAFTA, representatives of the United States, Canada and Mexico continued to have discussions regarding whether additional requirements or procedures should be adopted for purposes of administering the provisions of Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. As a result of those discussions, Canada and Mexico have decided on, and implemented, use of a Certificate of Eligibility as the means for monitoring and identifying export shipments eligible for preferential tariff treatment pursuant to the TPL provisions of Appendix 6.B. to Annex 300&hyph;B of the NAFTA. The Certificate of Eligibility, signed by an authorized official of the Canadian or Mexican government, is issued to the Canadian or Mexican exporter for transmittal to the importer of the goods who then would be able to make a claim for preferential tariff treatment based on the Certificate of Eligibility. The United States, Canada and Mexico have agreed that presentation of a properly completed and executed Certificate of Eligibility for Canadian and Mexican exports is a prerequisite to the granting of a claim for preferential tariff treatment under the TPL provisions, and failure to present such a Certificate of Eligibility will result in assessment of duty at the most-favored-nation (that is, non-NAFTA) rate. No action has been taken by the United States to institute use of a Certificate of Eligibility for U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico. In light of the adoption of the above procedures regarding use of the Certificate of Eligibility for Canadian and Mexican exports, Customs has been granting claims for preferential tariff treatment on TPL goods imported from Canada or Mexico only if a properly completed and executed Certificate of Eligibility pertaining to the goods is presented to Customs when the claim is made. In order to ensure that the NAFTA implementing regulations reflect the trilaterally-agreed procedures and provide appropriate guidance to the public regarding U.S. import requirements, this document amends §12.132 on an interim basis to require submission of a Canadian or Mexican Certificate of Eligibility in connection with a claim for preferential tariff treatment on goods covered by the NAFTA TPL provisions. Customs further believes that this interim amendment should take effect immediately to ensure the greatest procedural benefit to the public, and it is noted in this regard that the post-importation refund procedure under the NAFTA applies only to ``originating'' goods and thus is not an available administrative remedy in a TPL context for a failure to make a claim at the time of importation (see Article 502(3) of the NAFTA, 19 U.S.C. 1520(d) as added by section 206 of the Act, and Subpart D of Part 181 of the NAFTA implementing regulations set forth in T.D. 94&hyph;1).
