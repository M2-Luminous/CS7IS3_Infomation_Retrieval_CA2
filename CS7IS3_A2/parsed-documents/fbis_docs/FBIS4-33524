Aristide, who was elected in December 1990 and toppled by a military coup in September 1991, expressed his views before the OAS Ad Hoc Commission tasked with following up on the Haitian crisis. The deposed president attended the inaugural session of the 24th period of OAS regular sessions in this city in northeastern Brazil at the special invitation of the president of this country, Itamar Franco [words indistinct] violence and we must continue talking about reconciliation," Aristide said at a news conference held after his speech to the foreign ministers of the 34 member countries of the inter-American organization. "So far, we have tried (to restore constitutionality) through peaceful means and we have not yet exhausted them," the Haitian president-in-exile added, as he proposed new actions to intensify the economic and commercial blockade against his country. "As soon as we step up pressure on the coupists they will not be able to stay in power," Aristide said. "I am not requesting a military occupation but, based on an agreement signed at Governors Island (New York, United States), the international community knows what to do to avoid limiting its actions to words," he added. The Haitian president pointed out that when he referred to the coupist officers, he was talking about a "small group of soldiers involved in drug trafficking" and added that Haiti now ranks second in the continent for its involvement in drug trafficking. Aristide pointed out that "if it was not the main reason, drug trafficking was among the major reasons for the coup d'etat," after noting that he was committed to fight drug trafficking and had signed an agreement on this matter with the United States shortly before the military intervention. He recalled that while he led the government, he stepped up the struggle against drug trafficking, but now there is talk about 48 tons of cocaine that pass through Haiti producing an estimated $1.2 billion. Likewise, he explained that Haitian political problems are structural in nature in a nation with a tradition of coups. Haiti was the first nation with a black population in the world to obtain its independence when it became free from France in 1804. It has had 36 presidents of which 24 fell as a result of military coups d'etat. Aristide assured that the Armed Forces, comprising 7,000 men, used 40 percent of the national budget. He claimed that during the 32 months of the de facto regime commanded by General Raoul Cedras, he has lacked the means to communicate with the people who elected him, indicating it was important to break this information barrier. During his speech to the "Ad Hoc" Committee, Aristide presented to the international community four courses of action against Haiti. The measures highlight the need for swift action to remove the military from the government, a six-month presence of a U.N. mission in Haiti, his return to the country, and the fulfillment of the New York agreements. During the news conference held in French, Aristide also presented his government's projects which place particular emphasis on restructuring the judicial system and on investments, aimed at overcoming the Haitian people's serious social problems.
