Yazov said that in the majority of cases former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had issued only "oral instructions," adding that even the deployment of troops in Baku in january 1990 had not been preceded by such "formalities" as a written order of the Soviet president. At the previous hearings, the former defence minister denied statements that plans had been made to storm the White House, the seat of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at that time. He admitted that the coup attempt was unconstitutional as were the measures taken against the former soviet president who was removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha. He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in the former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than was envisaged by the law on the state of emergency. Yazov stressed that he had ordered the troops on high alert, but denied he had ordered Soviet Air Forces on full combat readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had been sent by the command of the airborne troops, who, apparently, have overstepped their powers.
