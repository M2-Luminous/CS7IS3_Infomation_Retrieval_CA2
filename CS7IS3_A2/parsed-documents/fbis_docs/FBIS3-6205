"The party and myself are willing to offer considerable concessions on vested rights to unify the opposition camp within the scope of protecting the legitimacy of the DP," Yi said at a press conference marking the first anniversary of his leadership of the main opposition party. In order to build a powerful opposition, Yi said he would join hands not only with the existing opposition parties -- the United People's Party, New Korea Party and New Political Reform Party -- but also with dissident and civil groups. The DP would soon coordinate party opinions in a supreme council meeting and, depending on the form of unification, could make considerable concessions on its vested rights, he said. "During the past year as party leader, I realized that without inner discipline, any rewards from struggling against the ruling party or progress as a policy-making party are useless," he said, vowing to instill discipline in party members or step aside. He said he would prepare for next year's mayoral and gubernatorial elections by strengthening the DP's nationwide network, adopting a budget accounting system and conducting training programs for election candidates and winners at home and abroad. An agreement reached recently by DP and ruling DLP floor leaders to create a subcommittee on legislation and judiciary to discuss revision or abolition of the national security law must be honored, he said. He pledged that formation of the legislation and judiciary subcommittee would top the agenda when a special National Assembly session opens in May. Yi proposed that a special committee to reform legislation affecting the public, including the national security law, police neutrality law, Bank of Korea independence law, unified medical insurance law and labor relations law, be set up on a full-time basis. He hinted at a stronger attack against the ruling camp, saying he would no longer tolerate delay in the installation of a National Assembly intelligence committee under the revised law related to the Agency for National Security Planning. "Though it is best that I visit North Korea after an inter-Korean summit, I am firm on my wish to visit North Korea despite the lack of realization of such a summit," the opposition party leader said. He said he would apply to visit the North at an appropriate time depending on progress in inter-Korean dialogue and Pyongyang-Washington talks. Yi, however, said little about his recent summit with President Kim Yong-sam except to note that the DP, as a legitimate opposition party, has performed its duty in helping the government when it is headed in the right direction and offering criticism when it is not. He went on to urge a thorough investigation into a bribery scandal concerning the state-financed National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and relocation of Sangmudae, an army athletic unit. He said his party would emphasize economic affairs as its success in the local elections also depended on resolving the public's financial problems.
