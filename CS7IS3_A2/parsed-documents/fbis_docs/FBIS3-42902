This situation, which is in itself unpleasant for any leader--specially since neither group has a stable majority in society--is aggravated for Yeltsin by the fact that he is politically dependent on both parties and cannot break with either of them. The Russia's Choice team which united around Gaydar and the political group which associates with it and which formerly originated in Democratic Russia are, as before, the president's main political base. These people formerly brought him to power, supported him in all cataclysms and shaped the reform ideology. Who means what by "reforms" in our country may be disputed, but no active politician would today risk declaring that he is not a supporter of them, even if he has an affection for "nonmonetary methods." Abandoning the reforms would mean closing the lid on one's political career, and all leaders without exception, the communists included, are well aware of this. In this sense it may be said that reform ideology has acquired official status, as formerly did Bolshevik ideology. Essentially, only Zhirinovskiy permits himself not to swear by reform since he is the sole active politician who has his own ideology. A paradoxical situation has come about: The party that was the founder of state ideology is in opposition to the executive. But neither the government nor the president here can "snatch" from Choice the monopoly of progressist vocabulary, which belongs to it by virtue of historical factors. Choice has the opportunity to blackmail a politician of any level with the stigma of "backsliding from the reforms," which it is practically impossible to wash off. But it is not only this fact that makes Yeltsin dependent on Gaydar's team. For the president the symbols of the Gaydar-Fedorov economic policy are not only the domestic ideological base but also a calling card for the West. It is far from obvious that the West will accept a Russian president "bolstered" by the government that Chernomyrdin has formed with the same willingness for cooperation with which it accepted the president's policy as set forth by Gaydar and Fedorov. When it comes to money, creditors prefer to know for what they are being asked to fork out, and explaining to Western bankers what is meant by "nonmonetarist methods" will not, evidently, be easy. In addition, they could always solicit the opinion of the former members of the Russian Government with whom they have become accustomed to dealing in the past two years. There is, in addition, the personal predilections factor. Burbulis, Poltoranin, Gaydar, Filatov, Filippov--these are people with whom Yeltsin worked in the closest contact for several years and to whom he has grown accustomed. Finally, against the background of the disorder, lack of organization, and squabbling in the democratic milieu Russia's Choice, granted all its internal heterogeneousness, remains, perhaps, the sole political current with a more or less solid structure. As yet, there is no one among the bloc's leaders who might constitute real competition for Boris Yeltsin at future presidential elections. On the other hand, Viktor Chernomyrdin's positions on the Russian political Olympus continue to strengthen. The exceptionally abrupt opposition character of that same Russia's Choice and the support for the new government by a majority of the State Duma are, in particular, contributing to this. In addition, significant forces in the West that have tied their financial and political position to the Russian reforms have an interest in the impression of the notorious "staying the course," whatever this might mean, being sustained in public opinion--specially since the Chernomyrdin government was formed fully in accordance with both legislation and the results of the expression of the public's pleasure. To which, incidentally, the vagueness of the wording of which the premier is culpable when talking about his future intentions contributes perfectly. All these and certain other factors are causing Viktor Chernomyrdin to become an increasingly independent and strong political figure, whose legitimacy is no longer based on the authority of the president who nominated him but on an entirely different base. The ingredients of this base are the support of the power ministries and the solitariness and even a certain harassment of the ministerial cabinet by public opinion contributing to the development of a spirit of the corporate identity and consolidation of members of the government around the leader and also the dependence on the executive of a president who lacks a majority in parliament. In addition, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who just a year ago was a passing and quite incidental candidate for the office of premier, is increasingly laying claim to the position of Yeltsin's main rival at the future presidential elections, although he is comporting himself with pronounced loyalty. The abolition of the office of vice president has not, it would seem, permitted a fundamental solution of the problem of internal competition: Now the premier is "racking up points" among his electorate at a furious pace. Although the presidential elections are still a long way off, the president will, possibly, have to make his choice in the very near future: The interests of the two groupings are clashing increasingly powerfully. Viktor Chernomyrdin is interested in Boris Yeltsin continuing to maneuver for as long as possible, and Gaydar's team, in Yeltsin disavowing Chernomyrdin as soon as possible and restoring the former alliance with Choice. It is significant that, as the date of the presidential elections approaches, the polarity of these interests will, most likely, change--Viktor Chernomyrdin could prove interested in the present president being responsible for the difficulties of the market reform.
