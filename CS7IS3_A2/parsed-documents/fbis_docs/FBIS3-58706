I know nothing of unlawful payments," Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme (PS) [French-speaking Socialist Party] said in his defense yesterday. Coeme also accused the French manufacturer Aerospatiale of having made improper proposals. Meanwhile, Walloon Minister President Guy Spitaels has said he did not want to harm either Dehaene or Claes. With this, the danger to the government appears to have receded. Coeme spoke to the press yesterday after he had presented his document defending himself to the special parliamentary committee. Coeme said that, at the time of the negotiations on the helicopter purchase, he had warned against the "lobbyists who are swarming around the contract like vultures." Some people had never forgotten those words, Coeme said yesterday. The minister also strongly attacked the French. Just one month after the decision to buy Agusta, rumors appeared in the French press about bribe payments. When the problem of the helicopters' excessive weight emerged, these rumors resurfaced. Coeme said, at that time, he had been approached by two Aerospatiale representatives who asked that the contract be broken. They exercised "very strong pressure," Coeme said, but he provided no further details. However, he was prepared to give additional explanations on the matter to public prosecutors. In the meantime, the special parliamentary committee has decided to hear investigating magistrate Ancia and Coeme next week. Further investigations may be demanded by a councillor of the Supreme Court on the basis of these interrogations. The Senate Judicial Affairs Committee is to give its verdict today on the partial lifting of the parliamentary immunity of regional ministers Guy Spitaels and Guy Mathot. Both regional ministers oppose the move. They argue that the partial lifting of their immunity would make them look guilty in the eyes of public opinion. However, Spitaels and Mathot are prepared to answer Ancia's questions. Nevertheless, a majority of the committee will probably vote for lifting the immunity. In any case, the PSC [French-speaking Social-Christian Party] announced yesterday that it would vote for their immunity to be lifted. It is worth noting also that a number of PS members favor the lifting of immunity as well. Minister Jean-Maurice Dehousse and MP Jose Happart have already made comments to this effect. In the meantime, the danger of a government crisis seems to have receded. The cabinet of Walloon Prime Minister Guy Spitaels denied yesterday that in his document the minister president had wanted to involve Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and Foreign Minister Willy Claes in the case. The cabinet pointed out that the names of Dehaene and Claes were quoted by a witness whose testimony was formally denied by another witness. These comments were included in the defense to prove that the evidence of some people was totally unfounded.
