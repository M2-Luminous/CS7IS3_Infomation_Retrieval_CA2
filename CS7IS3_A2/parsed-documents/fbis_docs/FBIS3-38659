[Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Usually no reports are issued on informal ministerial meetings, but a significant exception was made for today's meeting, the first of the Greek Presidency. Probably this is why European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan congratulated Ioannis Papandoniou, the Council's president and the Greek deputy minister for economy. An advanced cooperation agreement was concluded with Slovenia. Brittan said this shows the road to what could happen if there is peace in the former Yugoslavia. An advanced agreement will be signed if problems with Russia on nuclear trade and financial aid are resolved. The Council is proceeding well with the GATT agreement and will press the Japanese and more Asians to open up their markets to products that interest Greece such as leather, footwear, and drinks. Discussing the Balkans, it was decided to upgrade relations with Bulgaria and Romania. Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia asked the commissioner what he would say on the political intervention of some EU countries in favor of their own companies and against Greek companies that are performing very well in Bulgaria. The commissioner said that the EU Commission will do everything possible to reaffirm free trade in European markets, which means more influence for Greek companies in the Balkans. [Papandoniou] The selection of GATT issues and relations with East Europe and Russia reflects both the EU needs in current conditions and the Greek Presidency's priorities. [end recording]
