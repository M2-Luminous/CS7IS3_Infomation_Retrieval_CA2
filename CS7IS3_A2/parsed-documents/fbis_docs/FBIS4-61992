In a message to parliament, the Georgian leader asked deputies to take urgent measures to form new economic relations. This is an obligatory condition for the formation and development of the Georgian statehood, he believes. Shevardnadze says in his message that the government is to submit shortly to parliament three different types of bills which should be given particular attention. The first package refers to economic relations, the second one to the bills on legal guarantees for the protection of the rights of the economic subjects which take part in material relations. The third package has laws which, in line with the democratic course chosen by Georgia, should regulate relationships among branches of power. The message says that parliament should adopt also codes of civil laws, criminal and labor laws as well as laws on administrative violations of laws. As the speaker of parliament I am prepared, to speed up the process of law-making, to cooperate with all commissions, factions and individual deputies, says the message.
