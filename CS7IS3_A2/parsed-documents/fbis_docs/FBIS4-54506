We note that the new regulations impact on both career soldiers and civilian employees. What is involved here? As we have already informed you in the previous issue of A REPORT, the amendment to Law No. 143/1992 Collection of Laws [Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary and some other organizations, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies of the parliament of the Czech Republic on 15 February 1994, among other things eliminates Paragraph 4 of Section 16 of the law. Thus far, this paragraph had stipulated that pay for employees--members of the armed forces and security components and services in active employment--is due in the month in which the service relationship came into being or continues. As of the effective date of the amendment to Law No. 143/1992 Sb.--that is to say, as of 1 April 1994--pay for these employees will be due after that monthly period. According to this amendment, the procedure will be applied in practice for the first time by paying soldiers for the month of April 1994 on 13 May 1994 (under existing regulations, they would be paid on 15 April). To realize the transition to the new due date for wages, Engineer Miroslav Kalousek, deputy minister of defense, has promulgated the following measures: Deadlines for Paying Career Military Personnel Career military personnel who are normally paid by 15 April 1994 and who file an application may receive a down payment for the month of April in accordance with the wages to which their last pay category entitles them. A condition for this down payment is an obligation (this is essentially a simple document that financial officers will have at their disposal) to repay this amount in a maximum of eight monthly payments so that it will have been fully accounted for, at the latest, at the time pay for the month of November is due--that is, by 15 December. The first payment will therefore be deducted as a matter of principle from the pay for April, which is due on 13 May 1994. When drawing pay for March 1994, a career soldier will file the appropriate application on the prescribed form, which will simultaneously serve as his obligation to make a specific number of regular monthly payments. This is essentially an agreement between the career soldier and his employer, covering the payment of the down payment and its repayment. The agreement on specific repayments of the down payment can be fulfilled differently only in the following cases: 1. In the case of long-term illness and while drawing sick pay, the career soldier, recipient of the down payment, may, in justified cases, ask the appropriate commander to reduce the amount of the repayments or possibly to defer such repayments of the down payment. The decision by the commander regarding the reduction or deferral of the repayments shall be attached to the concluded agreement. 2. In the event a career soldier, recipient of the down payment, is discharged from active service before the repayments are made, the unrepaid remainder of the down payment will be accounted for, at the latest, by the time of his final pay or other monetary matters, entitlement for which arose before his discharge (for example, monetary compensation for equipment items, compensation for unused leave, etc.). If it is not possible to account for the unrepaid down payment even in this manner, the uncompensated remainder shall be deducted from the severance pay entitlement. 3. In the case of the death of the career soldier, recipient of the down payment, the unrefunded remainder of the down payment will be accounted for at the time of the final pay or other monetary matters to which the individual's estate is regularly entitled. If the accounting cannot be accomplished, the remainder of the down payment will be dealt with at the time of the inheritance proceedings. The cumulative total of the remainder of down payments paid out shall be reported by the various formations via their superior HFU/OMP [expansion unknown] managing clerks, such reports always to be made by the 18th day of the month after pay has been accounted for, by calling the Prague military telephone number 45 721. Deadlines for Pay for Civilian Employees In conjunction with the requirements of current practices, changes in pay for career military personnel are also accompanied by modifications of the deadlines for paying down payments and for the accounting of wages for civilian employees as follows: 1. In formations employing fewer than 250 employees, down payments by the 25th day of the month, accounting by the 10th day of the calendar month. 2. In formations employing more than 250 employees and in units having two or more pay locations, down payments by the 27th day of the month, accounting by the 12th day of the calendar month. The transition to these new pay deadlines shall be accomplished in such a manner that, beginning with the down payment in the month of April 1994, the deadline for paying out down payments and accounting for pay shall be advanced by one day each month.
