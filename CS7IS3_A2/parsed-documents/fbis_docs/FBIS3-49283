He has been invited by one of the activists of the Samoobrona National Front. [Jacek Hugo-Bader, GAZETA WYBORCZA] The activist is a very rich man who has known Zhirinovskiy personally and who boasts about the fact that a few days before the elections in Russia he had congratulated Zhirinovskiy on his victory in these elections. I think that this man's motivation is to capitalize on Zhirinovskiy's name for publicity purposes in order to enable his grouping, which is new and unknown in Poland, to get into politics. [Correspondent Monika Sieradzka] The author of the invitation, a rich entrepreneur, is convinced that Zhirinovskiy will win the future presidential elections in Russia. He wants to give him his financial support by, among other things, investing in Russia. The invitation emphasizes that various things happened in the history of our nations but that this was the fault of politicians. In his opinion, the views of Zhirinovskiy and those of the Samoobrona National Front are convergent and the two parties should cooperate with each other. [Hugo-Bader] The person who invited Zhirinovskiy said that he wants to arrange a meeting between Zhirinovskiy and any politician, so that they can talk to each other. [Announcer] It is still not known whether Polish politicians will want to meet Zhirinovskiy. According to Lech Falandysz from the president's Chancellery, it is better to talk to Zhirinovskiy than to isolate him. It is better to let him into Poland than to refuse him entry into the country as the Germans, the French, and the Australians have done.
