At the 17 December meeting with H.E. Khieu Samphan, I said that due to concrete reasons, it was neither useful nor productive to have talks within the framework of a technical group consisting only of the representatives of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party. 2. The idea of having a quadripartite discussion is not realistic after the implementation of the peace process in line with the Paris accords and after the formation of the royal government emerging from the same process. 3. With a view to advancing the process of national reconciliation, I agree to have a technical working group with no reference to the PDK or the RGC. On that occasion, I told H.E. Khieu Samphan that if the PDK looked through all the points of the 21 November article proposed by His Majesty the king, it should have noted that His Majesty clearly mentions in that same article: "The PDK and the RGC." 4. At the 17 December meeting, I made it clear that even if a technical group is set up without any name, this should also be accepted by H.E. Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC. 5. In Beijing, His Majesty, speaking with enormous wisdom and reason and in his capacity as a father, asked me to establish the technical working group made up of the representatives of the PDK and of "Samdech Krompreah, first prime minister of the RGC." With reference to this suggession, I would like to propose again to the PDK this formula with H.E. Sok An and H.E. Veng Sereivut as RGC representatives. Besides, this royal formula has already been endorsed by H.E. Chea Sim and H.E. Hun Sen. 6. In my reply to H.E. Khieu Samphan's letter that was quoted by AFP, I clearly stated that: A. The RGC accepts the five-point proposal of His Majesty the king. B. I asked H.E. Khieu Samphan whether it is possible to accept the proposed formula for the technical working group. This is to accelerate the process of national reconciliation and peace. 7. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the PDK is not sincere in the so-called desire for peace and national reconciliation. The simple proof is that while declaring acceptance of all the elements of His Majesty the king of Cambodia's article, the Khmer Rouge do not want to recognize the RGC, while insisting at the same time that they become members or advisors to that same government.
