"Neighbouring Thailand has some of the highest HIV rates in the world," said Cambodia's Public Health undersecretary Dr Uk Ingkim in his report to an international conference this week. The report was presented at the Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC) Inter-regional Symposium for Capacity Enhancement in Primary Health Care and HIV/AIDS, organised by the United Nations Development Programme. Dr Ingkim said the challenge to Cambodia was formidable. The political situation in the country remained unstable and was characterised by large shifts in population, porous borders, socio-economic disruption and limited public services. According to his report, risky behaviour could be characterised as primarily sexual. Dr Ingkim said HIV was brought into the country mainly by foreigners and repatriated refugees from Thailand. "Commercial sex has grown rapidly since 1991, promoted by economic liberalisation, an influx of foreign business, tourism, relief and development personnel and the UN Peacekeeping Forces (UNTAC)," said his report. Dr Ingkim said it was estimated there were 2,000 commercial sex workers in the capital and their number was growing noticeably in economic centres and western provinces like ports of Sihanoukville and Koh Kong. The country report presented by Laos' HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Programme coordinator Chanthon Sibounheuang stated that an alarming incidence of HIV/AIDS in Thailand caused Laos to believe it might soon face a similar situation. "The opening of the Laotian economy and the completion of the Mekong River bridge between Thailand and Laos could lead to an increase in HIV and AIDS," Dr Sibounheuang said. His report also stated that most of the HIV positive cases in Laos were returnees and refugees from Thailand and bar workers, many of them from provinces bordering Thailand. As of December 1993, more than 15,000 HIV tests had been conducted in Laos with a total of 38 persons diagnosed as HIV positive. To date only three AIDS cases have been reported. The first round sentinel surveillance conducted last October-December in five provinces, showed that out of 1,844 blood samples from different groups of students, military recruits, bar workers, villagers, pregnant women and prisoners, only three people were HIV positive and all three had returned from Thailand, Laos's representative said.
