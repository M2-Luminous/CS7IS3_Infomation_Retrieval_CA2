FBIS4-65563 "drweu097_j_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Reactions Reported Reactions Reported BR1805143494 Rome LA REPUBBLICA in Italian 18 May 94 pp 4-5 BR1805143494 Rome LA REPUBBLICA Italian BFN [Report signed "r.l.": "Poor Devil, He Is Going Bananas -- Bossi Has the Last Word"] [Text] Rome -- [Northern League Secretary] Bossi spoke last, and his words were heavy-handed: "[former League ideologue] Miglio? He must have felt so peeved at young [Institutional Reforms Minister] Speroni getting ahead of him that he went mildly bananas...." Thus ended the day when the League's former ideologue shot point-blank at the Bandwagon's [League nickname] leaders, and the latter finally replied with a broadside: Some, like [Interior Minister] Maroni, with affection; others, like Bossi, by branding him as a quasilunatic. The first to reply to Miglio's accusations, in the morning, was [League Chairman] Franco Rocchetta. Interviewed immediately after the senator's [Miglio] speech in the house, the party's chairman minimized its impact: "Miglio? He was relatively tough, very articulate, but he did not say anything that we did not know already." Then the press agencies published an interview granted by Miglio in the morning, in which he accused the League of being involved in illegal financing operations. This time it was Francesco Speroni who replied: "The professor is so outside the League from an organizational point of view, that I fail to understand how he dares make such inferences." The recently appointed minister also stated that he had offered Miglio the post of head of the institutional reform organizational structure: "I tried asking him for his help but, much to my regret, he refused," Speroni explained. By now it was lunchtime and, in the Senate's refreshment bar, it was Roberto Maroni's turn to answer the professor's charges. "Despite everything," the interior minister said, "I am very fond of Miglio, and I would rather leave it to him to say spiteful things than say any myself, but his behavior is similar to [former Senate speaker] Spadolini's after [current Senate speaker] Scognamiglio was elected." In fact, according to Maroni, Miglio wanted a ministry for himself: "I personally followed all the negotiations with a view to forming the government, and I can assure you that we had to choose between accepting the Institutional Reforms Ministry without Miglio, or, alternatively, renouncing the Institutional Reforms Ministry in order to give Miglio another ministry, such as the higher education portfolio. For strategic reasons, the League opted for the first solution. Miglio would have preferred the latter." Maroni went on to deny that the break-up between Miglio and Bossi took place in December: "I can testify to the fact that, three days before the negotiations for forming the government came to a close, there was a meeting at which Miglio did nothing but heap praise on Bossi." Finally, in the evening, Bossi also joined the issue. "Poor devil, it is sad to see a 76-year old man seeking fulfillment through a portfolio.... But I understand him. He felt excluded. One of these days I will go to have a talk with him in the Senate." Bossi confirmed that the veto against Miglio came from [National Alliance leader] Fini and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi: "They had strong objections. I defended Miglio, but I can understand Berlusconi's viewpoint. Clearly, if a prime minister has someone in his cabinet who shoots his mouth off like this, the government would fall three times a day." Finally, as regards the illegal funding of the League: "Tell me where the bank is. I wish I had the power...."
