Labor Minister Walter Barelli announced he was leaving the government once. The heated discussion calmed down only after Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares intervened and talked with Cardoso. "Elcio put the fire out," a minister said. Cardoso's most explosive reaction was provoked by Barelli's proposal to give equal treatment to prices and salaries. This proposal would have caused the compulsory conversion of prices by the product's average price in the last four months -- January and February not counting because of the speculation in those months -- which would have resulted in a de facto price freeze. "This is my limit and perhaps if I leave another person can amend the stabilization program," Cardoso said. There was a moment of surprise, particularly because shortly before Franco had made clear that he supported Barelli's proposal. The president supported the idea of controlling prices, particularly prices set in areas controlled by oligopolies. The solution the ministers found was to call on Gustavo Franco, Central Bank external area director. Participants then started discussing a new draft to include Barelli's amendment without implying price controls, but making it clear that the government was determined not to permit excessive price increases. The MP [provisional measure] originally said that price conversions would be free with a generic citation saying the government would follow and supervise oligopolies. According to the original text, when the time was ripe for converting the URV into the new currency, real prices would be adjusted "according to criteria established by the Finance Ministry." In order to resolve a disagreement over this text, it was decided to establish that prices would be adjusted by the average price in September, October, November, and December, eliminating January and February from the calculation. It also was decided to follow up the behavior of price increases. So-called "abusive increases" will have to be explained by the entrepreneurs within a maximum five-day period. Prices higher than average will be considered "abusive." The draft satisfied Cardoso because it used the word "may." In other words, the conversion is voluntary, but the entrepreneurs will have to give an explanation if the average is not used. Barelli Still on 26 February, Barelli inaugurated the succession of resignation proposals. He presented a timetable with three methods to improve the minimum wage. Barelli said: "I accept the amount established by the finance minister ($64.79), but I want the government to commit itself to improving the minimum wage." One proposal involved increasing the minimum wage to $100 by the end of this year. The other proposals involved improving the minimum wage by May or December 1995. Cardoso and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo rejected these proposals. Barelli exclaimed: "The way the [economic] program is drawn up, the government does not need a labor minister." Cardoso rebuffed: "Then I am also leaving, because the country can have another finance minister." Alvares again calmed the spirits. When the meeting ended, the president proposed drawing up a note of solidarity with FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- second economic program] signed by all the ministers. Barelli asked: "Does this solidarity include minimum wages?" Franco responded: "Yes." Barelli signed. The meeting's delay was caused by the president. As soon as the meeting began, he started reading the provisional measure. After reading each article, Franco asked each minister to voice an opinion, but the problems started with paragraph 1 of Article 3. The paragraph established that the BC [Central Bank] would determine the real currency's initial issuance date. Franco asked: "Isn't this an issue that must be decided by the president?" The expression Central Bank was replaced by executive branch. Similar changes were introduced in various MP passages.
