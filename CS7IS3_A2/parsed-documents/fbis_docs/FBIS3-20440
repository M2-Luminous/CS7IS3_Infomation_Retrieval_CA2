Japan's "Keidanren" is an organization for the Japanese major capitalist class. It is the behind-the-scenes boss of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and influences the government through the ruling party. In 1978, the State Council organized a governmental delegation to visit Japan. The delegation leader was Vice Premier Gu Mu, and I was the assistant delegation leader. In Japan we met with three former and current Prime Ministers and several major corporation leaders. When we met with Konosuke Matsushita, who is called the "God of Business," the elderly man said with pride "We keep the best talent in industry for our own use; and send only the second best talent to government." This illustrated the influence of the major capitalist class on government in Japan. Liao Chengzhi also told me that Deng Xiaoping shared his view. This showed that the Central Committee had considered that: 1) Political power in Hong Kong is primarily influenced by the capitalist class; and 2) if there is to be a political party it must consist of an organized capitalist class not of individuals of the capitalist class. Liao Chengzhi ordered me to support a certain tycoon in activities to organize a political party. This indicated that the Central Committee leaders advocated the organization of a political party. The certain tycoon wanted at that time to organize a political party and had even thought of a name similar to that of Britain's Conservative Party. Later, problems developed and he shifted his support to another group. In my activities in Hong Kong, I had urged individuals from the upper and middle classes to "get organized" and organize a political party. I had discussed this with Yang Sen, Luo Kang-rui, and Szeto Wah and with Y. K. Pao and Li Kashing. But enthusiasm was low among the upper class. I thought of using the Hong Kong Macao International Investment Company as a fledgling form to organize the major Chinese capitalists, especially the major capitalists with various types of influence, but in the end, they had no interest in cooperating and had to "disband." Some people critized me for being too conservative and leaning towards the capitalist class. I felt that the special circumstances of Hong Kong were: politically, there really was unequal capitalist political power. Political power at the moment was still in the hands of the British and the Hong Kong British government primarily protected the interests of the capitalist class. But economically, the policies and approaches it adopted were all relatively suited to providing "fair" opportunities for development. Thus, in the drafting of the Basic Law, we wanted to maintain with little change the policies of the current Hong Kong government which allowed for ample economic freedom with little or no government interference. The development of political "fairness," or the course of democratization, would be on the principle of proceeding in an orderly fashion, or one step at a time. The development of political structure in Hong Kong would have to be adapted to "getting organized," and to the process of the Hong Kong people gaining an understanding of and experience with democracy. It could not influence the stability or economic prosperity of Hong Kong. It would not benefit anyone for the Hong Kong economy to "collapse." The debate surrounding the course of democratization in Hong Kong was exceptionally intense as could be seen in the multitude of proposals put forth by various circles. The stand-offs among the different political proposals began when the business community put forth a 57-person proposal and, in rebuttal, the extreme democratization faction put forth a 19-person proposal. Before long, the middle faction put forth a 38-person proposal. The 57-person proposal evolved into an 89-person proposal. The 19-person proposal developed into the "190" proposal. The British Government promoted "mutual recognition" and added "double investigation," "double recruitment" and "4,42." After "4 June" there were many proposals lined up. Because the compromise among the different political proposals and the passage of the Basic Law did not happen until after "4 June," these events could not avoid the influence of "4 June." For convenience of narration, I will address these issues in the later chapter "The Storm of 4 June." (During the drafting phase of the Basic Law, the Hong Kong people had many opinions on political issues. The points of dispute mainly surrounded the speed of the development of democracy in Hong Kong. This referred to the proportion of seats for different classes of people in the legislative body and the rate of development towards direct elections. Another area of debate was the relationship between the legislative body and the administration and how the head official of the administration would be chosen. During the early phases of the drafting of the Basic Law, society divided those with different views into the "democracy faction," the "business faction" and the "middle faction." The so-called "190 Proposal" was a political system proposal jointly suppported by 190 individuals and groups in society. The views of this faction represented the thinking of those of the "democratic faction" of the time. Their main demand was that the political system design, including the election of legislative representatives and administrative officials, develop in the direction of universal suffrage with one person-one vote.) The "business community's 89-person proposal" was the political system suggestion supported by the business and professional members of the Advisory Committee. The final draft was supported by 89 members of the Advisory Committee and thus was termed the "89-person proposal." The thrust of the proposal was the establishment of a "great electoral body" with persons from various circles. The electoral body would select administrative officials and part of the legislative representatives. Representatives from the business and professional communities would occupy most of the seats in the electoral body. The "38-person proposal" was the concept of 38 members of the Advisory Committee. They combined the characteristics of the various factions and found compromise among the views of the different factions. For example, the nomination of administrative officials would be done by a nomination body. The officials would then be elected by one person one vote. They also took a middle ground approach to the proportion of seats in the legislative body, a compromise between the positions of the "democratic faction" and the "business faction." The content of these proposals changed constantly during the drafting stage. Later, even more proposals emerged, but generally speaking, all primarily addressed the issues of the proportion of seats in the legislature and the extent of direct elections.

[Text] The formal signing of the PRC-UK Joint Communique by the head of both governments marked the beginning of a period of cooperation and negotiated resolution of Hong Kong issues by China and Britain. Cooperation between Britain and Hong Kong during this period was demonstrated mainly in two areas: First: During the drafting of the Basic Law, China respected and made every effort to include Britain's suggestions. Of course there was debate but there was mainly cooperation and compromise. Second: Both sides cooperated on the issue of maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. During this period, I got along very well with both Governer Youde and Governor Wilson. On May 1 1985, Youde visited Shanghai and Jiangsu province at my invitation. I returned to Nanjing the day before so that I could greet Youde at the airport with Jiangsu Governor Gu Xiulian. Youde stayed at Nanjing's Zhongshanling No. 5 Hotel. This was built during the "Great Leap Forward" to accomodate Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Building No. 1 was reserved for Mao Zedong's exclusive use. Building No. 2 was for Liu Shaoqi and other authorities of the Central Committee. Both are separate villas with complete suites, built among ancient trees towering overhead between the tomb of Sun Yatsen and "Ming Xiao Ling," the tomb of the Ming Taizu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. After the 13th National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, they were opened to the public and used to accomodate honored guests and foreign businessmen. Responsible individuals of the Jiangsu provincial government accompanied Youde to visit the scenic areas and factories of Nanjing and to brief him on Jiangsu province. Youde was revisiting old haunts. In the late 40's, Youde was a Counselor in the British Embassy to China. According to our information, he was a senior intelligence agent of the British Government. On 1 April 1949, the People's Liberation Army of China forced its way across the Chang Jiang River, occupied Nanjing and other large and medium cities, and controlled the Jiangyin fortress at the passage to the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang. At that time, the British warship the Amethyst was on the river near Nanjing to provide assistance to the Kuomintang. Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping issued an order to seal off the Chang Jiang and not allow the Amethyst to "escape." Youde obtained this intelligence. The British Embassy ordered him to find a way to tell the warship to take the risk of breaking through the blockade on the night of the 22d. Youde received honors and an award for this. At that time, I was a political committee member of the 88th Division of the 29th Army of the People's Liberation Army. I was the leader of a vanguard camp. On the night of the 21st, I was in a wooden boat on the eastern stretch of the river campaign battleline, and we stormed the shore at Changshan in Jiangyin County. On the night of the 22nd, we were pressing towards Wuxi when we suddenly heard artillery fire towards Jiangyin behind us. A line in the sky several dozen miles long glowed up red with artillery fire which finally ceased after about one hour. Only on the next day did we know that the Amethyst had "broken through the blockade" and "escaped." In Hong Kong, Youde and I had talked of his desire to visit the ancient cultural city of Yangzhou. When he was stationed at Nanjing in the past he had regretted not being able to visit Yangzhou. On this trip special arrangements were made for him to visit Yangzhou, including allowing him to enjoy the artistic treasures of the "Eight Yangzhou Eccentrics," famous painters from the Ming and Ching dynasties. Afterwards, we crossed the river at Zhenjiang and went to Wuxi and stayed in the Li Garden Cottage on the edge of Lake Tai. This was the former home of Fan Li, a doctor of the Kingdom of Wu during the Warring States Period. Youde's visit to Jiangsu happened to occur during the market season for the Chang Jiang herring. During the season around Chingming Festival, when the willow cotton flurries from the trees, the Chang Jiang herring swims upstream from the mouth of the Chang Jiang to spawn and this is the time when the flesh is full and tasty. When I invited Youde in Hong Kong to make this visit, I promised him an opportunity to taste this fish. I went to Nanjing a day early and asked the head of the tourism bureau, who was responsible for the visit arrangements, to have some Chang Jiang herring for the banquet. In the end, however, Youde did not eat herring in Nanjing because during the previous few years, the Chang Jiang had been subjected to much industrial pollution. Overfishing had also helped cause an annual decrease in production so that the market supply was very low. I expressed my apologies and promised to make up for it in Wuxi. Who would have expected that even in Wuxi we could not achieve our wish. After we arrived in Shanghai, Mayor Wang Daohan held a banquet for Youde at the Jinjiang Hotel. At the banquet, herring unexpectedly appeared on the table, causing me great embarrassment. I could only try to explain away my awkwardness by saying to Wang Daohan, "You Shanghainese have money and means. A Jiangsu product cannot be found in Jiangsu but is found in Shanghai!" Everyone laughed. Later I asked Wang Daohan and found out that they had especially sent someone to buy the fish directly from a fishing boat. [End of Installment No. 58] [2 Jul 93 p 2] [Text] I Discuss the "Political System" with Youde; Deep Sorrow at the Sudden Death of Youde When Youde visited Jiangsu, Britain was already implementing a parliamentary system in Hong Kong and there were already conflicts between Britain and China. I exchanged views with Youde in Wuxi on this issue. With an interpreter for each of us, we spent about two hours talking. I initially expressed my appreciation for success of the Hong Kong British government's economic policies and advisory system. After 97, when the new special district government is designed, these experiences will be worth studying and preserving as much as possible. Because Hong Kong has not had a democratic tradition, the implementation of democracy, especially "direct elections," should not be done too quickly but one step at a time. The future special district government will have to protect and balance the interests of different classes. The major owners of capital in Hong Kong are most concerned that those involved in democratization will change the Hong Kong government's current tax system of low taxes and narrowly applied taxes. We must give the major capitalists time to organize and participate in elections. Youde explained in response to my comments that they were designing an essential political system and would not concern themselves only with the interests of the capital owners. On the question of "direct elections," the Hong Kong government had made detailed calculations and felt it could maintain "control" and that the Chinese Government could rest at ease. "Our attitude is very cautious," he said. I did not critique his essential political system as a colonial dictatorship representing the British capitalist class but said only "I hope that Britain will not use the same methods in Hong Kong as those used in withdrawing from other colonies." Hong Kong's conditions and qualifications are not the same as those of other colonies. Particularly on the economic front, both Britain and China share the same desire to maintain economic prosperity in Hong Kong. Furthermore, Britain would only withdraw after 12 more years. We wanted to join with Britain to strive for unity among all circles in Hong Kong and avoid social divisiveness or the creation of negative effects. I used terms like "we hope that Britain will not violate empiricism." Although our views were diametrically opposed to each other, our purpose was cooperation and the atmosphere was always friendly. Later, when I discussed Hong Kong political reform with newly appointed Governor Wilson, I also used the expression "don't violate empiricism." While Youde was visiting Jiangsu, he casually mentioned that he and his wife were both very interested in ancient Chinese culture. I suggested that they visit Xi'an to see the recently unearthed Qin Dynasty terracotta army. Youde was very pleased and indicated that he wanted to find an opportunity to make that visit. After returning to Hong Kong, Youde was very busy with official duties and did not have time to go, but his wife wished to go without him. I asked the authorities in Xi'an to issue the invitation and make the arrangements. When Youde died, his wife was touring Xi'an, accompanied by Deng Lianru. When the news arrived, I was in Beijing participating in a meeting of the Hong Kong Macao Office. Everyone felt that it was terribly sudden, because on the previous evening, Youde had attended a banquet with Ji Pengfei at the Diaoyutai Guest House. I was also present. His health and mood appeared fine. He even drank several glasses of Maotai liquor. I heard that he had a heart attack during the night and was found lying on the floor. Some people guess that he had an attack and was going to get some medicine, but it was too late and he collapsed. I felt great sorrow that he died this way. I attended his funeral after returning to Hong Kong. Having been adversaries with him for some time, I felt that we had come to know each other well and he was a person with whom I could communicate. [Text] Joint Rescue of the Stock Market; Hong Kong and Britain Jointly "Rescue the Market" Through Pu Weishi On October 19, 1987, the United States New York stock market crashed, and the world stock market crisis hit Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index lost about 1,000 points in one day. It was called "Black Friday." The Hong Kong stock exchange Chairman Li Fuzhao announced that the market would close four days. All the stockholders in the market were in a constant state of anxiety, and it was a miserable scene. On that day it happened that Beijing's Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa was in Hong Kong seeking donations to prepare funding for the Asian Games. I had invited a group of commercial magnates to a banquet at the Meilihua Hotel, intending to ask them for generous donations at the banquet. At that time I knew about the stock market crisis, and we were discussing it endlessly even before the meal. Furthermore, I knew that many among the guests had experienced great losses. Although they attended the event, they looked as if their thoughts were elsewhere and they were simply forcing themselves to fulfill their obligations to attend. I intervened with Zhang Baifa, "Don't bring up the question of donations at the banquet today. Leave it for another day." Zhang Baifa indicated that he understood and agreed. I asked stock expert Xiang Zhiqiu, known as the "Great Knight Xiang," for advice. He suggested: "The Hong Kong government should come out to rescue the stocks." He briefly explained his reasoning. Although I did not completely comprehend, I grasped the phrase "the government can come to the rescue." Two days later, Jiang Wengui, Chairman of the Hong Kong Macao Management Office of the Bank of China, called and asked to see me concerning an urgent issue relating to the stock market. I asked him to come over immediately. He told me that Hui Feng Chairman Pu Weishi had asked the Bank of China to work with him to rescue the stock market. Pu had indicated that this was also the desire of the Hong Kong British government. A total of two billion Hong Kong dollars was needed. Three parties would contribute the funds. The Hong Kong government would provide one billion, Hui Feng would provide 500 million, and the Bank of China would give 500 million. Jiang asked for my view. I immediately convened the economic leadership team of the Working Committee to discuss this. Everyone agreed that relations between China and Britain were very friendly, and since this request had come from the British Government, we could agree to cooperate in rescuing the market. Hui Feng, however, had a much larger volume of business in Hong Kong than the Bank of China and a much larger interest in the stock market. The Bank of China should not be asked to carry as large a burden. At the same time, "rescuing the market" would also include a certain risk which someone would have to carry but not the Bank of China alone. The Bank of China would not demand interest, regardless of the amount provided. All at the meeting agreed that "Society would know that the Bank of China had joined in the `rescue of the market.' This would indicate the Chinese Government's support of the Hong Kong stock market with greater political influence than economic influence." [End of Installment No. 59]
