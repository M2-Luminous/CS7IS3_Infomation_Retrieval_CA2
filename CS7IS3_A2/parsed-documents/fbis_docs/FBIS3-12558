Peres was speaking in Jerusalem at a joint press conference with the visiting Cambodian Foreign Minister, Prince Norodom Sirtvut. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres was asked about the long-term effects of the Hebron massacre on the peace process. He said it was a real tragedy that had created a great problem, and he took it very seriously. However, he rejected the Palestinian demand for an international force to protect the Palestinian civilians and for the disarming of all the settlers. [Peres] We don't have to punish people who are peaceful and who support peace. What we have really to prevent is this small group of terrible, opinionated people, who may pose another problem. In a democracy, you act against dangers and you don't punish innocent people. [Katzenell] The settlements will remain where they are, Peres said. But when he was asked about the proposal to evacuate the settlers from downtown Hebron, he said he would express his view at the cabinet meeting first, not to the media. The foreign minister expressed confidence that the negotiations with the Palestinians would be resumed soon. I don't know what all their demands are, he said. I was told that they are interested perhaps in increasing their police force. That is a legitimate demand, Peres said. We shall sit down and discuss it. [end recording]
