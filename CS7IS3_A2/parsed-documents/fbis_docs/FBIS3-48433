The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea in a statement charged that after seating himself in the "presidential" chair, Kim Yong-sam has refused to dismantle the "Security Planning Board," a suppressive machine, and kept the fascist laws including the "National Security Law." Television No. 2 of France said that the present South Korean "regime", under the mask of "civilian politics," continues repressing the people as under the military fascist rule. The Cuban magazine BOHEMIA said: "The South Korean people demanded that Kim Yong-sam restore democracy, end the fascist rule, clean up all manner of corruption and fling open the door of reunification. But he refused to do so and he is not a man fit for such things". The Rwandan Committee for Supporting the Reunification of Korea in a statement said the South Korean authorities showed that the present government under the "civilian" veil was a military fascist "regime" when they let loose the repressive force and blocked the fourth pan-national rally. A delegate of the International Association Against Torture demanded that the South Korean authorities immediately scrap the "National Security Law" and unconditionally release the innocent people.
