A possible meeting before the Hungarian elections in May was cancelled after the two sides failed to agree on whether a joint communique should be issued after the talks. Hungary accused Slovakia of showing a lack of interest in the meeting. "Of course, no-one wants these meetings to be nothing more than visits out of politeness," Moravcik says, adding that both sides had to bring something. He says there are three specific problems in Slovak-Hungarian relations, and if these are solved "an atmosphere of trust would start to reign." The first problem is that of the inviolacy of borders between Slovakia and Hungary, Moravcik says, pointing out that many Slovaks, with or without justification, are afraid of the borders changing in a way unfavourable to Slovakia, and this is a "disturbing element" in bilateral relations. Slovak leaders are aware that the Hungarian Government and realist Hungarian politicians are not putting forward any territorial claims on Slovakia, but in the interest of strengthening trust there is a need for the Hungarians to issue a concrete declaration confirming the current borders. The second question concerns national minorities. "The difference between the Slovak and the Hungarian standpoint is only really apparent when it comes to collective rights," the Slovak premier says. From the Slovak point of view there exists only areas with a mixed Slovak and Hungarian population, and therefore "a solution to the problem using collective rights would not be proper." He adds that the Slovaks are naturally willing to negotiate on "certain individual rights in such a way that all citizens, regardless of their nationality can fully realise their identity and cultivate their language and national culture." Moravcik says Slovakia is prepared to fulfil the recommendations of the Council of Europe concerning the official use of minority-language names and bilingual signs for towns and villages. Everything is already prepared and it is just a question of time before the relevant laws are passed, he says. The third problem is the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project. Both the Hungarians and Slovaks should listen to the opnions of experts more, and should try to depoliticise the whole affair as much as possible, Moravcik says.
