In an official statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was regrettable that China had again carried out a nuclear test at a time when all other major nuclear powers are refraining from conducting such tests and as active negotiations have been underway for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) since January. The Chinese test does not contribute to efforts to maintain international peace, it said. The South Korean Government urges all nations that possess nuclear weapons to stop testing nuclear devices to ensure early conclusion of the CTBT, and to refrain from undertaking any action that may have a negative impact on the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the statement said.
