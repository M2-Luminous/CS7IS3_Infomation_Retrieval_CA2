Karayalcin, talking about his views on recent political developments, repeated that he was misunderstood when he said, "There are those who are preparing to intervene against democracy." Karayalcin, explaining he did not mean the word "coup" said, "When I mentioned there are those who are getting ready to intervene against democracy, I did not mean to say coups. I meant some particular forces. The methods of intervention are not the same any more. In less developed countries, because the military is the most powerful force, the military carries out coups. ``However, this is changing. In a neighboring country, the name of which I don't want to mention, one industrialist, leasing tanks and soldiers, is able to intervene against the government. In Georgia, Shevardnadze can state that the ports of his country are in the hands of the Mafia. Those fighting in the former Yugoslavia are not soldiers. The traditional standards for coups are different now. In Turkey there are sectors arming themselves outside the military. There are people being trained outside the country and there are those taking an oath to change the regime. I wanted to draw attention to these people. It is not possible to govern Turkey without democracy. Turkey cannot be governed by military rule, isolating itself from the outside world. This is not possible.'' [passage omitted] Karayalcin, emphasizing that Turkey is in a geographic region where the line between war and peace is very thin, said, "It is very easy to move from peace to war in the Middle East, in the Balkans, and in the Caucasus. For these regions peace in Turkey and in the area has great importance. We have to add `Peace at home, peace in the region' to our principle of `Peace at home, peace in the world.' Taking regional characteristics into consideration, a thesis was put forth recently which says `Turkey does not have to be an ordinary country in the region.' According to this thesis, Turkey will be either a strong country or it will be divided. This is a hypothesis worth thinking about. It is from this perspective that one can evaluate Turkey's decision, despite the fact that all its governments have created inflation and dollar dependency, to choose a nonnegotiable 7-percent growth rate and to achieve that goal without fear of going into foreign debt."[passage omitted]
