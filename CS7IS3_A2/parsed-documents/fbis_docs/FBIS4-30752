The march was headed by a banner saying "Solidarity always in defense of your interests." The marchers chanted slogans, including: "Cimoszewicz must go," "SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] to Cuba," "An empty cell for Labor Minister Miller," and "Down with the commies." In his speech at the rally preceding the march, Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski referred to the helicopter observing the preparations for the demonstration. He suggested that the government had already prepared a statement saying that the Solidarity demonstration had been a failure.
