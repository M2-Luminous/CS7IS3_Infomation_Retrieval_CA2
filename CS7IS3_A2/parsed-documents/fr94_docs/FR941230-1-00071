FR941230-1-00071 FR941230-1-00006 II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated December 7, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1416), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package consisting of revisions to the Indiana program rules. The amendment revises language which was inadvertently repealed and pertains to the procedures for the application and renewal of blaster certification. The following amendments are being proposed. 1. 310 IAC 12&hyph;8&hyph;4.1 Application for Certification This new section is added to provide the following: Section 4.1(a) An application for certification as a certified blaster shall be submitted to the department. (b) An application for certification shall be in writing upon forms furnished by the department. (c) An application shall be completed in accordance with the instructions provided with it. (d) An application form is incomplete if the form does not contain all required information or if the form contains incorrect information. The applicant will be given notice of the deficiencies, and if the required information is not provided by the applicant within thirty (30) days of the notice, the application will be terminated. (e) The director or an authorized representative may verify the information shown on the application directly with educational institutions, other certification boards and personal references, and may verify the work experience with the employer. (f) If an application has been terminated, the person will not be considered for certification. A new application may be submitted at any time by complying with subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 2. 310 IAC 12&hyph;8&hyph;8.1 Renewal This new section is added to provide the following: Section 8.1(a) A certified blaster must obtain renewal of the certification every three (3) years. A request for renewal of the certification shall be in writing upon a form furnished by the department. The request for renewal must be received by the department not later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the certificate. (b) The renewal will be approved if the certified blaster has worked at least twelve (12) months of the preceding thirty-six (36) months as a certified blaster and the certified blaster is not in violation of 310 IAC 12&hyph;8&hyph;9. (c) When the certification is not renewed for more than one (1) year after expiration, the certification will not be renewable. An application shall be submitted to the department in the event that the individual desires to again be certified, and the individual shall be considered as a new applicant. (d) A renewal notice will be sent to each registrant not less than two (2) months prior to the expiration date of the certification. (e) All renewal notices and other communications will be sent to the last address given by the registrant to the department. A failure of the certified blaster to receive a renewal notice under this subsection does not relieve the certified blaster of the obligation to obtain a renewal of the certification as required under subsection (a) of this section. The proposed program amendment submitted by Indiana is available for public inspection at the addresses listed above. The Director now seeks public comment on whether the proposed amendment is no less effective than the Federal regulations. If approved, the amendment will become part of the Indiana program.
