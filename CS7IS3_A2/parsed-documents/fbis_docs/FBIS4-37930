Minister Shetrit spoke about the need to intensify building activity in Jerusalem, but the prime minister noted the legal problems involved in land confiscation. Minister Bar'am urged that Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not be left out of the picture in order to avoid playing into the hands of the extremists in the city. Police Minister Shahal complained that Olmert routinely fails to appear at meetings of the subcommittee on security affairs -- which operates in the framework of the Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs -- but rather sends a different representative on his behalf each time. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the ministers were told that those running the autonomy are attempting to spread their authority beyond the regions of Gaza and Jericho, and efforts are being made to stop this. The ministers also dealt with the tough living conditions of foreign workers in Israel. Minister Peres said it was a mistake to bring in workers from abroad. Ministers Peres and Shohat criticized Minister Shetrit for encroaching on their ministerial spheres.
