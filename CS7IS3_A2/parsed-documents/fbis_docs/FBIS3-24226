Over 1993 the expected losses of sovkhozes, kolkhozes, and agricultural combines will amount to 129.6 million tenge, and the loss level is 4.8 percent, while a year earlier 119.7 million tenge--recalculated into national currency equivalency--was earned in profits and the profitability level was 7.4 percent. Also, 1,232 entities, or 49 percent of the total, will account for 422.4 million tenge in losses. As we can see, almost one-half of public sector agricultural enterprises ended up bankrupt. The other half, which have survived the trials of a savage market, managed to cover only 71.7 percent of the losses. It would be useful to look at the financial side from the sectoral angle. Plant-growing, for instance, is overall profitable--17.5 percent. Moreover, all the main sectors are profitable: grain production--19 percent, potatoes--32 percent, field-grown vegetables--36 percent, and so on. At the same time, losses from sales of animal husbandry products amounted to 323.1 million tenge; the loss level in milk production is 40 percent, wool--39 percent, and horned cattle--34 percent. The costs of agricultural production increased 11-fold as compared to last year, which in turn resulted in increased production costs in plant-growing by a factor of nine to 25, and in animal husbandry by a factor of seven to 11. The Goskomstat provides specific data on how much of what products was produced, and the comparison between 1993 and 1992 figures. Grain and legumes were planted on 22 million hectares, or 348,000 hectares less than during the preceding year. The area sown decreased with respect to all crops, but an especially sharp cutback occurred with respect to millet--almost by half. The gross yield of grain in all categories of farms amounted to 21.6 million tonnes, which is 8.1 million, or 27 percent, less compared to last year's yield. Grain yield per hectare amounted on average to 9.7 quintals, which is one quarter lower than the levels reached in the past. The average yield of millet was only 4.4 quintals per hectare, and buckwheat--3.2 quintals. The shortfall in the production of these crops amounted to 216,000 and 99,000 tonnes, respectively. Production of potatoes and vegetables also declined in 1993--by 9 percent and 15 percent, respectively. There are two reasons--smaller area sown and lower yields. The output of fruit and berries, as well as grapes, also declined as compared to last year--by 37 percent and 52 percent. The gross yield of sugar beet declined by almost one-quarter, and sunflower seed--by 12 percent. As Goskomstat reports, the herd of horned cattle decreased as compared to last year by 5 percent, of swine--by 6 percent, and of sheep--by 1 percent. At the same time, the herd of horses increased by 4 percent, and of camels--by the same proportion. At first glance, the herd of cattle decreased insignificantly. Translated into absolute figures, however, the numbers are impressive--hundreds of thousands of head. I will add myself that over the past three years the herd of horned cattle decreased by 596,200 head, swine--by 783,800 (that is, by one-quarter), and of sheep and goats--by 1,460,500. The state of affairs in animal husbandry in different regions of the republic obviously is far from the same. For instance, the most perceptible decline in the size of horned cattle herd took place in Pavlodar Oblast--by 28 percent; in North Kazakhstan Oblast it decreased by 10 percent, and in Kustanay Oblast--by 7 percent. The herd of swine decreased by one-fifth in South Kazakhstan Oblast and almost one-third in Zhezkazgan Oblast; in a number of northern oblasts an active reduction of sheep and goats herd is underway. There are, however, encouraging examples as well. In southern and western oblasts, for instance, there was an increase in the size of horned cattle herd, in Akmolinsk and Karaganda Oblast--in swine, and in Atyrau, Mangistau, Kzyl-Orda and some other oblasts--in the number of sheep and goats. According to Goskomstat reports, the reduction of herd in the public sectors, which began several years ago, continues. The hope that the private sector will make up for the losses did not fully materialize. Yes, there is an increase, but not as significant as expected. Take for instance horned cattle. Their number at private farms increased by 18,000, bringing the total to 87,000. This is less than 1 percent of their total number. They say that under market laws, bankrupt enterprises cease to exist and are sold at auction. But there are just too many of them--1,232, almost one-half. Let us say some brave people will undertake this step. But who would want them, these economically insolvent agricultural enterprises? This is the first thing. Second, sovkhozes and kolkhozes became bankrupt not by their own volition. There were, of course, unprofitable enterprises before--five, 10 years ago--but not this many! And the explanation that in the past the state subsidized them is not valid, because at the same time it underpaid the farms for their products, and rural workers--for their labor. Third, over the past three years everything has been done to push agro-industrial complex enterprises into bankruptcy. Prices for industrial production grew much faster than for agricultural output. The cost of borrowing was unsustainable for sovkhozes and kolkhozes. On top of that, the state treasury ran out of money, delaying payments for grain and other products procured from the farms, which devalued the earnings even more. It is clear today that the comprehensive solution for the problems of the agro-industrial complex that seemed possible turned out to be unacceptable. It is not so simple to disband unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and land cannot be distributed to farmers overnight. Plus, far from all will take it, and it is far from certain that those who will can get operate it profitably. Of more than 15,000 private farms, a good half, or maybe even more, also are bankrupt. Thousands of independent peasants do not know how to make the ends meet. In short, just as the leadership of the Peasant Union and the Kolkhoz Council had predicted, the republic's agro-industrial complex has run aground, and solidly. And it is unlikely that we will be able to find a genius (domestic or foreign) capable of sorting everything out--when and what step to make, what to do today, what--the day after tomorrow. We will have to search for a solution together--politicians, economists, scientists, and peasants. The number one priority by far should be the introduction of price parity on industrial and agricultural production, without which economic stabilization is impossible. Agricultural Academy scientists have developed a conceptual program of agro-industrial complex development, and it would be a waste not to use it. Academician M. Suleymenov, director of Imeni A.I. Barayeva Scientific-Research Institute of Grain Growing, Transportation Academician S. Plokhov, and others offer original ideas aimed at stable development of grain growing. All we need is to learn how to see and hear them.
