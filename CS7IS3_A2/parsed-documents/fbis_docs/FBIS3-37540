Not a single of the four agreements under discussion has been signed at the Latvian-Russian talks which ended in Jurmala today. The next round of talks is scheduled for February 28. Commenting on the results of the talks, Martins Virsis, head of the Latvian delegation, said that the two sides did not agree in views on three issues: The size of rent for the radio location station in Skrunda, the number of its personnel and the status of military pensioners. Head of the Russian delegation Sergey Zotov noted that he was satisfied with the assurances given by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today that Latvia does not intend to restrict rights of military pensioners. According to Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh "the difficulties which arose at the talks, account for the complex internal political situation in Latvia. Failure to sign the treaty is disadvantageous for both sides, but much more for Latvia as it would be better if the radar worked within the framework of an agreement but not without it".
