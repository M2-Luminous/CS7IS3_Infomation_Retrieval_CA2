From the period when the CPC came to power to 1978, China accomplished the early-phase industrialization by implementing the import substitute strategy; since reform and opening up, through importing technology to transform heavy and chemical industries, China accomplished the process of "import for replacement." At present, the third-phase industrialization has begun, and it is a phase in which heavy and chemical industries are the main body and labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries are the two wings for realizing the high degree of industrial processing which is characteristic of industrialization in the later phase. For this reason, it is necessary to accomplish the change from importing technologies for petrochemical, mechanical, and electronic industries to exporting them, and to let light and textile industries provide foreign exchange to technology-intensive industries. The "closed-type" import substitute strategy stresses complete domestic manufacturing under state protection after importing technology. Under the conditions that technological progress in the international community takes place rapidly, that modern industrial sectors involve sophisticated technology and many production links, and that there are strict demands for raw materials, spare parts, and examining and testing measures, domestic manufacturing is not only costly, but also time-consuming, leading to the vicious cycle of "import--domestic manufacturing--backwardness--import again." Chinese economic and trade experts have now proposed a new "open-type import substitute strategy," that is, strength will be first concentrated to enable certain spare parts or processing stages to reach the world's advanced level, to enter the international market, and to become a part of the global industrial system, and through this to monitor the development trends of the world's industrial technology and products; then steps will be taken to enable overall manufacturing to reach the world's advanced standard. Therefore, the development of technology-intensive industries in the nineties must aim at participation in high-level division of labor in the international community, not just simplistic pursuit of the rate of domestic manufacturing.
