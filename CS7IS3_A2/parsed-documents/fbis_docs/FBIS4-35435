He also said that any PLO presence in Jerusalem must be authorized by Israel. David Ze'ev reports from the Knesset: [Begin Ze'ev recording] Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid presented the following statement in the name of the government before the Knesset plenum: One, that institutions of the Palestinian self-rule authority will be in the Gaza Strip or the Jericho area, and only there. Two, any organizational activity that is diplomatic or resembles diplomatic activity that relates to Palestinian rule or resembles it in Jerusalem will require the endorsement of Israeli authorities, and each case will be examined by Israel based on the accord with the PLO. And three, there is only one police force in Jerusalem -- Israeli, not Palestinian, and security and public order in Jerusalem is the responsibility of the Israeli police force, no other. That would be forbidden and will not be permitted, in Sarid's words. Minister Sarid said he has spoken out against the statements of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the past and is repeating that 'Arafat will have to renew his commitment to the accord in words; more importantly, in actions. But, said Sarid, the situation on the ground is a positive surprise. The Palestinians, he says, are doing their job under the toughest conditions. [end recording]. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he will do everything in his power to close Orient House. He was speaking in London at a gathering sponsored by the JEWISH QUARTERLY JOURNAL. Jerry Lewis has details: [Begin recording] [Lewis] Ehud Olmert said that Orient House was the headquarters of what originally was the Society for Arab Studies, sponsored by Faysal al-Husayni. However, lately it turned out to be the headquarters of what he says Faysal al-Husayni thought was the future government of the Palestinian state in Jerusalem. [Olmert] My personal position and my official position as mayor of Jerusalem is that Orient House ought to be closed, and I will do everything I can in my power to close it. The Orient House is acting against the laws of the State of Israel. When it acts to divide the city it is an outright violation of the criminal law of Israel that forbids any action that may jeopardize the status of Jerusalem as the exclusive united capital of the state of Israel.
