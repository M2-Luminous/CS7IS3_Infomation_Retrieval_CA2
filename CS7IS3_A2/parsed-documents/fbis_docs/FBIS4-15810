The conference aroused so much interest that Mr. Chornovil jokingly said it was not a conference, but another meeting with the electorate of which he conducted more than 200 during his campaign. The main result, according to Vyacheslav Chornovil, is that the elections took place, and the Ukrainian people should be credited with this fact. The Rukh faction held its ground in the new parliament. In the elections, Rukh positioned itself in the center of the political spectrum, rejecting both far- right and far-left slogans. Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Rukh tried to handle its rivals and opponents in a correct manner, which cannot be said about them. The elections showed that our democratic and national movement has a long way to go yet before achieving unity. Those forces, Mr. Chornovil stated, did not participate in the elections as a united front. For example, divisions between Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party deepened, and a similar tendency is visible in the case of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, which diverges the principles of democratic nationalism, on which its cooperation with Rukh was based. Mr. Chornovil then focused on the flawed Ukrainian electoral legislation and violations reported during the recent voting. One could see that particular concern of the Rukh leader was aroused by the fact that Kiev is left without its legislative core. The elections here were simply torpedoed. Vyacheslav Chornovil stated that Rukh will not allow this to happen in the next, third-round elections, and will vigorously fight for every vacant seat in the parliament so that Kiev is represented by democratically oriented deputies. Democracy cannot do without a lobby in parliament. [Begin Chornovil recording] There are quite a few independent democrats, or candidates whose independence have not yet been established. Some were in the power structures, and thus stayed out of parties. I think the uniting of democratic forces will be considered, unless some of the hot-headed national democrats shatter this unity. There have already been such attempts. By the way, I would like to see the newly elected Supreme Council carried away by political discussions, which is probably something that our communists will seek. It will be a bad thing if we start squabbling over national symbols or some other political issues. Perhaps we will have to look for [words indistinct] to resolve the serious problems with which Ukraine is presently faced. [end recording]
