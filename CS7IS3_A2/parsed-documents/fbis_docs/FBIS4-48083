The European Union says it plans to invest about 700 million rands in South Africa to help the government fulfill the expectations of the country's citizens. A member of the Union's executive, Mr. Hans van den Broek, said in Pretoria that the new government would need foreign aid for the difficult work that lies ahead. He said people were justified in having high hopes but that it would be a hard task satisfying them in the short term. Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it easier to export to Canada. Application of the General Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33 percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1 million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years. This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90 million rands. Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South Africa's new government needs international confidence and support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so great as in South Africa. Other nations who announced plans to boost relations with South Africa are Indonesia, Morocco, Bangladesh, China, India, and Singapore.
