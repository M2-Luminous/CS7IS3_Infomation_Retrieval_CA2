Raja Mohan: "U.S. Offers To Push Indo-Pak Talks"; quotation marks as published] [Text] Washington, Jan. 5. The United States will continue to prod India and Pakistan to work at resolving various issues that bedevil mutual relations, according to sources in the Clinton administration. They see the just concluded round of dialogue in Islamabad as a useful first step in a process with significant potential. The sources are not surprised at the testy nature of the dialogue and its tentative outcome insisting that only India and Pakistan can resolve their differences, the administration expressed its readiness to help facilitate a forward movement in the dialogue. In a separate written response to reporters, the State department yesterday declared its "strong support" for the resumption of talks at the level of Foreign Secretaries. The administration has for some time been pressing both countries to resume the "high-level" dialogue that last took place in August 1992. Although Washington did not publicly take credit for the resumption, the American pressure apparently was a key factor in the renewal of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue. The State department welcomed the "agreement in principle" reached in Islamabad to continue the talks at the `Foreign Secretary or other levels.' The administration hopes that `further talks can take place soon.' The State department said, "We agree that a meaningful dialogue is needed to peacefully resolve the issues between India and Pakistan. To that end, we encourage both parties to approach the entire range of issues constructively with the aim of achieving tangible agreements leading to reduced tensions." To another written question on the U.S. mediatory role, it declared that "we do not see ourselves in a mediator's role." However, "the U.S. is willing to assist India and Pakistan to reach and implement agreements if they both so desire." Dialogue on Kashmir: The written response made no direct mention of the Kashmir dispute. But sources in the administration referred to its complex nature and the difficulty both India and Pakistan face in making hard political and psychological adjustments to their traditional diplomatic posture on Kashmir. The sources also believe that the process of the dialogue on Kashmir should be seen as being productive by the people in the valley. India needs to go beyond the small steps it has taken on the human rights front, and initiate a genuine political process in the troubled State. The sources regret that despite much talk about a political initiative, New Delhi is yet to set in motion a new process in the valley. They also note that the Indo-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir would be a long slog. Questioned on the basic tension between the Pakistani approach to emphasising the resolution of the core issue -- Kashmir -- and the Indian call for progress on a broad front of bilateral relations, the sources suggest that this may not be unique to the sub-continent. They point to West Asia, where Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have made substantial progress in resolving their bilateral conflict, sidestepping the so-called core issues like the status of Jerusalem. This pragmatic, and typically American, approach to problem-solving is widely shared in Washington. Dr. Mitchell Riess, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Centre, suggested that progress on other issues should not be held hostage to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. Noting that an agreement on Siachen is at hand, Dr. Riess pointed out that movement on resolving smaller issues could generate a political momentum and the right diplomatic ambience to address the larger issues. "Solve what you can and keep talking." Welcoming the resumption of the dialogue, Dr. Michael Krepon, director of the Henry L. Stimson Centre which has in recent years taken consistent interest in Indo-Pakistani confidence-building, noted that several impediments to conflict resolution and confidence-building measures in the Sub-continent had been removed. The positive results of the latest elections in Pakistan and India, he believes, may have paved the way for a sober approach to problem solving in the Indian sub-continent. Dr. Krepon is apprehensive that without a political initiative at the highest level it may not be possible to realise the full potential of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue. But sources in the administration note the constraints on the leadership in both the countries imposed by the partisan rhetoric and their political opponents. They refer to the enormous concrete work that needs to be done in New Delhi and Islamabad to push the dialogue forward. In one important Pakistani response available here, Mr. Abdus Sattar, who recently served as the Foreign Minister of that country, wished that the Islamabad talks had resulted in a more tangible progress. Mr. Sattar, currently a distinguished fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, was earlier the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and posted twice as High Commissioner to India. Mr. Sattar lamented that while there was an incredible movement in conflict resolution in South Africa, West Asia and northern Ireland, India and Pakistan had lagged behind. Interestingly, the recent dialogue has attracted little attention in the U.S. media. The written response of the State department came only when the spokesman, who had no prepared answer, was questioned by the reporters from the sub-continent. For all anxieties in India and hopes in Pakistan about an American role in Kashmir, the issue barely figurtes in the foreign policy discourse in Washington. Only the few South Asia hands inside the State department and outside in this town appear concerned about the future of Kashmir or Indo-Pakistani relations. Raphael Comments `Unfortunate' PTI reports from New York Mr. Gary Ackerman, Chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee on South Asia and Pacific Affairs, has described as "very unfortunate" and "regrettable" the remarks by Ms. Robin Raphael, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, questioning the legality of the accession of Kashmir to India. "I think it does not indicate any shift or change whatsoever in the official U.S. policy." Asked about Pakistani-trained militants indulging in terrorism in Kashmir, he said terrorism anywhere was of great concern to humanity. "There are problems in Kashmir. There are those who foment trouble. There are always those who commit terrorist acts. It is time when Governments should exercise their legitimate rights to maintain order." In this connection, Mr. Ackerman stressed the need for "appropriate handling" of the cases of excesses that the security forces sometime committed while handling terrorism. On human rights, he was `very happy' to see that the situation in India was improving all the time. Replying to a question, he said India's nuclear programme so far "seems to be fairly responsible." But India must sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and open facilities to inspection. He would like to see New Delhi open up the process completely and be a member in good standing of the treaty. The U.S. had same concerns with India as with other nations whether friendly or not. "We have the same concern with China on a larger scale and everywhere there is nuclear (weapon) potential or nuclear capability." "We have a terrible problem with China's nuclear programme. We have a terrible problem with North Korea and the Ukraine."
