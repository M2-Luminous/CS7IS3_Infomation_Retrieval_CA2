We have warned numerous times in the past that Turkey's human rights record is dismal and that those in power have to do something urgently to correct this situation. The authorities have preferred to turn a deaf ear to our warnings, and we have reached a stage where Turkey can no longer pretend to be a select member of the community of civilized nations and still fail to take action to correct its human rights image. Recently the American Congress joined the Western offensive, linking U.S. aid to Turkey to human rights and the Cyprus question. We feel this is very mistaken. Cyprus is not only a very sensitive subject for Turks but it is also a national issue, and any external pressures, especially from the American Congress, will only sharpen the feeling of Turks that they are unjustly being persecuted. This coupling of Cyprus with human rights will only be counter-productive, even for those of us who are trying to promote human rights in Turkey. People will feel we are cooperating with those who are trying to force concessions on Cyprus, under the guise of talking about human rights. We are the ones who complain about the lack of human rights. Yet we also would like to remind our friends on Capital Hill that human rights in Turkey does not only mean Kurdish rights, but the rights of all the citizen of the Turkish Republic who are facing repression and intimidation. The citizens of Turkey are facing serious hardships in the midst of a guerrilla war, and those living in the western areas of the country often see their rights being violated, even though they do not live in the trouble spots.... We feel that people on Capital Hill should show sincere concern about human rights and the lack of freedoms in Turkey, and set aside Cyprus and Kurdish rights. There are writers who go to jail simply for expressing their views. There are people who disappear while in custody. This happens in major cities, not in the Kurdish-dominated trouble spots of southeastern Turkey. If the congressmen stop using Cyprus and eliminate a degree of bias, then their actions to promote human rights in Turkey will take on a more sincere dimension. We are aware that friends of Turkey abroad are also hard pushed to defend our country, in view of its unfavorable human rights image. It is about time we started doing something ourselves to eliminate these deficiencies in our democracy and take our rightful place among the community of civilized nations.
