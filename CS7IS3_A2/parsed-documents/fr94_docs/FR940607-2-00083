FR940607-2-00083 FR940607-2-00060 [Release No. 34&hyph;34138; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;44] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating To Issuance of Regulatory Circular Relating to Floor Brokerage Practices June 1, 1994. On October 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to issue to its membership a Regulatory Circular (``1993 Circular'') relating to certain floor brokerage practices. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33155 (November 4, 1993), 58 FR 59763. No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The CBOE states that the 1993 Circular is designed to assist floor brokers in understanding their responsibilities under the CBOE's Rules, the Act, and the Commission's regulations. On June 19, 1986, the CBOE issued a Regulatory Circular (``1986 Circular'') which describes, among other things, the steps that should be taken when a floor broker proposes to ``leg in'' a multi-part order or to cross customer orders pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.74, ```Crossing' Orders.'' In addition, the 1986 Circular sets forth procedures to be followed when there has been a ``print-through'' 3 on a limit order or an order is not otherwise executed due to a floor broker's error. 3 A ``print through'' occurs when a trade is effected in the crowd at a price that is better than the price at which a customer order should have been represented by a floor broker in the trading crowd. The 1993 Circular states that if a broker discovers a print-through during trading hours and a better price is available at the time, the customer order should be filled at the better price. If the better price is no longer available, then the floor broker is responsible at the original limit price and may either execute the order at the available market and give the customer a ``different check'' or fill the order out of his error account, provided it does not reduce or liquidate a position in the error account. If the print-through is discovered outside trading hours and the customer requires a fill as of that trade date, the floor broker may fill the customer's order at the limit price from his error account. If the print-through occurs on the opening, the customer is generally entitled to the number of contracts which print through at the opening price. If a better price than the opening price is available when the error is discovered, the customer order should be filled at the better price. The 1993 Circular restates and expands upon the subjects discussed in the 1986 Circular. For example, the 1993 Circular provides a more detailed discussion of recordkeeping requirements, restates the procedures applicable to a print-through on a limit order, and makes clear that, except as otherwise specified, a floor broker is not permitted to fill the customer order from his error account if doing so would reduce or liquidate a position in the broker's error account. Similarly, the 1986 Circular explains that the CBOE's Rules do not prohibit the ``legging'' of multi-part orders as long as the executing floor broker remains in compliance with the CBOE's rules concerning the use of due diligence in the execution of customer orders and the separation of market maker and floor broker functions. The 1993 Circular expands upon the treatment of this subject by setting forth specific procedures that are to be followed when a floor broker discovers that he is unable to complete the execution of a multi-part order. 4 4 Specifically, the 1993 Circular states that if a floor broker determines that he is unable to complete an order he has legged he must either: (1) Offer the executed leg to the customer; (2) liquidate the leg in open outcry and then offer the trade, regardless of whether it is a profit or loss, to the customer; or (3) execute the remaining leg(s) of the order at the available market in open outcry and give the customer a difference check. In addition, the 1993 Circular notes that a floor broker may not provide an execution on the unexecuted portion of the order from his error account; by doing so he is acting as a market maker. The 1993 Circular also provides guidance to floor brokers with respect to subjects that were not covered in the 1986 Circular. These subjects include the priority of customer orders in a floor broker's ``deck,'' the ``stopping'' of customer orders, and trading in securities underlying options traded by a floor broker. Specifically, with regard to a floor broker's ``deck,'' the 1993 Circular states that under Exchange Rule 6.73, a floor broker's agency business takes priority over trades for his error account and that a floor broker must determine the priority of agency orders entered simultaneously with him. The 1993 Circular also states that a floor broker must use due diligence to execute those orders at the best available price or prices. With regard to the ``stopping'' of customer orders, the 1993 Circular states that it is improper for a floor broker to ``stop'' or guarantee an execution to a customer order he is holding from his error account or deck because by doing so he is acting as a market maker and is in violation of CBOE Rule 8.8. The 1993 Circular notes that it is not a violation of CBOE Rule 8.8 for a floor broker to cross a public customer order with a facilitation order in accordance with the provisions of CBOE Rule 6.74(b), ```Crossing' Orders.''
