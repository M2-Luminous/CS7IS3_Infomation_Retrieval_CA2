[Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi and Fininvest are issuing a sharp response to the rumors of links between the Arcore [Berlusconi's residence] group and Mafia business. Organized crime has murdered a priest who spoke out against the Camorra. The war of opposing manipulations of the many inquiries opened by the judiciary is increasing exponentially. This does not seem like the best climate for the birth of the long awaited "Second Republic." Particularly in commentaries in the major newspapers, there is an extraordinary turn against the possibility of a "bipolarization" of the political system, so enthusiastically supported throughout the referendum campaign. There is a nostalgic turning of attention back to the "center," but it is difficult to observe for long the group comprising Zanone [leader of the Italian Liberal Party, PLI], Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI], and La Malfa [leader of the Italian Republican Party, PRI]. We discussed all this with Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] during a pause in his two day visit to Bologna, before his television debate with Berlusconi, to be broadcast this evening on Channel 5. His remarks -- on the eve of an election that will in any case be historic -- were connected by a thread: the voice of political reason must be allowed to speak once more, but it must be a truly new politics. [Leiss] Are we about to witness a violent "reckoning?" In connection with the alleged relations between the Mafia and Fininvest. Berlusconi denies having reported a "bloodless coup." But he and Fedele Confalonieri, the group's chairman, are talking in terms of crazy accusations, a campaign of lies, some kind of conspiracy. [Occhetto] I do not know who Berlusconi is referring to when he talks about a conspiracy in connection with relations between the Mafia and his group. What I can say is that he certainly cannot be referring to us. In the frank and open broadcast telephone discussion that I had with him -- which he himself acknowledged was a civilized one -- I did not question the judiciary's activities, unlike what his friend, Craxi [former Italian Socialist Party secretary], is doing. I am simply proceeding from an undeniable fact -- the statement by Mafia boss Piromalli, in support of Forza Italia. So there is nothing hidden and no "campaign." After all, I also gave him a chance to say right away, I reject that. It is not my fault that he hesitated, even though the broadcast lasted an hour. [Leiss] But he did say in Palermo: Forza Italia's votes are directed against the Mafia. Is that not enough? [Occhetto] I certainly do not want to criminalize all the votes that Forza Italia receives. However, that statement is too general. Unless it is corroborated by explicit statements about government options and measures to really counter the Mafia, some scope for ambiguity still remains. [Leiss] The controversy over the role of the judiciary has been revived, too. The rumors about charges of Fininvest's association with the Mafia started right on cue, the moment Berlusconi arrived in Palermo. For that matter, the PDS has not been spared in this election campaign, either: Stefanini's custody pending trial, Vincenzo Visco's subpoena to appear as a witness in the Cusani trial.... [Occhetto] If there is any timing that prompts suspicions, the things you mentioned show that it does not affect only one side. I would like to add that the matters relating to us are connected with events that will certainly be clarified -- at the investigation stage, I believe. [Leiss] But has there not been some overprotectiveness on the part of the Left? This is the charge leveled by some radicals who opted to side with the Right. Writing in CORRIERE DELLA SERA, Angelo Panebianco said that the judiciary wields too much power at present. [Occhetto] If the judiciary seems so strong now, it is because the balance has been upset on the political side, as I have said many times. The political authorities have shown themselves to be greatly compromised. Not only that, but they have responded to the inquiries in the worst possible way -- I am thinking here about Craxi and also about the arrogant behavior of some businessmen. They thought that they could still exploit their power to halt a process which was in fact unstoppable. And they have created a disaster, causing two results -- a profound delegitimization and destabilization of politics and excessive attention on the judiciary. Only the restoration of the authority of politics can restore the disrupted balance. As for us, I remain convinced that we were right to support the anticorruption investigations. This, because it brought to light the indefensible reality of Bribe City. The judiciary's work has been crucial and useful, though some judges may have made some mistakes and some initiatives may have been taken that are open to criticism with regard to the aspect of guarantees and form. [Leiss] Certain mistakes could be irreversible a few days away from the elections.... [Occhetto] The judges cannot suspend their inquiries every time there is an election. Of course, I hope that in such a delicate situation for the country they will be able to distinguish between actions, however legitimate, that could acquire a propaganda flavor, albeit involuntarily, and actions indispensable for the consistent pursuit of their inquiries. [Leiss] One final question on this delicate topic. People are talking again -- Judge Davigo, among others, has done so -- about the need for a political solution to Bribe City. Is this not a crucial element in a government program? [Occhetto] The only real solution is the establishment of a new leadership class, an authoritative political system. We are opposed to a "whitewash." The new government must provide all the instruments and resources that the judiciary needs to ensure that trials are held promptly and that clear sentences put an end to this very sad chapter in our history. [Leiss] Among the imbalances among the authorities that you mentioned, is there not also that caused by the entry into the arena of a big businessman owning half Italy's media organs, who also has his sights set on the prime ministership? [Occhetto] Undoubtedly. Berlusconi complains that he is under attack from lobbies of rivals. But how was it possible not to predict that there would be a reaction on the part of those who can see a major competitor, who is also a great communicator, in the race to gain political power, too? This power would enable him to appoint directors to both public and private television networks, to back legislation that benefits his own vested interests. So much for liberal democracy! It is enough to make [French philosopher] Montesquieu, whose principle was the separation of authorities, turn in his tomb. [Leiss] Many people now attribute this confusion to the illusion of a "bipolar" system. The sharp rivalry between Right and Left is a bad thing. The law resulting from the referendums is a bad one, and people are turning their attention back to the center. [Occhetto] The law is not a good one, and it is the result of a miscalculation. Those who promoted it -- certainly not we, who fought for a two-round system -- thought that the PDS would not succeed in forming a broad alliance. Instead, despite attempts to exclude Rete and Communist Renewal, we have achieved a historic innovation -- the alliance of progressive forces. Now people are trying to make the voters believe that it is impossible for one alignment to be victorious over the other. But it is possible. Difficult, but possible. [Leiss] However, political strategies seem to be focused on the assumption that this will not happen. Martinazzoli and Amato [Pact for Italy] are dreaming of a coalition government comprising the PDS, the PPI, and perhaps the League, excluding the "extremes." At his rallies Bossi devotes five minutes to criticizing Occhetto and 40 minutes to insulting Berlusconi.... [Occhetto] That seems to me a correct and fair proportion.... [Leiss] What about the suggestions emanating from the center? [Occhetto] In reply I will cite what Pietro Scoppola and other democratic Catholics have said. I am opposed to anything that would suspend the process toward a system of rotation, however much it may be hindered and obstructed by the mechanisms of this electoral law. We must behave clearly within this new rationale, law or no law. What if none of the three alignments wins? Well, that situation too, if it comes about, must be subordinated to the objective of a bipolar system, rejecting the temptation to lapse back into the old mentality of alliances. [Leiss] But how? [Occhetto] By talking about policies, not alignments. Even within the Popular Party and the "Pact," I remain convinced that there is a great difference between the motivations of Segni [Pact for Italy leader] and Rosy Bindi [PPI Venice regional secretary]. The idea that the center could exploit a possible stalemate by winning over part of the Right and part of the Left is a new version of the DC's [Christian Democratic Party] old "governability" theory. It is disheartening: Why was it necessary to hold the referendums and to introduce a first-past-the-post system just to achieve this? A continuing process of decomposition and recomposition, conducted on the basis of policies, would be another matter. With regard to matters of substance, there are two poles of attraction, the Right and the Left, which must demonstrate their ability to attract the center. [Leiss] Is this the same idea as the final destruction of the center? [Occhetto] I am not talking about destruction. I do not want to encourage the "wrecking" of this political area. What I am saying is that the further disintegration of the center seems to me to be an inevitable process. I know that a proper exchange of views on policies will require absolute honesty among the progressive forces, too, but this will be an obligation for the others, too. Including the right-wing forces. Only thus, if we want to continue the renewal, can we consistently fulfil the citizens' wishes as expressed through their votes, if they do not adequately identify a government majority. But I stress: We must now work for the victory of a progressive majority. [Leiss] Do you rule out an agreement on matters of policy with the League? For instance, on the subject of federalism? [Occhetto] Frankly, I do not see on the basis of what policies such an agreement could be built. Its shameful criticism of the concept of solidarity, especially of solidarity between the north and south of the country, is too great a negative factor for us. This, partly because it symbolizes a whole vision of society. What kind of credibility could such an alliance enjoy? If the League were really able to free its federalist aspirations from their demagogic and separatist encumbrances, then cooperation could prove possible in this field in parliament. [Leiss] The election campaign is reaching its conclusion. What aspect of it has struck you most forcibly? [Occhetto] I would say, the international attention on us. The other evening in Naples, in that festive atmosphere, I thought that because of the television news strike, I would not be surrounded by television cameras, as usual. In fact all the world's major television stations were there, starting with CNN. I answered dozens of questions, which confidently took for granted our victory, a government role for us. Nobody now, except Berlusconi, is brandishing the bugaboo of "communism" any more. And I was struck by something that Michel Rocard [French Socialist Party secretary general] said in Genoa: "The whole of Europe is watching you, and it would be crazy if there were a victory for an unnatural government comprising the DC right, the separatists of the League, and the neofascists of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]." Is the fact that at our rallies so much support has been shown for such people as Rocard, Glotz, and the European group leader, Jean-Pierre Cot, not a sign that the Italian Left really has embarked on a new chapter of its history, no longer marked by the split between communists and socialists? [Leiss] The main event in this election campaign seems to be the television debate between Occhetto and Berlusconi. Marcello Flores has suggested that in the republic's new phase political leaders appear on television no more than once every three months. Do you agree with that? [Occhetto] There is indeed something wrong in the relationship between politics and television. I am not convinced by the rules dictated by the watchdog committee. After all, the forum of the political platform through which a political leader can be questioned, calmly but closely, by well-informed journalists is not so bad. In the discussions involving several people, which are now the fashion, things are not always clear. Facile quips prevail amid an atmosphere rather more suited to a football match. It is exciting for the fans of each side, but perhaps there is a broader public that does not understand much of it and does not find it exciting. Furthermore, the rivalry between the networks and the superimposition of so many platforms has caused a kind of tower of Babel. Flores' remark was excessive, a provocation. But it is a move in the right direction. The direction of rules, quality, selection. Not a television free-for-all. [Leiss] Even some of Fininvest's television presenters have entered the arena.... [Occhetto] That seems to me dangerous and unprecedented. In such instances there should be prompt and strict action by the monitoring authorities. [Leiss] Are you worried about your "match" with Berlusconi? [Occhetto] I read that he would have preferred to meet with [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, because he likes me as a person. What is he doing -- counterattacking by flattering me? He might succeed....
