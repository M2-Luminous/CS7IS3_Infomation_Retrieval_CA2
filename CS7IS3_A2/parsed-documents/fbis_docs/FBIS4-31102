Hopes are that the new institutions will provide depositors with loans at less than 10-percent interest. The head of the housing policy department of the Finance Ministry, Pal Cseh, told NEPSZABADSAG that 15 years ago, when youth savings accounts were introduced as a form of savings for a purpose, they were patterned on Western building and loan associations. By now it is possible to establish such institutions in Hungary as well. However, to be able to do so, the law on financial institutions must be amended. Banking experts have already developed concrete ideas. According to Pal Cseh, the bill can be submitted to parliament as early as this year. The building and loan associations will be specialized financial institutions with special regulations on the management of depositors' money and on who, when, and after how many years of saving credit can be granted. In this type of financial institution the participants finance each other, Pal Cseh emphasized. In other words, the depositors get low interest on their savings, but the conditions of the loans are also formulated accordingly. In the department head's opinion, the ideal would be if the interests on housing loans did not reach 10 percent. However, he said, it is not the task of the law to determine that. Any bank already operating in Hungary will be allowed to establish building and loan associations but--as Pal Cseh pointed out--both the operation of these institutions and the regulations concerning them are very complicated, and therefore it will be beneficial to choose an experienced Western partner for their establishment.
