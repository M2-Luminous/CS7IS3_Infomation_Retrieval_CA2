FBIS4-37198 "drnes118yy_94004" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Interim Israel-Lebanon Deal Said Drafted Interim Israel-Lebanon Deal Said Drafted TA1906112294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 19 Jun 94 pp A1, A10 TA1906112294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Aluf Ben and Eytan Rabin] [Excerpt] Government elements have recently started drafting a detailed offer for an interim arrangement with Lebanon. The arrangement aims at attaining calm on the northern border, pulling the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] out of the security zone, and establishing security arrangements as a first stage toward signing a peace arrangement and normalizing the relations with Lebanon. The offered arrangement will be based on the principles Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has set for the negotiations with Lebanon. Israel will demand that the military capability of Hizballah and other rejectionist fronts operating against it from Lebanon be disassembled; that the Lebanese Army be deployed in south Lebanon; and that its ability to impose order be tested over a period of six months, after which the IDF will withdraw from Lebanese territory. Security and coordination arrangements between the IDF and the Lebanese Army will also be introduced. Israel will also demand that Lebanon make a commitment to maintain the well-being of SLA [South Lebanese Army] men and other Lebanese who collaborated with Israel. The offer formalized at this time includes an outline of the security arrangements that will prevail along the border and of the apparatuses that will supervise the agreement. Apparently, a UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] unit will remain in the area. Senior Israeli officials have said that making an interim agreement with Lebanon will only be possible if progress is made in the negotiations with Syria. Lebanon has rejected an Israeli offer to launch security talks at the level of army officers because Syria was opposed. Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States and head of the delegation for talks with Syria, arrived in Israel over the weekend for his daughter's wedding. Last night he met with the prime minister and briefed him on the progress of the talks with Syria. Discreet negotiations were held over the past several weeks between Rabinovich and the Syrian Ambassador in Washington Walid al-Mu'allim. Dennis Ross, head of the U.S. peace team, mediated by meeting each of the ambassadors separately. In the past, Rabinovich and al-Mu'allim held a series of secret meeting, but Israeli sources claim that they have not met for several weeks and only held indirect talks through the Americans. A member of the U.S. peace team last week told WASHINGTON JEWISH WEEK that, despite the negative statements from Jerusalem and Damascus, constant progress is being made in the secret channel between them, and that it is possible that a joint declaration of principles toward peace will be signed by the end of this year. Israeli officials confirmed the remarks, but said that the talks make "positive but insufficient progress." Rabinovich and al-Mu'allim are trying to bridge the gaps between the Israeli and Syrian stands and prepare for a visit here by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but have not yet begun dealing with a detailed draft of a declaration of principles. Israeli sources said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has not allowed al-Mu'allim to make much progress. According to them, the progress on the Jordanian track made the Syrians very angry and, over the past two weeks, they prevented progress. [passage omitted]
