Fujimori held a news conference at the end of his two-day visit to Colombia and said this case "must be fully investigated," adding he does not endorse debates on what he called "form" issues, for example, the controversy unleashed in his country due to the case being turned over to military jurisdiction. The president explained Congress issued a law (that allowed a changing of the venue from a civilian court to a military court) which "must be respected." He added the case, considered one of the most critical human rights violations in Peru, must be investigated to locate the culprits. The disappearance of a university professor and nine students occurred in mid-1992, when unidentified individuals, presumably military, kidnapped the victims. According to journalists' investigations, the 10 were tortured and buried in a common grave.
