Speaking at a seminar on the national economic situation in Jakarta, Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for economy, finance, and development supervision, warned that when the foreign debt exceeds this level, it will have a psychological impact in the form of decreasing confidence by donor nations in giving additional loans to Indonesia. According to the minister, the government has set a ceiling for commercial loans. The private sector is expected to manage their loans in accordance with the government ceiling, set in 1991. The ceiling is about 10 trillion rupiah for five years. Because the level of soft loans and export credits is still within normal limits, the government is optimistic that it can continue to meet its debt servicing obligations on time.
