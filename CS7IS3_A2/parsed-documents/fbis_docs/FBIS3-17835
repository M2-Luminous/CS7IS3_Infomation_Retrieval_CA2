He added that the special regime will be introduced for the whole of Pakri Peninsula. First there will be the familiar system of permits, but when the reactor's lid is lifted, so to speak, the peninsula will be closed completely. The special regime will be abolished after the nuclear fuel has been removed -- by the end of June or beginning of July. The Russian side will not allow anyone close [words indistinct] because several devices on site are alleged to be secret, and thus will be assuming total responsibility. Later, during the second stage of the removal process, the Russian military are willing to allow both Estonian and international observers to witness the dismantling process. [passage omitted]
