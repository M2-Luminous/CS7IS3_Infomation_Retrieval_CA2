The arrival of this important official should be viewed in a much more important context. It is clear that Mr. Watson came not only to give his blessing to Mr. Maisto's mission, but also to explain directly to the local protagonists how his country's foreign policy is to be applied in Nicaragua, which is perceived to be going through a transition that is difficult to understand and is also stalled. But what are the parameters of the United States' overall strategy, as far as this tiny country is concerned? In this regard, Clinton's foreign policy has three objectives: 1) maintaining the United States's current status as sole superpower, 2) defending democracy and the free market, and 3) preventing secondary conflicts in sensitive areas that would not be of any benefit to the United States. Nicaragua's case would fall into the latter two premises. It is reasonable for Mr. Watson to think that the Nicaraguan Government is in a precarious balance. From that point of view, Mrs. Chamorro appears to be an isolated hostage who is sending an ambiguous message, in contrast to the powerful military-social apparatus of the Sandinists who are surrounding her. Lacking her own political force, the president is sometimes seen to be too timid to make reforms, fearful of losing power, while at other times she appears to be a clever collaborator in the government coalition recommended by her prime minister and relative. In this regard, Mr. Watson must have been tempted to resolve this uncomfortable dilemma and, incidentally, to warn his interlocutors that time is running short for Nicaragua. Her other sisters are already organized, and foreign aid funding is shrinking irretrievably. But how could he give advice without appearing to intervene, without contradicting the notion that we should solve our problems internally? And how could he remain silent, allowing the ungovernability and inefficiency to continue in Nicaragua and to threaten to spread throughout the region? What he did not do was combine two recipes: assuring Dona Violeta that she will remain in place while pointing out to her that there are three objectives of the United States' overall strategy that have particularly critical ramifications in Nicaragua: respect for private property, returning or purchasing it as soon as possible; punishment for human rights violators; and subjecting the military apparatus to civilian control. Nonetheless, the visitor must have realized that as long as there are radical and influential Sandinist leaders who refuse to cooperate in stabilizing the country out of fear that they will be seen as pawns of the regional power, the problem will remain unsolved.... Nor will it be solved if officials continue to delay passage of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces, which would provide for the reform of a military hierarchy that is excessively politicized. To remove these obstacles, the democratic reforms of the Sandinist movement, proposed by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, are naturally viewed favorably. It is also logical to insist that the Organic Law of the Armed Forces be put in place as soon as possible so that the military can come under civilian control. In light of the vested interests, however, there is not much likelihood that the desire to blast Nicaragua out of its stagnation will be realized. The vicious circle can be broken only if the president implements a national political program that includes the democratic forces that brought her to power. That would allow her to effect the reforms the country is demanding and to jump start the economy. Watson's visit, not being subliminal, was meaningless.
