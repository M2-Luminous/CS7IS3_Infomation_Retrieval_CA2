But if war is unavoidable, North Korea will not be another Iraq, which suffered an ignominious defeat in the Gulf war, the official declared in an exclusive interview with YONHAP news agency. North Korea has been patiently awaiting a resolution of the nuclear issue, but "since our existence depends on it, we will resolutely face the problem, unafraid," the official said on condition of anonymity. Obviously aware of a move by the United States to refer the nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council for economic sanctions, the official said North Korea "has managed to go on living without help from the United States, Japan and Russia." "They all have to know that even a worm, if stepped on, wriggles," he said, by way of warning that North Korea would not submit meekly to military provocation. The official, however, made no negative comments on China, backing up past speculation that Pyongyang has been in close consultation with Beijing on the nuclear issue. Asked about the possibility of contact between the United States and North Korea prior to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21, he said he knew nothing about it.
