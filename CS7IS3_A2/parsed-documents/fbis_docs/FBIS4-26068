According to a plan mapped out by the regional government, Tibet has classified itself into the central, north, east and west parts, according to the areas' economic structure. The 18 counties in the central part of the region have been designated as the bread-basket of the autonomous region. A comprehensive agricultural development program is now being initiated in the areas, with two billion yuan from the central government. The project has already produced an extra 10 million kg of grain, over one million kg of vegetables and another 1.6 million kg of meat. A group of manufacturing and processing enterprises has shot up in the area, as energy and communications facilities have been greatly improved, making it a major production center of commodity grain, vegetables and foodstuffs, textiles and light industry. The northern part of Tibet has been listed as a center for animal husbandry. About 60 million yuan has been invested in Nagqu alone to build livestock-raising facilities and provide local herdsmen with shelters to settle down. The move has added an average 250 yuan per capita per year for the local herdsmen. The development of forestry products will be emphasized in Nyingchi and Qamdo. In the region's west and south, focus will be on an export-oriented economy, as the area shares 3,800 km of borders with neighboring countries.
