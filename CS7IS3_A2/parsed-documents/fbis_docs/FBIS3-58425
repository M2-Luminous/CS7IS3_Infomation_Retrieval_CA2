The prime minister will go to the Quirinale [presidency of the republic] tomorrow morning, and most probably, the head of state will dissolve the chambers after a very brief round of talks. We shall go to the polls in little more than two months. [passage omitted] Let us start with this report from the Chamber of Deputies: [Begin Ciampi recording] [passage omitted] This government cannot be linked to any of the groupings that are emerging in this changing political landscape. That applies first and foremost to me personally. This is a natural passage, which we had forecast; it is not an abrupt change. The path is a difficult one but it is clearly traced. Some things have become irreversible. [end recording] [Correspondent Francesco Pionati] This was Ciampi's statement. After his speech, the situation changed very much. There are two important new facts. First, the Socialist group clearly split in two. Some people say that it is a real division. The majority of Socialist deputies, including Craxi, elected a new parliamentary leader, Franco Piro. However, this election was not accepted by Ottaviano Del Turco. For the secretary of the Socialist Party the leader of the parliamentary group is still Nicola Capria. The division was caused by political reasons. On one side are those who want the legislature to continue and who look to the Center: this is the group that elected Piro. On the other side are those who look to the Left. They want this legislature to end right now: this is the group supporting Capria. The second important fact of the day was sparked by the Socialist split. The parties of the coalition in power prepared and presented a majority motion in which they confirmed their confidence in the government and in which they asked that some particularly urgent bills be approved. If this motion is approved, it will clearly be more difficult for Scalfaro to dissolve the chambers. As everyone can understand, the situation is tense and quite confused. The debate itself was full of contradictions. Some -- like the Christian Democrats -- want the legislature to continue. Some others -- the Democratic Party of the Left and the Northern League -- want the immediate end of the legislature. As for Pannella, he alone called for a new government to be formed. [passage omitted] Let us now listen to the reactions of the main political leaders, starting with their comments on the majority motion: [Sacco] This is the document motion you presented. You want to give a confidence vote to Ciampi. What do you want and who signed the motion? [Ferri] We Social Democrats signed it, but also the Christian Democrats with Gerardo Bianco, leader of the Christian Democratic parliamentary group, and Savino Melillo, leader of the Liberal group. We are waiting for the signature of the Socialists. The new leader, Piro, agreed with us on the main points. However, he will hold a meeting of his group, which is the right thing to do. There are also some members of the Republican Party. [Sacco] What does that document say? [Ferri] It says, first of all, that the government has created the conditions to continue his political and institutional work on some crucial points, as the vote of Italians abroad and the electoral reform for the European elections. [Correspondent] Mr. Bianco, the Christian Democrats say that the Ciampi government could and should carry on, but until when? [Bianco] I repeat that we think that the most logical thing to do is to vote in June at the same time as the Europan elections, and I think that other political forces agree with us. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] There are rumors that there will also be a confidence motion presented by some or by all groups of the majority coalition. [Bianco] Many colleagues already withdrew their signatures from Pannella's no-confidence motion, which somehow prompted this debate. [Bossi] No, not the League. The League wants elections. All this is not wise at all. The Christian Democrats are buying time. They hope that some miracle may save them, that the elections may be avoided. [Fini] Ciampi was honest. I hope he goes to see the president to resign and that the president of the republic allows Ciampi -- after his resignation but still in charge of the government for the ordinary administration -- to lead Italy to elections as soon as possible. [Correspondent] Do you think that the prime minister will resign or not? [Occhetto] I think -- having listened to his speech, in which he quite rightly focused on the real problem, not the relation between parliament and the government, as Pannella thinks, but the relation between parliament and the country -- that in fact he has called for the end of this legislature. He put himself above parties, the government can guarantee a safe and peaceful passage to a new era in the life of the country. This can be done only if he goes immediately to see the president of the republic, if conclusions are reached and if elections are called. [Studio Announcer Frajese] What will happen tomorrow? What is the institutional procedure? Fabrizio Ferragni reports from the Quirinale: [Ferragni] The next moves are now clearer, even though nothing is certain. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will probably come here to the Quirinale late tomorrow morning to inform Scalfaro about what happened. He will also put his mandate at the disposal of Scalfaro. The day after, 14 January, the president of the republic may hold talks separately with Giovanni Spadolini, speaker of the Senate, and with Giorgio Napolitano, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. This is what Article 88 of the Constitution, which deals with the dissolving of the chambers, says. After a pause on 15 January, the head of state may sign the decree dissolving the chambers. The cabinet would then have to decide on the date of the elections. It is almost certain that they will be held on Sunday, 27 March. [passage omitted]
