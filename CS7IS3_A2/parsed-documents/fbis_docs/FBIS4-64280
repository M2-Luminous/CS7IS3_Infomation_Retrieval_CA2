In a communique summarizing the report (150 pages sent to the public prosecutor in Marseilles), the Defense Ministry reconstructed the accident which occurred during maneuvers off Toulon. According to this version of events, the submarine was submerged at 190 meters. Between two training phases, the commander (who was among the victims) carried out a "section inspection" in the turbo-alternator compartment that "had been planned several weeks earlier to be done on that day." At 10:35, 12 men were in the compartment when "a leak occurred in the sea water refrigeration collector." This leak was not, therefore, in the external hull but in an internal pipe. The "energy" officer left the compartment to return to the central navigation station, while emergency maneuvers were made to resurface the vessel in 100 seconds: Power was upped to increase speed, the sea water circuits were closed to prevent flooding, and the ballast tanks were emptied to accelerate resurfacing. It was probably this combination of operations that led to "overpressure in one of the condensers," and then the "breaking of a clack plug, causing steam to pour into the compartment." Ten submariners were killed instantly by barotraumatism causing their eardrums and lungs to explode. One man managed to survive by taking refuge in the forward section of the compartment. The communique added: "The commission of inquiry found no evidence of human error attributable to the crew members at the time of the accident." Our sources tell us that a mechanic, responsible for closing two outlets to stop the steam escaping when the ascent was started, only had time to close one of them before he was killed. The Defense Ministry authorized the six SNAs that had been recalled for checks to once again take to the sea, instructing the "immediate closure of the steam circuits in the event of a water leak." However, it appears difficult to implement steam shutdown when a water leak appears, since it is necessary for rapid resurfacing.
