Many people, including the president, if one can judge by his statements, will long remember the tragic end of the former Supreme Soviet, although there deservedly should be no pardon for its leaders, whose unlimited personal ambitions and insatiable hunger for power almost threw the country into civil war. In this connection, it is no surprise that people awaited the president's first appearance in front of the new parliament with impatience. This interest was heightened by the president's 8 January reversal of his original decision to hold a joint session of the Federal Assembly's two chambers and to speak only to the deputies of the upper chamber, the Federation Council. This decision was obviously based on the guidelines contained in the new constitution. Yeltsin stated his position on the proper relationship between the two branches of power fairly clearly. After a reminder of the tremendous efforts required to maintain peace in the country last year, the president stressed that, "it is very important that the members of the Federation Council and the State Duma put the Russian parliament on a constructive path, so that cooperation becomes the most important aspect in relations between the executive and legislative branches." Undoubtedly, the Federal Assembly is beginning its work in a very difficult period when the Russian state is really just being founded. However, the first popularly approved constitution in Russian history has given the country a realistic chance to form its ruling structures calmly and effectively. One could say that Russia has finally agreed on the rules of the game, which must be observed by all the political forces. Now Russia needs more than anything else to preserve that spirit of agreement and calmness, which will prevent a dictatorship from ever returning. With this in mind, the president appealed to the deputies to "help the social and political forces agree on the most important thing, to fully and categorically exclude the use of force from the country's political arena." Of course, the president and the parliamentarians can disagree with each other, argue, and insist on their own opinion, but all political problems can and must be solved in a legal way. "Despite the variety of parties in the parliament, there is a principled basis for their joint constructive work," Yeltsin declared. The same thought was voiced by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was simultaneously addressing the deputies of the State Duma. However, the parliament's first day of work, especially in the lower chamber, did not radiate optimism. After spending a lot of time debating procedural questions, the Duma deputies never did get to any important matters. But the alarming thing is that the democratic forces have not yet managed to take control of the situation, while the part of the opposition represented by the Liberal Democratic Party and its ecstatic leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy behaved, to put it mildly, provocatively. It looks like the apprehensions voiced by Presidential Press spokesman Vladislav Kostikov on the eve of the parliament's debute may be true. He said that "a confrontational spirit might dominate" the Federal Assembly. Of course, it is too early to draw conclusions. Moreover, the president has enough constitutional powers to prevent opposition forces from using their full strength. No matter how contradictory the 12 December elections were, Russia has to live with the new parliament for two years. The parliamentarians have been provided with all the necessary conditions to earn themselves a worthy place in the country's history. They have the sad experience of their predecessors, the executive branch's good will and readiness to cooperate, and the trust of their electors. Now the ball is in the parliament's court.
