Additional "severe cuts," particularly in the sphere of personnel and material, had become necessary, sources from the Defense Ministry in Bonn said yesterday. The DM150 million that should have been spent on arms and equipment and has now been canceled, also affect the "Midas" project, which has been regarded as important by the Navy. Midas is a radar-controlled automatic gun for boats and ships for the defense against so-called seaskimmers, that is to say, missiles that attack a few meters above sea level. A total of DM40 million had been earmarked for the development of Midas in 1994. The cuts hit the Mauser company in Oberndorf/Neckar out of the blue. It had itself invested as much as DM40 million into developments. Within one year the weapons system could have been ready to go into production, company sources said. Between the Bundeswehr and Mauser there is a development contract for Midas, which had been orally confirmed by the responsible state authorities last summer. The company has stated that, as a result of the recent Bonn decision to impose further cuts, which is also putting the "Bundeswehr Plan 95" out of force, the "contract is in the air." The "Midas case" is only one of a whole series that highlight the Bonn coalition's "entire dilemma of making cuts without a concept" in the sphere of the Bundeswehr, representatives of the business community said. According to experts, the automatic gun is one of the top products of German armament technology. By cutting the funds for development, Mauser is losing its "system ability" in this sector. The company of Oberndorf, which belongs to the Diehl group of Nuremberg, and has reduced its personnel of 1,500 in the past few years by half, can no longer keep experienced engineers and technicians. "Not only Midas shows that this is a dangerous spiral," one industrial expert emphasized: "The Bundeswehr no longer finances innovation, but puts the little money it has only into the maintenance of aging arms and equipment until everything comes to a halt. And then?" The industry is losing is national and international ability for cooperation in the sphere of armament technology. The expert warned that at one point it will no longer be able to procure weapons for the German Armed Forces at home.
