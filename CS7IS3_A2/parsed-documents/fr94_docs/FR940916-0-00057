FR940916-0-00057 FR940916-0-00016 Section 298.42‚ê£Reporting Requirements_Financial Statements Several shipyards have suggested that since they are wholly owned subsidiaries and are included in the general audit of the parent corporation, MARAD should accept such audits because independent audits could be too costly to conduct for the shipyards. MARAD Response: The regulation already preserves the discretion of MARAD to allow the submission of consolidated audits in an appropriate case and no amendment of the regulation is necessary to accommodate the commenter's request. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Other Requirements of Law This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866, and it has been determined that it is a significant regulatory action since it is likely to result in a rule that may have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. It has also been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. Final Regulatory Assessments have been prepared and are available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. In summary, the Final Regulatory Assessments finds that the cost of the Title XI program over the first two years is $144 million, resulting in an average annual cost of $72.0 million. Assuming that there is demand for maximum guarantees and guarantees will range from 70 percent to 871/2 percent of actual cost of the vessel and shipyard modernization and improvement projects, the value of the vessels, capital goods and other assets produced over the first two years of the program will be about $1.85 billion. Further, it is estimated that new Title XI guarantees could generate 19,440 worker years of employment for U.S. shipyard workers, which translates into employment for 9,720 workers over a period of two years. This rulemaking document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' Federalism MARAD has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that these regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act MARAD certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Environmental Assessment MARAD has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
