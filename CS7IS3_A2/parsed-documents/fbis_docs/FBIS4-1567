Committee members maintained: It is necessary to offer explanations to dispel doubts currently harbored by public servants. Public servants in Hong Kong are encouraged to keep relaying their problems to the committee. As usual, the task force will pay close attention to their problems. The following are answers offered by the PWC's task force in charge of government affairs on several issues of concern to Hong Kong's public servants: [Question] Will Hong Kong's public servants be "completely replaced" in 1997? [Answer] No. Article 10 of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law explicitly states: Public servants serving in all Hong Kong government departments, including the police department, before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, may all remain in employment. This means public servants serving under the Hong Kong Government before 1 July 1997 may continue their service with the Hong Kong SAR Government after that date. Hong Kong's current achievements are inextricably linked with a highly qualified pool of public servants and an effective public service system. Members on the task force unanimously and fully affirmed the contributions made by Hong Kong's public servants to stability and prosperity in Hong Kong society. Maintaining the stability and continuity of the ranks of public servants in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is an important aspect of Hong Kong's smooth transition. Committee members sincerely hope that public servants currently serving in all Hong Kong government departments will be able to work without any worries and continue to serve the Hong Kong SAR Government and the Hong Kong people after 1997. [Question] Is there any basis to the statement that "accounts will be settled afterward"? [Answer] No. Public servants working in Hong Kong government departments before 1 July 1997 perform their official duties in accordance with Hong Kong's laws, regardless of what government departments they serve and whether their work is politically sensitive. When they continue their service with the Hong Kong SAR Government after 1 July 1997, they will also perform their official duties in accordance with the law. Moreover, after 1997 the Hong Kong SAR Government will maintain Hong Kong's original system for hiring and disciplining public servants, as well as its special bodies, on which basis it will exercise management over public servants. Therefore, it is simply impossible to "settle accounts afterward," politically or institutionally. [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be accountable to various central people's government departments after 1997? [Answer] The second paragraph of Article 99 of the Basic Law states: Public servants must be dedicated to their duties and be responsible to the Hong Kong SAR Government. This explicitly specifies to whom Hong Kong's public servants must be "accountable" after 1 July 1997. To be sure, the Hong Kong SAR Government, as a local government directly under the central people's government, should be accountable to the latter. This applies only to the Hong Kong SAR Government as a whole. This relationship of accountability will be reflected through the way the chief executive is accountable to the central people's government. Article 43 of the Basic Law provides for this accountability. Article 22 of the Basic Law states: No department of the central people's government and no province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong SAR administers on its own in accordance with this law. Therefore, the question of accountability to various central people's government departments does not exist for the work carried out by departments under the Hong Kong SAR Government. [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be able to retain their posts after 1997? [Answer] Public servants working for the Hong Kong Government on 1 July 1997 will, in general, be able to retain their posts. Principal officials, however, will be nominated by the Chief Executive and referred to the Central People's Government for appointment in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. The appointment and promotion of public servants in the Hong Kong SAR after 1 July 1997 will be on the basis of the qualifications, experience, and ability of public servants themselves in accordance with the provisions of Article 103 of the Basic Law; and will be not different from the current appointment and promotion of public servants in Hong Kong. [Question] Will foreign nationals be allowed to serve in government departments after 1997? [Answer] Certainly. According to the stipulations in Article 101 of the Basic Law, except for principal officials, foreign nationals can be employed by government departments at various levels. However, they must be a permanent resident of Hong Kong, or must already serve in the Hong Kong Government before 1997. [Question] Are public servants in Hong Kong required to speak Mandarin and write in Chinese after 1997? [Answer] Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates: In addition to the Chinese Language, the English Language may also be used by the executive authorities, legislature and judicial organs of the Hong Kong SAR; English is also an official language. Hence, knowledge of Mandarin and Chinese writing is not the prerequisite for serving in the Hong Kong SAR Government; however, it can help promote exchange and communication with various departments in the hintherland. [Question] What are the posts that will be excluded from foreign nationals or people with right of residence in foreign countries after 1997? [Answer] Very few posts will be excluded from foreign nationals or people with right of residence in foreign countries after 1997. According to the provisions of Articles 60 and 101 of the Basic Law, they are secretary and deputy secretaries of the Department of Administration, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Justice; directors of bureaus; the commissioner against corruption; the director of audit; the commissioner of police; the commissioner of immigration; and the inspector general of customs and excise. Also, chief justices of the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court will also be excluded from foreign nationals or people with right of residence in foreign countries. [Question] Will Hong Kong's existing system of recruitment, employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for public service be maintained after 1997? [Answer] Article 103 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates that Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment, employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for public service, shall be maintained, except for any provisions for privileged treatment of foreign nationals. [Question] Will the Public Service Employment Committee's standing committees in charge of public servants' pay and conditions of service continue to exist after 1997? [Answer] According to the provisions of Article 103 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment, employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for the public service, including special bodies for their appointment, pay, and conditions of serivce, shall be maintained, except for any provisions for privileged treatment of foreign nationals. Therefore, the Public Service Employment Committee and special bodies for pay and conditions of service of public servants -- including the standing committee for chief executives' pay and conditions of service, the standing committee for judicial personnel' pay and conditions of service, and the standing committee for public servants' pay and conditions of service -- can continue to exist after 1997 to perform their duties related to recruitment, promotion, pay, and conditions of service of public servants. [Question] Will the salaries, allowances, benefits, and conditions of service for Hong Kong's public servants be less favorable after 1997? [Answer] No. Article 100 of the Basic Law explicitly states that public servants serving in all Hong Kong Government departments before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR may retain their seniority, with pay, allowances, benefits, and conditions of service no less favorable than before, if they remain in employment. Article 102 states that the Hong Kong SAR Government will pay to public servants who retire or leave the service in compliance with regulations (including those who have retired or left the service in compliance with regulations before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR), or to their dependents, all pensions, gratuities, allowances, and benefits due them on terms no less favorable than before. [Question] Does the task force in charge of government affairs actively support the creation of a long-term wage fund for public servants? [Answer] Article 102 of the Basic Law explicitly addresses the benefits for public servants who retire or leave service in compliance with regulations: that is, the SAR Government will pay them or their dependents all pensions, gratuities, allowances, and benefits due them on terms no less favorable than before. Retirement pensions for public servants after 1997 are evidently guaranteed by law. Judging by Hong Kong's current financial status and economic prospects, there should be no problem paying retirement pensions to public servants in the future. Committee members understand that Hong Kong's public servants are concerned and worried about their retirement pensions. They support the demand for creating a long-term wage fund for public servants. It is hoped that the British Hong Kong Government will take active and practical measures in this regard. [Question] How will you treat public servants who have gained resident rights in Britain under the "Plan for Granting Resident Rights in Britain?" [Answer] The Chinese Government's solemn stand against the "Plan for Granting Resident Rights in Britain" is intended to deal with the British Government's intentional violation of the Joint Declaration, as well as its political schemes; it is not targeted at individuals who have "gained resident rights in Britain." Public servants who have gained "resident rights in Britain" may continue their service with the Hong Kong SAR Government after 1997. However, the Chinese Government will not recognize their status as so-called "British citizens." In addition, they will not enjoy Britain's consular protection in the Hong Kong SAR and in other parts of China. Moreover, according to relevant provisions in the Basic Law, they will not be allowed to serve as leading officials in the Hong Kong SAR Government, which is also true of foreign nationals, because they have gained resident rights in a foreign country. [Question] Is it true that the "Chinese Armed Police Force will assume the Hong Kong police's functions after 1997"? [Answer] This statement is groundless. According to relevant provisions in the Basic Law, the SAR Government will be responsible for law and order in the Hong Kong SAR. The Chinese Armed Police Force will not be sent to Hong Kong after 1997.
