Site Visit: A site visit to the Salmon River Hydroelectric Project is planned for April 26, 1994. Those who wish to attend should plan to meet at 8 a.m., at the Bennetts Bridge Powerhouse on County Route 22, Town of Orwell, NY. All participants are responsible for their own transportation. Bring a hard hat. m. Description of Project: The proposed project consists of two developments progressing downstream of the Salmon River: Bennetts Bridge and Lighthouse Hill. The Bennetts Bridge development consists of: (1) an existing dam 607 feet long and 45 feet high; (2) an existing reservoir 6 miles long; (3) an existing 10,000-foot-long conduit system; (4) an existing powerhouse containing four existing turbine-generator units with a total installed capacity of approximately 31,500 kilowatts (Kw); (5) three existing 12-kilovolt (Kv) electric transmission lines; and (6) appurtenant facilities. The Lighthouse Hill development, located approximately 1 mile downstream of the Bennetts Bridge powerhouse, consists of: (1) an existing 382-foot-long concrete gravity dam; (2) an existing 4,300-foot-long reservoir; (3) three existing 17-foot-wide by 8-foot-high by 62-foot-long concrete penstocks; (4) an existing powerhouse containing two existing turbine-generator units with an installed capacity of 8,200 Kw (NIMO proposes to install a 2,150&hyph;Kw (nameplate rating) turbine-generator unit in the empty turbine bay in the Lighthouse Hill powerhouse; (5) an existing 400-footlong, 12&hyph;Kv transmission line; and (6) appurentant facilities. The average annual generation for both developments with the proposed new unit would increase from 108,000,000 to 113,246,000 kilowatthours. The owner of the project facilities is the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. n. This notice also consists of the following standard paragraphs: D10. o.
