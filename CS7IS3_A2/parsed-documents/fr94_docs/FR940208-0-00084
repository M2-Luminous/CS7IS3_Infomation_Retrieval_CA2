FR940208-0-00084 FR940208-0-00031 Human ``predation'' (taking desert tortoises out of their natural populations either by death (accidental or intentional) or by removal) is also a major factor in the decline of the desert tortoise. People illegally collect desert tortoises for pets, food, and commercial trade. Some immigrants to the United States have collected desert tortoises for medicinal or other cultural purposes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Desert tortoises are often struck and killed by vehicles on roads and highways, and mortality of desert tortoises due to gunshot and OHV activities is common in many parts of the Mojave Region, particularly near cities and towns. In the western Mojave Desert of California, 14.3 percent of the carcasses found on 11 permanent study plots showed evidence of gunshot (Sievers et al. 1988). At one plot, 28 percent of the carcasses had evidence of gunshot. Loss of tortoises from vandalism has also been reported in northwestern Arizona. Approximately 10 percent of shell remains from a tortoise study plot near Littlefield, Arizona, had gunshot wounds. OHV use in the desert has increased and proliferated since the 1960s (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). As of 1980, OHV activities affected approximately 25 percent of all desert tortoise habitat in California, as well as substantial portions in southern Nevada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Negative effects range from minor habitat alteration to total denudation of extensive areas. While direct effects are immediate (mortality from crushing, collection, and vandalism), indirect effects can be either immediate (disruption of soil integrity; degradation of annual plants, grasses, and perennial plants; and/or destruction of desert tortoise shelter sites), delayed, and/or cumulative (soil loss due to erosion, soil compaction and its effects on annual and perennial plants, water pollution, and litter and refuse) (Biosystems Analysis 1991). Impacts of roads within desert tortoise habitat extend significantly beyond the tracks that are created. Fewer tortoise signs are found closer to roads, suggesting reduced populations (Nicholson 1978). Thus, well-used OHV areas often result in depressed tortoise populations extending beyond the immediate boundaries of the directly disturbed habitat. The use of OHVs appears to have a significant effect on tortoise abundance and distribution. Although road closures have been implemented in some areas, illegal vehicle route proliferation has also occurred in many areas and can result in a significant cumulative loss of habitat. Human access increases the incidence of tortoise mortality from collecting, gunshot, and crushing by vehicles. Domestic livestock grazing has occurred in desert tortoise habitat since the mid-1800s, with an increase in intensity near the turn of the century to the mid-1930s (Biosystems Analysis 1991). Possible direct impacts from grazing include trampling of both tortoises and shelter sites; possible indirect impacts include loss of plant cover, reduction in number of suitable shelter sites, change in vegetation, compaction of soils, reduced water infiltration, erosion, inhibition of nitrogen fixation in desert plants, and the provision of a favorable seed bed for exotic annual vegetation (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1991, 1993). Habitat destruction and degradation are especially evident in livestock watering, bedding, loading, and unloading areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1991). The degree and nature of impacts from livestock grazing are dependent upon the local ecosystem, grazing history, seasons of use, stocking rates, annual rainfall, and density of the tortoise population. Desert ecosystems require decades to recover from disturbances, and desert tortoise populations are incapable of rapid growth, even under optimum conditions. Desert tortoises, particularly hatchlings and juveniles, are preyed upon by several native species of mammals, reptiles, and birds. Domestic and feral dogs are a new source of mortality. Common raven ( Corvus corax ) populations in the southwestern deserts have increased significantly since the 1940s, presumably in response to expanding human use of the desert. Sewage ponds, landfills (authorized and unauthorized), power lines, roads, and other human uses have increased available foraging, roosting, and nesting opportunities for ravens. Over the last 20 years, raven populations in the western Mojave Desert have increased 1528 percent between 1968 and 1988 (about 15 percent per year) and increased in the Colorado-Sonoran Deserts 474 percent (over 9 percent per year). While not all ravens may include tortoises as significant components of their diets, these birds are highly opportunistic in their feeding patterns and concentrate on easily available seasonal food sources, such as juvenile tortoises. Increased mortality of young desert tortoises (in part due to predation by ravens), combined with drastically lowered survivorship of adults, is likely responsible for observed catastrophic population declines (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).
