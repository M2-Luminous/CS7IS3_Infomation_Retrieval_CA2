The situation of medium-sized industry in the new federal states is still very volatile, particularly in the sectors which face international competition, the BDI said in Cologne on Wednesday [30 March]. Unfortunately there is as yet no question of a marked improvement. The main problems are too high wage costs, inadequate self-generated capital, and the difficulty of opening up markets for sales. Rexrodt said on the same day in Bonn that medium-sized business in the east has successfully established itself and is the main pillar of economic development. At present there are 440,000 self-employed people there, employing some 3 million people. That is almost half the entire number of those employed in eastern Germany. Manual trades, commerce, and services are developing especially dynamically. According to him, only 550,000 jobs are left of the original 2 million in industry. However, one can still not call this deindustrialization, the minister stressed. Core industrial areas have been preserved and there are certainly the beginnings of new enterprise. Rexrodt said this process, described by the BDI on several occasions as decimation, is the necessary and inevitable acclimatization to the demands of the market economy. [passage omitted]
