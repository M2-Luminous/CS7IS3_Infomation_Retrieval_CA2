Gylys Welcomes `Shadow' Cabinet"] [Text] "People are currently most concerned with the indexation of savings, compensation, and benefits," said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys sharing his impressions after a meeting with his constituents in the Utena region. However, the audience also asked numerous questions about our relations with Russia after Zhirinovskiy's success in the elections. Even rural people were interested in whether we would join NATO, as well as other foreign policy issues. Journalists Violeta Gaizauskaite and Algimantas Zukas also had some questions for the minister, who is celebrating his first anniversary in office. P. Gylys "had a session" with journalists at the Foreign Ministry Collegium. [RESPUBLIKA] How could you assess the past year in politics? Do you think, as foreign minister, that you have fulfilled all commitments? [Gylys] Well, I am, probably, supposed to demonstrate severe self-criticism now .... Assuming this position, I understood perfectly well that I would not manage to accomplish everything I wanted. I do not want to underrate the work of Mr. A. Saudargas [former minister]. I see, however, that the formation of the system will continue for several years. When the International Relations Institute releases its first "production," we will have more young people who know several West European languages. If we succeed in creating a state machine that works in a new style in some five years, the state will remain stable even when ministers change. [RESPUBLIKA] However, many Foreign Ministry employees have found other, often better-paying jobs. Do you not think that such "migration" results from the fact that people do not see a prospect for making a good diplomatic career? What decides the appointment of one or another official to important diplomatic positions? [Gylys] I would not like to agree with you, because it is over recent months that we have tried to show people that their work is valued. They know that those people who work in the ministry and Lithuania's diplomatic missions abroad will rotate. A large group of our employees has gone to work in our missions in Washington, Vienna, and Helsinki. We invite people from other offices because it is difficult to find those of an ambassadorial scale. Neither the president nor I put any "political" questions to appointed ambassadors. [RESPUBLIKA] One can notice that former high-ranking suppliers and traders usually go to the East. With what is such "economic" tendency associated? [Gylys] The press mocks us by saying that nothing has come out of "economization," while you notice that real economists become ambassadors. However, this was not some deliberate selection. I would not stress the diplomats' former occupation. "Economization" is an unfinished process: We wanted to achieve much more, but I could not assess everything as damaging. By May of 1994, we must draft a free trade agreement with the European Union. We have prepared a program on joining GATT. These agreements must be drafted with the smallest painful effect, because the opening of the Lithuanian market implies competition, which is not always gentlemanly. [RESPUBLIKA] What should be the role of the Foreign Policy Coordination Council, the existence of which is not projected in the Constitution, by the way? [Gylys] I would like to be frank. However, I would not be pleased if my sincerity was used against me.... The president's office was a new institution, and I was a new minister. Therefore, the "circulation" of information between this office and the ministry was not too good in the beginning, but things have improved now. Political strife is often waged in the Seimas [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, thus, the latter is more difficult to communicate with. By the way, information about the committee's activities that reaches the Foreign Ministry is insufficient. The new council will help to know better who does what, and to take joint action. [RESPUBLIKA] Both journalists and Seimas deputies were quite surprised by the idea of establishing a position of the minister for relations with Western countries. Would you be "minister for the East" in that case? [Gylys] Representation plays a great role in interstate relations, and it would be good to have such a minister as J. Mejerovics in Latvia. The Foreign Ministry will not split and will deal with all geographic latitudes. [RESPUBLIKA] Lithuania has disbanded its former delegation for negotiations with Russia. However, Russia has not changed the status of its delegation. Its leader V. Isakov is urging the expansion of dialogue on the delineation of state borders and the establishment of border crossings. However, does Lithuania's new delegation include any specialists in these issues? [Gylys] The current delegation is only a core, while experts will be invited from all offices. For example, the group headed by Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas will contribute to the delineation of the borders. I would like to go back to the conversation between Presidents A. Brazauskas and B. Yeltsin, in which they exchanged opinions about the necessity of changes in the negotiating delegations. I think that nothing exceptional has occurred after the appointment of the group for negotiations with the CIS. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this group includes state officials rather than politicians. Russia did this in the very beginning, while we did not preserve the principle of solidarity and state interest. [RESPUBLIKA] RESPUBLIKA was surprised by the statement of G. Karasin, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information Service, that Russia had been informed about the visit of the Chechen delegation to Lithuania in advance, and, therefore, this visit "did not exceed any permissible limits." What could this mean? [Gylys] I learned about this visit a few days ago. As far as I know, none of our employees informed Moscow about it in advance. According to my understanding of diplomacy, however, the preparation for this visit seems strange. [RESPUBLIKA] You assessed the opposition's no-confidence vote against you as an integral part of the operation "Fall." Do you think that the opposition is plotting a "Spring" operation? [Gylys] I imagine that the operation "Spring" will be much weaker than the "Fall" one. The oral battle will continue until the next elections. However, this is not enough. There is a slight possibility of assuming power through illegal means. [RESPUBLIKA] How would you comment on the words of opposition leader V. Landsbergis that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's foreign policy has failed? Could the opposition participate in conducting the policy of the ruling party? What constructive proposals of the opposition could you remember? [Gylys] Like Mr. V. Landsbergis, I would have to strain my memory very much.... I could discern a conceptual, although a critical, assessment in the address of Social Democrat V. Pleckaitis before the Seimas. Sometimes it looks like some people in Lithuania are displeased with our considerably quiet relations with Russia, or with the withdrawal of Russian troops. They need strife and enemies, and possibly large ones. However, such an evolution of international relations has no perspective. I believe that it is high time for the opposition to think about a "shadow" cabinet, because it is useful for the people to know what government will come after the next elections. [RESPUBLIKA] One "shadow" cabinet has already declared itself.... [reference to young politicians' conference which elected a 'government of the 21st century'] [Gylys] If you have in mind the Lithuanian Government of the 21st century, its representatives also work in the Foreign Ministry. However, as soon as I learned about its existence, I calmed down. They are allowed to act freely, and their "orientation" toward the 21st century is welcome.
