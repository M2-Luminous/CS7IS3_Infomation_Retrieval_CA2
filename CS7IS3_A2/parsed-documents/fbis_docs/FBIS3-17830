Ukraine's positions, which Volodymyr Handohiy [Ukraine's acting permanent representative at the United Nations] related at a plenary session of the UN General Assembly -- that a CIS representative can only represent the interests of those states that have signed the CIS Charter -- remain unchanged. As Ukraine has not done this, and also does not consider the CIS to be a subject of international law, but only a regional organization, Ukrainian diplomacy is in favor of direct and not mediated relations with the United Nations.
