A sponsor of the formation of the new party is the well-known entrepreneur A. Kisherin, head of the Kisherin & Co. concern. Our own correspondent in Belts met with Mr. Kisherin and asked him to answer a number of questions. [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, as far as I know, you were never a member of any party or involved in politics previously. Why did you, a prosperous, respected person, doing what you like best, want to get into.... [Kisherin] Do not go on, I know what you are going to say--politics is a dirty business. And I agree, but only when ambitious people who are backed by nothing other than a set of populist phrases and slogans take up politics. They, truly, make all kinds of promises and quite unconcernedly go about their business, enjoying the blandishments of power. I ask forgiveness for the excessively strong language, some people will not like it, naturally, but speaking openly, plainly is in my nature. This is my problem and my good fortune. I have had unpleasant situations and have made enemies, but even more have I found friends, who like my candor. They trust me and believe me. This was a factor that brought me to the party. I never was, truly, a member of any party. I was involved in the economy and I understand some things here and I can see that it is currently on the brink of ruin. Struggling alone makes no sense. We have assembled a team of fellow thinkers who evaluate events identically and who know how to find a way out of the impasse situation. [Starik] You see light at the end of the tunnel, then? [Kisherin] Yes, together we have formulated a program for the extrication of the republic's economy from the impasse. We are publishing this program and will not, therefore, touch on it now. Specially since we will not be revealing any special truths: We will simply struggle to ensure that the manufacturer and entrepreneur may work efficiently and productively, manufacture output, pay people, and well, for their work, and sell the commodities where there is demand for them. [Starik] This is in the sphere of the economy. What does your party offer in the social and political plane? [Kisherin] It seems to me that our society simply cannot rid itself of the complexes of the socialist system, when everyone, be he of Solomonic wisdom or an outright slacker, must be supported. At the expense of the state. It is time to understand that the main policy in all spheres should be the economy. It should put man at the forefront. If we resolve economic problems, political problems, the social problems will disappear of their own accord. You took a stab at me here, saying I am a prosperous individual. Yes, I can allow myself to take my family to Miami, Switzerland, wherever I like. No problems. But why should others have them--young families, students, old people who have spent all their lives working for this system, and large families that cannot now make ends meet, and the state has forgotten about them. It was for the sake of social justice that we created the Economic Revival Party, and it will struggle for a better life for all strata of society and influence government policy in this respect. And seek a preponderance in favor of the working man. Look what is happening, after all: Production is grinding to a halt, and people capable of working well are finding themselves on the street, not to mention old people, the infirm, and children. And why? Because some people wanted to play at politics for politics' sake. Having totally forgotten about economics. But it does not allow itself to be dependent on political ambitions. It is supported on its own laws, which no demonstration or edict can abolish. We believe, therefore, that the time has come for people who have proven by action that they know how to manage to come to power. If only in the example of their own enterprise, plant, or factory. Those who are called the bread and salt of the economy. Our information: The Kisherin & Co. concern is an enterprise of a broad agro-industrial profile. It is known as one of the republic's highly profitable enterprises with a well-funded social infrastructure. Average wages in the concern constitute R150,000 (this material prepared before the money exchange). More than 500 new jobs have been created in the past two years. Aside from its main profile--the cultivation of agricultural products--the concern has a network of commercial stores selling consumer goods. The production of packing crates, which have helped the farms of the republic considerably in saving and selling what they have grown, has been organized here as of spring of this year. [Starik] So in creating the party you set your sights on acquiring power? [Kisherin] I emphasize once again that there should be at the helm of the state competent and decisive people who know precisely what needs to be done. And the interests of whose party they represent are secondary. Just as long as the people believe and support them. [Starik] It is being said that the Economic Revival of Moldova Party is a millionaires' party. [Kisherin] Ah, this habit of pinning on labels! People are still afraid of becoming bourgeois and appearing, according to stereotypes, like bad little boys. What is wrong, pray, in a person getting on thanks to his intellect, ability, know-how, and enterprise. Not by thievery, but by his personal attributes. Why is being a millionaire in our Sovman consciousness considered a vice, and in America people are proud of this and aspire to wealth? What, don't they understand anything, those people across the ocean? But we have digressed. There are in our party many industrialists, entrepreneurs, bankers, leaders of state-owned enterprises and private firms, specialists, and many ordinary workers and peasants. And they came to us voluntarily in order to establish together a normal life and in order that each of us, be he a member of the Economic Revival Party or not, may hope to become a millionaire. [Starik] Are you yourself, Mr. Kisherin, a millionaire? [Kisherin] It is somewhat difficult becoming a millionaire with our permanent economic disorders and almost regular monetary reforms. But I am able to provide my family with a decent living and have a foreign car in the garage and money to enable me to feel in charge of the situation in any country. Everything earned by the concern is constantly being put to work and is making profits. For me and my subordinates. Such is the law of the market economy. Decent wages should be received not just by the workers of the Kisherin concern, but also by the other inhabitants of our republic. And this is possible on one condition: the unrestricted development of enterprise. People are reluctant to understand this as yet, unfortunately. There is much work to be done by our party, using facts and figures, for this simple truth to triumph. Democratically, without any social upheavals. [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, your concern is known also for its extensive charitable activity. The church in Drokiyevskiy Rayon's village of Kotovo was restored with its money, and you support Belts television, the Yunost movie theater, artistic groups of the city and the republic, athletes.... Will not your assistance grow scarce in connection with the formation of the party? After all, it could be that some of the resources will be needed for the party coffers. [Kisherin] A party, if it is based on certain economic principles, should support itself. Plus the dues and personal contributions of its members and organizations, but only for the accomplishment of program tasks. We have no intention of maintaining a bureaucratic machinery like the former rayon and city party committees. Everyone, not apparatchiks, should work with the masses. As far as the charity is concerned, we will continue this program. Within the framework of the Kisherin & Co. concern and also within the framework of party activity.
