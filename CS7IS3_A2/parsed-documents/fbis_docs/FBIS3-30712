The Supreme Court established that the Council of Ministers has once more acted illegally by committing a breach of the Constitution and of legal acts. The Council of Ministers has abused its power, which is an inadmissible offense in a rule-of-law state, especially if committed by an organ that is responsible for the comprehensive administration of the country, the Supreme Court's announcement reads.
