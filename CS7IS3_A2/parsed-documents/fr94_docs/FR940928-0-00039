FR940928-0-00039 FR940928-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 RIN 2127&hyph;AE36 [Docket No. 92&hyph;33; Notice 3] Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This notice reinstates Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c of 49 CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, which were inadvertently omitted from Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 400&hyph;999 as of October 1, 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: The rule is effective September 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Taylor Vinson, Office of Chief Counsel, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5263). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 3, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule which, among other things, revised and redesignated certain paragraphs of S5.1 of Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment (58 FR 12183). Before the final rule, paragraph S5.1.1.11 contained internal references to Figures 1a and 1b, and paragraph S5.1.1.12 an internal reference to Figure 1c. The final rule redesignated S5.1.1.11 as S5.1.1.6, and revised it to incorporate the substance of S5.1.1.12, including the reference to Figure 1c. (Further amendments adopted a new paragraph S5.1.1.11, removed S5.1.1.12, and redesignated S5.1.1.32 as S5.1.1.12.) NHTSA has been informed by the Federal Register that, because the amendatory language of the final rule did not contain instructions where to place Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c within the text of Standard No. 108, the figures were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations. This document reinstates those figures, to follow the text of S5.1.1.6. Effective Date Because this amendment is corrective in nature and imposes no additional burden upon any person, notice and comment upon are not required under the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is found, for good cause shown, that an effective date earlier than 180 days after issuance is in the public interest. The amendment will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register . List of Subjects in 49 CFR part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 571 is amended as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1.

Section 571.108 is amended by adding Figures 1a, 1b and 1c, as set forth below, to follow paragraph S5.1.1.6. §571.108 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. * * * * * S5.1.1.6 *␣*␣*
