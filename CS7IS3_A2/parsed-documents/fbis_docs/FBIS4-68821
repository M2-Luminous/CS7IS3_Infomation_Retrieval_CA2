For two years they have been working within the framework of a technical cooperation program entitled "Budgetary Relations Between Governmental Bodies at Various Levels in the Russian Federation." The work of this group of World Bank experts in Russia culminated in the publication of a summary report entitled "Russia and Problems of Budget-and Tax-Based Federalism." The assessment of mutual tax relations between the center and the regions and the accompanying recommendations contained in that report were very striking. Specifically, the experts are quite well aware that Russian authorities are attempting to balance the federal balance through the arbitrary shifting of as many expenditures as possible to the regional level, particularly expenditures for social needs and capital investment. As a result, local governments do not have a very clear idea for which specific expenditures they are responsible, or which sources they should use to cover those expenditures. Taking the experiences of economically developed federative states (primarily the United States and Canada) as their point of departure, the World Bank experts propose as a first step that the list of expenditures for which local governments are responsible be clearly established, once and for all (with basic expenditures for social needs and capital construction brought back to the federal level). The next suggestion is to put all tax revenues in Russia from the basic taxes (income tax, profit tax and value added tax) in a single "pool" and clearly define what portion of that money will be sent to local budgets, and what portion will remain in the federal budget, based on the division of expenditures between budgets at various levels. It is also suggested that a portion of the money set aside for local budgets be shared between regions proportionally to the amount of taxes collected in each -- with the more economically developed regions naturally getting more. The remainder should be divided up between regions with the objective of levelling their economic playing field. It will also be necessary to get away from the excessive number of local taxes (those that are paid directly into the local budget), leaving only the most stable of them, primarily the land tax. Also notable was the approach taken by the World Bank experts to differentiation of tax rates by region. They propose abandoning the current system, which allows the possibility of various profit tax rates being established in various regions of the country (in addition to the 13-percent tax that is paid into the federal budget, between 0 and 25 percent of profits may also go to the local budget based on a decision by a local legislative body). This kind of tax system creates a tangled "tax jungle" for business people, forcing them to choose not so much between various regions with varying prospects for profitable investment as between regions with varying tax systems. It is also proposed that we move to a differentiated tax system for personal income taxes (regions would simply be granted the right to collect regional surcharges over and above a unified federal income tax, with those surcharges paid directly into local budgets). If this were the case, every citizen would understand that he or she would have to pay a larger share of his or her income to live in a city with nice homes, schools and roads than in other regions (fully in keeping with American tradition, for example). In addition the World Bank experts, while supporting a clear-cut and well-defined system of relationships between budgets at various levels, are also fully aware that Russia's government has a certain interest in an "ill-defined" system that makes it possible to present the federal budget to international lenders in a favorable light whenever one wishes. However, they assert that lenders will be quite understanding of the fact that reform of budget relationships between the center and the regions in Russia will worsen official budget indices, and consequently will somewhat reconsider their strict requirements with regard to macroeconomic indicators. * * * Commentary The recommendations prepared by World Bank experts are not seen as a fundamental reform of the existing tax system, but rather as proposals aimed at improving that system. Specifically, the attention of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts was drawn to the idea of efficient expenditures of tax revenues and reduction in the current number of local taxes, combined with an expanded role for land taxes. This idea is not new, but it is quite timely and (a point of some significance) it can be easily and painlessly implemented in Russia right away. For fairness' sake it should be noted that proposals that local taxes be reduced have been put forward repeatedly by Russian scientists, in particular by Academician Dmitriy Lvov and Professor Vladimir Frolov (see: KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 29 April), as well as by sections of the executive branch, i.e the State Tax Service and the Russian Ministry of Finance. It is easy to explain such rare unanimity: collecting these taxes is inefficient. With the possible exception of land taxes, the cost of collecting taxes to pay for things like parking or police often exceeds the amount of money actually collected. However, in addition to some proposals that are quite self-evident, this report by World Bank experts also contains a number of proposals that are quite unexpected for the Russian tax system. For example, the thoroughly logical and justified idea of introducing higher taxes for residents of the most economically prosperity localities. However, under Russian conditions this innovation will most likely not lead so much to social justice (better living conditions as a result of additional funding) as to greater social tension, since -- and of this KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts are quite certain -- an increase in local taxes will not result in any noticeable improvement in the quality of life in the immediate future. Also of interest is the idea of establishing a standard level of payments into local, republic and federal budgets out of the sum total of all significant tax revenues. Previously tax revenues were paid out to the various regions at various rates (with the distribution of 1992 profit taxes particularly indicative in this regard). However, the proposal to support the most backward regions with the objective of "equalizing their economic position" will also be complicated in Russia due to its economic peculiarities: an additional infusion of money into the regions might just become another financial "feeding trough." The World Bank experts took an untraditional approach to the widely proclaimed "regional independence" with regard to regulation of local tax systems. This time they were undaunted by accusations that they might be infringing on fragile Russian democracy and proceeded primarily on the basis of fully self-evident assumptions. However, it should be noted that tax rates still vary among the various states of economically prosperous America.
