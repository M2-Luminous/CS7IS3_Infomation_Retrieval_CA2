The TEC, which has formed a task force to examine the grievances of civil servants who are striking in several of the homelands and self-governing territories, appealed for a virtual moratorium on strike action and said the TEC would hold discussions with the trade union federations to urge them to refrain from strike action "in the national interests". The TEC noted the importance of civil servants in the electoral period, in particular security forces. It noted too that concerns had been expressed about job security, pension payouts and the rationalisation process. The TEC said a successful election would lead to a stable country that could attend to civil servants' grievances. The TEC wanted civil servants to accept its assurances that their jobs would be secure after the election.
