In its noon newscast on Monday, 7 March 1994, Israel radio said Jordanian Tourism Minister Muhammad al-'Adwan visited the Israeli pavilion and made a statement in which he said: I hope Jordan and Israel will overcome their extremists so the desired peace between the two countries will be realized soon. I also hope that after signing a peace agreement between the two countries, it will become possible to carry out joint tourist projects to attract foreign tourists to Israel and Jordan. He said Jordanian businessmen and investors are ready to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts on setting up joint ventures that serve bilateral economic and tourist interests. Israel radio attributed this statement to al-'Adwan during a surprise visit to the Israeli pavilion, as the radio claimed. The radio said the Jordanian minister arrived in the pavilion unexpectedly, and that the director general of the Israeli Ministry of Tourism was quickly called in to receive the unexpected guest. Sources at the Israeli pavilion expressed a belief that the political relaxation in Middle East relations have a direct impact on the change in the Arab world and the visits to various Israeli fairs by Arab officials. The Israeli side proposed tourist deals to their Arab visitors. Israeli tourists toured Arab pavilions. The director general of the Israeli airlines company visited the Yemen pavilion and met with Yemeni businessmen. Ahmad al-Ma'ni, director general of a tourist company in Dubai, told Israeli press representatives who visited the Dubai pavilion that what happened in Hebron turned things upside down. Ibrahim Yasin, a ranking Syrian Tourism Ministry official said several Syrian officials are impatiently waiting for the time when they will be allowed to visit Israel. In an exclusive statement to AL-SABIL, Dr. Muhammad al-'Adwan, Jordanian minister of tourism and antiquities, said this report is baseless. He said: I did not visit the Israeli pavilion, nor did any member of the Jordanian delegation. No one made a statement to the Israeli media. This report is totally untrue, he said. He said the objective of Israel radio is to stir up a clamor and to try to harm the firm Jordanian position by diverting attention from the ugly massacre committed by Israeli settlers. Al-'Adwan welcomed cooperation between AL-SABIL and the Ministry of Tourism in the service of the public interest.
