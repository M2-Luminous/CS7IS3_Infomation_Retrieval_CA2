A classic example is erstwhile macroeconomic policy. Postwar Japan modernized the economy with the national objective of catching up with Europe and the United States. Pursuit of that objective involved adoption of fiscal and financial policies which gave highest priority to the development and growth of industry. Tax systems were designed with a variety of provisions favoring businesses. Favorable treatment of savings unheard of in other parts of the world were adopted to ensure the recycling of family savings into the industrial sector. Comprehensive implementation of macroeconomic policies of this nature which favored industry resulted in spectacular growth for Japan in a short period. However, macroeconomic policies of the past, which functioned so well during the catch-up era, are no longer very effective now that we have passed the catch-up era. And, there is more to the problem. The former macroeconomic policies are creating a series of problems that are bound to become obstacles to future economic growth. Such problems are countless and include accumulation of huge international balance-of-payments surpluses, international economic friction, the lowest housing standards of principal leading nations, and price levels which are high when compared to other nations. Limitations of Erstwhile Macroeconomic Policies Macroeconomic policies of the past were designed so as to accumulate savings necessary for industrial growth. However, continuation of economic growth led by exports has become difficult and industrial capital demand has declined sharply, while savings have increased and international balance-of-payments surpluses have continued to accumulate. If we are to learn from these lessons, it is obvious that the economic policy to be adopted by Japan in the post-Heisei recession period should be a modification of the excessive savings habits. The most unattractive aspect of Japan, which supposedly built an affluent society, is its low housing standards centered in urban areas. Especially urgent in our nation which is about to usher in a senior citizen society is the construction and expansion of residential capital stock. From an international viewpoint, we must work expeditiously to establish an economic system which will enable us to coexist with the rest of the world. There is no way that Japan with a 15-percent share of the world's gross national product (GNP) can survive by isolating itself from the rest of the world. Aggressive deployment of a new macroeconomic policy which corrects imbalances between savings and investment as an alternative to earlier macroeconomic policies will guarantee economic growth led by domestic demand and reduce international balance-of-payments surpluses. Attainment of those results will require special emphasis on the following three points on a mid- and long-term basis: First, we address reform of tax systems. The government Tax Council is playing a central role in studying a plant to decrease and increase taxes which combines an income tax cut and consumption tax hike. I too believe that in the face of the pending arrival of the senior citizen society, modification of the direct and indirect taxing ratios should be effected in the interests of stabilizing overall tax revenues. However, I am opposed to any modification of direct and indirect taxing ratios which calls for an "overall increase in taxes," as strongly advocated by some quarters of the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. In terms of modifying the direct and indirect tax ratio, it would probably be acceptable to see a result that would produce "neither an increase nor a decrease on an overall basis." However, it is desirable that the ratios be modified so that the result is an "overall decrease in taxes" in order to enhance the soundness of our consumer markets which lack vitality. This approach is presented with the idea that it will enhance the expansion of domestic demand and lead to an improvement in the savings-investment balance. As an offset for deficiencies in tax revenues, we should probably consider a further cut in fiscal spending and a boost in tax revenues through comprehensive taxation of special income categories such as interest income. Further, we must not lose sight of the need to exert efforts at increased tax revenues attained through economic growth by means of putting the economy back on a stable growth track. Second, we address a fundamental revision of the public works program. Already, the industrial infrastructure has been built to a considerable extent in terms of roads, harbors, bridges, and railways. Any uncontrolled expansion of public works spending based on past categories could lead to a waste of resources. On the other hand, there has been a major expansion in the investment needs for construction and expansion of new social capital required in Japan for the future. For example, as mentioned in previous installments of this editorial series titled "Blueprint for Post-Heisei Recession Period," they include constructing a next-generation information-communication infrastructure, organizing transportation systems incorporating needs of the senior citizen society, building medical and nursing systems, establishing a worldwide environmental protection infrastructure, and developing advanced technology and equipment and systems for pollution measures. Use of current categories of public works programs would preclude effective fulfillment of these new kinds of needs. The two major classifications of national construction bonds and national deficit bonds are no longer compatible with current conditions for issuance of national debt instruments. It is difficult to place research and development funds used for basic research which is significantly tied to the future Japanese economy under the two categoies of bonds used in the past. We should actively invest public funds in the public sector for social needs even if they do not result in the building of tangible assets such as roads and bridges. Let Us Make Housing With 100-Year Lifespans Third, we address implementation of bold, preferential policies for residential investments. Housing built in Japan in the past was of a meager quality which barely exceeded the definition of durable consumer goods. Quality of housing was affected by the high cost of residential construction, including the cost of land and the government's housing policy which emphasized the idea that "housing was acceptable as long as it was habitable." Such a policy was tolerable when Japan was a poor nation. However, in the future there is a need to supply durable homes which will last about 100 years. Such homes will lead to the creation of comfortable, high-quality residential environments. It would be desirable to attain that goal by stimulating investments in homes by emulating the method used by the United States in encouraging housing construction after World War II by exempting from taxes the income used for interest charges on home loans. The foremost obstacle which can be visualized in implementing macroeconomic policies which emphasize the correction of imbalances between savings and investments will probably be past forms of bureaucratic systems and bureaucratic concepts. Strong political leadership will be indispensable in overcoming such barriers. Having said that, it must be obvious as to the direction of economic policy to be assumed by the new Hata government, the second cabinet following abandonment of the "1955 political system."
