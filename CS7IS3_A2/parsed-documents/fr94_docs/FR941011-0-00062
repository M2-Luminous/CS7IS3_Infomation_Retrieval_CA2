Browner, Administrator. 40 CFR part 60 is amended as follows: PART 60_STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES 1. The authority citation for part 60 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sections 101, 111, 114, 116, and 301 of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401, 7411, 7414, 7416, 7601). 2. Section 60.391 is amended by adding definitions in alphabetical order to paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: §60.391 Definitions. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* Solids Turnover Ratio (R T ) means the ratio of total volume of coating solids that is added to the EDP system in a calendar month divided by the total volume design capacity of the EDP system. * * * * * Volume Design Capacity of EDP System (LE) means the total liquid volume that is contained in the EDP system (tank, pumps, recirculating lines, filters, etc.) at its designed liquid operating level. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* LE = the total volume of the EDP system (liters), * * * * * 3. Section 60.392 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §60.392 Standards for volatile organic compounds. * * * * * (a) Prime Coat Operation (1) For each EDP prime coat operation: (i) 0.17 kilogram of VOC per liter of applied coating solids when R T is 0.16 or greater. (ii) 0.17 x 350 ( 0.160&hyph;R T ) kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids when R T is greater than or equal to 0.040 and less than 0.160. (iii) When R T is less than 0.040, there is no emission limit. (2) For each nonelectrodeposition prime coat operation: 0.17 kilogram of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. * * * * * 4.
