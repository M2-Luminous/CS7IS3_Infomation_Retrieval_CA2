(y) Services associated with the assessment of fees, billing, and administration of this part. ยง354.6 Billing and payment of fees. FEMA will forward bills to licensees based on the assessment methodology set forth in ยง354.4 to recover the full amount of the funds budgeted by FEMA to provide REP Program services. The assessments for each site and licensee, as stated above, will not distinguish between site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors. Licensees with multiple sites will receive consolidated bills. FEMA will forward one bill to each licensee during the first quarter of the fiscal year, with payment due within 30 days. There will be a one-time adjustment to the billing cycle in the first quarter of FY 1995 to accommodate a transition to the new methodology. During this quarter, an adjusted final bill for FY 1994 REP Program services will be issued along with the bill for all of FY 1995, with a possible second bill if minor adjustments are necessary. In order to avoid having the licensees pay two bills during the same fiscal year (FY 1994) for activities performed in two different fiscal years, FEMA, with the concurrence of the Department of the Treasury, will structure the due date of these two bills so that the adjusted bill for FY 1994 will be due and payable by the end of December 1994 and the full bill for FY 1995 will be due and payable in January of 1995. ยง354.7 Failure to pay. In any case where FEMA believes that a licensee has failed to pay a prescribed fee required under this part, procedures will be implemented in accordance with 44 CFR part 11, subpart C, to effectuate collections under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq. ).
