By retaining water or rainfall storage, the survival rate of trees in semi-arid areas has been raised to about 90 percent from 30 percent. The new method, developed by researchers from Beijing Forestry University after five years' study, consists of collecting and storage of rainfall and maintaining soil moisture, is able to double or even triple the water available for trees in arid or semi-arid areas. Arid and semi-arid land accounts for 52.5 percent of China's total territory, and the average tree survival rates were four percent and 30 percent in arid and semi-arid areas respectively.
