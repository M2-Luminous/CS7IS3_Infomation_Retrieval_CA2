The Czech Republic has become the 11th country to join the project. [passage omitted] Klaus said in his speech that the Czech Republic regards the Partnership for Peace as a brave initiative that means a new stage in our relations with NATO, the military and political organization of 16 countries that we are striving to join. As far as our admission into the European Union is concerned, Klaus was, in his own words, very optimistic following his talks with the EU Commission President Jacques Delors, in particular when he said that the end or the turn of the century was too late for us as a date for our admission as a fully fledged member. The Czech prime minister shocked the Hungarians and the Poles, in particular, with this statement. They are expecting to be admitted to the alliance at the turn of the century. Neither Delors nor Klaus regard it as decisive when a country submits an application for full membership in the Twelve. What is more important is when they meet the specific qualitative criteria for membership set by the Maastricht Treaty. [passage omitted]
