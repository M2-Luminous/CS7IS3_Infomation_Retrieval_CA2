Ishida is the 63-year-old chairman of Komeito [Clean Government Party], the third-largest ruling coalition party, backed by the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai. His agency supervises state administration and takes charge of promoting economic deregulation. Komeito's connection with Soka Gakkai was called into question at the Diet when the opposition Liberal Democratic Party quizzed Ishida over constitutional issues. The Constitution bans the state and its organs from conducting religious activities. Ishida and Party Secretary General Yuichiro Ichikawa, the coalition's major strategist, have led Komeito for nearly five years. Born in Hokkaido, Ishida started his Komeito career as an employee of Soka Gakkai's official newspaper after graduating from the Commerce Science Department of Meiji University. He comes from a family which has close relations with Soka Gakkai, one of the most successful religious movements in postwar Japan. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time from the No. 6 constituency in Aichi Prefecture in 1967, the year Komeito first entered the lower house and voters have returned him nine more times. He assumed the post of party chairman in 1989 following the resignation of former Chairman Junya Yano over his alleged involvement in the Recruit "stock-for-favors" scandal and other corruption cases involving the party's Diet members. The new chairman, however, met with setbacks both in the House of Councillors election in 1989 and the House of Representatives election in 1990, and was forced to change the party's direction and take a more centrist course. In April 1990, Ishida made Komeito's position clear as a leading centrist party, distancing itself from reformist forces headed by the Social Democratic Party. By forming a union with another centrist force, the Democratic Socialist Party, Ishida cooperated skillfully with the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party in handling important issues in Diet debate. In 1992, he played a key role in pushing a bill through the Diet that allows Japan to dispatch Self-Defense Forces personnel overseas to join in U.N. peacekeeping operations.
