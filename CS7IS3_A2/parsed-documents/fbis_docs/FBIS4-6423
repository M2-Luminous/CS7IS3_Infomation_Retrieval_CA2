UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said, "I think the real peace (in Bosnia-Herzegovina) will come only after the Serbs are brought into the peace process." She was referring to UN-brokered negotations between Bosnia's Muslim government and Bosnian Croats. "The Serbs have been left out of the peace process and this is why the difficulties still exist," said Ogata, who is a former professor of international politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. Neither UN-authorized NATO air strikes nor warnings and pleas from the West have deterred the Serbs from further encroaching on Muslim-dominated territory in the former Yugoslavia. "The situation is very, very serious and the United Nations is facing a very critical point," Ogata said. In their latest offensive Bosnian Serbian forces attacked and almost overran the town of Gorazde, one of the six UN-designated safety zones. Ogata said the last UN convoy with food and other humanitarian aid has reached the town, where some 60,000 refugees have been trapped on March 22. She said Gorazde-based UN staff is "crying for help" for the besieged town, which sustained one of the worst poundings by Serbian artillery Wednesday that damaged a hospital and a red cross refugee center. However, she said the UNHCR will not ask for air drops of relief goods because the casualty toll would increase as people leave their shelters to gather the goods. Nearly 350 people have died and more than 1,000 have been wounded in the three-week assault on Gorazde. Ogata said there might be a slight chance for "a little cease-fire" if the Serbian forces stick to their promise to let through to Gorazde a UN convoy with 100 peacekeepers and 41 doctors delivering medical supplies Thursday. She said she was not able to confirm whether the convoy was on its way. Noting that cease-fire agreements have "come and gone," Ogata said at the moment, "there is nothing that would make me feel optimistic" about reaching a lasting armistice. Ogata was in Tokyo to attend a three-day meeting, ended Thursday, of the Commission on Global Governance, an independent think tank preparing proposals for strengthening the UN.
