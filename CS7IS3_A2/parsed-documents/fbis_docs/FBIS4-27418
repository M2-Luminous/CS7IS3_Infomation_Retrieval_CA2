The reason is that coordinated buying of the dollar and coordination on interest policy by Japan, the United States, and Europe has been followed by a rapprochement on resumption of the Japan-U.S.trade talks. Doubt about the recycling of capital into the United States with its international balance-of-payments deficit has caused turmoil in the securities markets and authorities have assumed a coordinated position. The strong yen outlook is now subject to slight relaxation until the Naples summit in July and should have a favorable impact on Japanese stock prices. The breakdown in the Japan-U.S. trade talks after the Japan-U.S. summit in February triggered the rapid rise in the yen. In that sense, the decision to resume the talks should serve as reason for a cheaper yen. The yen underwent only slight fluctuations around 104 yen to the dollar in trading on the Tokyo market on 24 May as the trading had already reflected the pending Japan-U.S. compromise. The strong yen coupled with fear about incipient inflation functioned like a boomerang in triggering a loss of confidence in the dollar and a widespread decline in the dollar amidst rising U.S. interest rates. Shigetada Nakajima, chief economist of the foreign exchange-securities department of Itohchu, comments, "It was a case where the United States had no choice but to recognize that use of foreign exchange rates to draw concessions from Japan was inadvisable." The change in the posture of U.S. authorities has deprived the markets of an excuse to go on a major dollar-selling offensive. Whenever the United States moves to cause a strong yen with the aim of correcting the trade imbalance, some temporary successes are realized, but a gradual widespread decline in the dollar follows, which imposes the inevitable need to shift to dollar-defense actions such as monetary tightening. Actions to cause a strong yen by the Carter administration, which was inaugurated in 1977, and the 1985 Plaza Accord for a weaker dollar are actions that are being repeated by the Clinton administration. The skepticism of the U.S. bond and stock markets after the United States shifted to monetary tightening policies in February 1994 testify to the tenacity of fears originating in such a chain of events. Whether it is Japan's recurring balance-of-payments surplus or the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit, imbalances for either nation can become the focus of attention. The sense of an overheating U.S. economy has ironically focused market attention on the expansion of the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit. Normally, the favorable U.S. economy in comparison to Japan and Europe and the higher U.S. interest rates would be favorable for buying dollars, but investors have failed to react favorably. Investors do not react favorably is that they assume that an excess of dollars will persist as long as the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit continues to expand and that the supply and demand balance will eventually result in a cheaper dollar. Officials at major investment firms admit, "Ever since the strong yen trend began in the 1990's, we have not succeeded in making a profit on U.S. Government bonds." Even if the series of U.S. Government policy changes have quieted the turbulence in the markets, the existence of imbalances in payments between Japan and the United States will cause hesitancy in investing in dollar assets. Market participants have reached the analytical assessment that "a dearth of news affecting the markets until the Naples summit will limit movements in the yen's value." However, any delay in mollifying concerns about an overheated U.S. economy could result in the potential for an explosive upward movement in the yen which will call for full-scale dollar defense actions.
