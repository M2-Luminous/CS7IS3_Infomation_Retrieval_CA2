But if Europe again splits into two blocs, as intimated by the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks suffered by the reformists in Russia, and the signs of an emergence of a Russian nationalistic foreign policy, then it will become difficult for Finland to combine an EU membership with military nonalliance. This is the conclusion reached in a study conducted by the Institute of International Affairs regarding the consequences EU membership would have on Finland's foreign and security policies. The study was prepared by researcher Jukka Salovaara. The study also emphasizes the fact that the ramifications of an EU membership are dependent on whether Finland also makes a military commitment, and on the direction Europe's development takes. New Possibilities As a member of the EU, Finland must commit itself to a common foreign and security policy, but the common policy only applies to issues and activities regarding which there is consensus, notes Salovaara. This commitment is counterweighted by new possibilities opening for Finland's foreign policy. As far as the possibilities to affect the common policy of the EU are concerned, Salovaara makes a division into three categories. First of all, there are areas where policies conducted by the EU are well established, and where Finland must increase its expertise, in order to exert any influence. This applies, primarily, to the Middle East policy, but pertains also to policies regarding CSCE and the UN. In regard to the CSCE policy, there are no major differences between Finland and the EU countries, nor as far as policies toward the UN are concerned, remarks Salovaara. He notes however, that, for example, as far as South Africa is concerned, Denmark, in spite of its EC membership, has been able together with the other Nordic Countries to take another tack than the EC countries, and that Nordic cooperation in regard to UN policy could also be conceivable in the future. Secondly, there are areas where the policy conducted by the EU will get a different emphasis, such as, for example, the policy toward Russia and East Europe. EU membership would give Finland's policy toward Russia new dimensions. Thirdly, Salovaara believes that Finland, as an EU member, can add a new Nordic dimension to foreign policy conducted by the Union. That could lead to increased EU interest in the areas on Finland's eastern border. Finland is unable by itself to solve the problems afflicting these areas. If Finland were to stay outside the EU, and Norway and Sweden also did so, then cooperation among the Nordic Countries could be developed. If Sweden and Norway join the EU, but Finland does not, then the relationship with Russia becomes more important. The difference compared to the Cold War era would be that West Europe's outer border would pass between Sweden and Finland. The study notes, that this would make Nordic cooperation, in its current form, difficult. As far as defense solutions are concerned, Salovaara presents four different options, depending on whether Finland joins or does not join the EU, and depending on whether Finland joins the military alliance or not. If Finland does not become a member, neutrality becomes the most likely option. If Sweden also does not become a member, a defense alliance with Sweden could be a possibility. Based on the geopolitical status of the countries and historical experiences, Salovaara deems this improbable. The fact that the relationship with Russia could become of central importance, is based, among other things, on the realization that Finland lately has come to assume greater military strategic importance for Russia. This has resulted from the partial retreat of the Russian Baltic fleet to St. Petersburg, and because the Kola Peninsula is assuming greater importance than previously in Russian strategy. As an EU member, Finland may still be militarily nonaligned and have an independent defense. However, the Maastricht treaty includes a statement regarding the goal of establishing a common defense policy, which in time may lead to a common defense. The study conducted by the Institute of International Affairs does not, however, provide an answer to the question of what the ramifications of a common defense policy are. Salovaara believes that no far-reaching decisions will be able to be made by the government conference in 1995. He assumes, however, that the EU will have some expectations of Finland, after it has joined, primarily because the Union then would have a long common border with Russia. The study regarding foreign and security policies is one of the studies that yesterday were presented in regard to the consequences of Finland joining the EU or remaining outside. Another study pertained to regional policies, and was prepared by Hannu Tervo, Hannu Niittykangas, and Tuomo Nenonen from the Economic Research Center of Central Finland . During yesterday's presentation ceremony, Nenonen noted that integration, in general, should provide an economic growth impulse for the economy as a whole. Regional distribution is not, however, expected to change from the impact of the EEA [European Economic Area] treaty. On the other hand, the assumption is that the EU will provide a stronger economic growth impulse that the EEA did. Competition will become tougher, which will cause problems for the weaker regions. However, in the long run, the endeavors of local businesses and the regions' own efforts will be of decisive importance, noted Nenonen.
