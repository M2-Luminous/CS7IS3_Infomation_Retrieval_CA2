So far, there are 29 cities and 889 towns in the province's 100,000 sq km landspace, concentrated in the southern and northern sectors. For example, Wenling County has set up 21 towns, ranking first in the province. These towns, taking advantage of neighboring on Wenzhou, which was a pioneer in introducing the market economy, have shifted into the specialized ones involving the industries of clothing and household electric appliance. It is also reported that the province has injected an average of 10 billion yuan annually to improve the infrastructure of these towns. Experts attribute the increase in the number of cities and towns to the brisk growth of township enterprises there. So far, six million farmers have flocked to find employment in over 500,000 township enterprises. For example, in Shangyu city, a former county town, the output value from township enterprises accounts for four-fifths of the industrial output total, far surpassing that of agriculture. And as a result, it was promoted to a city in 1992. Meanwhile, the province boasts more than 4,300 flourishing commodities markets, which are briskly promoting the industries of finance, communications and services. Among them, Yiwu is the most outstanding. A poor county ten years ago, it has poured hundreds of millions of yuan into infrastructure projects, like an airport, railway station and power facility, greatly upgrading the investment environment.
