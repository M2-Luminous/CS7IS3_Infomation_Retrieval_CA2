Following 6 and 9 June, when the Jiangxi machine tools plant and the Nanchang steelworks were turned into state-owned, limited-liability companies, a series of 32 wholly state-funded companies, which were listed as pilot enterprises by the provincial government, will be employing this operational mechanism. This marks that Jiangxi has entered a new stage in comprehensively reforming state-owned enterprises in accordance with a modern enterprise system. Since the beginning of this year, the provincial government has actively promoted experiments in reforming industrial enterprises. On 5 January this year, the governor's and vice governors' work meeting adopted a decision on selecting 32 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to conduct experiments in forming wholly state-funded limited-liability companies, and approved the 10-point proposal formulated by the provincial commission for restructuring economy and the provincial economic commission. Since then, each of the enterprises accordingly has set up an experimental leading group; done an active job in such basic work as checkup of warehouses, assessment of assets, and revaluation of assets; readjusted the economic structure in strict accordance with the stipulations of the Company Law; optimized the disposition of resources, with the stress on system upgrading; and established a new structure under which property rights are clearly defined, government and enterprise functions are separated, and management is scientific; thus speeding up the pace of establishing a modern enterprise system. It has been learned that the province's 32 selected pilot enterprises occupy an important position among the large- and medium-sized enterprises, and their products are in line with the state's industrial policy, are marketable, and can produce good economic results. Their leading bodies are of sound quality and their enterprise management has a solid foundation. They have managed to operate in accordance with the stipulations of the Company Law and to separate state ownership from the property rights of the enterprise legal persons, avoiding reliance on administrative organs. Hence, the state's once-unlimited responsibility for enterprises has become limited responsibility.
