[Peres] I think they are full of promises for the future. I have many hopes for the future, not only for our countries, but also for the Middle East. We can work together in every field. There is a broad potential for this. We can develop cooperation especially in the economic, technological, agricultural, defense, and tourism fields. [Dogru] How do you see the future of the Middle East peace process? [Peres] I hope that the negotiations between the PLO and Israel will be concluded by the end of this month and implementation will begin at the beginning of May. The implementation of the framework agreement will constitute the first step toward a new Middle East. [Dogru] There is a big massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would like to hear your views on this subject. [Peres] One must not approach the incidents in Bosnia as a Muslim-Christian conflict. The only discrimination the civilized world is allowed to do is the one between those who are killed in this war, that is the victims, and those who cause this shame. Civilized communities should side with the innocent people who are killed for no reason. They should defend those who do not even have the right to defend themselves because of the embargo. We feel deep sorrow for the victims of this war. [Dogru] What kind of a future awaits our world, which is changing at a head-spinning pace? How can you describe Turkey's place in this changing world? [Peres] Turkey must leave the past behind and prepare for the next century with its young population. The coming days will be accompanied by many problems such as terrorism and the environment. No country can look forward to a future without any problems. We need more educated people to resolve these problems. We must all invest more in educational institutions and scientific research organizations.
