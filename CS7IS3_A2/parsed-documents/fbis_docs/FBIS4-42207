In July last year, the day after the approval of the St. Michael's Agreement, negotiations started on dividing the 5,031 staff, the buildings, works of art, other possessions, and debts. The inheritors are the new provinces of Flemish and Walloon Brabant, the federal government, the Brussels Region, and the three Brussels Community Committees. The agreement was only fully completed last week. Louis Tobback, the federal government's home affairs minister, said the agreement was in time to be ready by 1 January 1995, as planned. Tobback said yesterday he was pleased that, despite the sometimes hard negotiations, things never came down to a trial of strength. The Home Affairs Ministry said that even the trade unions, which recently mobilized staff for the maintenance of their language bonus and favorable pension scheme, supported the agreement. Yesterday Paul Scherens [Catholic Union of Civil Servants] strongly denied the claim. The trade unions remain vigilant. "The cabinet has assured us that a law will be passed to ensure that the pensions never fall below the level which would have applied had the province continued to exist. First we want to see this law passed. If it does not come through then we will mobilize again and we will also once again raise our demands about maintaining the language bonus," Scherens warned. This language bonus will eventually be abolished, according to the cooperation agreement. The trade unions lost a court case in which they tried to demand negotiations (and not just consultations) about the partition's social consequences for staff. The judge said the demand was well-founded but could not be received because it was "premature." Another case in the Council of State is ongoing. The trade unions continue to find it outrageous that as yet workers have been given virtually no information about their transfer. Now it is a question of waiting for two new governors to be appointed. It is they who are to monitor the implementation of the cooperation agreement. A bill now put before the senate makes it possible for the King to appoint the governors of Flemish and Walloon Brabant after the signature of the cooperation agreement. Tobback said Parliament could approve the law before the summer break. Tobback also indicated that the federal state will pay for the construction of two provincial buildings and the accommodation of the adminstration. However, this does not apply to the official residences of the two provincial governors. They will be required to live in their provinces but not in the provincial capital. Uncertainty Delegate Jan Anthoons had mixed feelings about the partitioning of Brabant province's property and especially about the birth of the new Flemish Brabant province and the consequences for staff. The agreement maintains the favorable benefits of the present personnel conditions. After the New Year no one will earn less than now. But the big uncertainty remains where staff will be located. So far no one has received even one line of information about his or her possible prospects. "The agreement is good for staff remuneration, but nevertheless there is a threat of personal dramas for some staff," Anthoons said. For example, the province's partition means the end of the Medical Social Institute (MSI) in Brussels. The MSI will not go into Brussels' hands, as has happened with other provincial institutions in Brussels. The new province will have to relocate these workers, but this does not seem so self-evident. Financially the agreement is unfavorable for the new Flemish Brabant province. "The new Flemish Brabant province must take over 190 staff too many," Anthoons said. "The present unitary province employs more Dutch-speakers than French-speakers, who had greater difficulties with the language examinations. The new Flemish Brabant province has a surplus in staff because the reasonable distributive formula per language was applied separately, rather than to the staff as a whole. The budget will come under heavy pressure from the wage bill, accommodation, and working costs. Figures from the accounting department show that the division of the Flemish Brabant budget produces a 0.5 billion Belgian francs bonus, but the surplus staff numbers reduce this to some tens of millions of francs. This situation is burdening the new province's room to maneuver."
