The trawler "Vostochnoye Okno-1", belonging to this Russian firm, has been arrested in the Walvis Bay port on the Atlantic Coast of Namibia, under a supreme court of Namibia decision. The Namibian branch of the company owes a huge sum to its partners. Two fishing companies of Namibia, "Erongo Sea Products" and "T.N.P. Fishing", sued the Russian company for over two million Namibian dollars (about 550,000 U.S. dollars). This amount was made up from the cost of supplying ships and credits paid against future fishings. Recently the court ruled the claims justified. The Namibian representation of the "Vostochnoye Okno" was fishing in Namibia's coastal zone with the help of four trawlers. Now this fleet is disintegrated. The "Vostochnoye Okno-2", one of the vessels, was transferred to recover debts to the "Sovrybflot", the joint-stock company set up to replace former all-union foreign trade amalgamation. The crew of the second ship, "Alma", has established direct ties with Namibians. At last, the leased trawler "Venera-4" from Odessa, suspecting something wrong, headed home on "French leave" in March together with its fish catch, which was to be delivered to Zaire. As a result, the Odessa-based fishing amalgamation "Antarktida" has been declared company non-grata in the southern Africa. Currently there are about 30 trawlers from Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Estonia, fishing for four companies off the Namibian coasts.
