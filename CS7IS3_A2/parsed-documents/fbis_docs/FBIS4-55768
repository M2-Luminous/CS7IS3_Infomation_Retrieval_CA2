A Smallholder alliance with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is out of the question: Smallholders feel that after the first round (May 8), MDF deputies with seats in parliament from party lists are closer to the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats than to the Smallholders. However, the FKGP is discussing possible long-term cooperation with the Christian Democrats, FKGP Deputy Chairman and campaign chief Mrs. Nagy G. Agnes Maczo told reporters in Budapest on Thursday.
