FR941220-1-00002 FR941220-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/-50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a reduction of the low cycle fatigue (LCF) retirement lives for certain high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected parts with reduced LCF retirement lives. This proposal is prompted by the results of a refined life analysis performed by the manufacturer which revealed minimum calculated LCF lives significantly lower than published LCF retirement lives. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a LCF failure of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. DATES: Comments must be received by February 21, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, Room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Discussion This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/-50 series turbofan engines. A study performed by the manufacturer using updated life analyses for the high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk has revealed minimum calculated low cycle fatigue (LCF) lives which are significantly lower than published LCF retirement lives. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a LCF failure of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1069, dated September 12, 1994, that describes a reduction in the published LCF retirement lives for affected HPTR stage 2 disks, and an FAA-approved rework procedure for the affected disks to increase the FAA-approved LCF retirement life to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles since new (CSN), depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, the proposed AD would require a reduction of the published LCF retirement lives for certain HPTR stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected disks with reduced LCF retirement lives. If the FAA-approved rework is accomplished, the LCF retirement life may be increased to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles, depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 280 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 194 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $16,383 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,574,840. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: General Electric Company: Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37. Applicability: General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/-50 series turbofan engines installed on but not limited to Airbus A300 series, Boeing 747 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft.
