The Serb troops have announced that nine of their soldiers were killed when the tanks -- belonging to the Nordic UN troops -- shelled Serb firing positions near the town of Tuzla. Speaking prior to the meeting of defense ministers, which has opened in Korsoer in Denmark, Haekkerup said that the UN troops must not be passive targets but they have at least the right to fire back. The meeting in Korsoer is discussing the Nordic countries' peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. The meeting is also attended by the UN commander in Bosnia, Michael Rose.
