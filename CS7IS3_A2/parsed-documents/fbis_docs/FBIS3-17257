The audience stood to applaud as L. Korolkov, chairman of the Communist Party Coordinating Council, received the registration certificate. Kazakhstan's communists, whose persistence cannot be denied, (they fought every day for two-and-a-half years to achieve registration) intend to make their presence felt in parliament and in public life. Another 13 social and religious organizations received their registration documents along with the Communist Party. L. Korolkov, the leader of the Communist Party, told journalists that he sincerely believes in the building of communism. However, the methods of achieving this goal are somewhat different from those of 1917. "There will be no repetition of the armed uprising, I guarantee you that," he declared.
