The Subtitle D Corporate Financial Test Analysis As was discussed above, the approach used by the Agency to evaluate alternative subtitle D financial tests was consistent with the 1991 subtitle C analysis. However, because candidate measures for the 1991 subtitle C analysis were assembled from a thorough review of available research on bankruptcy predictors, the Agency decided that additional research was not likely to identify any new candidate measures. Therefore, the Agency did not consider it necessary to repeat the process of assembling and testing candidate financial measures, and combining the most promising candidate measures into alternative financial test configurations. Instead, the Agency used the alternative financial tests identified in the subtitle C analysis as the starting point for the subtitle D analysis. The Agency then developed firm samples and cost estimates for the subtitle D program, and proceeded to evaluate those candidate financial tests using basically the same procedure used for subtitle C, with minor modifications. 1. Firm Samples The Agency identified 16 non-bankrupt firms (12 public and 4 private) that own or operate MSWLFs. One of the private firms, which appeared to be quite small, was dropped from the sample for lack of financial data. Two of the remaining private firms were deleted because they had tangible net worth less than $10 million. The final non-bankrupt firm sample, then, consisted of 13 firms_12 public and one private. 2 2 The Agency believes that the same policy considerations discussed above for subtitle C compel use of a $10 million net worth requirement for subtitle D. In addition, the Agency conducted analysis to determine whether a lower net worth requirement would significantly increase the amount of financial assurance that could be covered by the subtitle D financial test. The Agency found that the 3 small firms excluded by the minimum net worth requirement owned only 12 MSWLFs, which were less than half the size of the landfills owned and operated by larger firms. Therefore, the Agency concluded that a lower minimum net worth requirement would not significantly increase the availability of the subtitle D corporate financial test. The final non-bankrupt firm sample, then, consisted of 13 firms_12 public and one private.
