FBIS TRENDS-06APR94-KUWAIT Crown Prince Announces Cabinet Reshuffle, Slams Press Crown Prince Announces Cabinet Reshuffle, Slams Press SUMMARY Crown Prince and Prime Minister Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah has used the announcement of a forthcoming cabinet reshuffle to warn the Kuwaiti press to temper its criticism of the government and to signal his displeasure with Kuwait's National Assembly. END SUMMARY While devoting much of his speech to a review of current foreign and domestic economic policy issues, Shaykh Sa'd began by directing sharp criticism at the press and, by implication, at the National Assembly, which was dissolved in 1986 and reinstated in 1992 following the Gulf War (Kuwait TV, 4 April). He reaffirmed a commitment to "constitutional democracy" as an "irreversible option" but charged that "some practices have exploited the atmosphere of freedom by going in for exaggeration and excesses" and have "gone beyond the limits and controls which the constitution laid down." In an evident allusion to the assembly, a majority of whose members were elected in October 1992 as independents or representatives of political groupings outside the government, Shaykh Sa'd complained that "groupings and blocs have appeared which are on the verge of becoming parties" and which "undermine our unity" and "spread the spirit of division and fragmentation in our ranks." Although informal political groups are tolerated in Kuwait, official political parties are banned. "True democracy," the shaykh explained, entails "responsible behavior and sincere commitment to the values and traditions of society." Although Shaykh Sa'd refrained from explicit attacks on the National Assembly, an article appearing in the the London daily Al-Hayah on 2 April indicated that the principal target of his ire is six members of the current cabinet taken from the ranks of the National Assembly when the current government was formed as part of a deal by which the assembly would defer some demands for political reform in return for being allowed some direct participation in the government. The article cited an unnamed source close to the shaykh as saying that the shaykh "was not satisfied with the way some ministers, who are also members of the National Assembly, act in their ministerial posts" and as charging that these ministers "act in light of their alliances and sympathy with the political forces at the expense of their commitment to maintain solidarity among the members of the government." On the 6th, Al-Hayah reported considerable speculation in Kuwaiti political circles concerning the reshuffle but added that no official announcements are likely before 11 April. Turning to the press, on which prepublication censorship was lifted in January 1992, Shaykh Sa'd claimed that "some of our papers have made of themselves an arena for the infighting of quarreling groups and blocs," quite likely a reference in particular to the daily Al-Oabas, which has frequently been a thorn in the government's side. Such papers, the shaykh added, have engaged in "bigotry, intellectual intimidation, insults, and discrediting" and "have become tools destroying our national unity." Without threatening any specific sanctions, Shaykh Sa'd warned against "the negative consequences of the continuation of the practice of irresponsible freedom" and added that the goal of press freedom "is not chaos but a commitment to truth, objectivity, and the good of the nation." Implications Judging from Shaykh Sa'd's speech, the reshuffle may involve both the removal or shifting of at least some of the six ministers from the National Assembly, as well as some movement of ministers holding various domestic economic portfolios. Notwithstanding the shaykh's obvious irritation with the press and the National Assembly, both of which have demonstrated a clear willingness to attack the government since the restoration of parliament in 1992, his reassurances of his commitment to constitutional government probably also reflects a recognition by the ruling family that it must live with a degree of political pluralism and debate given the substantially changed political climate in Kuwait brought on by the Gulf War.
