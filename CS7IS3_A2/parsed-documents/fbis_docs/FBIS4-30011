In the New York currency market on 21 June, the yen, for a while, was posted at 99 yen per dollar. This condition, however, is due less to an appreciation of the yen than to a depreciation of the dollar. The important thing at this time is not to panic at the historic rate of "99 yen" but to prepare conditions for policy coordinatioin to stop the dollar's sharp fall. The dollar's decline against the mark and the yen is thought to have been caused by the outflow of funds invested in stocks and bonds as a result of growing investor apprehension that improved economic conditions in the United States might bring inflation to the U.S. market. Another reason is that the economies of Japan and Germany are starting to recover and the gap between them and the U.S. economy is narrowing. The problem is that the dollar's fall will aggravate the market's apprehension about inflation, possibly raising U.S. long-term interest rates and inviting a fall in stock prices. The triple declines in value of the dollar, stocks, and bonds would impact the world, putting upward pressure on long-term interest rates throughout the world. It would also lead to falling stock prices. Such a chain of movements in the market would be amplified through a sharply expanded use of such financial derivatives (financially generated products) as futures and options. Triggered by the fall in the dollar's value, long-term interest rates in various nations have already started to rise, and it is feared that this condition will have the effect of pouring cold water on the recent mood of the world economy recovering. Particularly with the yen reached an historic level, Japan's exporting companies are taking the situation seriously as one that will hurt their profits. We must deal with this high yen problem in a calm manner. While the U.S. market's apprehension about inflation has caused the decline of the dollar, what has dominated the world economy since the end of the Cold War is disinflation as a result of low-wage nations' entry in the world market. Excesses in the market will correct themselves sooner or later. In the government, top leaders met in a hurry to discuss measures to deal with the yen's appreciation, but this is something we have seen done time and again. What is important now is not responding to the yen's appreciation from the perspective of our own country but agreeing on policy coordination from a global perspective to stop the dollar's sharp fall. Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market has a temporary effect in taming turbulence in the market, but it has its limitations. It is now time for the major countries to embark on policy cooperation that will go as far as reforming the structures of their economies. The July summit of the advanced nations (the Naples summit) will provide a good opportunity to do that. The U.S. monetary authorities should flexibly manage their monetary policy to dispel apprehensions about inflation and do all they can to reduce the budget deficits. Germany should continue easing its monetary restrictions and revive its economy. Japan, for its part, should reduce is current-account surpluses by pushing to expand its domestic demand. Japan should front-load the reduction of income taxes and keep the rise in the consumption tax only to the level of revenue neutrality. Deregulation should not be in name only, and it must be an effective one. Assuming a strong yen, it will also necessay to turn the country's export-dependent industrial structure into one led by domestic demand assuming. The current-account surplus is expanding now; it is not clear if the economic recovery is on the right track yet. It will not serve the purpose of policy coordiantion if Japan is thinking about seeking deductible tax increases [sashihiki zozei] or taking the substance out of deregulation. We certainly hope the government will take actions and not fall into a situation of panicking once again as a result of failing to do anything this time.
