Present at the talks also were UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia General Michael Rose, special envoy of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Nicholas Morris, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. The signing of a peace agreement would avert or discourage the forces opting for continued war, it was assessed at the talks. The evasion of a peace agreement by war option protagonists, assisted by foreign factors, can only flare up war conflicts bearing heavy consequences om regional peace and stability, it was cautioned at the talks. On Sunday, the Moslem side rejected a draft accord on lasting truce in the Sarajevo region as drawn up by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Asushi Yakashi. The Moslems also turned down a peace plan by the European Union (E.U.) in Geneva twenty days ago, opting for war and trying to win out military intervention against Bosnian Serbs. A resumption of political talks, to which the Serb side commits itself and on which the international community would have to insist strongly, is the only rasonable road to peace, it was said at the talks. It was pointed out that Serbia, as it has been doing so far, would lend support to peace efforts by the United Nations in the areas of former Yugoslavia.
