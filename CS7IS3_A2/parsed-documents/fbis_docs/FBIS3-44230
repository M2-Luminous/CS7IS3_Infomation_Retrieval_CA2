It all started at around 0930 AM when armed youthwingers of MRND- CDR converged at 100 meters from CND [National Development Council] building where RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] officials reside, and erected barricades in the roads. The notorious supporters of MRND-CDR began to pull people out of cars, confiscated things, smashed windscreens, and forced the owners of vehicles to walk on foot. According to an eyewitness, one person was violently pulled out of the car and slashed with a panga [machete]. The attackers accused the victims of being tall, and therefore a Tutsi, according to them. All these acts of terror took place in the presence of security forces, the local paramilitary gendarmes. The gendarmes seemed concerned with the security of the perpetrators of violence instead of administering law and order. The only vehicles allowed to pass were those of RTLM [expansion unknown], a radio station used by MRND-CDR, and that of Mr. [name indistinct] the secretary general of MRND-CDR party, which passed in the area several times. At around 1100 AM, the MRND-CDR gang stopped an RPF vehicle which was taking an RPA [Rwandan Patriotic Army] officer to the headquarters of UNAMIR to meet Brigadier General Romeo Dallaire [UNAMIR commander]. In order to pass, the RPA soldiers escorting the officer had to shoot in the air to disperse those manning the illegal roadblock. When the RPF vehicle returned from the headquarters of UNAMIR, it was again stopped by the MRND-CDR youth. When the RPA soldiers tried to pass they were shot at by the gendarmes who had led an ambush nearby. The RPA returned fire and they drove home. The gendarmes continued shooting and bullets hit the CND building in which the RPF officials reside. Contrary to reports by Radio Kigali nobody was injured by the bullets during the exchange of fire. The only casualty reported was the person cut with a panga by the MRND-CDR youthwingers. According to UNAMIR regulations, demonstrations are supposed to take place 1.5 km away from the RPF residence. But the MRND-CDR activists have been staging their demonstration close to the RPF residence in order to provoke RPF soldiers guarding the place. Today's illegal roadblock was erected only 100 meters from the main entrance to the CND building. Meanwhile, reports from Kigali say that the presidential guards and the gendarmes have started vacating their families from the area. The presidential guards are said to be spreading rumors that RPF soldiers are planning to do something tonight, which is something the presidential guards did not explain. Other members of presidential guards in civilian clothes are reported to have spent the day making reconnaissance around the RPF residence at CND. Following President Habyarimana's move to block the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions, there have been increasing acts of provocation by MRND-CDR activists and these are now being joined by the government forces, the gendarmes, and presidential guards.
