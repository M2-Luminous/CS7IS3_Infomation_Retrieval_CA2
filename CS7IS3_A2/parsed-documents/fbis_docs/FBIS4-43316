But, in a speech in northern Italy, Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, one of the three allies in Berlusconi's conservative administration, said the European vote would "change not a comma" in the government's and the country's situation, whatever the result. According to Berlusconi, he is hoping that the majority -- the Northern League, his own Forza Italia and the hard-right National Alliance -- would win sufficiently well to increase the government's authoritativeness. Another hope he expressed on RAI, the public broadcasting corporation's "Electoral Tribune" series, was that the result may achieve a greater compactness in the government's ranks, which have often seemed riven by emerging dissent. Apparently to further this aim, he told a news and chat show on one of the Fininvest channels that Bossi and the Northern League, like the judiciary, had played an important role in making Italy's change of the political guard possible. In another nod in the League's direction, Berlusconi said he favours greater regional autonomy and a fiscal system that starts from the periphery. In other points, he appealed to moderately conservative Catholics to join what he said was a "moderate majority." In the RAI interview, Berlusconi said he hopes the Italian MEPs who go to Strasbourg will be able to represent the citizens' interests by pursuing continuity in renewal. Bossi's speech stressed that Sunday's vote is important for creating a true "law-making" European parliament which will make "good laws" for Europe. He also accused the powers-that-be in Europe of wanting to avoid giving the assembly law-making powers. He also warned against voting for Forza Italia. "Anyone who votes for Forza Italia," he asserted, "knows perfectly well what's behind it. Let's stop being hypocritical. It's the old that is coming back." In other points, he justified his alliance with Forza Italia and the National Alliance for the March 27 general elections by saying he was hoping to beat Berlusconi once he had gained an improved position. "We are guaranteeing governability," he said, "but we don't intend to be subordinate to anyone."
