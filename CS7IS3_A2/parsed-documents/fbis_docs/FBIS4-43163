This visit, revealed by Europe 1 television, provoked the protests of the families of the victims in the explosion of the UTA aircraft. The interior minister's statement is all the more surprising given that the Libyan eminence did not spend his Parisian weekend in a suspect little hotel, but at the Crillon Hotel on Place de la Concorde, some hundreds of meters away from his ministry. A Parisian palace where this type of visit rarely goes undetected by the Directorate of Territorial Security (DST) counterespionage agents. It is the French Embassy in Tripoli that granted a visa to the Libyan minister who wished to transit Paris, on his way to South Africa and back. The granting of the visa was the object of a telegram addressed by the French ambassador to the Foreign Ministry, which sent a copy to the Interior Ministry and to the air and border police, as stipulated in administrative procedures. Therefore, there are just two hypotheses left: either Charles Pasqua is fooling us, or he does not read the reports of his own services. Both hypothese are not very reassuring with regard to someone who once upon a time was most concerned about "terrorizing the terrorists."
