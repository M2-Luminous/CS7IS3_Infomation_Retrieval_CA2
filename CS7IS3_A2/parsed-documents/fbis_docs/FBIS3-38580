[Kooijmans] Originally Benelux was set up as an economic cooperative association. In the meantime the European Union has taken over a large part of its tasks, to such a degree that you could even say that the European Union train has taken over the Benelux truck. Soon Benelux will have existed for fifty years. For me and my colleagues in the other countries that is reason to examine the future of the association. You should never throw away old shoes before you have looked to see whether they could be used for something. We must examine the other fields where Benelux cooperation could be useful now that the economic factor has dropped away. I am thinking in particular of problems which did not arise at the time when it was set up, like environmental pollution. [Hubo] "I am against a Benelux process, because in it the Walloons are the Italian-speaking Swiss who paddle on Lake Lugano," Guy Spitaels said two years ago, expressing the Walloon fear of being pushed aside. Is the present combination of countries the most fortunate? [Kooijmans] I have no fixed opinion on that. I do think we should realize that we are in a small corner of Europe with three countries which largely have a shared historical background, no matter how differently they subsequently developed. We are also squeezed between a large Germany and a large France. In this context the Benelux association creates a frame of reference where you recognize each other's problems as small countries. [Hubo] At present Europe is showing itself to be painfully impotent where peace and security in its own part of the world are concerned. Can the small countries still play a role in controlling these problems? [Kooijmans] Of course, they can. Take the former Yugoslavia. Both the Netherlands and Belgium have many troops in Bosnia. That also gives them the right to express their opinion. I do not believe that our role is less important because we are small. We are not able to solve the political problem. To do so it is necessary for the European Union to speak with a single voice, which is not the case at present. But to achieve a single European position, the votes of both the large and small countries are important. [Hubo] While a number of allies are considering withdrawing their troops from Bosnia, the Netherlands is increasing its contribution by 1,150 combat troops. [Kooijmans] These troops will protect the safe areas. I do not think you can say: We are going to withdraw our troops and abandon the people to their fate. For me withdrawal is not an option at present. Just speculating about withdrawal will make the will for peace decline. I am calling for an increase in pressure for using air strikes. You should not think of a military intervention like in Kuwait. Of course that is impossible in a civil war in a country where everyone will have to continue to live together. But we must show that we are actually implementing the mandate which we have been given, and that we will not be put off by the slightest little group of local militants. That is how you can strengthen both your authority and the will to reach a solution at the negotiating table. [Hubo] The situation has become blocked again. How can it be unblocked? [Kooijmans] I think that the United States should be more clearly present involved in the negotiation process. We should not ask the United States to supply ground troops, but it would be very important if the Americans, who now have an observer's position in the negotiations, would commit themselves more. That would have an effect on the Muslims, who regard participation by the United States in any settlement essential for their security. That would also have an effect on the Serbs. They could hope that a softening of the sanctions, which is now rejected by the United States, could become open to discussion.
