FR941007-2-00065 FR941007-2-00039 [PR Docket No. 94&hyph;108; DA 94&hyph;1055] Commercial Mobile Radio Services; New York State Petition for Authority to Regulate Commercial Mobile Radio Service Rates AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice; extension of time. SUMMARY: The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the authority to continue regulating intrastate rates. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in this proceeding in partial response to a request filed by the New York Public Service Commission. This extension will provide interested parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies on the issues we raised in this proceeding. DATES: Reply comments must be filed on or before October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send reply comments to the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regina Harrison, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Matter of Petition for New York State Public Service Commission to Extend Rate Regulation; Order Adopted: September 26, 1994; Released: September 26, 1994. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. Petitioner New York Public Service Commission (New York) has filed a motion for a 30-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments. 1 For the reasons given below, we grant New York some, but not all, of the relief requested. 1 Motion for Extension of Time in Which To File Comments of New York State Public Service Commission (dated Sept. 23, 1994) (Motion). 2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory authority by filing a properly supported petition for the FCC. 2 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a stay statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to decide any reconsideration. New York filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules, 3 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies. 2 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, Title VI, 6002(b)(2), 107 State. 312, 392 (1993), amending Section 332(c)(3) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. ยง332(c)(3). 3 Second Report and Order, Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services, 9 FCC Rcd 1411, 1522&hyph;23 (1994), 59 Fed. Reg. 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) (to be codified at 47 CFR 20.13). 3. New York states that it needs the requested extension in order to have as much time to respond to the opposition as other parties were given to respond to its petition. It states that it needs the additional time in order to read and respond to the voluminous and complex comments filed. It observes that very few of the parties served New York with their pleadings and that it did not receive a full set until September 22. It states that an extension will not undermine the Commission's ability to complete the proceeding on a timely basis. New York claims that the complexity of the issues and the fundamental state interests at stake demonstrate that good cause exists for an extension. 4 4 Motion at 1&hyph;2. 4. We agree with New York that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues, including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate. For these reasons, we conclude that an extension of time would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in a large, complex proceeding. Granting an extension as long as New York requests could impair the Commission's ability to comply with the statutory deadlines. For these reasons, we find that good cause has been shown for an extension of 15 days. This doubles the reply period permitted to a total of 30 days. 5. Pursuant to Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 5 we GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART the Motion of the New York Public Service Commission for Extension of Time in Which to File Comments TO THE EXTENT INDICATED HEREIN, AND HEREBY EXTEND the period for filing replies UNTIL October 19, 1994. 5 47 CFR 1.46.
