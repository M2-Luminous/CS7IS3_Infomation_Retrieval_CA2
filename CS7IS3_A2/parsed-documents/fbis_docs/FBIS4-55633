LE SOIR said, quoting well-informed sources, that during an attempt to thwart the sale of 30kg of false gold, Belgian security forces discovered documents allegedly referring to plans of purchasing weapons for use in a "coup attempt" at run-off elections on May 29. The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details or evidence confirming the news. Police will do their utmost to prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said.
