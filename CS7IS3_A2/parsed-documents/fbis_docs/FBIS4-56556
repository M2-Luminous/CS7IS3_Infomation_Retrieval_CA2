Gen. Ortega's retirement was agreed on yesterday during a "top-level closed-door meeting" held at the Olof Palme Convention Center under tight security. Attending the meeting were members of the Executive Branch, the National Assembly Blocs Assembly, and the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General Staff. Among those attending were Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, National Assembly Representatives Luis Humberto Guzman, Sergio Ramirez, Frank Duarte, and Ivan Salvador Madriz. Also present were Gen. Ortega and the EPS top command. Our source told this newspaper that President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro will announce the decision on an unspecified date. It is believed this could be on 2 September, during the Army Day celebration. One of the participants of the meeting told BARRICADA that the points the Executive Branch brought to the fore were related to the Military Organization Code, the deadline for Gen. Ortega's retirement, and the situation of terror that exists in the country's northern region. That highly reliable source said Gen. Ortega seemed at ease when talking of his departure, "which will take place on 21 February 1995." President Chamorro will announce Gen. Ortega's retirement and the name of his replacement, once the National Assembly approves the Military Code. "Chamorro may make the announcement on 2 September during the Armed Forces anniversary, the source said. On that same date, President Chamorro announced Gen. Ortega would step down in 1994, prompting a violent reaction by the EPS, which was taken by surprise. When asked by BARRICADA, Gen. Ortega said the topic of the Army had been discussed "very superficially" during the meeting, downplaying the importance of the matter. "These were general topics, first to work out final aspects of the law we have drafted and which will be in the Assembly in a few days. Second, we discussed the conflict in the north," the EPS chief stated. "The idea is to submit the bill for the consideration of the National Assembly so we can have a law based on a consensus between state branches within a sensible period of time," he added. Deputies Roberto Urroz and Adolfo Jarquin of the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement and Social Democratic Party, respectively, felt this is positive solution to the existing problem. When commenting on the matter, Urroz said a source of tension will be eliminated and "once Ortega's replacement is announced, he will be the one to take over the reigns of the EPS."
