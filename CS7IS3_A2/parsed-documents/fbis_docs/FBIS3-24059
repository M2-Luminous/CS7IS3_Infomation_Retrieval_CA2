Petrov: "The Future Is for the APR [Agrarian Party of Russia], Believe Oblast Conference Delegates"] [Text] The regional section of the Agrarian Party of Russia, is perhaps the youngest in the multiparty list of the Smolensk region. Organizationally, it was formed a little over a month ago. However, in its numbers (around 400 members), the APR is far from being in last place. And this is understandable: Our oblast has long been called agrarian. Moreover, the APR won a certain authority in Russia during the elections to the State Duma, where it received representation among eight parties and movements. Organizations of the APR have been created in 70 regions of Russia. This fact was reiterated at the recently held oblast conference of the APR. The chairman of the party organization, A. S. Ignatenkov, justifying the need for unification of agrarians of the Smolensk region into a party, recalled the oblast conference on agriculture which was held two years ago. Even at that time the conclusion was drawn that reforms are being implemented not in the interests of the farm workers. A coordinating committee was elected, which prepared documents containing proposals and demands of the rural residents to the local administration and the government, organized picketing, etc. The result was zero. Evidently, they made the rounds of the offices and pleaded in vain. It was necessary to opt for extreme measures--not to supply products. But, on the other hand, the coordinating committee did not have any powers and authorities. The creation of the party introduces the work on defending the interests of the peasantry into a constitutional channel. This was the specific guideline during the creation of the APR by its founders, among which the main role belonged to the trade unions and the Ministry of Agriculture. A. Rutskoy was also of great help. What is the APR trying to achieve, and what are its tasks today? First of all, it is necessary to stop the disintegration and the pilferage of agricultural structures which had been decades in the making. The head of the Smolensk organization of the APR, A. S. Ignatenkov, has long been well known, including also outside the oblast, as the chairman of the leading kolkhoz "Zarya" in Pochinkovskiy Rayon. The achievements of this farm in the sphere of production as well as in the social-domestic sphere were widely publicized not only in the local, but also in the central press. However, in the words of A. S. Ignatenkov, it was not necessary to do anything brilliant in order to obtain 40 quintals of grain crops from a hectare and a 4,000 liter milk yield. The main thing was that a good material base was created and, were it not for the reforms, not tens but hundreds of farms in the oblast would have such indicators today. We could feed not only ourselves, but Poland too. Yet today even the recent "beacons" cannot make ends meet: The problem lies in selling the produced product, in getting money for it. The statements of farm managers F. S. Vasilyev and V. D. Komarova, who are well known in the Smolensk region, resounded with concern already for the near future of the farm. Oblast leaders today have forgotten their pre-electoral promises to see to the needs of the peasants. Despite the invitations, not one administration representative came to the conference. To hear them talk--everything is fine with us. Yet catastrophe is not far away--there is simply nothing with which to sow the current Spring planting in the Smolensk region, not to mention the problems with equipment, spare parts and fuel. Where and for what means are the current joint-stock companies supposed to buy all of this, if even an excellent flax crop, for which medals were given before, brings only losses? The APR does not have time for political discussions. It does not aspire to any bright color in today's political spectrum. Its goals and tasks are in keeping with those facing the trade unions. And it is no accident that the trade unions are among the founders of the party, and it is no accident that at the conference (it was held in the oblsovprof [oblast soviet of trade unions]) the tasks for creating and stepping up the actions of the local APR organizations were placed before the trade union raykom [rayon committee] chairmen. Speaking at the conference, the oblast committee chairman of the trade union of workers in the agricultural industry, V. A. Yakovlev (he is also the co-chairman of the oblast organization of the APR), noted that the APR is a party not only of farm workers, but of everyone who holds dear the needs of our farms. Ultimately, the well-being of everyone depends on the degree to which these needs are met. This is specifically why the future is for the APR. And we do not need to forcefully drag anyone into the party, to inflate its membership numbers. The Agrarian Party is open to constructive cooperation with all parties and movements, but will not itself seek alliance with anyone. For now, the agrarians are in closest contact with the communists. A separate point on the conference agenda was the question of nominating candidates to the oblast duma. An agreement was reached on support of previously nominated candidates by the APR. It turned out that among these were also the heads of the Rudnanskiy, Pochinkovskiy and Kholm-Chirkovskiy administrations. The candidates for deputy in the oblast duma nominated by the APR were P. Ye. Demyanov (Yartsevo) and V. A. Yakovlev. An oblast organization council was created at the conference, and all participations were given party tickets of a pleasant green color. We have only to hope that the Agrarian Party will be able to help the peasants as well as us, the city residents, to live through the current difficult times.
