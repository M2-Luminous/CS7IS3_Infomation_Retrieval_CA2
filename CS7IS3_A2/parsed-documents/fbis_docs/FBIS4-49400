"It world be regrettable if the actions of one individual, Michael Fay, who had transgressed Singapore law and been punished according to the law, were allowed to affect bilateral relations," a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said. Singapore had to enforce its laws impartially, whether Singaporeans, Americans or other foreigners were involved, he stressed. The spokesman made the comments when responding to the statement by Christine Shelly, acting spokesperson for the U.S. State Department on Thursday [5 May]. In her statement, Christine Shelly said that Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord met with Singapore Ambassador to the United States S.R. Nathan on Thursday and informed the ambassador that President Bill Clinton "was very disappointed" by Singapore's decision to "deny clemency to Michael Fay". Fay, 18, was caned at the Queenstown Remand Prison in Singapore on Thursday for vandalism. He was originally sentenced to six strokes of caning in early March. But the Singapore Government announced on Wednesday that the country decided exceptionally to reduce the punishment from six to four strokes of the cane to accommodate Clinton's concern over the case. Clinton had written to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong, asking for commuting Fay's sentence of the cane and expressed his concerns over the case three times in the public. In his meeting with Ambassador Nathan, which was described as "frank and candid", Lord also warned that this incident of Fay "will have to be taken into account in the overall relationship between the U.S. and Singapore," Shelly said. The spokesman of Singapore Foreign Ministry said however that he believed that U.S.-Singapore ties "were robust enough to weather any difficulties caused by Michael Fay's caning." "The U.S. and Singapore have always enjoyed a strong relationship, based on many common interests and shared strategic objectives," he said. He said he hoped that "both sides would focus on their larger mutual interests and put this incident behind them".
