Even when the former union was undivided and all its nuclear electric power stations [AES] were operating normally, insufficient orders could be found to operate the plant and its production capacities to the full. The Chernobyl catastrophe and the subsequent suspension of construction of new AES power units for an unspecified time undermined the already shaky economy of the enterprise. [Video shows workers handling metal rods and components on a production floor] Today its main output, components for nuclear reactors, makes up only 22 percent of its overall production volume. The plant found itself unable to maintain its enormous auxiliary capacities. When this happened three years ago it was decided to shift them into independent organizations with their own full measure of responsibility and an independent bank account. They were told in as many words: So, if you want to survive, here is the necessary minimum order from the plant, find the rest of your profits yourselves. [video cuts to show Foshenko interviewing V. N. Sukhoverkhov, general director of the ``Atomenergomash'' Production Association] [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] My main task is marketing. I mean looking for orders and markets for the products of the enterprises comprising the production association, now and in the future. I have absolutely no interest in anything concerning the internal operations of these enterprises. [end recording; video cuts to show a worker handling automobile window glass] So machine tools and equipment not related to the basic needs of nuclear power engineering appeared on the previously empty production floors of the enterprise, which never did reach design capacity. A wood processing shop began turning out furniture; production started of glass for all types of automobiles, including imported ones; a sausage shop, and a shop for plastic goods were inaugurated; and a whole plant for disposable syringes was built. [video again shows Sukhoverkhov] [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] As far as our prospects are concerned, they include the preparing the way for the creation of new production facilities. We are seeking to attract investors to build these new production facilities. [end recording] From a previously unified plant, six production groups were formed. They remain, however, a single production mechanism. Next year it is planned to double the number of these enterprise.
