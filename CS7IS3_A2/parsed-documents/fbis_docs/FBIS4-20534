FRANKFURT. The first, fully functional 64-Mbit memory chips, developed jointly by Siemens and IBM, have now been delivered to key customers. The sampling and examination of the chips should provide information on what and where changes are to be made. In its newsletter of January 1994, Siemens reported that following a successful pilot run, the technology will be converted into a production line, which will require investments of about one billion US dollars. Subsequent technological advances, such as the joint development by IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba of circuits having structural widths of 0.25 micrometers, will then be undertaken in Dresden as well. The market research company, Dataquest, predicts that by 1997, as many as 40 million 64-Mbit chips may have been sold on the world market.
