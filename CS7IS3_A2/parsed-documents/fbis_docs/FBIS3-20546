Enterprise mergers and acquisitions are a means of foreign trade reform and a key instrument of accelerating the development of a socialist market economy by combining the transfer of ownership rights with the optimization of resource allocation. Last June, for instance, China Metals Import and Export Corporation merged with the Siping City Tungsten Molybdenum Materials Company and in November China Chemical Industrial Import and Export Corporation merged with the Siping City United Chemical Industrial Works and Siping City Pharmaceutical Company. Earlier in January last year, Ningxia Metals Import and Export Corporation acquired Yinchuan Calcium Carbide Factory. Reportedly a number of foreign trade enterprises are actively considering and making plans to merge with or acquire industrial enterprises. I Enterprise mergers and acquisitions are governed by the "Regulations on Changing the Operating Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." Under Article 16, for example, "Enterprises may acquire other enterprises in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation and compensation. The transaction shall be reported to the government department in charge for record purposes." Article 34 says, "The government may decide that one enterprise shall merge with another or approve such a merger. In either case, provided the enterprises in question are owned by the whole people, the properties may be transferred without compensation. A merger plan shall be put forward by the government department in charge or by the enterprises. A merger agreement shall be drawn up under the auspices of the government department in charge and after full deliberations by all parties involved. The creditor's rights and liabilities of the original enterprises shall be assumed by the enterprise created by the merger." "An enterprise may acquire other enterprises on its own initiative. Acquisition is a form of merger with compensation. Enterprise acquisitions must be approved by the government department in charge. The creditor's rights and liabilities of the acquired enterprise shall be assumed by the enterprise that has acquired it." When a foreign trade enterprise seeks to merge with or acquire an industrial enterprise, it should proceed in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations. 1. About Enterprise Mergers A foreign trade enterprise may merge with an industrial enterprise with permission. As far as enterprises owned by the whole people are concerned, a merger may take the form of a transfer of properties without compensation. A merger plan should be put forward by the enterprise. A merger agreement should be drawn up by the two parties after full consultations. The creditor's rights and liabilities of the merged enterprise will be assumed by the post-merger foreign trade enterprise in accordance with the terms in the merger agreement. The merger between China Metals Corporation and Siping City Tungsten Molybdenum Materials Company and that between China Industrial Chemical Corporation and Siping City United Industrial Chemical Works and Siping City Pharmaceutical Company were processed in this manner. 2. About Enterprise Acquisitions Enterprise acquisition is a form of merger with compensation. A foreign trade enterprise which decides on its own to acquire an industrial enterprise should come up with an acquisition plan. An acquisition agreement should be drawn up by the acquiring enterprise and the enterprise being acquired after full discussions. The creditor's rights and liabilities of the acquired enterprise should be assumed by the foreign trade enterprise in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement. Ningxia Metals Import and Export Corporation acquired Yinchuan Calcium Carbide Company in this manner. 3. About the Legal-Person Status of the Enterprise Being Merged or Acquired Regardless of whether the case involves the transfer without compensation of the properties of an enterprise owned by the whole people or the transfer with compensation of the properties of a collectively owned enterprise, the original ownership system shall remain unchanged despite the change in its affiliation. Also unchanged will be its original independent legal person status under which it enjoys decision-making authority in its operations and assumes responsibility for its own profits and losses. That way we can first avoid putting old wine in new bottles, which would give rise to a new form of "eating off the big rice pot." Secondly, we want to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of both industry and trade. Thirdly, we can keep the more flexible operating mechanism. II True to the spirit of the relevant national regulations, a foreign trade enterprise should abide by the following basic principles when it proposes to merge with or acquire an industrial enterprise: 1. Comply with the principles of mutual voluntary participation, supplementing one another's strengths, and common development. Departments in charge should not practice match-making when the parties involved are reluctant. Practice proves that forced mergers and acquisitions that ignore objective conditions and are based solely on subjective wishful thinking are often counter-productive. A foreign trade enterprise has its own characteristics. For example, it has good access to international market information, varied and multiple commodity marketing channels, and a specialized corps skilled in handling foreign economic relations and trade. Industrial enterprises too have features unique to themselves. Most, for instance, have fixed physical structures, including plants or land, a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, and a corps of workers boasting a fairly high technical standard and practical experience. The two--a foreign trade enterprise and an industrial enterprise--are able to come together, breaking down administrative regional barriers and bridging the gap between different industries, mainly because this form of combination serves the common economic interests of both trade and industry and is consistent with the direction of their long-term development. 2. The foremost responsibility of a foreign trade enterprise, which lies at the heart of its work, is to work hard to expand exports and earn foreign exchange. In seeking to merge with or acquire an industrial enterprise, a foreign trade enterprise should abide by the principle that the new enterprise must be able to increase exports and earn more foreign exchange or do so after transformation. The foreign trade enterprise must strike a proper balance between concentrating on its core industry and diversifying its range of operations, between exporting and earning foreign exchange, on the one hand, and making a profit, on the other. It must strive to diversify into a variety of areas by revolving around its main industry. 3. Take stock of and appraise the assets of merged or acquired industrial enterprises carefully. Enterprise mergers and acquisitions in essence mean two parties trading property rights. Only a comprehensive, fair, and accurate inventory and appraisal of assets ensures the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of both parties and prevents the loss of state or collective properties. In line with the principle of comprehensiveness, fairness, and accuracy, the state has ruled that neither departments in charge of state property administration nor the departments overseeing the industries concerned should directly engage in the business of inventorying and appraising state properties. Instead, it should be conducted by a third party: a property appraisal company, an accounting firm, or an auditing firm certified by the state to appraise properties. 4. After taking stock of and appraisal its assets, an enterprise that is found to have more liabilities than assets in principle should not be accepted as candidates for merger or acquisition. In the real world, however, the situation is much more complicated. We should study each case in earnest and handle it with caution before making a decision. Some industrial enterprises may have more liabilities than assets, but they have development potential. In these cases one should consider their combination on the basis of voluntary participation. 5. Industrial enterprises that have been merged or acquired normally should not be given the authority to import and export. Importing, exporting, and related business activities should be handled centrally by the foreign trade enterprise. Where such authority is indeed justified, an application should be made in accordance with regulations. In the case of industrial enterprises already authorized to import and export before the merger or acquisition, such authority should remain intact. 6. The personnel management, appointment and dismissal of cadres, wages, bonuses and benefits, and social insurance, among other things, of the industrial enterprise merged or acquired should be processed in accordance with the appropriate regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade or the local government concerned. The merger and acquisition of industrial enterprises by foreign trade enterprises is a product of the deepening of foreign trade reform as well as the road foreign trade enterprises must travel to achieve industrialization. China's property rights market has yet to be standardized and the necessary laws and regulations are less than comprehensive, but provided we liberate our thinking, seek truth from facts, research diligently, and experiment boldly, our property rights market and the body of laws are bound to get better and better over time, thus making fresh contributions to the deepening of foreign trade reform.
