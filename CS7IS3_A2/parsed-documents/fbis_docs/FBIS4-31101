However, there will be an increase in price in the summer because there will be a considerable increase in the tax portion of fuel prices after 1 July. The April meeting of the price committee of MOL, which takes a monthly survey on gasoline prices on the world market, the effect of exchange rates, and other relevant factors, took place a few days ago. At its last meeting the group decided not to change gasoline prices on 1 May, Managing Director Gabor Jozsef told NEPSZABADSAG. However, there will certainly be a price increase over the summer, possibly on 1 July when, based on a decision by parliament, the consumption tax portion included in the price of gasoline will increase. Thus, the consumption tax on leaded gasolines will increase from the current 33.10 forints [Ft] to Ft36.90, and the tax on unleaded gasoline will increase from the current Ft28.00 to Ft29.00. The tax on diesel fuel will increase to Ft26.20 from Ft23. (The 25-percent value-added tax is added to all this.) In other words, leaded gasoline will be Ft4.80, diesel fuel Ft4.00, and unleaded gasoline Ft1.50 more expensive because of the tax. At the same time, the actual price increase might be even greater because if summer seasonal factors or other reasons lead to an increase in oil prices, the oil company will obviously pass the increase on in Hungary as well.
