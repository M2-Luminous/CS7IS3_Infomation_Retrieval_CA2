Yakunin described the situation inside "Russia's Choice" as generally normal. According to him, the faction is unlikely to split, even though its members differ in their stand both toward the Russian Government and the possibility of the bloc's transformation into a political party. He deems it inevitable that the bloc should re-evaluate its values in view of its defeat at the December elections. A number of the bloc's members would like to form a rigid party led by Yegor Gaydar, whereas their opponents inside the bloc would rather form a broader popular anti-fascist, anti-totalitarian movement based on "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia". "Democratic Russia" is to decide on the issue at the session of the council of representatives on February 25-26 and then at the forthcoming congress of the movement. Personally, Yakunin does not approve of the idea to form a political party, because he thinks it impossible to produce a larger party than the Party of Russian Unity and Accord or the Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms. He was also critical of the idea to create a "presidential" party. According to him, it would be impossible for the president to form a party without involving the nomenklatura or the Soviet-style privileged establishment, which is celebrating its victory these days. Such a party could be worse than the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he said. Both "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia" direct their activities at preparations for the 1996 elections, he said. As to the forthcoming elections to the local governments, "Russia's Choice" has in fact too little time to make due preparations. We cannot but ignore insignificant programme differences and we call on all the democrats to join together, he said. Touching on his faction's stand toward the government, Yakunin remarked that the representatives of "Democratic Russia" were still taking a very tough stand, although the two political allies seemed so far to share the general principle: to support positive initiatives of the government while remaining in opposition to it. According to Yakunin, Yegor Gaydar takes a more restrained stand, though he also criticizes the government. In Yakunin's opinion, it is unlikely that the "Russia's Choice" faction should split for this reason: The faction cannot afford such a "luxury" in view of the difficult political situation.
