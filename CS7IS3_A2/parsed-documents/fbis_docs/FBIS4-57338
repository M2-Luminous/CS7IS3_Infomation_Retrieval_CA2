[Ipina] The new arrangement does not affect the Law of Ministries structure, which clearly defines the responsibilities of the MDH. These responsibilities--which are substantive and are not to be considered incidental--must be carried out by well-defined executive organs, and the system of secretariats that we now have in the Ministry fulfills these responsibilities. Therefore, they will all remain. [PRESENCIA] But Popular Participation, which had been slated for the MDH, has been passed to the Ministry of Sustainable Development.... [Ipina] Popular Participation is unique. It is not an exclusive function of this ministry, although it is substantive. In fact, it covers all of the state's powers. What in fact was formed was a Technical Unit of Popular Participation (UTPP)--not a secretariat--and a team was organized that prepared the Popular Participation plan, directed by Minister Fernando Romero and supported by the national secretaries. The plan was the subject of a lengthy discussion. It had more than 35 versions, because the president himself took an interest and personally took charge of directing the discussions in a way that could be described as merciless: indecisiveness, vagueness, and improvisation were not tolerated. [PRESENCIA] Will this unit be passed to the Ministry of Sustainable Development? [Ipina] The president is studying that possibility. The UTPP can fit in the MDH as well as in the Ministry of Sustainable Development. I personally believe that it would be better off in Sustainable Development for one simple reason: I am convinced that Popular Participation is something that should be above any suspicion of partisan manipulation, because it reflects the highest and most substantive policy of the state: the development of democracy. In that sense, the UTPP can carry out its responsibilities with a better public guarantee of party neutrality if it is headed by an independent minister and not by a supporter of the government, which is my situation. With Minister Guillermo Justiniano--a man of proven ability and honesty, of great commitment to the country--Popular Participation will have an additional guarantee, visible and palpable--if the statements by the Executive Power were not already sufficient--of the government's intention, decision, and determination that this matter be managed above the interests of the parties. [PRESENCIA] What are the general guidelines that you will establish in the MDH? [Ipina] I am convinced that the standard of living in our country cannot be considered suitable for human dignity. We are a country that is deeply divided into two worlds. One rural, tremendously impoverished by an urban world that feels insecure, but that bases its welfare on the exploitation or hyperexploitation of the rural world. We have a typical case, for example, in agricultural prices which, because of the way they are established, pay the smallest benefit to the peasant. Thererefore, the policy of human development must concentrate precisely on trying to overcome this kind of hyperexploitation of the countryside by the city, which is also evident in that the relatively high quality of basic urban services is made possible only because of the almost total lack of such services in rural areas. We have to lean toward establishing a system of equity in the basic social services and support everything that implies the humane attention of society. Our greatest concern must be to provide water, sewers, power, health, education, enjoyment of and participation in cultural activities, sports, welfare services for abandoned children and for the aged, where such services do not exist or are very scarce, while not forgetting that there are also enormous and complex needs in urban areas, especially in outlying zones, where we are witnessing a dramatic phenomenon. In that sense, our concern for rural areas should not stop at the limits of the urban peripheral world. It should enter it, and this explains the president's determination that there be integrated treatment, rural and urban, of social problems. Both have become so merged with one another that the welfare of one is closely connected to that of the other, and overcoming the lack of development would be impossible without taking this into account. This justifies and explains the Popular Participation Law, that creates the urban-rural municipality, territorialized, which transcends the old colonial concept of the urban area and which gives it the right to concern itself as much with the province as with the classic city. [PRESENCIA] Why is there so much opposition from city halls and civic committees to the Participation Law? [Ipina] Actually, the opposition is not so great, because, in an institutionally democratic country, no one can be against popular participation. There has been a kind of fear and nervousness over losing special treatment that the urban world has enjoyed. Taking into account that 83 percent of the nation's income is concentrated in just three large cities, we can imagine the state of abandonment of the rural areas, not only of the provinces, but of the smaller cities, even the capitals of departments. Observing this phenomenon and assigning an equitable distribution of the national income to the municipalities, based on the number of inhabitants, those who are privileged--the large cities--obviously are afraid of losing out. And as their problems are also not resolved, their opposition or contained resistance explained why the attitude of the municipalities has been and continues to be very prudent. [PRESENCIA] But the government has had to accept the fact that Congress is considering the proposed Administrative Decentralization Law at the same time as the Popular Participation Law.... [Ipina] In my opinion, administrative decentralization, as it is being put forward, was more in response to the interests of the large cities. That is why there has been some resistance. What we are doing now is showing how decentralization at the departmental level does not conflict with popular participation, with the allocation of resources to the basic territorial organizations, to the provinces, and to the small towns. [PRESENCIA] The health, education, sports, and cultural areas are defined. But the others are not: Provincial and Rural Development; Ethnic, Gender, and Generational Affairs; and Social Investment, which includes the funds. How do you intend to orient them? [Ipina] Good planning for activities of the state begins with an analysis of basic social needs. The Plan for Everyone saw this clearly: an extremely impoverished rural area, a great need for social services and therefore low productivity by Bolivians. We saw clearly that we needed to promote and improve rural and peasant life in Bolivia. Therefore, an objective was assigned to a perceived need: to energize that neglected area of national life. And the assignment of an objective calls for the creation of an instrument: the National Secretariat of Rural Development. The same holds true for the National Secretariat of Ethnic, Gender, and Generational Affairs. There are obvious inequalities in our country. The most serious of all is ethnic inequality. The evidence is clear. The great majority of adults who do not know how to read are indigenous. It is evident that there is ethnic inequality, and if we analyze further, we find that three of four who do not know how to read are women. There is evident inequality by sex difference--as we used to say--or by gender--as we now say. In the world of labor, of education, health, culture, sports, woman shines by her absence. With very rare exceptions, this continues to be a country made by men for men, through women who work for them. This cannot continue. The same is true of youth, childhood, and old age. Thus, the Secretariat answers this need, not with welfare (which is the responsibility of ONAMFA [expansion not given]), but with a program for improvement, which is different and which is the responsibility of the Secretariat. In the case of the Urban Secretariat for Urban Development, we used to have a Ministry for Urban Affairs and Housing, whose functions duplicated those of the autonomous municipalities. It was understandable that there be such a ministry when municipalities were not autonomous and mayors were handpicked. But it no longer made any sense once the municipalities were democratized. However, there is a need for a Secretariat charged with improving the municipalities, of strengthening them in view of the need to extend the system to the entire country and not just to a few cities, and of organizing the entire country into municipalities. That is its function. It might seem, then, that the three Secretariats are not well defined, but they are, and although the quality of their services might not yet be appreciated, people will realize how important they are as they carry out their work. [PRESENCIA] One sees in your explanation a logical sequence of the idea of human development. But when it comes to putting it into practise, the General Budget retains the traditional tendency to prioritize economics and politics. Why is it impossible to change that relationship? [Ipina] I believe that, while there is a change in general direction that can be seen in a kind of 50-50 division between economic and social factors (another question is the political sector, which also takes its slice: the Ministries of Defense and Government, because of the problems we face in the fight against drug trafficking, etc.), it seems to remain static because the pie continues to be small. We have inherited a pie, furthermore, that is inflated by a 6.5 percent budget deficit. But we could not continue on with that policy, as it would have caused the loss of one of our country's great achievements in recent years, macroeconomic stability. But when the pie grows, which we hope will happen as a result of capitalization, there will be no reason for the economic and political sectors to grow significantly, and the social sector will be the only one able to grow. This means that if we now have 100, which is divided in 40-40-20, when we have 200, the new relationship will be 20-10-70. This is why the pie has to grow. [Box, p 2] Educational Reform in a few words [PRESENCIA] What are the principal features of Educational Reform? [Ipina] There are two central pillars: popular participation and interculturalism. The first refers to democratization of the administration of education, to the very institutionality of the system, which is to open it to the participation of the community, which must have the possiblity of assisting in educational tasks and in administration. The second pillar is pedagogical in nature and has its major philosophical orientation in interculturalism, which is the soul of Reform. This a novel view of an old reality: the multipluralism of races, cultures, and regions in the country, which we regard as a comparative advantage, like a natural resource, like a group of positive factors that make us better people and, some day, better off economically. [PRESENCIA] Specifically, how will the education system be organized? [Ipina] The reform proposal's philosophy is evident, first, in the opening of the curriculum to regionalization, on the basis of common national roots, so that it not only answers national needs, but also regional and local ones as well. Second, bilingualism where it is necessary so that children learn to write in their mother tongue and acquire Castilian as a second language. The curriculum is divided into four levels: initial, primary, secondary and superior, which is the usual arrangement. The interesting part is to see what happens within each of them. The nonformal part of the initial level will be entrusted to the family and the community; the school will only occupy a year, in order to be able to extend the service to all children. At present, we are only teaching 30 percent of the children for two years; we hope to reach 60 percent soon, for a single year. At six years of age, the child enters the primary level. There are no longer any grades, to avoid truancy and being left back. This phase is conceived as a single level organized by blocks of objectives that have to be achieved by all pupils, according to their personal rhythm, so that groups move ahead, respecting their personal rhythms. If a child fulfills the objectives of one block, he or she passes on to the next. There is no first or second grade, etc., but rather basic, essential, and applied apprenticeships. An entire cycle should last eight years at most, but a high percentage of children can do it in six years, and some even in five. The slowest will finish in eight. No child should lose a year or be left back. Therefore, no child should have any reason to leave school. We want to broaden coverage and retain the child in school for at least eight years of primary school. This assumes that the curriculum will contain an intercultural focus, because regional and cultural diversities, and individual differences, will be respected. At the secondary level, there will be a common two-year period of technical education for everyone, not forgetting language and mathematics. Then it branches out: two years of technical education at midlevel and two years of preparation for university undergraduate education. In this way as well we will be responding to local and regional planning needs, because these technical proposals will be drawn up in each department. Finally, at the superior level: higher technical and standard university courses towards the baccalaureate and doctoral degrees. This curriculum follows faithfully the doctrinal philosophical focus of interculturalism, the soul of the reform. In sum, Education Reform can be synthesized in two great concepts: popular participation and interculturalism. [PRESENCIA] How long will the process of change take? [Ipina] Something that assumes gradual growth cannot be implanted overnight. Curriculum changes will begin in 1995, gradually and progressively. But the institutional changes, those regarding popular participation, have to be fully achieved by 1997. The Technical Support Team for Education (ETARE) has established a 20-year period as being necessary to appreciate the magnitude of the results, but these results will be evident objectively and concretely each year in the way that these activities are carried out. [PRESENCIA] Attention will be centered on the primary cycle? [Ipina] Yes, but the others will also benefit, through improvement of education. Curriculum reform has two elements: change and improvement. The first will be applied radically with those programs that are just beginning; the second, with those that are already operating. [PRESENCIA] You have just returned from the United States where you obtained assistance for education reform. With whom did you meet and what specific agreements did you bring back? [Ipina] Together with the negotiating team, I met with the World Bank (IBRD), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and representatives of the friendly donor countries, who are making substantial contributions to the process of educational reform. We completed the technical discussions and began the formal negotiating process, which ended in the approval of the terms of the loan agreement, which must be discussed at senior levels of the IBRD and the IDB, as well as at high levels of the Bolivian state, specifically, in the legislature. When all these agencies have approved the terms, the donor countries will also contribute, and disbursements will begin according to the schedules that support the various programs provided for. [PRESENCIA] Is the IBRD's pressure over content and form real, or is this a myth? [Ipina] I would say at present they are a myth. The IBRD obviously has experience with educational reform in the various countries that it has financed and when it begins to talk to the Bolivian Government, it makes certain proposals. For its part, the government sits at the same table and explains what it wants to do. In this way, a period of technical discussions begins, in which each side presents its point of view. But there is no pressure. The proof is that we were practically able to, I will not say impose, but rather define our position with total clarity, and the IBRD accepted our terms. The IBRD's position on certain points also helped us. For example, its concern for the self-sustaining nature of the reform in future years, which assumes the existence of a scheme of macroeconomic projections. It was a requirement of the IBRD, and we had to work very hard on it. Antonio Sagasta prepared a study that both the government and the bank found very satisfactory. If the IBRD had not set that condition, we probably would not have done it. [PRESENCIA] Is it true that the IBRD requires a high degree of consensus with the teachers? [Ipina] Of course. Not only the IBRD but also the donor countries and the IDB, who are also interested in the continuity of the process. One of the nicest things has been that for the first time a bank like the IBRD has agreed to finance a project that is not totally defined from the start, but that is conceived as a project subject to modification as it evolves, something that it has never accepted before. [PRESENCIA] Who are the donor countries? [Ipina] The Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden are the three. Other countries might join in as the project develops. They were undoubtedly waiting for the results of the negotiations with the IBRD. [PRESENCIA] How much money is involved? [Ipina] Approximately $140 million. The IBRD will authorize $42-45 million, the IDB $55 million, and the donor countries, all together, $40 million. To this must be added the national contribution, set at $36 million, which brings us to $176-180 million, which is the financing for the start-up of educational reform, in its first seven-year stage, destined basically to primary education in the transformation stage and to secondary education in the improvement stage. After those seven years, we will enter into the preparation and development of the transformation of secondary education. [Box, p 2] "We Want Opposition" Suddenly, Enrique Ipina is asked about a fear that has arisen: the danger that there might be a tendency toward hegemony on the part of the government coalition and especially of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] in the formation of the basic territorial organizations, provided for in the Popular Participation Law. Ipina speaking frankly says that "if we were a one-party government, we could talk about a desire for hegemony, but we are not. We are well aware that, even if we did win 36-38 percent of the national vote, this is only a plurality, and we have formed a coalition government with three other parties that are very important. One of them, the UCS [expansion not available], because of the number of votes it won; the other two, for the quality of their political activity and of their ideas. The MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] is a great party, beyond its voting strength, and the same can be said of the MRTKL [Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement of Liberation] to a somewhat lesser degree." He added that, because of "the way in which the work in the Executive Branch and the Congress is being organized, one cannot really speak of a movement toward hegemony in the heart of the coalition. When decisions are taken, one opinion weighs as much as another, and it is not a question of how many votes one has , but of how right one is." Outside the coalition, Ipina insists that "no tendency toward hegemony exists there, either. On the contrary, we are very concerned over the lack of a political opposition, due to the problems that are affecting the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and the ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action], because when the opposition no longer expresses itself politically, it begins to express itself by other means." This is becoming serious because, in his opinion, "it does us no good either that the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] itself is suffering deterioration because of a lack of vision by its leaders and a failure to adapt to changing times." So that "in the absence of opposition parties and of a creative labor organization, with whom could one discuss problems that affect civil society? A political monologue could easily develop, which is not hegemony, it is poverty, political pauperization." Ipina believes for these reasons that the government "would like to have an organized opposition, find a leader with whom to talk. The same is true of the labor movement."
