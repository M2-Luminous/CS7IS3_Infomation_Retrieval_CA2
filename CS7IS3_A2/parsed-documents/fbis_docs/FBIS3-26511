If Shanghai were an actual sea, it was Comrade Xiaoping's remarks made during his tour to the south that -- like the eastern wind -- make this sea look so magnificent. It is as described by the Han dynasty's Mu Hua [2606 5478] in his "Hai Fu" [Prose on the Sea]: "Raising the hundred-foot sail in anticipating the gusty winds; vast and boundless, the sky is the Limit; it may be calm and unruffled, it may be stormy and tumultuous with waves reaching the sky and suddenly down and gone. Yet, it is the meeting place of hundreds of slow-flowing rivers that help clear away garbage while they flow. It is the broadness, bizarreness, and greatness that count." It is precisely with this "Hai Fu" that this reporter begins his interview with Wu Bangguo, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, on Shanghai's economic situation. Topic of Conversation One: What Mode of Thinking Has Shanghai Adopted in Its Operations? [Wu Bangguo] You are talking about literary works and cite Mu Hua's imaginative descriptions of the great sea. I have to rely on reality. Let me tell you something about Shanghai's actual situation. For the past few years, Shanghai's main task has been the identification of thinking on development. The central authorities' demand for Shanghai has been the "development and opening of the Pudong area of Shanghai and making Shanghai one of the world's economic, financial, and trade centers," under which Pudong has been clearly designated as the focus of nationwide reform and opening up in the nineties. In meeting this demand over several terms of office, the Shanghai municipal party committee and the municipal government, after carrying out numerous investigations, studies, and examinations and taking local realities into consideration, have identified the goals and strategic focus of development in Shanghai. I would like to elaborate on them in a relatively popular way: The first goal is an average of 10-percent annual growth in terms of the gross national product [GNP] to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in Shanghai. The second goal is the adjustment of the industrial structure and industries' internal setup. We are not only interested in speed, but speed with high efficiency. Because of historical factors, Shanghai has been concentrating highly on industry, leaving thus behind a very weak tertiary industry. In terms of development, it will be difficult to bring into full play the function of a city without a well-developed tertiary industry. That is why we emphasize developing tertiary industry and, derived from this very thinking, commit ourselves heavily to the ongoing development of the various markets, transportation, wharfs, and communications. As for adjusting industries' internal setup, we have been promoting the growth of such new industries as sedan cars, communications, machine building, and electronics as a whole, power stations, bioengineering, and petrochemicals. With this move and by highlighting our special strengths and avoiding our weak points, we should be able to develop a unique industrial structure in Shanghai without repeating the patterns of other cities. We should strive to complete the adjustment exercise for both the industrial structure and industries' internal setup by the close of the century -- not only an adaptive adjustment, but a strategic and fundamental one. This is crucial to speedy and better economic development in Shanghai. It is only through these adjustments that we will be able to truly achieve technological progress, enhance the people's quality of life, and bring out Shanghai's superiority. The third goal is the shaping of a new Shanghai in Pudong -- bounded by the area opposite the Bund and to the east of the Huangpu Jiang -- capable of meeting the challenges of the next century. The fourth goal is eliminating the current 800,000 night stools and 800,000 briquette stoves and the basic solution of related problems -- including transportation and housing, which have been left over by history -- by the end of the century. Our targets are that by then, the per capita housing space for Shanghai residents -- both urban and suburban -- will reach 10 square meters, with more than 70 percent of housing units having their own bathrooms and kitchens. Besides, we have more concrete goals. [Zheng Zhong] What kind of measures have you adopted to achieve these goals? [Wu] What will be the main focus of our work, given these four goals? First, we must vigorously step up the building of the infrastructure, which is necessary to improve the people's living environment. It is not strange for people to complain if they have to endure crowded buses all the time. We must also improve the investment environment: telecommunications, power supply, wastewater treatment works, two major bridges, multilane tunnels, the inner and outer ring roads, several expressways linking Shanghai to other places, and the subway. All these cost big money, but we cannot do without them. Without a sound infrastructure, there will be no good investment environment; without a good investment environment, it will be difficult to get the funds for future construction. Today we cannot say we have provided the people of Shanghai with a superior environment, but at least their living environment has improved. We are all human beings. Who does not want to live a more comfortable life? The day has arrived for the people of Shanghai to live more comfortably. Second, we must develop a number of large modern markets, focusing particularly on cultivating markets for essential factors of production. This not only requires that the marketplace covers a large area and that facilities be more advanced, but it also demands greater standardization, order, and efficiency. Shanghai needs to further improve its own financial and securities, nonferrous metal, oil, and other markets. It should gradually explore a spot- commodities exchange and a negotiable-instruments-futures exchange, and it should develop high-standard markets with advanced trading information. At the same time, under state guidance, it should step up the construction of foreign exchange, gold, and bonded capital goods markets and accelerate the cultivation and development of markets for specialized technical personnel, labor, real estate, scientific and technological research results, as well as information so as to turn Shanghai into a comprehensive, modernized market capable of reaching out to faraway places. Third, we must develop in the direction of high and new technologies. This has a twofold purpose. One is to develop high- and new-technology industries, and the other is to apply high and new technologies to transform traditional processing technologies. I have been responsible for telecommunications. The contract on the program-controlled telephone switch system signed with Bell Laboratories covers the period up to 1995. Mobile telephones and cellular phones are all trend-setting things. We will also develop satellite communications. Without satellite communications, the development of financial and futures markets will be affected. Laser printers and fax machines are among the other things we want to develop. I have said that the telecommunications industry alone will generate 20 billion to 30 billion yuan in output value by the year 2000. It seems now achieving this target will not be a problem. The telecommunications output was 800 million in 1991, it rose to 3.2 billion by 1992, and it is expected to reach 6.5 billion in 1993. This industry makes full use of Shanghai's favorable conditions in terms of its human resources, and it has great potential. Our mayor, Huang Ju, personally attends to the automobile industry. Shanghai's car production exceeded 100,000 in 1993, and its capacity will reach 200,000 this year, with 82 percent of the parts being manufactured domestically. Sales by the automobile industry topped 30 billion yuan last year. Deputy Secretary Chen Zhili is responsible for computers, Vice Mayor Xu Kuangdi is in charge of biological engineering, and Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren has control of the power industry. I believe that by the end of this century, a group of new backbone industries will take shape in Shanghai. These are our three principal strategic points. There is a distinguishing feature of Shanghai's work: All the things that we promised have been done. So far, there have never been a single instance in which we did not accomplish on schedule what we said we would do. [Zheng] Ideas are wealth. I believe that Shanghai has found a clear way to develop itself. [Wu] That is right. Ideas mean wealth. I have the same opinion. Even if we do not have any money, we will think of ways to collect funds and succeed. Without the right ideas, we can accomplish nothing even if we have money in our hands. [Zheng] When I worked as a reporter in other localities, people asked me whether Shanghai was performing magic. Formerly, it was like a "pauper" without any accomplishments at all. Now, it has become rich like an upstart, as if it had suddenly awakened from a slumber. [Wu] Friends in other localities say that we are performing magic. Now I am going to tell you the truth. Some comrades do not understand Shanghai. We have two accounting books now. One is a financial accounts book. The finance bureau's accounts book is for subsistence. Frankly speaking, it is not enough to depend only on the funds of the financial accounts book, which are spent entirely on subsidies for grain, diesel oil, and public utilities. For example, electricity, communications and transportation, coal gas, and tap water need to be subsidized. We have a deficit every year. The other one is a construction accounts book, which relies mainly on loans. The first source is the direct introduction of foreign funds. We attracted foreign funds worth $5.3 billion from January to August 1993, and we shall strive to attract direct investment exceeding $50 billion from foreign businessmen by the end of the century. The second source is borrowing money. Building the big bridge is funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank, the 1.6 billion yuan for building the confluence sewage treatment project is from a World Bank loan, and the subway project is funded by a German Government loan. We have to repay 780 million yuan worth of foreign debt every year. At home, we incurred debts by obtaining loans from the People's Bank [of China] and by issuing stocks and bonds. The third source of income is leasing land. Land in Shanghai is very dear. Leasing rental space in Shanghai's downtown area generally costs about $500 per square meter; when calculated using a ratio of five, taking into account an average of five stories per building, leasing one square meter of floor space will then bring in $2,500. By leasing real estate space, we have raised considerable funds for renovating Shanghai's old areas and for building supporting infrastructure facilities. Funds now are the most important consideration for the Shanghai municipality's so-called macroeconomic control. We hold a meeting on managing funds once every week. What we have stimulated are the construction funds. If people say that we are performing magic, we are performing it with the funds until we enter a sound cycle of economic activities. Topic Two of the Conversation: Shanghai's Reform at Its Own Expense and With the Initiative in Its Own Hands Under the Prerequisite of Three Guarantees [Zheng] History shaped Shanghai's role as a base of heavy industry. The development of a market economy gives Shanghai a sense of urgency. Large and medium state enterprises are more concentrated in Shanghai than in any other area. What are Shanghai's concept and implementation in this respect? [Wu] At an economic work conference held by the central authorities on successfully running large and medium state enterprises, Comrade Huang Ju delivered a speech on behalf of the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai municipal government. He offered three guarantees to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council: 1) a guarantee of the orientation of socialism; 2) a guarantee that financial revenues to be turned over to the higher authorities will be paid in full; and 3) a guarantee of the fulfillment of the tasks assigned by the central authorities and a guarantee of Shanghai's subordination to macroeconomic regulation and control. He asked the central authorities to permit Shanghai to carry out reform at its own expense and with the initiative in its own hands under the prerequisites of these three guarantees. Because the market economy has been implemented, it is necessary to create an environment in which enterprises can compete fairly with each other. To achieve this goal, we have adopted three measures. First, to "balance the tax burden." The current major contradiction is an unequal tax burden. State-owned enterprises, which are overburdened with taxes, lost their competitiveness. Leading comrades of the central authorities have mentioned on many occasions the idea of giving in order to receive. The overall idea for transforming large and medium enterprises is "lowering tax rates and enlarging the tax base." Although tax rates are lowered, the state's tax revenue does not decrease because an enlarged tax base produces more revenue. Second, decisionmaking power for exports is given to enterprises, thus enabling them to conduct business in accordance with international practices, to participate in international economic cooperation and the international division of labor, and to tap into foreign raw materials, capital funds, and markets. This is necessary to push Shanghai's economy in a beneficial direction. Third, enterprises are given decisionmaking power in distribution, thus arousing the enthusiasm of enterprises' workers. We put forward the idea of directly linking wage increases to enterprises' economic performance. As a result, tax rates increase by 1 percent and wages increase by 0.7 percent. But the wage increase is lower than the increase in labor productivity. There is no longer a set limit for wage increases. Of course, the most fundamental key to invigorating state-owned large and medium enterprises lies in changing the operating mechanism. The issues of the modern enterprise system currently raised by comrades in theoretical circles are worthy of great attention. [Zheng] Do localities have the power to reduce taxes? [Wu] We do not have the power to reduce taxes. But Shanghai practices a contracted financial responsibility system. It is estimated that the revenue turned over to the state by Shanghai, which has an area of 6,100 square km, might reach 30 billion yuan this year, including 15 billion yuan from the Shanghai municipal government and 15 billion yuan from enterprises in Shanghai directly under the central authorities. The idea of carrying out reform at Shanghai's own expense means that under the prerequisite of pledging to accomplish the task of turning over a set amount of revenue to the central authorities, Shanghai will provide support for the development of some high- and new-technological industries in accordance with Shanghai's financial ability. Such industries include communications and computer industries, as mentioned above. Because Shanghai's financial ability is limited, the scope of tax reductions and exemptions is also limited. However, as far as supporting new pillar industries is concerned, this is of significant importance. [Zheng] Is this an experiment on a selective basis or an experiment to be carried by all enterprises? What is the result of such an experiment? [Wu] The "Regulations on Changing Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" stipulate that enterprises enjoy 14 kinds of decisionmaking power. We emphasize the three aforementioned points. I personally believe that they provide a fairly good objective environment for enterprises. Compared to the rest of the nation, Shanghai's state-owned enterprises are suffering the lowest financial losses. At present, Shanghai's large and medium enterprises are faring relatively well. Those which are faring poorly mainly are small enterprises. Therefore, I told foreign visitors that it is useless to discuss concepts alone. State-owned large and medium enterprises are not a bad idea. Shanghai's overall industrial growth rate is 10 percent, and the growth rate of its large and medium enterprises is more than 16 percent. The growth of large and medium enterprises constitutes the main part of Shanghai's economic growth. As for the reform of state-owned large and medium enterprises, we began to try it out on a selective basis. In the beginning, we experimented with the reform with some enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose economic performance is good. A total of 54 large and medium enterprises carried out the experiment at that time. The reform turned out to be a success. Later, the scope of such an experiment is enlarged step by step. In the end, it will be carried out at all enterprises. [Zheng] Can all enterprises be saved by such an experiment? As far as I know, some enterprises in Shanghai are heavily burdened with debts. They are on the brink of bankruptcy or are waiting to go bankrupt. [Wu] You are right. Now I would like to discuss another idea: Those manageable large and medium enterprises should be allowed to prosper and those unmanageable ones whose debts are larger than their assets should be allowed to go bankrupt before they are reorganized. Some plants with only 20 million to 30 million yuan in assets are burdened with more than 100 million yuan in debts. The debt interest for each plant totals 15 million yuan per year. They were even not able to pay the interest. As a result, we replaced several plant managers. Some plant managers were so worried that their hair went gray. Who could handle the problem? It seems that bankruptcy is a solution worth trying. Some foreigners asked me what we should do if state-owned enterprises experience financial losses. I told them that under the structure of the planned economy, financial losses do not mean anything because the state will subsidize the losses. They criticized us by saying that we treated enterprises like a kind father. The market economy means permitting survival of the fittest on the basis of fair competition. Some enterprises are eliminated through competition, but more are reborn and grow bigger in the competition. But great resistance occurs when we try to let unmanageable enterprises go bankrupt. Having no other, better way, we adopt the method of mergers. More than 100 plants are merged each year. Raising returns through an economy of scale is achieved by merging plants whose products have a ready market and whose economic performance is good with plants waiting to go bankrupt. After the merger, the new plants become even more invigorated. This is also a good way to readjust the industrial structure. There is an iron- clad rule: If you do not let enterprises whose debts exceed their assets go bankrupt, they will not experience a rebirth. Topic Three of the Conversation: How the Organizational Form of an Enterprise Meets the Requirements of the Modernization Drive [Zheng] During the course of reform carried out by enterprises, the organizational form of an enterprise is drawing increasing interest, and people in theoretical circles are raising the idea of modern enterprises. What is your opinion about this? [Wu] The current organizational forms of enterprises are somewhat unable to meet the requirements of this stage of the market economy. To enable them to meet such requirements, enterprises should adopt the corporate system. Enterprises in all other market economy-type countries are either a company or a financial group. This mean that current enterprises should change their form. This is a complicated process which requires a good job be done in many fundamental tasks. I believe that such fundamental tasks should include the following: The key issue is property rights, which serve as the mainstay of the market economy. If the property rights are not clearly defined, they cannot become the mainstay. Government administration and enterprise management are separated in our current enterprises. The state bears unlimited responsibility for them. If they experience financial losses, whom will they turn to? Nobody except the state, who should bear the responsibility. Such a system will ruin enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to compile an inventory and examine the stockpiles and capital of enterprises. Many enterprises do not know exactly what assets they possess or what portion is the state's capital funds and what portion is the enterprises' assets. Second, it is necessary to clarify accounts receivable and debts payable. As I just mentioned, if there exists an enterprise whose assets are only 20 million or 30 million yuan and whose debts exceed 100 million yuan, then we should let it go bankrupt because it does not have the capability of paying its debts. Now many enterprises have chaotic accounts. Although deeply in debt, they give more bonuses to workers than do other enterprises. In this way, the state's assets are frittered away little by little. Third, the accounting measures currently adopted by enterprises should be replaced by international ones. Enterprises now have more than 20 report forms, while Sino-foreign enterprises usually have only three, with which they are able to clearly show their business situation. Because of the incorrect accounting methods, the situation often occurs in which profits show up in the accounting statement despite losses being the actual situation. As for cost accounting, we do not share a common language with other investors living abroad because we have different opinions about what is to be considered a cost and what is not. I will not go into further detail about such problems as deducting the percentage of depreciation expenses and the expenses incurred in developing new products, as well as whether to list wages and bonuses as a cost. It will be very difficult to push enterprises onto the right track if they do not adopt the accounting method commonly used internationally. [Zheng]: What would the large enterprise groups be like when the enterprise's external environment and internal structure are optimized and they have shifted to new tracks? Can you tell us your ideas for the future? [Wu] There are two types of large enterprise conglomerates in the world. The Japanese type is trade oriented. The conglomerate is composed of many enterprises, and its trading companies are very active. South Korea also is included in this type. The other type is found mostly in the United States and Europe. They are industry-oriented large conglomerates. Germany's Siemens and the Netherlands' Phillips belong to this category. They are big translational industrial groups linked by assets. We are now considering merging Shanghai's four major energy concerns into an enterprise group. [Zheng] Does this mean a thorough transformation in the enterprises' organizational form? [Wu] Yes. I believe that enterprises' organizational forms should be diversified. First, there will be many limited liability companies and limited liability stock companies. Certainly, those companies whose shares are listed should be of a small number. Even in Japan, they account for only 2 to 3 percent of the total. Then there are Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and exclusively foreign-owned enterprises. More and more foreign-invested enterprises have emerged in Shanghai. I believe that we should be selective with regard to foreign-invested enterprises so that we can exchange access to our market for technology and accelerate China's modernization drive. The market is the driving force of economic growth; it is also our means for importing technology. We must not give away our capital for nothing. [Zheng] You have spoken with me before about implementing the shareholding system in Shanghai's enterprises. I know that both you and Mayor Huang Ju are ardent supporters of this idea. Now we can see the results of this system. [Wu] When Shanghai introduced for the first time the shareholding system in enterprises, it was an experiment. We only had some fuzzy ideas, not like the very clear ideas that we have today. Today, those shareholding enterprises in Shanghai are lively and energetic. They are growing faster than the rest of them and they are having the times of their lives. The four shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai Handicraft Industry Bureau account for 70 percent of the bureau's total economic returns. The seven shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai Textile Bureau account for 50 percent of the bureau's economic returns. The shareholding system's impact on enterprises is twofold: First, the injection of capital helps advance the enterprise's transformation and development, and second, it prompts them to transform their operating mechanisms in a down-to-earth manner. Shareholders' overseeing of an enterprise's operations has proved to be a very effective driving force. The enterprise is supposed to distribute dividends or allocate additional shares at the year's end. If its assets have not increased or it is unable to come up with the money to pay dividends, the shareholders will call the managers to account. The most important characteristic of the shareholding system is that it is highly transparent. It must publish its balance sheet once a year. You cannot fool today's shareholders. If there is a mistake in the balance sheet, they will jump on it and you will find yourself in a terrible fix. Therefore, the enterprise must improve its management and make public its liabilities, assets, and profit-to-sales ratio. Under these circumstances, enterprises will have to introduce standard management procedures. Shareholding enterprises with especially high economic returns may have their shares listed on the securities exchange. Listed enterprises have a responsibility to small investors. No one is allowed to willfully bring an enterprise to bankruptcy. We must protect the interests of investors. [Zheng] You can feel Shanghai's prosperity everywhere you go. Can there be a bubble economy behind the facade of prosperity? [Wu] I also thought about this concern of yours. I recently conducted a survey, which shows that in the first half of 1993, Shanghai's trade grew more than 38 percent, which was very good. The growth was attributed mainly to consumption by residents instead of institutions, which saw not much growth. This has set my mind at ease, because consumption by the general public is genuine. The ongoing macroeconomic control would have curbed institutional consumption if it had accounted for a greater proportion of the trade growth. This being the case, we are still closely regulating and controlling Shanghai's economy to prevent the development of a false, bubble economy. Topic Four: The Formation of the Great Ideas and Their Impact on Shanghai's Development [Zheng] There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Sit in a command post to formulate strategies." Your command post is always empty; we have a hard time finding you. [Wu] I like going down to the grass roots. Even though I may not necessarily conduct in-depth investigation, the more places I go to and the more things I hear, the broader my thoughts become. There are many talented people in various work posts who have brilliant ideas on running this municipality. These people are in no position to direct other people to do what they think is right, but we can absorb their ideas and use our position to put their ideas into practice. Strategies do not have to be developed in offices or meetings. (At this time, Wu Bangguo stood up from the sofa and walked to a map of Shanghai suburbs, which was filled with closely-drawn circles) I have visited every county in Shanghai suburbs and all the circled townships, towns, and villages on the map. The visits have given me more ideas, and I have a pretty good idea about developments in the rural areas. [Zheng] You mentioned the question of pooling the wisdom of the masses. This reminds me of something I have pondered all the time: Shanghai has been making tremendous achievement based on great ideas. The great ideas are, I believe, the result of the efforts of the current municipal party and government leaders, who have not only carried forward the thinking of their predecessors but also enriched and developed them. I mentioned this in my interview with Wang Liping, Chen Liangyu, Xia Keqiang, and other leaders. They had the same feeling. [Wu] This is an important point. Huang Ju and I have learned much from our predecessors during the 11 years of service here. As deputies, we took part in the formulation of Shanghai's major policy decisions and development blueprints. Many of the measures announced today were not formed overnight; they were the crystallization of the wisdom of past leaders. Comrades Zemin [Jiang Zemin] and Rongji [Zhu Rongji], in particular, dedicated their painstaking efforts and wisdom to lay down a strong work foundation. In the new situation, there will certainly be changes and development. However, we still pay attention to maintaining stability and continuity. The great ideas you mentioned also incorporate another element: We have always upheld the building of spiritual civilization to maintain a fine social atmosphere. This was also the traditional thinking of Shanghai's past leadership. We must be responsible for our next generation. How can we live in a society where parents are always worried about their children away from home. We must safeguard social stability. We will not be able to accomplish anything in a turbulent society. Ordinary citizens will be the ultimate victims. The municipal party committee has decided to ban horse racing, bar girls, gambling, and beauty contests. Some people accused me of being on the left. Actually I am being responsible to the people. No one can control the situation once social atmosphere is corrupted. Things like that, if allowed to develop, will create an underworld, which will produce incurable maladies and exert corrosive effects on party and government organs. If society is in disorder and social atmosphere is corrupt, ordinary citizens will complain and curse you even if the economy is in good shape. A foreign businessman told me he was not afraid of carrying some money and walking on Shanghai's streets at night. Maintaining social stability is also a great idea. [Zheng] How did the current leaders communicate with each other to arrive at a harmonious consensus? [Wu] I mentioned before that I have worked with Huang Ju for 11 years. I know what he thinks and he knows what I am thinking. We have taken concerted action without prior agreement. After working side by side for a long period, we have complete trust in each other. This is not only the case between the two of us, either. Among the leading bodies of the municipal party committee, the government, the people's congress standing committee, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee, it seems that everyone is able to speak freely with each other with an open mind. They deal with problems and do not concern themselves with personalities. They work with peace of mind and do not feel the need to guard against each other. They discuss issues without reservation. Good ideas are supported regardless of who comes up with them. Every so often we hold a meeting to exchange views. There are no predetermined subjects. Participants speak their minds, and sometimes they are able to come up with some good ideas. [Zheng] Will there be new moves in Shanghai's future development? [Wu] The specific ideas for development which were decided on at the sixth municipal party congress are the result of joint explorations by previous municipal party committees and governments, and they have been affirmed by the party Central Committee and the State Council, as well as by Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older generation. The general framework will not change between now and the end of this century, but we are determined to broaden our path forward. [Zheng] This has been a very pleasant interview. Thank you. [Wu] You are very welcome. Please come again for a casual talk. [Zheng] In the old days, I accompanied Comrade Wu Bangguo as a journalist in his tour of five provinces in southwestern China. At the time, it was called lateral association, which was part of the activities within the framework of a planned economy. Since then, I have become better acquainted with him and have learned more about him. We are able to talk for long hours at a time when we meet on occasion. I have often been moved by his humility and by his strict self-discipline. I often admire his original and penetrating views but have not had a chance to publish them in the press. This was because he asked me on those occasions to chat with him as a friend, not as a journalist doing an interview. On this particular occasion, I spoke with him about many problems related to Shanghai's development at the request of a Beijing magazine. Because some of the subjects discussed are rarely known about by the people, I have recorded the interview with Comrade Bangguo for the benefit of our readers. He has not reviewed the transcript. I wonder whether he will take offense.
