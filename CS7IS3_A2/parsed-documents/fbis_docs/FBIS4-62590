Vladimir Kazimirov Proposes Phased Settlement of Conflict"] [Text] The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which was never resolved under the Union, is our most difficult legacy. The six years of confrontation have accounted for around 30,000 lives. Hundreds of thousands of people have been turned into refugees. Time has also been lost today. Literally the entire world -- through the efforts of representatives from Russia, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the CSCE Minsk Group, and the United Nations -- is trying to resolve the conflict. But there has been little success. It is hard to change anyone's mind -- there is too much distrust, toughness, and hatred in the confrontation zone. What is happening needs to be recognized in the natural, usual way, this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by Vladimir Kazimirov, official representative of the Russian Federation president and leader of the Russian mediation mission, in the realization that recognizing reality and turning toward peace is an exceptionally difficult process that is made harder -- apart from anything else -- by propaganda. Russia's actions should be particularly balanced and wise -- and this is what it is striving for, campaigning above all to organize good and effective relations (this is its sole aim) with both Azerbaijan and Armenia. There is constant advice and counsel on offer, but only Russia has a conceptual approach, Boris Yeltsin's representative believes. The essence of the Russian plan is to give preference to a phased settlement of the conflict without undermining the elaboration of package measures. We are proposing three phases, V. Kazimirov said, which could either be superimposed on each other or come one after the other. Phase one includes a cease-fire, the cessation of hostilities, and a reliable consolidation of this state of affairs. Like any first step, this phase is the most difficult. Appeals to political, legal, moral, or any other criteria will be useless. All our hopes will be pinned on military-technical measures envisaging the suspension of hostilities, the observance of the cease-fire, and the disengagement of the forces. Implementing this will take just six days. Phase two envisages the liberation of all captured territories (apart from Shusha and Lachin), the rapid exchange of prisoners and hostages, the restoration of communications, and the return of refugees to their homes. This phase will be of immense importance, in both humanitarian and psychological terms. All this will take 34 days. Phase three will be the negotiating phase, during which the question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be examined. Are the sides ready for the measures proposed by V. Kazimirov? The meeting in Bishkek and the talks with Armenian and Azerbaijani parliamentarians have shown that a number of politicians are hesitating when they take a closer look at implementing the move toward peace. And it is not hard to understand that. After all, peace poses a threat to the careers of certain political leaders. Consequently, it is of little concern to them if the continuation of hostilities costs thousands of lives. Only a full appreciation of this fact can make politicians ignore career considerations. Will they have enough sense and willpower to do so?
