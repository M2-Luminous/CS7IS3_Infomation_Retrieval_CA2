In terms of overall satisfaction with a market economy, however, 71 percent of Albanian citizens expressed their approval, the highest result in the survey. With the growth of the economy in that country the financial situation of Albanian households has also been improving. Czechs were somewhat more restrained in their praise of capitalist economies, with 51 percent signifying approval and 36 percent disapproval. In Slovakia the majority in the survey were displeased with market economy (44 percent disapproval, 40 percent approval). Market economy was rejected by an absolute majority of polled citizens from the Commonwealth of the Independent States, but overall the survey found that its support was eroding in other countries as well. Survey results connected the current economic difficulties in the countries with the drop off in support. A total of 50 percent of Czech Republic's citizens approved of the pace of reform, the most of all countries surveyed. Twenty-one percent considered the reform process to be too slow and 18 percent too quick. In all other countries the dominant opinion was that reform was proceeding too slowly. Citizens of the Czech Republic also approved the most often in the survey of the pace of privatization, which 39 percent considered to be optimal. It was too slow for 36 percent and too fast for 14 percent of Czech citizens. In Poland and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], however, a majority of citizens considered the progress of privatization to be too quick, while in other countries a majority saw privatization as proceeding too slowly. The greatest dissatisfaction with the tempo of privatization was observed in Slovakia where 54 percent said it was too slow, and in Ukraine where 59 percent were dissatisfied with the pace of privatization.
