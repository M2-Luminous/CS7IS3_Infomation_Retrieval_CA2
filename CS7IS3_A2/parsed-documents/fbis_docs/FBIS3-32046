[De Leon] I think the yes vote has resolved the institutional problem we had been experiencing since 25 May. The very fact that a popular consultation was held is an advantage for the Guatemalan people. The very fact that it happened in spite of the obstacles [word indistinct] and terrorist acts consolidates the process, because in the eyes of the Guatemalan people and the world, we resolved a problem that had existed since 25 May through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic means. What events? The people wanted a purge, and with the victory of the yes vote over the no vote, they managed to purge three branches of state. The deputies will go and there will be a new Congress and a new constitution. Therefore, the branches of state will be reorganized. But to answer your question, I say yes, the institutional problem has been resolved because there was an impasse. The solution came late, because the people wanted this situation to be resolved earlier. But today the Guatemalan people can have peace of mind because we have turned this page of Guatemala's history and we can now deal with profound issues such as the country's economic and social problems. [Reporter] Did the abstention say anything to you? [De Leon] Yes, of course. First I must point out that today's electoral event was marked by some very special characteristics that led to abstention. I am not making excuses, but the situation must be examined. This was a very special, unprecedented event in Guatemala. From the electoral standpoint, no local authorities were being elected. Residents of municipalities, for example, are interested in electing their mayors, deputies, and president. In this election they were voting for something that was not clearly understood by everyone. There was a lot of confusion, misinformation, or a shortage of information. In other words, the circumstances surrounding the event were adverse. If we couple that with the terrorism, blackmail, and numerous obstacles confronted by the voters, abstention was to be expected. In any electoral event anywhere in the world, abstention is natural and was to be expected in Guatemala. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan people should acknowledge the high rate of abstention and should be concerned about it because, in my opinion, it shows that the democratic system is somewhat exhausted. [Reporter] Do you dismiss the possibility that it was a form of protest against the format of the consultation? [De Leon] I do not think it was precisely against the format of the consultation. I tend to think that on one hand it shows the Guatemalan people's exhaustion, and on the other their rejection of the (?democratic) system. The Guatemalan people are tired and indifferent, and that is dangerous. That is why I say we should all be concerned about the democratic system's failure to give the people the answers they wanted. We have had this system since 1986 when the first constitutional period began following a constituent assembly, and Guatemalans still have not seen an improvement in the situation. On the contrary, in some ways the situation has grown worse. Herein lies the danger, and that is why I believe we should be concerned over today's abstention rate. We must think about the congressional elections that will be coming up within five months and the general elections within a year. I don't think we should have such a high abstention rate. [Reporter] From now on, taking for granted the victory of the yes vote, of course, do you believe the deadlines established in the reforms will be respected? [De Leon] Of course. They must be. First, Article 33 of the constitutional reforms states that the reforms will go into effect 60 days after being confirmed by a popular consultation. These measures correspond to the government agenda for 1994 and 1995, the present circumstances, and the government policy to meet the goals proposed for 1994 and 1995. I cannot give details ahead of schedule, but I can say that they are of a monetary, fiscal, political, and economic nature. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] enjoys full credibility. It is about the only institution enjoying the full faith of the Guatemalan people and the international community. The TSE does its duty. The constitutional reforms will go into effect 60 days after the referendum. The TSE then has 120 days to convoke congressional elections; that is, the TSE could hold the elections for a new congress around 30 July. All the executive has to do is enforce the law and defend the Guatemalan people's interests. But the law cannot be mocked. The Guatemalan people know about the TSE's principles and commitment to duty and that the TSE will do what it must within the deadline. I don't think we have any reason to worry about this. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] In the first place, it is their right to use any legal instrument or resource and to take any actions to oppose the event for this or any other reason. I can tell you in advance, however, that such a move does not stand a chance because the law is very clear. Approval does not require a specific and greater percentage. This was a relative majority. The yes vote won over the no vote by approximately 100 to one. There is no doubt. The high abstention rate is the responsibility of those who did not cast their votes. Those who did represented the rest, therefore there can bae no challenge from a legal viewpoint.
