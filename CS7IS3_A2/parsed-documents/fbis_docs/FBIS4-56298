The three most important problems that have arisen in the past four months in Mexico (the Chiapas insurrection, Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder, public security, and a chain of kidnapping cases) are being handled by special commissions directly appointed by the Presidency. This trend, according to analysts, bolsters the lack of credibility by the corresponding offices, where corruption and bureaucracy usually prevail, as several high-ranking government officials have confessed. It also furthers the opposition's charges of centralism and authoritarianism against the president and his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been in power for the past 65 years. The latest commission, the "Coordination for the Nation's Public Security," was established yesterday, Monday. As an irony of destiny or headstrong interventionism, the announcement of its creation coincided with the announcement of a new kidnapping: that of Angel Lozada Moreno, son of the owner of the most important supermarket group, Gigante. This kidnapping occurred 40 days after the kidnapping of banker Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the group Ranamex-Accival. The new organization, which is directed by Arsenio Farell, who until now had been labor secretary, must "coordinate" the public security-related activities of the secretariats of government, justice, the Army, and the Department of the Federal District (the capital), according to a communique from the Presidency. The president had already appointed a special commission composed of "notable citizens" a few days ago. This commission was charged with continuing the investigations into the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the late PRI presidential candidate who was murdered on 23 March. The creation of this commission took place following the appointment of Miguel Montes as "special deputy prosecutor" to oversee the investigations into the assassination. Montes is still working on this duty. His appointment, which was made five days after the assassination, caused surprise because the investigations should normally have been handled by the nation's attorney general, Diego Valadez. The Chamber of Deputies, where the PRI holds a broad majority, also decided that day to appoint a parliamentary investigatory commission, perhaps to avoid criticism of doing less than others. Many shadows surround the investigations and the way they have been conducted while the authorities, the special deputy prosecutor, and the investigatory commissions maintain absolute silence. The creation of special commissions began in January with the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis as "special commissioner" to oversee the establishment of a dialogue with the Zapatist National Liberation Army, the guerrilla movement that emerged at the beginning of the year in Chiapas. The matter could have been handled by the government secretary, but he, Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, who had been criticized due to his performance when he was Chiapas governor, had to be quickly replaced. According to institutional systems, the matter should have been handled by the current government secretary, Jorge Carpizo. We could finally mention the National Commission for the Integral Development of the Indian People, which was created shortly after the Chiapas insurrection. Four months after the creation of this commission, Beatriz Paredes, who headed it, was appointed, on 18 April, deputy government secretary in charge of public development and no one replaced her at the head of the commission about whose future the authorities have said nothing.
