FR941230-0-00049 FR941230-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD05&hyph;94&hyph;050] RIN 2115&hyph;AE47 Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Sunset Beach, NC AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: At the request of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard is changing the regulations that govern the operation of the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach, North Carolina. This rule will restrict bridge openings in the month of November to help reduce highway traffic congestion problems, public safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational boat traffic. This rule is intended to provide for regularly scheduled drawbridge openings to help reduce motor vehicle traffic delays and congestion on the roads and highways linked by this drawbridge. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on January 30, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann B. Deaton, Bridge Administrator, Fifth Coast Guard District, at (804) 398&hyph;6222. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: . Drafting information: The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Linda L. Gilliam, Project Manager, Bridge Section, and LCDR C.A. Abel, Project Counsel, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History On September 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Sunset Beach, North Carolina, in the Federal Register (59 FR 46209). The comment period ended November 7, 1994. The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. The Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District, also published the proposed rule as a public notice on October 14, 1994, with the comment period ending November 17, 1994, and no comments were received as a result of this notice. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose The North Carolina Department of Transportation has requested, on behalf of the Town of Sunset Beach, North Carolina, that openings of the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach, North Carolina, be further restricted through the month of November. This would help to reduce highway traffic congestion problems, public safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational boat traffic. Currently, the drawbridge opens on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for pleasure vessels from April 1 to October 31. It opens on signal at any time for vessels of the United States, State and local government vessels, commercial vessels, and any vessel in an emergency involving danger to life or property. This rule extends this schedule to November 30 with drawbridge openings occurring on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The North Carolina Department of Transportation conducted a study of the drawlogs for this drawbridge for the month of November and it revealed that the drawbridge opened 558 times in 1992 and 571 times in 1993. These openings exceeded the openings for every other month during the same years. Based on this information, the Coast Guard believes these regulations will permit an orderly flow of recreational vessel traffic through the draw. This should not unduly restrict recreational vessel passage through the bridge, since they can plan their vessel transits around the hourly restriction.
