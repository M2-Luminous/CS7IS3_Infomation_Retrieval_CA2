Although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hoped to achieve tangible progress, due to the practical atmosphere prevailing over the talks, all signs indicate that the Israelis are avoiding responding to any substantive questions posed to them, especially those concerning full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. The Israelis have adopted a policy of prevarication while showing flexibility in techniques only. The stand of the Israeli negotiators in Washington reflects Yitzhaq Rabin's views, which have been described as a halfway policy. On every occasion, Rabin calls on the Arabs to convince Israel that they really want peace, given that the Arabs have repeatedly reaffirmed their desire to achieve peace. The Arab trend toward peace does not need further evidence or proof. Syria has presented a lot in order to render the peace process a success and its efforts have enjoyed the international community's appreciation. Syria was the center of attention during the recent Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. The latter clearly and frankly praised Syria's stands and its true efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. President Clinton totally adopted President al-Asad's call for the peace of the brave--a just and honorable peace that removes the occupation and restores the rights to their owners. From this we can see that Israel's prevarication has certainly not been caused by the doubts it is claims to have on Arab intentions for peace, especially Syria's intentions. It is caused by its desire to devour as much occupied Arab territories as possible under the pretexts of security, given that a firm peace is the ideal security guarantee for all the countries in the region. It is no surprise that during his official address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Yitzhaq Rabin said he is not, and will never become, Israel's de Gaulle, in clear reference to [former] French President Charles de Gaulle's decision to withdraw from Algeria and recognize its independence. At the time, this decision was described as a brave and courageous decision and enjoyed world appreciation. Rabin added: Israel will very carefully explore the road until it is reassured of Syria's intentions toward peace and security. It is clear to every observer that Israel, through its officials, is deliberately raising these doubts in order to put an end to the momentum of the peace process after the Geneva summit and to buffer the active and effective U.S. role. the Arabs understand peace as a full withdrawal from all their occupied territories -- not from half of these territories-- and a restoration of all their rights -- not having them restored in increments. The halfway policy that Rabin is promoting is a flagrant attempt to circumvent the call for the peace of the brave and the world community's expectations that Israel will rise to the level of the Geneva summit and the desired peace in the Middle East. This is especially so since, after long years of feeding the Zionist community on Talmudic illusions, kindling fanaticism, and promoting expansionist schemes, the rulers of Israel have no alternative but to adopt a true and brave stand themselves and confide in the Israeli people the facts of the 20th century and the requirements of peace, the foremost of which is a full withdrawal from the occupied territories and closing the chapter of Jewish settlements once and for all. This bravery, which the world community is eagerly awaiting, has been frankly rejected by Rabin. Instead, he is still talking about the same security claims and fabricated doubts. It is natural for all of this to reflect on the Washington talks and for the Israeli negotiators to continue evading the requirements of the peace process and the necessary answers to substantive questions. Because peace is an important and basic issue, on the fate of which the future of the region depends, the Arabs will continue talks until the end. The next days will reveal the extent of the rulers of Israel's response to the will of the world, the resolutions of the world community, and the results of the Geneva summit.
