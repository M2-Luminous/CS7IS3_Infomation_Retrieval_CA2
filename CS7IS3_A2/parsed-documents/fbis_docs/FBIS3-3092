Minister Qian also heads the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In the meeting, the foreign minister said there is no question that the policy of having two systems in one nation will prove valid for Hong Kong. He predicted all targets provided in the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be achieved by all means, and Hong Kong after 1997 will be more prosperous and developed than it is now. Foreign Minister Qian said the sessions of the NPC and the CPPCC this year were held in an amicable atmosphere as a result of the fact that China's reform and open-door policy has been very effective in boosting the national economy and in stabilizing society and the people's lives. The day before the opening of the second session of the Eighth NPC, the UK authorities in Hong Kong turned over the second part of Governor General Patten's so-called Political Reform Bill to the Legislative Council for deliberations. This is another UK action aimed at breaking up PRC-UK cooperation. The UK likes to mouth the word cooperation, but what the country is doing with respect to the Hong Kong issue goes completely against what it says. He said, therefore, China will not entertain itself with unrealistic illusions any more. Minister Qian said that with the PRC-UK talks forthcoming China had foreseen this. He recalls when he met with Douglas Hurd, UK secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth affairs, in New York last October, he told the latter that at the PRC-UK talks there can come to only one of the two choices -- one is to come up with an agreement at the talks that will enable the political structural framework, which is born from elections conducted from 1994 to 1995, to continue after 1997; and the other is to fail to arrive at an agreement and the political structural framework created unilaterally by elections conducted by the Hong Kong authorities will be terminated on 30 June 1997. He added that China should secure the orderly transfer and long-lasting prosperity of Hong Kong in cooperation with many Hong Kong residents who love the fatherland and Hong Kong.
