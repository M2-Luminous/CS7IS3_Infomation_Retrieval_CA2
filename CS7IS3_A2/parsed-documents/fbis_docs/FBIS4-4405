According to the NAEWOE PRESS here, the radio said about 7,000 North Korean loggers were working at vegetable fields in the Khabarovsk Province after Russia and North Korea failed to resolve the issue of renewing their logging agreement that expired at the end of last year. It went on to say that the internal affairs authorities of Khabarovsk urged the North Korean consulate general in the area to strictly abide by rules on foreigners employment while a large fine was imposed on a Russian industry for employing the North Korean loggers without a proper permit. The Khabarovsk authorities fear that the North Korean loggers may become "second Vietnamese," said the radio, reminding that tens of thousands of Vietnamese people who worked in Russia in the past scattered all across Russia as illegal traffickers.
