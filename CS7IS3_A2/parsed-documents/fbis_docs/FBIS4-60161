He said that the U.S., using its influence on oil and gas consortium in Turkmenistan, was doing its best to obstruct the construction of a pipeline for export of Turkmen gas via Iran and Turkey. The source, who asked not to be named, said the orders issued by President Niyazov on setting up of a gas pipeline to Europe via Iran and Turkey were generally ignored by those at the lower part of that country's chain of command manily due to obstacles put by Washington. The U.S. has so far created numerous problems for Iran-Turkmenistan joint project by exercising its influence. The Turkmen minister of oil and gas is said to be one of critics of President Niyazov's views, having close links with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. People such as the Turkmen minister of oil and gas have recently come out with new proposals that the proposed pipeline pass through Azerbaijan and Georgia instead of Iran and Turkey. The source said that the Islamic Republic has informed President Niyazov through various channels of its dissatisfaction with Washington's attempts to block expansion of ties between Iran and Turkmenistan.
