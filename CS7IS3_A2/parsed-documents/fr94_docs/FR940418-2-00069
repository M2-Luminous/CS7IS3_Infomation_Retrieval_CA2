Take notice that on April 8, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 250. The proposed effective date of this tariff sheet is May 8, 1994. WNG states that this filing is being made to modify Article 13 of the General Terms and Conditions to provide that WNG will file revised fuel and loss reimbursement percentages by December 1 of each year based on actual experience for the 12-month period ended the previous September 30. Such revised fuel and loss reimbursement percentages would be effective on January 1 of each year. This would result in revised fuel and loss reimbursement percentages being made effective on January 1, 1995, based on the first 12 months of restructured operations. WNG states that a copy of its filing was served on all jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
