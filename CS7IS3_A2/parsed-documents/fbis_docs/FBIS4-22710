Ignatenko, Russian Federation presidential representative in Maritime Kray, and V. Maslakov, director of Far Eastern plant Zvezda, under the rubric "Official Version": "The Problem of Radioactive Waste in Maritime Kray Is Not Going To Be Solved on a Populist Wave"] [Text] Lately, kray (and not only kray) mass media have been discussing especially energetically and quite intensely the problem of utilization of liquid radioactive waste accumulated by the Pacific Fleet both in its arsenals and at the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. Unfortunately, a rather considerable number of these materials are of a clearly populist nature and are not distinguished by objectivity or a balanced approach. And such irresponsible statements as "the bay will die and the population will have to be evacuated," give rise to all sorts of rumors and conjectures that any time now the end of the world is coming to Maritime Kray. Residents of the town of Bolshoy Kamen are being especially subjected to this kind of scare tactics. Such a frivolous approach to an extremely serious matter not only does not help solve the problem but also aggravates its moral and psychological aspects and distracts Maritime Kray residents from the substance of the matter and the way to deal with it. It is true that large quantities of liquid radioactive waste (LRW) have accumulated in Pacific Fleet arsenals at the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. TNT-5, TNT-27, and Pinega tankers, as well as two floating reservoirs of PEK-50 type with a capacity of 100 tonnes, are being utilized for its collection, temporary storage, and transportation. However, the TNT-5 tanker, which was decommissioned in 1992, is practically falling apart. These capacities will be able to accept over the next half a year about 170 tonnes of LRW. One would think that we still have a safety margin of six months to take steps in the direction of creating new capacities for utilization or storage of LRW. This is not so, however. We do not have this margin, because 170 tonnes of LRW is clearly not enough to fulfill the current year's state program for ship repair and utilization. Not only will an important state defense order not be fulfilled, but also a great number of Bolshoy Kamen residents will be left without work. Moreover, as specialists point out, it is impermissible to continue keeping TNT-5 in the plant's aquatic area. Its tanks contain 794 tonnes of LRW with a total activity of 0.78 curies. There is simply no solution other than towing TNT-5 outside the plant's territory and dumping its contents into the sea (which, by the way, is what other countries that possess nuclear fleets do). Otherwise, we cannot avoid the serious consequences of the tanker's depressurization. It should be emphasized that today the practice of radioactive waste (RW) disposal at sea in our country represents the only possible way to ensure functioning of nuclear-powered ships and vessels. France and England do the same, as a matter of fact. They have been granted this right, however, under the International Convention for Protection of Marine Environment in the Northeast Atlantic Area, which envisages a phase-out of RW disposal at sea by the year 2018. In our case, the critical situation with TNT-5 is exacerbated by the fact that the Russian Federation government adopted a decision in the fall of 1993 to ban dumping waste into the sea. Having imposed the ban, however, it has not made the second step--offering a solution to the problem. What needed to be done was to provide our Russian scientists with the opportunity to implement their versions of LRW reprocessing and allocate the necessary means for it. This has not been done. As a result, we have a dilemma: either idle the plants and limit the activities of the Russian Navy, or violate the government ban and carry out unauthorized dumping of LRW in the Sea of Japan or other part of the Pacific Ocean. The former "either" is simply impossible. This leaves the latter--dumping into the sea. In our opinion, kray Governor Ye. Nazdratenko, looking into the root of the problem, made the absolutely correct statement that in the event the Russian government does not provide financing for resolution of the problem of LRW storage and reprocessing, in order to avoid an ecological catastrophe Maritime Kray authorities will be forced to order a halt in production resulting in LRW and dump the waste stored at TNT-5 and TNT-27 in specially designated areas of the Sea of Japan, on the concurrence of the president. This is a very important and courageous decision, and all Maritime Kray residents ought to support it. Now regarding waste reprocessing. The technology for its utilization is more or less the same. Solid radioactive waste (SRW)--equipment dismantled from nuclear power generation systems, such as pumps, steam generators, pipelines, and so on--are reprocessed with the purpose of reducing their volume and activity level. SRW is collected in containers and then buried at disposal sites specially designated and equipped for this purpose--as a rule, on the territories of countries that own this waste. These sites must meet a considerable number of requirements that are in line with both state and international rules and terms. There are two options for purification of liquid waste. One is evaporation. In this case the resulting substances are purified water and brine. Brine has a high level of activity, and therefore is subjected to further reprocessing in order to reduce its volume and subsequently bury it at SRW disposal sites. This option has a serious shortcoming--it is very energy-intensive and is not a good solution in the environment of constant energy crisis in Maritime Kray. The second option is water purification through filtration by special compounds. The setup itself is simple: an unpurified water tank, pumps that push the water through filters, a purified water tank, and a control and automation system. Servicing this system is quite simple and does not require great expenditures--in terms of either energy or labor. For reliable operation it requires six to eight persons for a two-shift operation. In our opinion, a temporary and easiest-to-implement version of this system is installed on a pontoon or a barge. In the current situation this is the preferable option. Such a mobile system could play the role of an "ambulance" of sorts--they can be quickly towed to wherever LRW storage is reaching capacity. Regretfully, Russia does not yet have a service (which it should have within the Ministry of Atomic Energy system) engaged in utilization of radioactive waste--both liquid and solid. The leadership of the Russian Navy believes that this is not their problem: The task of the Navy is to ensure defense of the state at sea. Ship-repair plants, of which Zvezda is one, exist for the purpose of ship and vessel repair, and reprocessing LRW is not their specialty. What is the Maritime Kray administration to do in this situation? This is a far from rhetorical question; it long ago moved into the realm of practice. Our Japanese neighbors, having resolved it long ago, have offered to help. Their systems operate not only in Japan and not only for purification of LRW but also for purification of higher toxicity waste. Russia also has specialists and scientists in the area of LRW reprocessing, including in Maritime Kray. What our scientists offer, however, is only at the laboratory stage. It will take time and money to organize a competition for the best project and then implement it. We do not have either. Therefore we see this potential solution to the current situation: support Ye. Nazdratenko's proposal to ask Japan, which is an interested party, to provide monetary aid or LRW reprocessing systems. Bring Japanese firms into resolution of these problems, and provide aid directly to Maritime Kray, bypassing Moscow. This solution, however, also requires certain time: Japanese companies estimate that at least six months will pass between the time financing is provided and the system is put in operation. While the matter of financing is being resolved in the Russian "top echelons," however, the clock is ticking inexorably, and the accumulated LRW will be sitting right in our lap, in a decrepit vessel. Simple logic brings us back to the already advanced idea: While talks continue about the system construction and passions are raging around LRW, we need to dump this waste into the sea, as was done before the 1993 ban. As practice and the latest research by specialists show, the low-activity waste accumulated at the Zvezda plant will have practically no effect on the ecology of the ocean, whose water naturally contains metal salts carrying radioactive nuclides. This is one point. Another is that special areas for waste dumping are designated quite far from the shore, taking into account the current, which will quickly dissipate the waste, practically bringing its radioactivity to a minimum. LRW loses its negative qualities as ecologically dangerous when it mixes with the general background of the world ocean. All waste is stringently documented. And, third, expeditions monitored the situation at the site of waste dumping. Instrumentation showed an increased radioactivity of sea water for an hour to an hour and a half after the dumping. When the LRW dissolved, the water reacquired its natural background level. If we calculate the damage to nature during tanker accidents resulting in oil spills, this damage is far more serious and dangerous than dumping the same quantity of LRW into the water. As to construction of a system of waste reprocessing, it cannot be built in Bolshoy Kamen, which is a densely populated area. This is the opinion of most Bolshoy Kamen residents; they do not object--and neither do specialists for that matter--to using the unfinished complex for LRW storage and processing in Sysoyev Bay. Enormous money was pumped into this complex back in the 1960's, but, as is quite common, it was never finished. It is up to specialists to say what should be done: a new one built or the already existing one put into operation. We would like to see us take an united stand in the resolution of these problems instead of throwing words against one another at popular referendums and in the press. Today, both in the kray and in Russia, we cannot be divided into ours and strangers. The LRW problem is our common problem, our common trouble.
