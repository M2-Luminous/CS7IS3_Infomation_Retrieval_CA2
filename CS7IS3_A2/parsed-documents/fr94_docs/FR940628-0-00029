FR940628-0-00029 FR940628-0-00017 Discussion: The Secretary agrees that the regulations should allow for delivery of loan proceeds by means of a lump sum check. This change recognizes the acceptance by the Department of the ``master check'' concept as provided in earlier guidance. Changes: The regulations have been revised to permit the disbursement of loan proceeds by ``master check'' for a number of borrowers in addition to an individual check for each borrower. The definition of ``disbursement'' has also been revised to include the transfer of loan proceeds by a master check that represents loan amounts for more than one borrower. Comments: A commenter suggested that the Secretary expand the regulations to provide that a student enrolled in a foreign school have the option of having the loan proceeds delivered to the student or to the foreign school. The commenter suggested that the regulations apply to students studying abroad for credit at the home school and appear to exclude students enrolled in a foreign school who are not studying for credit at the home school. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the proposed regulations did not provide students attending eligible foreign schools the option of receiving the loan proceeds directly or having the funds delivered to the school. The Secretary recognizes that section 428(b)(1)(N) of the HEA specifically provides borrowers in this circumstance this option. Changes: Section 682.207(b)(1)(v)(D) has been added to provide the option to borrowers attending an eligible foreign school but who are not studying for credit at a home school to have their loan proceeds delivered to them directly or sent to the school. Section 682.300␣Payments of Interest Benefits on Stafford and Consolidation Loans Section 682.300 (a) Comments: Several commenters noted that proposed §682.300(a) should be revised to specify that the Secretary pays interest on subsidized Stafford loans. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that this change is necessary to prevent confusion. Changes: The regulations have been revised to specify ``subsidized Stafford'' loans. Section 682.300(c) Comments: Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``disbursement'' as it relates to the limitations on interest paid to a lender prior to disbursement of a loan should be restricted to its more ``traditional'' use, i.e., issuing of loan proceeds by the lender, rather than interpreting it to mean ``delivery'' of loan proceeds to the borrower by the school. Discussion: As noted in the preamble to the NPRM of March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12489), the Department's interpretation of Congress' use of the word ``disbursement'' in this context and its applicability to the interest limitation provision were thoroughly discussed during negotiated rulemaking. However, as a result of discussions with the negotiators, the Department agreed to proposed regulatory language that would achieve the statutory intent while developing a schedule for lender billing of interest on the more easily documented disbursement date. The term ``disbursed'' as it is used in §682.300(c) refers to the traditional use for issuance of funds by the lender. The interest limitation provisions are then applied depending on whether the loan proceeds are disbursed by the lender before or after the first day of the period of enrollment for which the loan is intended. Changes: None. Section 682.301␣Eligibility of Borrowers for Interest Benefits on Stafford and Consolidation Loans Section 682.301(a)(3) Comments: Several commenters noted that §682.301(a)(3), regarding the eligibility of Consolidation loan borrowers for interest benefits during authorized deferment periods, should be revised to reflect OBRA. Discussion: OBRA changed section 428C(b)(4)(C)(i) of the HEA to limit interest subsidized deferments to Consolidation loan borrowers who receive Consolidation loans that discharge only subsidized Stafford loans. This change was effective for Consolidation loans made based on applications received by the lender on or after August 10, 1993. Changes: The regulations have been revised to reflect the changes made by OBRA.
