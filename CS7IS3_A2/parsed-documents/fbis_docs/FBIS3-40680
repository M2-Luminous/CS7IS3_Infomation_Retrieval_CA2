Prof Nanjundaswamy told reporters that a formal decision on setting up seed banks would be taken in a KRRS State executive committee meeting to be held at Davanagere on January 9. A seed bank would be opened at Kittur in Belgaum district on January 19. With a view to evolving a parallel system to GATT and multinationals, the KRRS planned to set up seed banks which would help preserve seeds and also facilitate a free exchange of seeds between the States. Already two such centres, one in Karnataka and another in Himachal Pradesh--both called "Navdhany"--had started functioning, he said. The country had been provided with one year time to sign the GATT pact. However, the Government behaved much as a stooge of the World Bank and the IMF by hurrying to amend the Seeds Act. There were reports that the Government was also attempting to discontinue subsidies in some States, against its much repeated assurance to protect them, he pointed out.
