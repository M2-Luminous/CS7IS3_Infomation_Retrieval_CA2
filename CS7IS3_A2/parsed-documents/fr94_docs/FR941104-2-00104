Relating To Exercise Price Intervals on Government Security Yield Options October 28, 1994. I. Introduction On June 30, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend CBOE Rule 23.5(a) to reduce from $2.50 to $1.00 the fixed interval between strike prices. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on July 20, 1994. 3 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34366 (July 13, 1994), 59 FR 37107. II. Description of Proposal Currently, the CBOE lists government security yield options at strike price intervals of $2.50. 4 The CBOE proposes to amend its rules to reduce the interval between exercise prices on such contracts from $2.50 to $1.00, 5 which will establish a minimum spread of $100 ($1.00 times the multiplier of 100) between series. The Exchange believes that its proposal will improve the value and utility of government security yield options by, among other things, enabling investors to construct hedges that correlate closely with interest rates and changes in interest rate measures underlying government security yield options. According to the CBOE, the $2.50 minimum strike price interval is wider than the typical increments of change in interest rates, even during periods of high interest rate volatility. 6 4 See CBOE Rule 23.5(a). CBOE Rule 23.5 (Terms of Interest Rate Option Contracts) applies to government security yield options. Currently, government security yield options are based on the 13-week T-bill, 5-year T-note, 10-year T-note, and 30-year T-bond. 5 See Proposed Amendment to Rule 23.5(a). 6 In its filing, the Exchange indicated that during a recent highly volatile week, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond changed by less than 15 basis points (or $150), while strike price intervals were necessarily set at the minimum of $250 apart. III. Findings and Conclusions The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 7 Specifically, the Commission believes that reducing from $2.50 to $1.00 the interval between exercise prices on government security yield option contracts will further the public interest by providing investors with more flexibility in the trading of such options, and allowing investors to establish government security yield option positions that are better tailored to meet their investment objectives. 8 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 8 The Exchange maintains that a consequence of the minimum strike price interval of $2.50 is to make at- or near-the-money positions unavailable, thereby limiting the ability of investors to construct tight hedges or to use combination orders such as straddles effectively. The Commission also believes that the CBOE's proposal sets a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to accommodate the needs of investors and the need to avoid the excessive proliferation of options series. In this regard, we note the specialized nature of the trading of government security yield options. For example, the CBOE indicates that the current relationship between yield changes in securities underlying government security yield options and the applicable $2.50 strike price interval requirement allows for instances where significant market yield movement would not result in the trading of government security yield options through existing strikes, thus preventing the availability of additional ``at-the-money'' strikes, which are necessary for the effective implementation of certain hedging trading strategies. 9 The Commission accordingly believes that a $1.00 strike price interval will allow for at-the-money strikes to be more readily available, without causing an excessive proliferation of strikes in such options. 10 9 See supra note 6. 10 Moreover, it should be noted that CBOE Rule 23.5, Interpretation and Policy .01 provides an outer limit with respect to the number of strike prices for new options series. This limit is eight strike prices under normal circumstances, and up to twelve strike prices when unusual market conditions exist. Finally, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') has stated that the additional traffic that will be generated by changing the strike price interval for government security yield options to $1.00 is within OPRA's capacity. 11 11 See letter from Joseph P. Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, CBOE, dated October 26, 1994. IV. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 12 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;21) is approved. 12 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 13 13 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
