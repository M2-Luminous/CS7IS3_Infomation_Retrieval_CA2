The Information and Broadcasting Minister, Mr. K.P. Singh Deo, today ruled out privatisation of any channel on Doordarshan. Replying to supplementaries during question hour, he said the issue involved was selling television time to private parties. "There is no question of privatisation of any channel." Several members expressed concern over the "cultural invasion" that was taking place in the country and urged the Government to take all necessary steps to preserve, protect and enrich our cultural heritage. The Minister said if Parliament felt it was warranted, the All India Radio and Doordarshan code could be reviewed. The code was approved by Parliament in 1977. While admitting that there has been a cultural invasion, he said special endeavours were being made to bring out the Indian identity on Doordarshan. Mr. Singh Deo, however, stated that the programmes telecast on Doordarshan were not in violation of any stipulated guidelines. -- PTI
