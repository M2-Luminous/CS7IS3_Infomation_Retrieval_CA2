FR940506-2-00137 FR940506-2-00078 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33983; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Modifications of Exchange Fees April 29, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to establish the following fees: (1) A $350 monthly fee for CBOE members who install ILX/WDN personal computer (``PC'') terminals in their floor booth(s); and (2) a $150 quarterly fee for non-clearing Designated Primary Market Makers (``DPMMs'') for the Exchange's work in reviewing their SEC Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 reports and conducting annual financial audits to ensure their compliance with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective April 1, 1994. 1 In addition, the Exchange proposes to expand its customer box spread fee rebate program, which is currently limited to positions in Standard & Poor's 500 (``SPX'') index options, to make the rebate available on a member's request for qualifying public customer positions in any and all European-style index options. 2 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737 (August 11, 1993), 58 FR 43555 (File No. S7&hyph;27&hyph;88). 2 The current box spread rebate program provides a 50% rebate on transaction and trade match fees for box trades by public customers in SPX options, provided the box trade totals 500 or more contracts for the four sides of the trade. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31386 (February 8, 1993), 58 FR 8639 (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;06) (``Fee Rebate Approval Order''). The text of the proposed fee changes is available at the office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish two new fees and to extend the CBOE's current fee rebate program for SPX options to additional classes of European-style options. The first new fee is a $350 monthly fee to CBOE members who install ILX/WDN PC terminals in their floor booth(s). These terminals, which will replace booth-installed Quotron terminals, will use Windows-based software and will include and ILX window for display of market data as well as a CBOE WDN window for internal CBOE displays and functions. The second new fee is a $150 quarterly fee to be paid by non-clearing DPMMs for the Exchange's work in reviewing their reports on SEC Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 and conducting annual financial audits of such DPMMs to ensure compliance with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective April 1, 1994. 3 In the past, because non-clearing market makers were exempt from the net capital rule, the CBOE'S financial oversight of non-clearing DPMMs was less extensive, as were the CBOE'S costs therefor. Beginning on April 1, 1994, however, non-clearing DPMMs will be required to meet portions of the Commission's net capital rule, and the Exchange's oversight costs will increase accordingly. The CBOE believes that the $150 quarterly fee will recover a substantial portion of the new oversight costs which the Exchange estimates it will incur. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 1. In addition to the two new fees described above, the CBOE proposes to expand the customer box spread fee rebate program, which is currently limited to positions in SPX options. 4 The expansion will make the rebate available on a member's request for qualifying public customer positions in any and all European-style index options. The existing rebate program, which was approved permanently in February 1993, 5 enables members to reduce certain transaction and trade match fees which they pay to the Exchange. 4 See Fee Rebate Approval Order, supra note 2. 5 Id . The terms of the fee rebate and the rebate procedures proposed for all European-style index options will be identical to the rebate terms and procedures applicable to SPX options. Under the current rebate program, as under the proposal, CBOE members may request a rebate of 50% of their transaction and trade match fees 6 assessed an options transactions that meet the following parameters: (1) The options transaction(s) are executed for a customer account; and (2) the transactions are box spreads 7 on a European-style index that total 500 or more contracts for the four sides of the spread (i.e., 125 contracts per side). 6 The rebate is $.22 per contract ($.20 transaction fee, plus $.02 trade match fee) on contracts with a premium greater than or equal to $1 and $.12 per contract ($.10 transaction fee, plus $.02 trade match fee) on contracts with a premium less than $1. 7 For purposes of the rebate, a box spread is a four-sided option spread on a given European-style index that is composed of (i) a long call and a short put at one strike price and (ii) a short call and long put at a different strike price. All four sides must expire in the same month. Members seeking a fee rebate must submit a rebate request together with supporting documentation to the Exchange's Accounting Department. At a minimum, the supporting documentation must include the trade date, the executing broker acronym, and the contract class, series, premium, and quality.
