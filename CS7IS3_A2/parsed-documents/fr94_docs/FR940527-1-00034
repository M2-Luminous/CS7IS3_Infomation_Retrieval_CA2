FR940527-1-00034 FR940527-1-00014 •Conditions that may not co-exist, such as partial/total, unilateral/bilateral, obstructed/unobstructed, and benign/malignant, should not be considered CCs for one another. •The same condition in anatomically proximal sites should not be considered CCs for one another. •Closely related conditions should not be considered CCs for one another. The creation of the CC Exclusions List was a major project involving hundreds of codes. The FY 1988 revisions were intended to be only a first step toward refinement of the CC list in that the criteria used for eliminating certain diagnoses from consideration as CCs were intended to identify only the most obvious diagnoses that should not be considered complications or comorbidities of another diagnosis. For that reason, and in light of comments and questions on the CC list, we have continued to review the remaining CCs to identify additional exclusions and to remove diagnoses from the master list that have been shown not to meet the definition of a CC stated above, as appropriate. (See the September 30, 1988 final rule for the revision made for the discharges occurring in FY 1989 (53 FR 38485), the September 1, 1989 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1990 (54 FR 36552), the September 4, 1990 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1991 (55 FR 36126), the August 30, 1991 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1992 (56 FR 43209), the September 1, 1992 final rule for the revisions made for discharges occurring in FY 1993 (57 FR 39753), and the September 1, 1993 final rule for the revisions made for discharges occurring in FY 1994 (58 FR 46278).) We are proposing a limited revision of the CC Exclusions List to take into account the changes that will be made in the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM diagnosis coding system effective October 1, 1994. (See section II.B.7, below, for a discussion of these changes.) These proposed changes are being made in accordance with the principles established when we created the CC Exclusions List in 1987. In addition, upon review of our current CC Exclusions List, we found that there are some diagnosis codes that do not exclude themselves as CCs. In the September 1, 1987 final notice, we noted that a very few codes were not excluded from themselves because they may signify the bilateral occurrence of a particular condition (for example, diagnosis code 730.02 (acute osteomyelitis of upper arm)) (52 FR 33154). However, we found some diagnosis codes that do not meet this criterion. Therefore, we are proposing to add the following diagnosis codes to the CC Exclusions List as excluding themselves when they are secondary diagnoses: 710.0_Systemic lupus erythematous 710.1_Systemic sclerosis 710.3_Sicca syndrome 710.4_Dermatomyositis 710.8_Other specified diffuse diseases of connective tissue Based on a comment we received, we are also proposing to exclude diagnosis code 707.1 (Ulcer of lower limb, except decubitus) as a CC when the principal diagnosis is 440.23 (atherosclerosis of the extremities with ulceration). The commenter believes that this exclusion is similar to the current exclusion of 785.4 (Gangrene) when the principal diagnosis is 440.24 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with gangrene), and we agree with the commenter's assessment. Finally, it was brought to our attention by another commenter that when a patient's principal diagnosis is complication of a transplant condition (diagnosis codes 996.71 and 996.8x), the diagnosis codes used to denote transplant status (V42.x) should not be considered CCs. Thus, for the following principal diagnoses, we are proposing to delete the indicated status code: •For code 996.71 (Complications due to heart valve prosthesis) delete code V42.2 (Heart valve transplant influencing health status) as a CC. •For code 996.80 (Complications of unspecified organ transplant) delete codes V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing health status), V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health status), V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health status), V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health status), and V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue transplant influencing health status) as CCs. •For code 996.81 (Complications of kidney transplant) delete code V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing health status) as a CC. •For code 996.82 (Complications of liver transplant) delete code V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health status) •For code 996.83 (Complications of heart transplant) delete code V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health status) as a CC. •For code 996.84 (Complications of lung transplant) delete code V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health status) as a CC.
