Political support which we expected to get from the Nordic countries over Russian troop withdrawal has been received and is unexpectedly clear-worded and strong, Prime Minister Mart Laar said. The prime ministers of the Nordic countries at a meeting of the Nordic Council in Stockholm Monday [7 March] issued a statement urging for a quick, orderly and complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994. The Estonian leader in his remarks to BNS today said it was particularly good that the Nordic leaders in their statement very strongly asserted the final deadline for the pullout. [passage omitted]
