FR940831-1-00021 FR940831-1-00009 Wednesday August 31, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Coast Guard 46 CFR Parts 30 et al. Obsolete Bulk Hazardous Materials; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 168␣/␣Wednesday, August 31, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Parts 30, 150, 151, and 153 [CGD 94&hyph;902] Obsolete Bulk Hazardous Materials AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is considering amending its regulations on carriage of bulk hazardous materials by deleting commodities from its regulations that are no longer viable as bulk liquid cargoes, and cancelling the classifications of obsolete commodities not included in those regulations. The Coast Guard is seeking the public's assistance in identifying such obsolete cargoes and classifications to determine whether such a rulemaking would be appropriate. This action would help to ensure that Coast Guard requirements are current and that the hazardous materials tables and lists are free of entries that unnecessarily complicate the Coast Guard's regulations. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406) (CGD 94&hyph;902), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the above address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. The Executive Secretary maintains the public docket for this notice. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Curtis G. Payne, Hazardous Materials Branch, (202) 267&hyph;1577.

Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, on 81/2 by 11 inch paper, suitable for copying and electronic filing.

Related Rulemakings Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register , the Coast Guard is publishing amendments to its noxious liquid substances lists in 33 CFR 151.47 and 151.49 (CGD 94&hyph;901) and its bulk hazardous materials lists and tables in 46 CFR Parts 30, 150, 151, and 153 (CGD 94&hyph;900). Background and Purpose The Coast Guard is seeking to identify obsolete cargo entries in its various tables and lists as well as obsolete cargo classifications for entries never entered in those tables and lists. Upon review of the comments received in response to this notice, and further review of its own records, the Coast Guard will determine whether a notice of proposed rulemaking to delete obsolete entries and classifications would be appropriate. By deleting obsolete entries in its tables and lists, and cancelling the classification of obsolete commodities, the Coast Guard will reduce an administrative burden on its regulatory record keeping and ensure that its requirements reflect current needs. The various commodities are divided into several groups, identified by a number in the right hand column, depending upon the list or table in which they appear in the Code of Federal Regulations, or based on Coast Guard information that the commodity is, or may be obsolete. The commodity status groups are identified following the commodity list.
