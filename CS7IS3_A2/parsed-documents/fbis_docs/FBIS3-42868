Russia inherited from the USSR the lion's share of its nuclear potential, as well as the entire Soviet-American infrastructure of control over armaments, along with corresponding obligations, rights, and responsibilities; it inherited the Soviet doctrines and concepts regarding the use of nuclear weapons, balance of forces, stability, etc. No less important is that which Russia is attempting to move away from, to disavow. First of all, this includes the political foundations of interaction with the United States in the nuclear sphere according to the confrontation-rivalry model, which determined both the development of USSR military potential and its approach to control over nuclear arms. President B. Yeltsin stated that Russia would like to consider the United States its ally, not a competitor-enemy, and would prefer to see international relations develop overall without the participation of weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, this relates to the Soviet style of elaborating and adopting decisions on nuclear weapons matters, which used to be characterized by centralism and secrecy. In addition, the Soviet Union was a stable state, a factor that created favorable conditions not only for the deployment of weapons, but for the conclusion of agreements on arms reductions as well. But today Russia must confront the numerous consequences of the collapse of the Soviet state and manifestations of instability in the regions. Right alongside its new measures, Russia put the American side in quite a difficult predicament, moving it towards equally radical changes in military policy. The future of Russian-American relations, including in matters of armaments, depends therefore to a great extent on the desire and capability of both sides to try to find a suitable balance between continuity and innovation in this sphere. To what degree can the experience of the Cold War period be retained, and what should be rejected? This article makes an attempt to find answers to these questions. Special attention is devoted to three aspects: evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the world; different variations of the strategies of Russia and the United States; the future of control over nuclear arms following the end of the Cold War. The Changing Nuclear Landscape The main attributes of one configuration or another of the strategic nuclear balance in the world should include not only the number of states possessing this variety of weapon and their hierarchy in the "nuclear club" (by size and scale of arsenals of the means of destruction and protection), but chiefly their military-strategic orientation along the ally-enemy spectrum. If we consider all the attributes of configuration of the balance of nuclear forces in their aggregate, it can be asserted that fundamental changes in the qualitative respect have not yet taken place--for Russia's security in any case. All nuclear weapons systems belonging to the United States, Great Britain, France, and China, as well as those located in the former Union republics of the USSR, have retained their previous orientation on the whole, although the number of targets for destruction in their territories is decreasing, and do not exist at all today in the territory of former Warsaw Pact allies of the USSR. As before, the nuclear weapons systems of the United States, Great Britain, and France are aimed mainly at targets in Russia. Their relationships as allies have been preserved and efforts are being made to strengthen them. At the same time, the entry of Russia into NATO is problematic, to put it mildly. Although large-scale in application, the START I and START II Treaties first of all have not been implemented; secondly, they do not affect the main foundations of the balance of nuclear forces in the world. The changes that took place following the end of the Cold War affected the former Soviet nuclear potential to the greatest extent, and the treaties on reductions did not play the most important role here. As a consequence of the collapse of the USSR, the reliability of this potential was placed in doubt, i.e., guarantees of executing combat missions in retaliatory operations, as well as its safety and security, consisting primarily of the capability to impede unauthorized access to nuclear weapons systems and prevent accidental launch resulting from technical malfunctions or errors in the chain of command and control. The nuclear potential transferred to jurisdiction of the Russian Federation lost a portion of its weapons systems and security systems (in particular, tracking, early warning, command and control), facilities of the production and testing base, and means of launching spacecraft. True, as opposed to Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Russia can replenish these insofar as it is denied peripheral elements, but not central ones. However, this requires time and assets. Maintaining the state integrity of the Russian Federation and restoring the high degree of combat readiness of its army will obviously also mean preserving the basic international standing of the Russian state as a nuclear power. At the same time, preconditions have today taken shape for changing the configuration of the strategic nuclear balance in the world. These consist primarily of the political nature of relations between the two leading nuclear states--the United States and Russia--and their abandonment of rigid confrontation. These circumstances place on the agenda the question of a new military-strategic orientation of nuclear potential, that of the United States and its NATO allies first of all, but also that of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Political declarations on their part are clearly insufficient. In order to effect a true rejection of military confrontation, and not just its mitigation, it is necessary to bolster political and diplomatic steps through appropriate measures in the sphere of trade and economic relations and in the specific plans of the military departments. If the previous policy of targeting and selecting priorities and programs for the development of systems of nuclear destruction is maintained in principle, then political relationships too will not be void of ambiguity and will perhaps become reversible. It is clear that the qualitative improvement of relations cannot be limited just to diplomatic steps and quantitative reductions in armed forces and armaments. But if the policy of the United States and Russia in selecting targets for destruction and in planning the military application of nuclear weapons changes radically, who then will replace Russia as the main objective of United States' nuclear restraint and on what scale? And if a suitable candidate is not found, what then is to be done with the nuclear arsenal? Time and colossal assets are necessary for its destruction. And if the American leadership finds a worthy candidate for the role of power to be restrained, will the United States and its allies be able to ensure the efficacy of restraint with respect to other states seen as a threat to the territory and interests of the NATO countries? Serious fears exist on this account insofar as a great deal depends on the perception of U.S. actions in other countries which may be unprepared for the system of already established values, rules, and conventions of confrontation. Most likely, according to tradition, Russia will remain for the time being the main objective of nuclear restraint on the part of the United States and NATO, which means we will continue to see the status quo in the configuration of the strategic nuclear balance in coming years. China may be thought of as another premise for change in this configuration, if its policies come to rely on narrowing the gap between it and the leaders, building up the combat capabilities of its nuclear potential according to qualitative or quantitative parameters, expanding its involvement in regions and spheres of international relations which presuppose confrontation with other nuclear states, and finally, consolidating security guarantees as a result of the possible reorientation of former USSR allies against the last powerful bastion of socialism. Ukraine might move the Chinese leadership in this direction if it succeeds in achieving the status of nuclear power, insofar as China would then be shifted from third to fourth place in the hierarchy of the "nuclear club." Not having nuclear allies and being limited in its choice of military strategy alternatives by virtue of technological lag behind Russia and in particular behind the United States, it could rely on building up its own arsenal of nuclear forces. It seems, however, that this supposition will remain unfulfilled. In evaluating the prospects, it should be taken into account that the United States and China have already established broad economic ties, and despite his preelection statements, President Clinton has extended the law affording China most favored nation status in American-Chinese trade. Relations with Russia are also intensifying, although it should not be forgotten that neither broad economic ties nor diverse political and diplomatic contacts provide a guarantee of prevention of military confrontation. Such a guarantee can only consist of commonality of national interests, a fairly extensive sphere of their overlap. An important premise for changing the configuration of the strategic nuclear balance is impairment of the regime of control and nonproliferation. Interaction between the leaders in Moscow and Washington has its own prehistory in the establishment of this regime. They achieved very great successes here. At the beginning of the 1960's, at the height of the Cold War, the USSR and United States were forced to acknowledge that not only was it necessary for international relations overall to restrict the number of states that might gain access to nuclear weapons, this also conformed to the particular national interests of both powers. The existing regime of nonproliferation is basically the result of bilateral efforts. The persistence of these efforts was a key factor, joining 140 states by 1990 within the framework of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Despite extremely complex political relations, every year the United States and USSR coordinated their policies in this sphere. In 1989 the USSR and United States set about accomplishing measures to fight nuclear terrorism. At the same time, the opinion developed by the beginning of the nineties that the efforts of both sides were insufficient to meet the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons--this could take place independent of the treaty. Certain countries--Israel, India, and Pakistan, in particular--did not subscribe to it. In fact, over the course of the entire Cold War period, a slow but undeviating preparation was seen to take place for entry of new members into the "nuclear club." Today it is not clear whether or not the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will remain in effect after 1995. Moreover, it is difficult to name with absolute confidence the precise number of nuclear powers. Contradictory trends are being seen. Certain "threshold" states which are regional rivals and centers of power have disavowed further development of their nuclear programs (Argentina, Brazil, the Republic of South Africa). This facilitates a lessening of tension on the whole in the regions in question and a diminution of the role of the nuclear factor in international relations outside the framework of Russian-American understandings on military issues. At the same time, other examples exist. In particular, M. Gur, Israel's deputy minister of defense, stated recently that in the event of a nuclear attack by one of the Arab countries against Israel, the nuclear strike in response would cause the aggressor significantly greater damage. Available information indicates that Israel possesses about a hundred nuclear rounds and the systems to deliver them. (Footnote 1) (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 8 June 1993.) There is no reliable data regarding the possession of such weapons by the Arab countries. It cannot be ruled out that confrontation between India and Pakistan, Israel and the Arab countries, or North and South Korea, for example, would contribute towards establishing several of them as nuclear states. Do these prospects truly alarm the Americans, or is discussion of this topic just a means of proving that their nuclear weapons specialists and personnel on alert at launcher facilities are earning their keep? Both are true, apparently. Of course, a few dozen nuclear weapons available to India or Pakistan, Israel or North Korea, can hardly be considered a threat to American territory, even if intercontinental delivery systems are found for these weapons. The interests of the majority of "threshold" states are not anti-American in their orientation. Clearly they do not need to compete with the United States with respect to capabilities, or are not able to do so. However, the point does not lie in the fact that disruption of the nonproliferation regime would make American territory more vulnerable or create a universal threat of nuclear blackmail. For the United States there would be a narrowing of the field of political maneuver, intervention, and resolution of regional problems on advantageous terms. For it is well known that U.S. national interests are not at all restricted to inviolability of its territory, population, and social system. These interests are significantly broader and extend far outside the boundaries of the United States. Therefore, the international relations situation that will prove stable for it will be one that facilitates progress for American political influence and capital and assists in securing a settlement of problems and conflicts that is advantageous to the United States and its allies. Naturally, the emergence of new nuclear states does not contribute towards the growth of American influence. Moreover, it may impede U.S. participation in international affairs and foreign policy initiatives and may increase risk, including by virtue of direct threat of eliminating American military facilities in allied countries. In this manner, opportunities for controlling and managing the development of crisis situations that the American administration considers key in ensuring stability are limited. In particular, North Korea's intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has compelled the American side to make concessions, and in return for agreeing to remain within the framework of the treaty North Korea obtained the right to inspect American military facilities in South Korea. For Russia the problem of nonproliferation is not so urgent. Why? First of all, retention of the regime of nonproliferation has been beset with a great many conditions of third countries which entail further concessions on the part of all veterans of the "nuclear club," including Russia. The matter is not restricted to cessation of nuclear testing. (Footnote 2) (In July 1993 Clinton stated that the United States would not renew testing unless another nuclear power did so. It is too early, however, to draw final conclusions with respect to the U.S. position insofar as the Congress has not repealed its previous decision on limiting the number of tests, and American nuclear arms proponents are exerting pressure on the administration in favor of continuing an abbreviated testing program.) But it seems that the latest (January 1993) treaty with the United States on nuclear weapons reaches the limit of Russia's capabilities in disarmament--this the result not so much of military-strategic factors as of domestic economic and social ones. It is not clear whether or not Russia will have the funds and resources necessary to fulfill obligations already undertaken, not to mention new ones. Secondly, the prestige of Russia, having cut off almost all ties with its former allies, and its influence on international relations have been sharply curtailed as compared with what the USSR used to enjoy. Control over the development of situations in the "far" abroad and actively effecting their settlement do not constitute a priority goal of Russia's strategy. The United States is interested in this to a far greater degree--expansion of the "nuclear club" is for it tantamount to reduced American influence on the neighbors of new nuclear powers. Thirdly, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea, and other candidates for official membership in the "nuclear club" are not directly in conflict with Russia. These powers can effectively use the nuclear trump card only on the regional level, in rivalry with their neighbors in whose direction their nuclear warheads are primarily aimed. Those political and military efforts of China or Pakistan, for example, which have an anti-Russian orientation (exporting civil war out of Afghanistan to the territory of the former USSR, supplanting Russia and expanding their own zones of influence through direct or indirect penetration into former Soviet republics), are carried out mainly through third countries. Nuclear weapons can help them very little in their relations with Russia, and this is perfectly understood by all. Nor can Russia rely solely on the nuclear factor in resolving these problems. It will apparently have to travel along the same path the United States has taken, long ago orienting itself on increased attention to conventional weapons and general-purpose forces, to means of command and control based on advanced military technologies, to intelligence and communications, etc. While nuclear potential will remain for both Russia and the United States "the final argument." Ukraine, and to a certain extent Kazakhstan, present a common concern to them, insofar as a portion of the Soviet nuclear arsenal remains on their territory. The problems these states have, going through the difficult period of establishment, create compelling motivation for the acquisition of nuclear status. At the same time, they do not fully possess the technical, production, or operational capabilities of becoming nuclear states. This is impossible without assistance from Russia. But such assistance can be afforded only under conditions of relations with these states as allies. This has broadened somewhat President Yeltsin's opportunity for flexible policy. It is not the United States but Russia that could become an equalizing influence in American-Ukrainian relations if it so desired and exert significantly greater influence on the international postures of both sides. However, it is especially difficult to foresee all the consequences of this right now. After all, the basis for cooperation between the United States and Russia on the old principles of rivalry have already become outdated, and a new basis based on partnership has not taken shape. Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine has also not been formulated as yet. Therefore, in the interests of a positive continuation of international relations and in their stability, it is necessary first of all to devote greater attention to control over armaments and to expand the circle of participants in this process. Activation of the mechanisms of control over all varieties of the weapons of mass destruction will probably show greater resolution in revealing shifts in the configuration of the balance of forces in the world and will define areas of heightened risk. Variations in Strategy of the United States and Russia Concern over bipolar nuclear parity will apparently shift to the background in the coming period. The concept of strategic stability reflected in practical terms in the START II Treaty may become the basis--officially or unofficially--for construction of the nuclear potentials of both the United States and Russia. This means that the era of nuclear rivalry between the two powers has entered the stage of extinction. At the same time, the era of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, is only beginning, it seems. Apocalyptic predictions regarding so-called "nuclear pygmies" dictating terms and blackmailing the rest of humanity are perhaps exaggerated, but it is necessary today to limit this risk based on a new level of cooperation in efforts between Russia and the United States. Is such a new level of cooperation indeed possible? If we are talking about a fundamentally different basis of cooperation not just of allies, but of partners formally striving to avert confrontation, this is possible only if a radical review of targeting policy takes place so that American and Russian cities and other facilities are not the targeted objectives of the nuclear missiles and strategic bombers of both sides. Without such in-depth changes, or at least some parallel movement in this direction, it is difficult to discuss a new era of cooperation. It is important to take note of two circumstances when examining this question. First of all, a great deal regarding cooperative efforts of the United States and Russia in the nonproliferation sphere depends on what role will be played by nuclear weapons in the world as a whole, and especially in the national security strategy of the United States and Russia as the most powerful nuclear states. There are many contradictory tendencies in this sphere of policy. On the one hand, it is clear that nuclear weapons cannot be a response to all threats, or even the majority of them. They are not viewed as the universal means of achieving national security strategy objectives, including those of the United States and Russia. However, both Clinton and Yeltsin emphasize in their official statements the important role of the nuclear potentials of their countries, allowing it to be understood that they have no intention of harboring a nihilistic attitude towards these under today's conditions. (Footnote 3) (Annual Report to the President and the Congress, Department of Defense, Wash., 1993, p. 4-6, 15; KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 11 June 1993. (Speech of President of Russia B.N. Yeltsin to the leadership of the Russian Federation Armed Forces.)) If both states move definitively away from confrontation with one another--which presently has not yet taken place, as already noted--but preserve their number one and two positions in the hierarchy of the "nuclear club," the end of the Cold War will then lead to a consolidation of nuclear multipolarity. The remaining members of this club, especially countries of the Third World, with which China categorizes itself, will view new generations of American and Russian strategic offensive and defensive systems in the best case as a guarantee against devaluation of their strategic potential. But in the worst case scenario, they will evaluate this as a direct threat, for which it will be necessary to find appropriate countermeasures. The premises will have been created for a resumption of the nuclear arms race with adjustments for a new configuration of power centers. Secondly, if the United States and Russia radically alter the military-strategic orientation of their nuclear arsenals with respect to each other and do not cling to nuclear leadership here, there are grounds to hope that the acquisition or build-up of nuclear potential will not become the military policy aim of third countries. It is difficult to be optimistic, however, for a number of reasons. Even in the event of ratification of the START II Treaty by the United States, Russia, and other former Soviet republics, its implementation will take a decade. During the course of this period of time it is entirely realistic to expect scientific-technical breakthroughs in the military sphere in the largest countries, including developing countries. Then towards the beginning of the 21st century the prospect will arise of a narrowing of the gap between the United States and the most powerful regional centers of power. This is contrary to American interests. Officials in the American administration have asserted that the Pentagon's maintenance of indisputable technological superiority continues to comprise an extremely important objective of U.S. national security policy. (Footnote 4) (Annual Report...1993, p. VIII, 15.) The Americans will continue to maintain and build up their scientific and technical reserves in the arms race. And it is possible the nuclear orientation will not be the fundamental one for them. Whereas for other states, including U.S. allies, supporting an advanced level of military technology in all the main orientations and setting the tone in the selection of priority orientations is hardly an attainable objective by virtue of the far greater limitations in their scientific-technical and financial resources, as compared with the United States. Especially since a timely reorientation on nonnuclear aspects of the arms race would be difficult to achieve for the less powerful and less developed states. Those in this category that have at least some sort of reserve of their own will either continue along this path or they will withdraw, rejecting independent participation in the arms race no matter what the sphere of advanced military technology. Understanding the possible benefits of this, including economic benefits, the Americans will obviously prefer to settle problems from a position of superiority rather than from one of self-restriction in the choice of means of exerting pressure. They can hardly be expected to themselves reject advantages over others, risking failure in negotiations with unyielding opponents, and find themselves without additional trump cards in the event of one complication or another. As a consequence of this, the nuclear factor in American national security strategy will lose its weight not so much depending on improved relations with Russia and a weakening of Russian might as much as on the extent to which the United States secures new achievements in the sphere of arms and acquires alternative, more flexible means of guaranteeing its national interests. Taking these perspectives into account, a narrow, egoistic variant of U.S. foreign policy is entirely realistic. Such a variant may be aimed at securing interests of the moment even at the risk of endangering international stability. This does not mean a return to isolationism in its pure form. Here the United States could conduct an active foreign policy, but on principles of unilateral advantage, in the interests of broadening its spheres of influence in the Third World, including to the detriment of Russia and even its own allies. Even following the end of the Cold War the United States has been using the multipolar balance in Eurasia with the aim of playing on the contradictions among various power centers in the region. The result of such a policy would be further disintegration of the security system and extreme imbalance of the strategic equilibrium. In this event, certain traditional bastions of tension in the regions will spread out over the ruins of the bipolar system and control of armaments will have limited significance for all entities of international relations. How will this influence Russian policy? Having confronted American egoism and lost its status as a superpower, Russia will likely lose interest in the bilateral process of control over armaments and will instead prefer some kind of variety of "nuclear isolationism," meaning complete independence in the strategic sphere. In the event of such a choice, Russia will follow in the path of France in the 1960's. Not being in any condition to play according to the rules of the nuclear superpowers, Paris totally rejected these rules. If Moscow follows this path in the middle of the nineties, the United States may then remain the one nuclear superpower without partners in negotiations and without support in the matter of nonproliferation. Such a variant seems more probable for Russia, insofar as new orientations of the development of U.S. nuclear potential relying on qualitative parameters with respect to command and control, intelligence, and defensive systems have gradually undermined the significance of parity among the nuclear powers as the basis for negotiations on nuclear arms. As a result, other criteria are being brought into the calculation in the adoption of decisions concerning Russia's defense, the most important of which are qualitative parameters of nuclear forces as a guarantee for inflicting a responsive strike. Taking these into account during the course of negotiations is quite problematic in practical terms. There exists a probability under today's conditions that Russia will undertake unilateral measures to reduce its Armed Forces and will change their structure. This is not so much a question of unilateral reductions in nuclear potential as much as the independent selection of a path of development of strategic forces and the rejection of duplication of the American weapons systems. Another variant of American foreign policy can be termed collectivist. This presumes that the United States will not separate its own security interests from the security interests of its allies and the entire world community. In this regard, the basic aim of the United States will be to form an international security structure of the "greater Europe" variety, capable of stifling the numerous destabilizing impulses of a chronically unstable South. Of course, U.S. national security policy will in reality not be a clear-cut choice between the first and second options. More likely this will be a flexible combination of elements of both depending on the political situation in the country and in the world. In a number of his speeches, new U.S. President Clinton has stressed that his administration is proposing participation in collective efforts to guarantee security. In the event collective measures do not conform to the national interests of the United States, however, they will prefer to act as they see fit. An example of this can be seen in the American position with respect to the crisis in Yugoslavia, where the United States did not agree with Europe concerning maintaining an embargo on arms shipments to the Islamic community, and sent a military contingent to Macedonia as well. In this manner, a claim was made on the role of equalizer with respect to German, Turkish, and Russian policy in the Balkans, opportunistically taking advantage of the "Islamic factor" which the United States always uses to frighten the Europeans and Russia. In analyzing the tendencies that are taking shape, we can presume that it will be increasingly difficult to support the collective principle in the realization of U.S. national security strategy, even within the NATO framework, and the nuclear doctrine of the bloc as the embodiment of this principle will probably be subject to a durability test, insofar as the ground is disappearing beneath its feet. The technology factor may also come to play its role here. It seems that with the technical complexity and high cost of antimissile defense systems and new military technologies of offensive weapons, not all the nuclear powers will be able to possess these, and over the course of 10-20 years a more precise delineation will come about within the "nuclear club" between first-class powers--which possess advanced technologies and capabilities in command and control, communications, intelligence, accurate delivery of nuclear weapons, and use of defensive systems--and second-class nuclear powers--which do not possess such capabilities. France and Great Britain may organize closer cooperation even without the United States in developing a new generation of offensive and defensive systems. Certain allies of the United States are already attempting to lessen their data and information dependence on the Pentagon. In particular, France is focusing attention on improving and perfecting its information and intelligence service by developing its own space-based means of observation and by creating new intelligence organs, processing and analysis centers, and data and information distribution centers. Evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the direction of "regionalization" could accelerate European military integration and gradually destroy the Atlantic partnership. It should be noted that up until now the Europeans have not gotten very much out of cooperation with the United States in the sphere of SDI-related technologies, although their support for this program permitted the Americans to obtain decent political dividends during the period of the Cold War with the USSR. Another question that will have an effect on formation of the infrastructure for cooperation between the United States, Russia, and other powers in the sphere of control and nonproliferation consists in whether or not nuclear weapons will be used directly or indirectly in possible conflicts between the North and the South, concerning which much is now being said. Will it be at all possible to depend on nuclear weapons to contain regional conflicts, especially without using them a single time for appearance sake, as was done by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Unless the North withdraws from participation in conflicts of the chronically unstable South, nuclear weapons may become an important factor in North-South mutual relations, other effective means and methods of exerting influence being lacking. For Russia this unfavorable prospect may acquire special significance, insofar as it borders directly on the most explosive regions of Asia. The build-up of tension in relations with the Third World contributes towards accelerating the regional arms race in the South. The industrially developed countries of the North may try to use against the South the same strategy that was used by the West against the USSR during the Cold War period: a nuclear threat to prevent the possible employment of conventional or nuclear weapons. It is not ruled out that under these conditions Russia will privately be viewed by them as an outpost, similar to the way Germany was a foothold of NATO in the confrontation with the East. True, the given scenario is not very probable since it does not conform to the interests of Russia, which must not permit the victors in the Cold War to use it as a battering ram or cannon fodder in their policies with respect to countries of the South. However, deliberate and selective arousal of the "Islamic factor" with the help of the American intelligence community may put Russian diplomacy in a quandary when it is forced either to resort to brute force for assistance or to give up its positions--as is now the case in Tajikistan. In any event, the Islamic card plays a role of no small significance in--as was stated in the latest U.S. Department of Defense report--"not permitting the emergence of a new global threat to the United States, similar to the Soviet threat." (Footnote 5) (Ibid., p. 3, 4.) This can hardly be expected to strengthen the foundations of cooperation between Russia and the United States in control and nonproliferation.
