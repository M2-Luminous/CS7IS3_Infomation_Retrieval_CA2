FR940727-2-00103 FR940727-2-00056 Availability of Staff Technical Position on Consideration of Fault Displacement Hazards in Geologic Repository Design AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is announcing the availability of NUREG&hyph;1494, ``Staff Technical Position (STP) on Consideration of Fault Displacement Hazard in Geologic Repository Design.'' ADDRESSES: Copies of NUREG&hyph;1494, including the staff disposition of comments, can be purchased from Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A copy of NUREG&hyph;1494 is also available for public inspection and/or copying at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street (Lower Level) NW., Washington, DC 20555. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne E. Garcia, High-Level Waste and Uranium Recovery Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11545 Rockville Pike, MD 20852. Telephone: (301) 415&hyph;6631. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NRC regulations for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository recognize that prohibit designing the repository against the effects of such a potentially adverse condition. The STP recognizes the acceptability of designing the geologic repository to take into account the attendant effects (e.g., displacement) of faults of regulatory concern and express the staff's views on what is needed from the U.S. Department of Energy if it chooses to locate structures, systems, and components important to safety or important to waste isolation in areas that contain faults of regulatory concern. On March 18, 1993, NRC published the ``Notice of Availability'' for the draft STP in the Federal Register (see 58 FR 14594) and solicited public comments. As a result, more than 25 comments were received from four different parties. The NRC staff reviewed these comments and, as a result, changes and clarifications were incorporated into the STP. Staff responses to these comments are documented separately as Appendix C to NUREG&hyph;1494. On March 24, 1994, the NRC staff briefed the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) on the revised STP following the end of the public comment period. As a result, the ACNW recommended, without additional comment, that the staff publish the STP in final form. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 20th day of July 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Daniel M. Gillen, Acting Chief, High-Level Waste and Uranium Recovery Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
