FBIS4-37109 "drnes117_l_94003" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Beilin: Country Mediating Foreign Disputes Beilin: Country Mediating Foreign Disputes TA1606183994 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 16 Jun 94 TA1606183994 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Hebrew BFN [Text] Over the past six months, Israel has been involved in solving local crises in foreign countries. Israelis are currently in a CIS country on a mediation mission. Several months ago, Israelis were engaged in a similar mission in another country. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports on this new Israeli involvement: [Begin recording] [Rosen] In Jerusalem today, the widow of late Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst was given the peace award. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, the man who conceived the Oslo track, today discussed a new reputation Israel has been gaining: selling peace. [Beilin] Two countries approached us after the Oslo agreement and asked if we at the Foreign Ministry would be willing to help them handle problems within their boundaries involving disputes between the government and a violent opposition element. In both cases, we were willing to offer our good services. We were even glad to do it. [Rosen] Beilin would not name the countries in question. This activity is taking place under a thick veil of secrecy, and even the Prime Minister's Office is not familiar with all the details. We have learned that one of the countries is in Latin America. The other is in Europe, where these very days Israelis are shuttling back and forth in an attempt to mediate between two rival camps engaged in a bloody and violent struggle. So, after having been engaged in selling arms, are we now selling peace? [Beilin] First, I am not certain that the gains are comparable. These services are given voluntarily. I certainly hope that in the future, Israel will be able to really help other places in the world that are involved in conflicts. [Rosen] The deputy foreign minister also said today that he would support the participation of Israeli soldiers in UN peacekeeping forces. [Beilin] I would not rule out the possibility that one day -- certainly after peace prevails here -- while we would still want to have a strong army of a considerable size, we could have units of volunteers who would be willing to serve in peacekeeping forces.
