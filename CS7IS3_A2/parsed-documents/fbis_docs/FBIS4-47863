These elections, the first ones held with the complete participation of the population, constitute an event of significant importance because they mark the beginning of a new era in the political history of South Africa, where the majority of the population was repressed by the shameful apartheid regime of racial segregation, the message sent by President Chamorro said. The Nicaraguan Government, firmly committed to the promotion of democratic and human rights, is pleased to salute the efforts by the various South African political sectors which made changes in that country possible, the Nicaraguan Government note observed.
