Before MPs set to discussing the principal issue on the agenda, that is, the approval of the staff of the government, the morning sitting was overwhelmed by harsh, radical, and sometimes unfounded speeches. Several statements were made. Eventually, at the evening sitting, the parliament got down to approving the Cabinet of Ministers. A deputy prime minister, Avtandil Margiani, faced the parliament. He made an extensive speech about the work done and the future plans. The deputy prime minister had to answer numerous questions. Voting was conducted to approve Mr. Avtandil Margiani to the post of deputy prime minister. The (?party) of Republicans and the Ilia Chavchavadze Society did not take part in voting. They had announced their refusal to participate in any voting on the approval of members of the Cabinet of Ministers at the previous sitting. Some 105 votes were cast for Avtandil Margiani, while 31 were against and five abstained. The nomination of Avtandil Margiani has failed. A deputy speaker, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili who chaired the sitting, said that the head of state had the right to once more nominate his candidate to this post.
