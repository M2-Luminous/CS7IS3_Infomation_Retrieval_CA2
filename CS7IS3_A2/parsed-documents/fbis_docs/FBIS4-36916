The United States asked Pakistan and India last year to stop the manufacture, acquisition, and testing of missiles in South Asia. Pakistan accepted the U.S. advice, but India did not respond. The issue was once again raised when Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, visited the region in April. India then postponed the Prithvi missile test just before Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States. However, as soon as Rao concluded the visit, India test fired the missile and made it clear to the whole world, including the United States, that it is free to deal with its own matters without regard to the advice of the United States or any other country. The U.S. reaction to India's attitude is not only half-hearted, but also superfluous. As far as Pakistan's nuclear program is concerned, it has been clearly pointed out to the United States that Pakistan will not accept any unilateral decision in this regard. Amazingly, India pays no attention to U.S. advice, nor does it care about world public opinion on the nuclear issue or on missile production. This arrogance is leading to a lack of balance of power and is causing concern and apprehension among the smaller countries in the region.
