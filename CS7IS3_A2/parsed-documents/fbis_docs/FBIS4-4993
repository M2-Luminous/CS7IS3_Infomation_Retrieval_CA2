Commenting on the prime minister's remark while speaking with a group of reporters early in the morning of 6 April, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said: "The prime minister made the remark at a dinner. He made the statement from his position as a civilian, not as prime minister. He is used to speaking his mind to others." But Hatoyama added: "As prime minister, he made a reckless remark. I believe he did not make that statement even jokingly."
