The statement said only that "a contact" had taken place between North Korean representatives to the IAEA and officials from the nuclear watchdog but did not give any details except to say "the contact is expected to continue next week." North Korea had agreed to a resumption of international inspections of its nuclear facilities after a gap of almost a year, a senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday. But Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis would not be pinned down on whether North Korea had agreed only to a single inspection of its seven previously visited nuclear facilities, as press reports had suggested, rather than a resumption of regular visits. The International Atomic Energy Agency has made it clear that they regard regular inspections as the basic condition to be able to ensure continuity of safeguards and verify that North Korea was not developing a nuclear weapon. The IAEA said Thursday it had not received any notification from North Korea that it was ready to allow resumption of regular inspections, and at a meeting Wednesday the Pyongyang side simply took note of an IAEA request to discuss details of renewed inspections and said it would report back.
