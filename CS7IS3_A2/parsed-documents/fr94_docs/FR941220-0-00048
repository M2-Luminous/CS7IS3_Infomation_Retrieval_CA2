FR941220-0-00048 FR941220-0-00009 In the event the shipper and carrier cannot resolve their dispute, the complaining party should file an informal complaint with us that documents the dispute. We intend to handle such cases informally under the rules at 49 CFR 1130. Filings with us must include either a copy of whatever the shipper submitted to the carrier to contest the charges and any response by the carrier or the carrier rebilling and any response by the shipper. We are delegating authority to the Suspension/Special Permission Board to handle these complaints. If our handling of the dispute does not terminate it, the aggrieved party must be mindful of the statute of limitations for filing court actions which is now 2 years from the date the claim accrues but is reduced to 18 months on December 3, 1994, 49 U.S.C. 11706(a)&(b). Congress has given the Commission the jurisdiction to adjudicate these disputes, but only a court can order the payment of monies that may be owed. In other words, a court action must be filed within the statute of limitations period. Filing with the Commission does not toll the statute of limitations for bringing court action. Environmental And Energy Considerations We conclude that the rule adopted here will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis We conclude that our action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action only involves delegation of responsibilities to the Suspension/Special Permission Board to handle these complaints.
