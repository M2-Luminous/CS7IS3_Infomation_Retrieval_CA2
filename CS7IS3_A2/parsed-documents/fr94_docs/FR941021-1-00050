FR941021-1-00050 FR941021-1-00009 FAA Response: The medical standards were revised in 1982 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). The revision eliminated the need for the time consuming and cumbersome exemption pathway under part 11 for part 67 medical disqualification cases and opened up part 67 medical disqualification cases (including cardiovascular cases) to special issuance procedures under ยง67.19. Additionally, the 1982 rule change stated, in the preamble, general and specific criteria that would be considered in the determination of a cardiovascular special issuance. The 1982 change considerably reduces the administrative costs and processing time for special issuance cases. In regard to the CPRR proposals to change the disqualifying statement on myocardial infarction and to allow for ``due process'' and appeal, FAA review of part 67 has not led to such proposals. The disqualification for myocardial infarction remains in the proposed rules. However, it is, and would continue to be, possible for an applicant with a history or diagnosis of myocardial infarction to receive a medical certificate through the special issuance procedures if further medical evaluation of the applicant shows that he or she is able to perform the privileges of an airman certificate without endangering public safety. Any applicant who has been denied certification because he or she is unqualified under the cardiovascular standards is notified of the procedures, standards, and tests required for special issuance determination. Test results are reviewed and evaluated by medical specialists. Generally, in difficult cases or those involving commercial pilots, a panel of cardiovascular specialists reviews the medical reports and other required documentation, assesses the risks involved in accordance with its best medical judgment and advises if it believes a special issuance is warranted. The procedures provide for a reasoned, objective determination based on medical facts and judgment. The determination is not based on a hearing-type procedure in which subjective facts are weighed. In any case, the proposed rule would allow for the same ``due process'' as under the present rule. Discussion of Public Comments The FAA requested public comments on the review of part 67 in two separate notices. On July 15, 1982, the FAA announced the review of the regulations and invited public comment (47 FR 30795). On May 23, 1986, the FAA announced the availability of the AMA Report and invited public comment on recommendations in the report (51 FR 19040). A total of 211 comments were received. Comments were submitted by pilots, pilot organizations, and physicians, including several AME's. Most of the comments refer to the AMA Report recommendations, only some of which are proposed in this document for adoption. The following discussion of comments addresses only the main medical issues raised by commenters that are relevant to this rulemaking document. It does not address comments on AMA recommendations that the FAA did not choose to adopt. Some commenters recommended changes similar to those recommended in the CPRR petition and, since the FAA's position on these issues has already been stated, it is not repeated below. While the following discussion addresses the main medical issues raised by commenters, it is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all of the comments received and considered by the FAA. Comments Received on the Review of Part 67 In response to the first notice, the FAA received 52 comments providing suggestions for the FAA to consider during its review of part 67. Twenty commenters, including four physicians, comment on persons with diabetes. In general, the commenters argue that diabetes is a disease that is well understood and easily monitored by a personal physician. Advances in treating diabetes, such as home glucose monitoring and other tests, provide full control to a pilot of his/her illness. Several pilots suggest that diabetes is readily containable with the appropriate medical care, and no significant physical strain is placed on a diabetic pilot in providing continuous treatment of the illness. Four commenters discuss the possible benefits of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in evaluating a person's medical situation. One doctor who is also an AME recommends a chest X-ray as a preventive test. Another physician explains that there are currently no standards for risk factors such as cholesterol, cigarette smoking, and blood pressure. These all have links to heart disease and, as a result, should be closely examined. Three people, including two physicians, support closer testing of pilots for signs and effects of alcoholism. They point out that alcohol abuse is a major cause of aviation accidents and should, therefore, be tested. Nineteen people objected to the stringent medical standards for persons obtaining a third-class medical certificate under ยง67.17. They argue that these strict standards are too rigid for this class of flyers, who are generally leisure and sports pilots and can not easily obtain a medical examination. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) submitted a detailed section by section recommendation for revising part 67 that was based on recommendations of a medical advisory panel of distinguished physicians that was convened by AOPA.
