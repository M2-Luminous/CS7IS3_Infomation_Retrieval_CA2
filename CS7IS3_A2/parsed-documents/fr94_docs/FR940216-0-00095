FR940216-0-00095 FR940216-0-00010 These constraints on the transfer of RBOB do not apply if a refiner or importer designates the RBOB as suitable for blending with any oxygenate or with ethers only, 41 and assumes that ethanol will be blended with ``any-oxygenate'' RBOB and MTBE will be blended with ``ether-only'' RBOB. A refiner or importer using this blending assumption option further assumes that the volume of oxygenate blended will be that amount necessary for the resulting reformulated gasoline to have an oxygen content of 2.00 weight percent, or approximately 5.70 volume percent in the case of ethanol, and approximately 10.80 volume percent in the case of MTBE. These oxygenate blending assumptions are discussed more fully below. 41 The ethers include but are not limited to MTBE, TAME, and ETBE. In order to ensure that gasoline produced or imported as reformulated in fact meets the reformulated gasoline standards, refiners and importers are required to engage an independent laboratory to sample each batch of reformulated gasoline produced or imported, and to analyze up to ten percent of the samples collected. EPA will direct the independent laboratories as to which samples to analyze. Refiners producing gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending may obtain a waiver from EPA and have the in-line blending records audited in lieu of the independent sampling and testing requirements. The independent sampling and testing requirement is discussed more fully below. Under the final rule, refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders are required to keep specified records that relate to the production or importation of gasoline, sampling and testing of gasoline, credit transfers, and compliance calculations. All regulated parties are required to keep copies of product transfer documents, and records of any quality assurance sampling and testing performed. Refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders are required to submit reports to EPA that contain information necessary to demonstrate that standards have been achieved either per-gallon or on average. The periods for reporting are calendar quarters (January through March, April through June, July through September and October through December). The quarterly reports are due on the last day of the second month following the end of the quarter. Quarterly reports consist of detailed information describing each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced or imported. Additional reporting requirements apply for refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders who produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB which meets any of the applicable standards on average. RVP, VOC, and NO X averaging reports are submitted with the third quarterly report of a given year and cover the high ozone season averaging period. Oxygen, benzene and toxics averaging reports and credit transaction reports are submitted with the fourth quarterly report and cover the annual averaging period. Credit transaction and averaging reports are not required for reformulated gasoline or RBOB which meets all of the applicable standards on a per-gallon basis. Refiners, oxygenate blenders, and importers are required to register with EPA by November 1, 1994 or no later than three months in advance of the first date the party will produce or import reformulated gasoline, whichever is later. Registration information identifies the refiner, blender, or importer and any facilities at which reformulated gasoline or RBOB may be produced, and the independent laboratory that will be used to fulfill the independent analysis requirements. EPA will supply a registration number to each refiner, importer, and oxygenate blender, and a facility registration number for each refinery and oxygenate blending facility that is identified; these registration numbers must be used in all reports to EPA. The final rule includes a requirement that all refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders must commission an annual review of the information contained in the reports to EPA, or an ``attest engagement.'' Attest engagements must be conducted either by a Certified Public Accountant, or by a Certified Internal Auditor, following procedures included in the final rule. The attest procedures are intended to ensure that all gasoline produced or imported is included in the reports for either reformulated gasoline or conventional gasoline; that product transfer documents are properly prepared; that the requirements for downstream oxygenate blending are met; and that in the case of a refiner using computer-controlled in-line blending, that the blend records support the reported properties of the gasoline produced. All parties in the gasoline distribution system are required to segregate certain categories of reformulated gasoline from other categories. These segregation requirements result primarily from the time and place of use restrictions necessary for reformulated gasoline, and to a lesser extent are necessary for per-gallon minimums and maximums and gasoline quality surveys in covered areas. In summary form, the segregation requirements are the following. Gasoline subject to simple model standards may not be fungibly mixed with gasoline subject to complex model standards. In addition, gasoline produced at any refinery or imported by any importer that is subject to the complex model before 1998 must be segregated from complex model gasoline produced at any other refinery or imported by any other importer. These two segregation requirements, which are limited to the period 1995 through 1997, are necessary in order for per-gallon minimums and maximums and gasoline quality surveys to properly function. Only gasoline that is VOC-controlled may be used during the high ozone season, which requires the segregation of VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline in advance of the high ozone season (other than to ``blend up'' storage tanks to the VOC-controlled standards). Similarly, only gasoline designated for VOC Control Region 1 may be sold in that region, which requires the segregation of VOC Control Region 1 gasoline from VOC Control Region 2 gasoline. In addition, VOC-controlled gasoline produced with ethanol may not be mixed with VOC-controlled gasoline produced using any other oxygenate during the period January 1 through September 15. These segregation requirements are necessary in order for VOC emission reductions to be achieved. Lastly, only gasoline designated as oxygenated fuels program reformulated gasoline (OPRG) may be sold in an oxygenated fuels program area during the oxygenated fuels control period, which requires the segregation of OPRG gasoline from non-OPRG gasoline in advance of any oxygenated fuels control period (other than to ``blend up'' storage tanks). This segregation requirement is necessary so that the extra oxygenate used in oxygenated fuels program cities does not, through averaging, result in non-oxygenate fuels program cities receiving less oxygen than is required under the Clean Air Act. The final rule establishes liability for a number of prohibited activities that may occur downstream of the refinery or importer, including the following: The sale, dispensation, transportation, or storage of conventional gasoline represented to be reformulated; the failure of reformulated gasoline to meet the minimum or maximum standards; and the use of reformulated gasoline in a manner inconsistent with the time and place of use restrictions recited in the product transfer documents. When such a violation is found, the following parties are presumed liable: The operator of the facility at which the violating gasoline is found, and each upstream party, other than carriers, that supplied any of the gasoline found to be in violation. In the case of a facility operating under the brand name of a refiner, that refiner is also presumed liable regardless of whether the refiner supplied any of the gasoline found in violation.
