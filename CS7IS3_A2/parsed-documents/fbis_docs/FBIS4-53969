The leading Japanese daily on its front page said Japan in secret bilateral negotiations with Washington in late March pledged to import 20,000 to 30,000 tons of milk products annually for use in bread and confectioneries through a semigovernment channel. The paper reported that the bilateral accord with Australia was reached last year. But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries denied the allegation. "These measures are not a country-by-country accord, being prohibited by GATT," the daily quoted a ministry official as saying. Japan will liberalize imports of milk products in 1995 with a minimum foreign access level of 137,202 tons annually under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The amount, which is imported on low tariffs, is allocated to the Livestock Industry Promotion Corp. The other importers will be permitted to buy the foreign farm products at high tariffs. The semigovernment body also promised Australia that it will buy three-quarters of Japan's total imports of the allocated skim milk and butter annually, according to the daily.
