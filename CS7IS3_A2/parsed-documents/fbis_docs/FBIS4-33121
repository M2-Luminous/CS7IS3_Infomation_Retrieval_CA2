To accomplish this, once the election results have been proclaimed the deputies-elect will have to meet informally to outline their working plans. The subject of perspectives for the new Congress and for the country in general was examined by deputies-elect Frank Vargas of the Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action and Fabian Alarcon of the Alfarist Radical Front while taking part in Radio Quito's program "Controversy," directed by Miguel Rivadeneira. Marco Flores of the Social Christian Party was also invited but did not attend. Alarcon said that the new deputies-elect "cannot make mistakes this time and must salvage Congress' image by hard work." He recognized that the people are unhappy and frustrated about political activities and legislation, and that urgent action is needed to remedy the situation. Vargas also recognized a certain culpability on the part of politicians, but he said that they are not the only ones to blame, but the problem involves everyone, and therefore there is a responsibility to redeem Congress' work and actions for the benefit of the people. [Rivadeneira] Frank Vargas, is it possible to change Congress, which has not responded to the needs of the people, and place it at the service of great national interests? [Vargas] I believe that a moral decision is indispensable to put aside personal and group interests, and emotional considerations, forgetting for the moment the desertion of deputies who have become "independents." This is currently the case with 21 persons who have seriously damaged the image of the parties and Congress in the eyes of public opinion. [Rivadeneira] Would not freedom of thought be restricted by party pressures on a deputy to act according to his leaders' wishes and not his conscience? [Vargas] I believe it is important that there be maturity and conscience, or the people will make their demands heard that Congress keep their promises. The people can even request that someone be replaced if that person does not obey the popular mandate. For my part, I will be very reliable. I will never miss a meeting. [Rivadeneira] Are these changes feasible and will Congress be disposed to cooperate in the process? [Vargas] I am certain that the changes are feasible, and this is why it must not be undertaken lightly. I believe that today, more than ever, there should be a different attitude, of responsibility, of patriotism, of work, of reliability. In any case, legislation as well as oversight are fundamental for the country to come out of its crisis. [Rivadeneira] Will General Vargas support the modernization that the current government has begun? [Vargas] Nobody can oppose an improvement or a restructuring of the state because evolution demands it, but as it has been presented and is being carried out, there is no modernization as such, but rather a consolidation of power that is very far from the country's collective and sovereign interests. [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how would you go about improving Congress' performance in the next two years? [Alarcon] In the past two years Congress has touched bottom. The Congress has not made laws, nor has it exercised oversight, nor has it met any of its responsibilities. The Ecuadoran people sent a very clear message to the country, the politicians, and the parties on 1 May: it wants a change in attitudes at all levels of the state, and especially with regard to Congress. [Rivadeneira] Is it possible to satisfy this popular demand and change attitudes in Congress? [Alarcon] Yes, those attitudes can be changed. I remember that when I presided over Congress we worked intensively. About 180 proposed bills were drafted and 80 were passed into law, many of which were very important for the country. The work was performed with responsibility and discipline. [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, to what do you attribute the change? [Alarcon] Unfortunately, these past two years changed the face of what Congress had been, and this basically is because the government greatly interfered during that time, buying deputies of the various parties. Therefore, I believe that the government is responsible for what has happened in Congress during the past two years. [Rivadeneira] What corrective actions must be taken to prevent Congress from continuing in this state of deterioration? [Alarcon] The needs of Ecuadorans must be transformed into proposed laws. First, Congress must be made to work and to exercise self-discipline. Congress oversees everyone, but who oversees Congress? [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how can Congress be supervised? [Alarcon] It has to be by self-supervision through laws. We will submit a proposed law that says a deputy who does no work is a deputy who gets no pay, that requires punctuality and regular attendance at the legislative commissions. If a nonperforming deputy maintains this attitude during a succeeding month he will be sent home, with the people's approval. [Rivadeneira] What about the independent deputies? [Alarcon] As for the famous "independent" deputies, a law should be passed to the effect that deputies who disaffiliate or who are expelled from their parties will automatically cease to be deputies, out of a sense of political morality. Finally, I propose that we deputies-elect start to work along broad guidelines, on legislation, as well as on oversight matters, to be able to go to work right away on 10 August so that the country can see a new image of Congress. [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, will you support the changes the country needs and the process of modernization that the government is carrying out? [Alarcon] No one can be opposed to change and modernization, which are necessary. However, as it has been presented, one must ask where the change is headed. If it is to consolidate the privileges of the few, we are absolutely opposed to modernization. If it is to benefit the vast majority, we are for it. Unfortunately, the government is confusing modernization with privatization.
