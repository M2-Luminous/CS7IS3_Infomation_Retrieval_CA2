FR940505-1-00191 FR940505-1-00012 For stationary source categories whose facilities range in size, a cutpoint differentiates point and area sources. EPA guidance on emission inventories sets this cutpoint at 10 tpy for VOC sources, and 100 tpy for NO X and CO. 102 Point source emissions are calculated by adding estimates of individual source facilities in a category. Area source emissions are generally determined by subtracting point sources from a total estimate derived from an emission factor assumed for the entire category. Certain source categories are estimated by the State while others are estimated by the local air pollution control agency. 102 See Guidance for Initiating Ozone/CO SIP emission Inventories Pursuant to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (OAQPS, February 13, 1991), page 22. These cutpoints are different from the definition of major stationary source used for the New Source Review of RACT regulations. (1) Sacramento. For purposes of this NPRM, EPA relies largely on stationary source emission data provided in CARB's November 1992 inventory submittal. This inventory includes VOC and NO X estimates for Sacramento, Sutter, Solano, Yolo, Placer and El Dorado counties for 1990, 1999 and 2005. This inventory is also similar to the inventory used in the 15 percent plan submitted by the Sacramento APCD in November 1993. EPA has, however, made several adjustments to CARB's inventory which are discussed in the technical support document. The following table summarizes the estimated stationary source emissions used in this NPRM before applying FIP measures: Sacramento Stationary Source Baseline Inventories [Tons per summer day in 1999 and 2005] 1‚ê£ 11999 VOC 11999 NO X 12005 VOC 12005 NO X Fuel combustion 1.3 10.4 1.4 11.4 Waste burning 4.4 0.1 4.8 0.2 Architectural coating 15.2 17.4 Consumer products 14.3 16.3 Other solvent use: Dry cleaning 2.1 2.4 Degreasing 4.5 5.0 Other surface coating 17.8 19.6 Asphalt paving 2.4 2.6 Printing 2.3 2.5 Industrial solvent use 0.9 1.0 Other 0.2 0.2 Petro process, storage, transfer: Petro marketing 4.2 1.1 4.3 1.1 Petro refining 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.1 Oil & gas extraction 5.1 0.0 5.1 0.0 Other 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.1 Industrial processes: Commercial bakeries 1.3 0.0 1.4 0.0 Other 4.6 0.3 5.1 0.4 Pesticide application 13.1 14.2 Livestock waste 7.2 7.9 Misc processes 3.1 0.0 4.3 n,s Total 104.2 12.1 115.7 13.4 (2) Ventura. EPA and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District are jointly funding a coordinated SIP and FIP modeling effort in order to maximize consistency between these parallel efforts. Thus, for purposes of this NPRM, EPA is using Ventura County's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan (1991 AQMP) 103 as the starting point for estimating and projecting emissions from stationary sources in Ventura rather than CARB inventories. The 1991 AQMP inventory also provides the starting point for the 15 percent plan submitted by Ventura to EPA in November 1993. While the 15 percent plan incorporates a number of modifications to the growth factors, emission processing mapping, and other inputs to the 1991 AQMP inventory, EPA was not able to evaluate and incorporate these in time for this NPRM. In addition, the 15 percent plan only projects emissions through 1996, and projections are needed through 2005 for the FIP. EPA expects, however, that the inventory used for the final FIP attainment demonstration will incorporate many of the modifications included in the 15 percent plan. It should be noted that CARB's inventory forms the basis of many of the specific source category emissions estimates in Ventura's AQMP and 15 percent inventories. 103 Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, October 1991. The following table presents the 2005 stationary source emission estimates before applying FIP measures. These estimates are described further in the technical support document:
