Most people, it is noted, accept the rationale implied in the president's response to the clemency appeal. But the government must acknowledge that this view is liable to gain currency: the United States government wanted nothing less than commutation, which rightly was a non-starter where Singapore was concerned, so why the need to compromise? In wanting to meet President Bill Clinton part of the way, as the government says, it has dismayed a section of Singaporean opinion which holds that the authorities should have stuck it out as it has the commanding heights in moralism and jurisdictional rights. Neither could it mollify Washington and the merchants of hysteria and disinformation in the American liberal establishment, whose campaign against Singapore has been asking that the basis of its penology be scrapped as it does not conform to American values. That said, this was, still, arguably the least controversial approach to a troublesome episode. There are a number of reasons. The first, which is crucial as it bears directly on the rule of law, is that a legal principle had not been subverted. Fay was sentenced to be caned because he had vandalised property. He received swift justice yesterday. The Americans offended Singaporean sensibilities when they moved heaven and earth to save his skin but Fay was not spared the punishment; reducing the number of strokes fell within the realm of constitutional discretion. This reinforces the message the government has been consistent about since the case broke, which is that the law is inviolate and nationality-blind. Would foreigners please note. A second factor has to do with balancing domestic political realities with the conduct of foreign relations. Not caning Fay would not just have made a mockery of the law, it would injure the Government's mandate in managing the state. Preserving the integrity of the judicial system, then, is the fount of the moral right to ruIe. A dogged adherence to this position could, however, expose the government to charges of being not sufficiently mindful of external factors in a world rendered interdependent by trade, security and diplomatic obligations. That is the substance of the government's concession. Much play is made in the official statement of the good relations with the US and of its economic and security contributions to Asia-Pacific stability. To those in favour of giving the Americans some latitude, taking into account the special relations between the two countries, the justification would make more palatable an uncharacteristic pliability. But this would barely pass muster with those Singaporeans who are either incensed by gorilla heaviness of some American media advocates whose chutzpah they see as exceeded only by their ignorance, or view the trade and diplomatic angle as irrelevant to a judicial matter. In the end, this has been a case of exercising political judgment. Time will tell if the government had acted correctly. For now it would have to take note of the unhappiness expressed by concerned Singaporeans who had backed it fully in taking the hard line, not out of jingoism but on a point of principle. But more troubling is the opening its decision would provide for special interests and foreign governments to intercede on behalf of their nationals in controversial cases in the future, or cases with "media possibilities". The government says this is "an exceptional decision which will not be a precedent for future cases". The commitment is one which Singaporeans will expect it to uphold -- come hell or high water.
