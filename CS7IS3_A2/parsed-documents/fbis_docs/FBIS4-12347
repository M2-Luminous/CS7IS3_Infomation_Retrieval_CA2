Jamila Mezoued has the details. [Begin Mezoued recording] Mr. Redha Malek said state officials, both civilian and military, have continued with courage and bravery to carry out their difficult tasks to repulse the specter of disorder and establish law and order. The head of the government added that recently some new promising economic prospects have started to become clear because of the agreements that are about to be signed with the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Redha Malek said all these compact acts constitute a firm view by a government that has not lost the initiative; it is today required, in the name of the public interest, to leave its distinctive marks on the course of events. The head of the government said political pluralism and the freedom of expression are some of the main gains Algerian people have obtained since the ratification of the 1982 constitution. The government will remain, more than any time before, eager to preserve and bolster these gains. Mr. Redha Malek added that in this sphere, it was high time for the restitution of the rule of law, because when some leaders of some political groups expect to achieve political interest by turning a blind eye on the terror that is shaking up a whole society, then this is ethically unacceptable, but it remains that everybody should have a conscience and, and history will be his judge. In his article Mr. Redha Malek also says that when some openly call for insubordination and rebellion inside institutions dealing with order, and for an international boycott of our country, they are then obviously dealt with in accordance with the laws of the republic. Only the state bears the task of defending property and persons, preserving the unity of the people, and guaranteeing the harmony of the nation throughout the homeland. It is fine, Mr. Redha Malek says, that we denounce bribery, favoritism, nepotism, and all scourges. This is a salvation and courageous action, a commitment to society for the emerging of a political culture devoid of illegitimate privileges and settlement of accounts. The tactics of securing gains and all the demagogic ways that have been used excessively by some people must be fought by the political class first if the latter wants to retrieve its credibility. Concerning the role of the press, Mr. Redha Malek says in his article that the information media play a decisive role, sometimes negative and sometimes positive, in changing situations. But some journalists and papers, the prime minister adds, have not yet arrived at appreciating the exceptional situation we are going through, and the degree of the complication and danger of the situation in our country. Mr. Redha Malek said that in my capacity as the head of the executive body, the laws of the republic will be implemented on everybody. The prime minister added that if there were criticisms on this issue, they should be put in a clear and detailed way. The destructive confusion of issues and the easy and unfounded accusations should disappear completely from the columns of our press. The article of Mr. Redha Malek added that the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state will strongly contribute towards the definition of the vision and the consolidation of stability and security. If combating terrorism remains the most pressing duty of the state, it will not neglect other essential duties represented in the renewal of our political system to enable it to manage the transitional phase, in the light of a critical change, as stated by Liamine Zeroual in his speech in Tunisia. Mr. Redha Malek added that today, more than in any other times, our country strongly needs its sons. [end recording]
