The Flemish Socialists appear to be slowly recovering from the uproar caused by the BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees] scandal in March. Back then, the SP dropped from 17.6 percent to 15.3 percent. In May, the SP climbed back to 16.2 percent. That is still 3.4 percent below the result obtained in 24 November 1991. The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] has not managed to reach the 30 percent mark again since January. In May, the VLD party dropped half a percent from 29.2 percent to 28.7 percent. The CVP [Christian People's Party] is stagnating at 21.7 percent (up 0.2 percent), and since September 1993 has not exceeded 22 percent. Live Differently [Ecologists], however, is the big loser. The Ecologists lost 1.1 percent of their support and dropped to 10.6 percent. The VB [Flemish Bloc] scored 11.3 percent after a climb of 0.3 percent. The VU [The People's Union] was forced to give back some of the ground gained in April and dropped 0.4 percent to 7 percent. Rossem is at 3.1 percent (up 0.2 percent). French-Speaking Socialist Party Drops In Wallonia, the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] saw another 1.1 percent of votes flow away. The atmosphere of scandal is continuing to pursue the French-speaking Socialists. With 30.5 percent, Busquin is only 0.4 percent above February's historic low point (30.1 percent). The PSC [Social Christian Party] managed to benefit a little from PS losses and climbed by 0.6 percent to 19.9 percent. Ecolo also is on the increase: up 0.7 percent (to 16.5 percent). Jean Gol's PRL [Liberal Reformation Party] stagnates at 22.9 percent (down 0.2 percent). The "others" category, including the United Left and National Front, also stagnates at 10.2 percent. Dimarso's survey traditionally covers voter preferences for national parliamentary elections, therefore it is not per se representative for the upcoming European elections. Nevertheless, it is probable that in the middle of the European campaigns, telephone surveys give a good indication of intentions for the European elections. Reference is made to the strongly domestic character of this European campaign, which would reduce the chance of differences between surveys covering European or national elections. In the latest Dimarso poll, 17.2 percent did not answer. That is a few percentage points lower than the normal average. In April, the "don't know, refuse" category was 18.9 percent.
