FR940712-2-00086 FR940712-2-00059 C. Surveillance The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. 29 In this regard, the NYSE and the Amex, which currently are the primary markets for the REITs comprising the Index, are both members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. 30 29 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). 30 See supra note 21. D. Market Impact The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the REIT Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. 31 First, as described above, for the most part no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because at least 90 percent of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options listing standards, the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 10,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by The Options Clearing Corporation just like any other standardized option traded in the United States. 31 In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of options and LEAPS on the REIT Index. See Letter from Joseph P. Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated February 25, 1994. Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index. 32 32 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992). E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies the proposed rule change by making specific representations with respect to surveillance and Index value dissemination. These representations are identical in all material respects to those made by the Exchange in connection with similar proposals to list options on stock indexes. 33 Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal on an accelerated basis. 33 See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33962 (April 25, 1994), 59 FR 22874 (May 3, 1994). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;05, and should be submitted by August 2, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 34 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;05), as amended, is approved. 34 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
