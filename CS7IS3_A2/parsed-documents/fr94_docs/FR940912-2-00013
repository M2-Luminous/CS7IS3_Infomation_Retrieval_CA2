FR940912-2-00013 FR940912-2-00010 THE COMMISSION ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY `NOTCH' ISSUE Notice of Public Hearings and Requests for Written Statements AGENCY: The Commission on the Social Security Notch Issue. ACTION: Notice of hearing. SUMMARY: The Commission on the Social Security `Notch' Issue was established by the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;393, September 10, 1992). BACKGROUND: The legislation adopted in 1972 to provide for automatic cost of living adjustments (COLA's) in social security benefits contained a flawed formula for determining benefits which resulted in higher benefits than intended. In 1977, Congress enacted legislation to remove this flaw. The new law was effective for all beneficiaries born after 1916 and the resulting benefit modification for those born for several years after that date created what has become known as the `notch' issue. DATES: The Commission on the Social Security `Notch' Issue will hold a public hearing on Friday, September 16, 1994, at 9:00 a.m. in room 423 of the Federal Trade Commission, located at 6th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. Future hearings will be held in Kansas City, MO. November 15 and San Francisco, CA, November 17, 1994. Specific times and locations for these field hearings will be provided in October.
