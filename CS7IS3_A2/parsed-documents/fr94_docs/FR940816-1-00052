FR940816-1-00052 FR940816-1-00009 6. Klamath Tribe, Chiloquin, Oregon The Klamath Tribe currently has no reservation, per se. However, the Klamath Tribe has reserved hunting, fishing and gathering rights within the former reservation boundary. This area of former reservation, granted to the Klamaths by the Treaty of 1864, is over 1 million acres. Tribal natural resource management authority is derived from the Treaty of 1864, and carried out cooperatively under the judicially enforced Consent Decree of 1981. The parties to this Consent Decree are the Federal Government, the State of Oregon and the Klamaths. The Klamath Indian Game Commission conducts the setting of seasons. Tribal harvest is monitored by both the tribal biological staff and tribal Regulatory Enforcement Officers through frequent bag checks and hunter interviews. In a May 6, 1994, letter, the Klamath Tribe proposed season dates that run from October 1, 1994, through January 28, 1995. Daily bag limits would be 9 for ducks and 6 for geese; the possession limits would be twice the daily bag limit. The daily bag and possession limit for coots would be 25. Shooting hours would be one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset. The Service proposes to approve the regulations of the Klamath Tribe, provided an agreement can be reached on waterfowl sex and species restrictions. 7. Navajo Nation, Navajo Indian Reservation, Window Rock, Arizona Since 1985, the Service has established uniform migratory bird hunting regulations for tribal members and nonmembers on the Navajo Indian Reservation (in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). The tribe owns almost all lands on the reservation and has full wildlife management authority. In a June 18, 1994, communication, the tribe proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations on the reservation for both tribal and nontribal members for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season for ducks (including mergansers), Canada geese, coots, band tailed pigeons, and mourning doves. For waterfowl, the Navajo Nation requests the earliest opening dates and longest seasons, and the same daily bag and possession limits, permitted Pacific Flyway States under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. For both mourning dove and band-tailed pigeons, the Navajo Nation proposes seasons of September 1 through 30. The Navajo Nation also proposes daily bag limits of 10 and 5 for mourning dove and band-tailed pigeon, respectively. Possession limits would be twice the daily bag limits. In addition, the tribe proposes to require tribal members and nonmembers to comply with all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part 20 regarding shooting hours and manner of taking. In addition, each waterfowl hunter 16 years of age or over must carry on his/her person a valid Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (Duck Stamp) signed in ink across the face. Special regulations established by the Navajo Nation also apply on the reservation. The Service proposes to approve the Navajo Nation request for these special regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting seasons. 8. Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, Oneida, Wisconsin Since 1991&hyph;92, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin and the Service have cooperated to establish uniform regulations for migratory bird hunting by tribal and non-tribal hunters within the original Oneida Reservation boundaries. Since 1985, the Oneida Tribe's Conservation Department has enforced their own hunting regulations within those original reservation limits. However, the Oneida Tribe has a good working relationship with the State of Wisconsin and the majority of the seasons and limits are the same for both. In a June 14, 1994, letter to the Service, the tribe proposed special waterfowl hunting regulations. For ducks, geese, mourning dove and woodcock, the Tribe described the ``outside dates'' (seasons) as being September 1 through November 30, 1994, inclusive. Canada goose bag limits would be 2 tribally tagged per day; the tribe will reissue 2 tags as each 2 birds are registered. The possession limit for Canada geese is 4. The Oneida Conservation Department is recommending a season quota of 150 geese taken. If that quota is attained before the season concludes, the Department recommends closing the season early. For ducks, the daily bag limit is 5, which could include: no more than 3 mallards, with only 1 hen; 4 wood ducks; 1 canvasback; 1 redhead; and 1 hooded merganser. The daily bag limits for mourning dove and woodcock would be 10 and 6, respectively. Shooting hours are proposed to be one-half hour before sunrise to sunset. Indians and non-Indians hunting on the Oneida Indian Reservation or on lands under the jurisdiction of the Oneida Nation will observe all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations found in 50 CFR, except that the tribe proposes to exempt Indian hunters from the purchase of the Migratory Waterfowl Hunting and Conservation Stamp (``Duck Stamp'') and the plugging of shotguns to limit capacity to 3 shells. The Service proposes to approve the request for special migratory bird hunting regulations for the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin if the tribe requires tribal members to plug shotguns to limit capacity to three shells. 9. Penobscot Indian Nation, Old Town, Maine Since June 1985, the Service has approved a general migratory bird hunting season for both Penobscot tribal members and nonmembers, under regulations adopted by the State, and a sustenance season that applies only to tribal members. At the Service's request, the tribe has monitored black duck and other waterfowl harvest during each sustenance season and has confirmed that it is negligible in size. The waterfowl harvest in the 1993&hyph;94 sustenance season is assumed to be low and similar to that of the previous seasons. The Penobscot Nation usually outlines their migratory bird hunting season proposal through the Service's Region 5 Office, however, this year has not provided confirmatory information. The tribe normally requests special sustenance regulations for tribal members in an area of trust lands that includes but is much larger than the reservation. These lands were acquired by the tribe in the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement. The tribe would be proposing a 1994&hyph;95 sustenance hunting season of 75 days (September 17&hyph;November 30), with a daily bag limit of 4 ducks, including no more than 1 black duck and 2 wood ducks. The daily bag limit for geese would include 3 Canada geese or 3 snow geese, or 3 in the aggregate. When the sustenance and Maine's general waterfowl season overlap, the daily bag limit for tribal members would be only the larger of the two daily bag limits. All other Federal regulations would be observed by tribal members, including that shooting hours would be from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset. Nontribal members hunting within Penobscot Indian Territory would adhere to the seasons and bag limits established by the State of Maine. The Service proposes to approve the 1994&hyph;95 regulations put forward by the Penobscot Nation, provided the tribe provides the appropriate confirmation copies of regulations for the seasons.
