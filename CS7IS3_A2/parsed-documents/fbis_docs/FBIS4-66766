The lesson learned on that date was a lesson beyond imagination for all children of the Arab nation generally and for the children of Kuwait in particular. Nobody had imagined that the day would come when one Arab would attack another Arab brother, would invade his land, and would treat him as one treats enemy prisoners. This is a history that has left its imprints on every heart, in the depths of every conscience, and in the crevices of the soul of every Kuwaiti who had been living safely and securely. This Kuwaiti citizen has responded to his Arab nation most sincerely, courageously, and faithfully and has tried as hard as possible to support his Arab brother in all positions and crises to the degree of his belief in this brother's position and his awareness of this brother's crisis. [passage omitted] In this regard, we find that relations between Egypt and Kuwait are distinguished relations that crystallize that vital slogan that is applied seriously, enthusiastically, and with mutual faith. The slogan is that Egypt and Kuwait are brothers in time of tribulation and partners in time of prosperity. If time confirmed this fact in the past, whether before or after the aggression, then it behooves us to take a pause before the reflection of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations in the past year. To start, we generally say that in 1993, Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations experienced constant growth at all levels. This growth reflected the strong boost these relations had gained during the aggression to which Kuwait was subjected by Saddam Husayn, Iraq's tyrant. This ordeal contributed to strengthening the bonds of love and fraternity between the two peoples, considering that Egyptians and Kuwaitis united as a single man in their rejection of the aggression and their defense of Kuwait's freedom and independence. This growth in the two countries' relations was not confined to official aspects solely but was coupled with a noticeable leap in relations between the two fraternal peoples. This leap was embodied in the frequent visits between representatives of the two countries' popular organizations and in increased numbers of Kuwaiti tourists coming to Egypt, not to mention the single spirit that united both countries' read, seen, and heard media, which played the same tune for freedom, dignity, and independence. When speaking of development of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations in 1993, we can say that a new spirit cast its shadows on the various aspects of cooperation between the two countries since the invasion ordeal that culminated with the invaders' defeat and with the restoration of Kuwait to its legitimate owners. This cooperation is no longer based on interest alone and it no longer relies on the conventional mainstays that bind all Arab and Islamic countries. Rather, other elements of rapprochement and harmony were generated and they resulted in the spontaneous solidarity between the two people's citizens during the ordeal. It is worth noting that the direction of the bilateral Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations indicates greater closeness and communication in the coming phase, thus reinforcing the accomplishments made recently as a result of the wise leadership of His Highness Prince Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, amir of the State of Kuwait, and His Excellency Muhammad Husni Mubarak, president of the Arab Republic of Egypt. One Philosophy In the information and culture area, Kuwait was keen on organizing cultural weeks in Egypt, including art shows and varied intellectual and literary activities. They included the week organized by the University of Kuwait in cooperation with Alexandria University--a week which abounded with artistic and intellectual demonstrations that reflected the spirit of cooperation between the two countries. Kuwait also participated in the activities of the Cairo International Fair which was held at the beginning of this year. Moreover, Cairo witnessed the visit by Kuwaiti Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah who met with President Husni Mubarak and high-ranking officials. The minister concluded a number of agreements in the various information areas to bolster cooperation between the two countries' radio and television people. This cooperation was bolstered with the agreement concluded between Amin Basyuni, head of the Radio and Television Union; and Faysal al-Hajji, Kuwaiti Information Ministry undersecretary, to receive the transmission of the Kuwaiti satellite channel and to retransmit it in Egypt. Kuwait also purchased a large number of television and radio productions from the union. Educational cooperation marched in step with the information cooperation. Egypt loaned 1,053 male and female teachers to Kuwait and increased the number of Kuwaiti male and female students in Egyptian institutes and universities to 816 students. Egypt also contributes to the development of Kuwaiti curricula and meets Kuwait's needs for educational materials and requirements. In a related development, the Kuwaiti Government and people contributed to the construction of dozens of schools to make up for the schools damaged by the October 1992 earthquake. Kuwait played a prominent role in alleviating the effects and in dealing with the consequences of that catastrophe. As of the moment news of the catastrophe were broadcast, Kuwait rushed to express its solidarity with Egypt. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Salim al-Sabah was the first Arab official to arrive in Cairo to convey condolences on the loss of the earthquake victims. Kuwait did not content itself with this moral gesture but proceeded to offer $20 million as a first installment to assist earthquake victims; established an air corridor to deliver medical and food supplies to Egypt; and launched active popular efforts to collect donations, which amounted to dozens of millions [of dollars]. Egyptian Labor in Kuwait As Kuwait contributed with its great generosity to the reconstruction activities that followed the earthquake, Egypt continued to participate in the building and reconstruction operations that followed the liberation of Kuwait. Egyptian construction companies continued to perform their commendable role in restoring utilities and installations and contributed to the development projects going on in all parts of Kuwait. In addition to this direct participation, Egyptian labor and brains, working side-by-side with Kuwait's citizens, have contributed greatly to Kuwait's revival. After its liberation, Kuwait opened its doors to Egyptian labor and gave Egyptian workers all facilities and privileges that enable them to offer even more. Consequently, large numbers of Egyptians poured into Kuwait. By the beginning of 1993, their numbers amounted to 140,000 Egyptians, representing 26 percent of the foreign labor, followed by Indian, Bengali, and Pakistani workers. A total of 63 percent of the Egyptian workers in Kuwait are employed in the manufacturing sector and 17 percent in the trade and insurance sector. Out of the two countries' eagerness to safeguard Egyptian workers' rights, 1993 saw the conclusion of an agreement by the two countries' manpower ministers that stipulates that the salary of an Egyptian worker in Kuwait will be no less than 70 dinars [D] monthly, plus food and housing. Moreover, the two countries' labor unions have been working actively to bolster their cooperation in the various areas. Open Lines In view of the importance of transportation and communication means in strengthening concerted cooperation between the two countries in the area of labor and other areas, officials have devoted attention to bolstering these means by increasing the number of telephone lines and eliminating obstacles in the area of air transport. Moreover, the Kuwaiti National Assembly approved the Egyptian-Kuwaiti agreement on land transportation of goods and passengers, which calls for abolishing any fees or other taxes levied on the two countries' citizens in these areas. The positive steps taken by the two sides in this regard reflected positively on their economic relations. Trade activity and capital movement increased and Kuwaiti participation in varied production projects grew. An indication of this fact is that total loans and grants advanced by Kuwait to Egypt grew to $52 million to finance 16 projects. Egyptian officials assert that these sums have contributed effectively to Egypt's development programs because of their soft terms and high performance. In the context of bolstering the two countries' economic cooperation, the Kuwaiti Development Fund allocated $500 million as a contribution to Egypt's economic reform process until 1995. A prominent project to which Kuwait contributed in 1993 is a project to reclaim 400,000 feddans of land in the Sinai at a total cost of 4 billion Egyptian pounds, to which Kuwait has contributed the equivalent of D71.3 million. This is in addition to dozens of other projects to which Kuwait has contributed more than D300 million. On its part, Egypt is keen on elevating the level of economic exchange with Kuwait, and it seeks to increase its export rates. Consequently, it has established a trade center in the middle of the Kuwaiti capital to display Egyptian products. Sixty companies and factories have participated in this center. This is in addition to a center to provide information on Egyptian goods and companies. In this respect, Kuwait participated in 1993 in the Cairo International Fair through 300 companies and establishments that displayed a variety of distinctive Kuwaiti products, embodied in textiles, consumer goods, perfumes, aluminum products, and fish. This demonstration was an opportunity for businessmen from both countries to meet and to agree on joint production and service projects. The Kuwaiti side also expressed its willingness to import more Egyptian goods and products. The value of such imports amounted to more than 300 million pounds in 1993. By June 1993, total Kuwaiti investments in Egypt amounted to 788 million pounds, which is the equivalent of 16 percent of the total Arab investments in the country. The two countries believe that the presence of a feeling of security and safety at the domestic and external levels is one of the most important elements that contribute to enhancing economic and other forms of cooperation between the two countries. Consequently, Egypt has received numerous Kuwaiti Army officers to be enrolled in training courses at specialized military units and institutes. Egypt also sends its experts to train Kuwaiti soldiers in operation the the locally-manufactured air defense system. Regarding domestic security, cooperation between the two countries witnessed noticeable growth in 1993. Kuwaiti Interior Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir visited Cairo and held with Egyptian officials contacts that culminated in the conclusion of agreements in the areas of training and information exchange. Egypt dispatched 43 officers, ranking from major to brigadier general, to join the Kuwaiti State Security Agency and to contribute with their expertise in training their Kuwaiti colleagues on investigating war crimes, interrogating prisoners and collaborators with foreign circles, and fighting espionage. Exchange of Convicts Security cooperation was coupled with cooperation in the legal area by virtue of the strong link between the two areas. This cooperation included the Kuwaiti National Assembly's approval of the extradition treaty between the two countries and the loaning of 41 Egyptian counselors to Kuwait to work in its various legal departments. A delegation also visited Egypt in 1993 from the management of Kuwait's Citizen's Administration and Complaints Office. The delegation met with officials of the Administrative Control Authority, and familiarized itself with its working systems. In addition to these areas of close cooperation between the two countries in 1993, forms of cooperation in other areas, such as health, also expanded. Visits between the two countries' physicians increased and Kuwaiti import rates of Egyptian drugs rose. In the area of electricity and energy, Kuwait participated in the construction of a number of Egyptian power plants, including Sidi Kurayr plant at a cost of $300 million. Kuwaiti electricity networks also contributed $3 million, in addition to building a heavy oil distillation unit at a cost of $5 million. In the oil resources area, 1993 experienced constant growth in oil- prospecting operations carried out by Kuwaiti firms in Egypt, and these operations scored great success. Coordination continued between the two countries' officials on oil policy. Cooperation between trade unions in the petrochemicals area was also active. The Kuwaiti Government renewed the contracts of the Egyptian firms that participated in restoring and rehabilitating Kuwaiti oil wells that had been destroyed during the Iraqi aggression. Venerable al-Azhar Delegations Out of awareness of the strong spiritual tie that binds the two countries' peoples, their two governments devoted great attention to this area. Delegations from the venerable al-Azhar visited Kuwait constantly and Cairo received increasing numbers of Kuwaiti students in its religious institutes.
