FR940527-2-00216 FR940527-2-00152 For those programs that will support the construction of new residential units, project feasibility will be critical. While the extent of need and number of units to be created will be a primary consideration in evaluating the impact, issues of site control, marketability and assurance of private financing must be addressed, and must be documented. Homeownership activities will be reviewed in terms of: how effectively the program would meet homeownership needs identified in the community; and the extent to which they would make effective use of available funds. Public service activities also may be considered in conjunction with other activities under this criterion. Again, any such activities would need to meet demonstrated needs within the community. The impact of public improvement activities will be assessed primarily on the documented severity of the need and the extent to which the proposed program will address that need. Those needs which directly affect the public safety and welfare will be considered the most severe. Economic development activities also will be evaluated by the extent to which they will alleviate the identified problems. However, the assessed impact for these activities is often diminished due to feasibility concerns. In addition to quantifying the extent of the anticipated improvements, applicants must demonstrate that the proposed activities can be carried out_that is, documentation with respect to private participation in such activities must be thorough. Letters of only general interest, by either property owners or other private sector participants, do not necessarily ensure their participation in the program. Some degree of assurance of participation should be presented. Review Criteria and Submission requirements for Housing described under the Single Purpose Program apply in evaluating and rating housing proposals that are a part of a Comprehensive Program. (b) Criterion 2_Provides Housing Choice within the Community either Outside Areas with Concentrations of Minorities and Low- and Moderate-Income Persons or in a Neighborhood which is Experiencing Revitalization and Substantial Displacement as a Result of Private Reinvestment, by Enabling Low- and Moderate-Income Persons to Remain in their Neighborhood. If a proposed program provides housing choice within the community outside areas with concentrations of minorities and low- and moderate-income persons, the application must document that there are existing areas which do, in fact, contain concentrations of low- and moderate-income families and minorities. The proposed program, if implemented, must result in additional housing assistance being provided in areas of non-concentration. Communities with no minorities or minority concentrations may receive impact points where opportunities are provided outside areas of low- and moderate-income concentration. The degree of impact will be based upon the severity of needs, the number of units to be provided, and the nature and cost of the activities. In a neighborhood which is experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment, the applicant must provide a detailed description of the revitalization efforts within the neighborhood, the amount of displacement of low- and moderate-income persons, and the manner in which the implementation of the proposed program will enable displacees to remain in the neighborhood. The degree of needs, nature and cost of activities, and percentage of needs to be addressed will be evaluated to determine program impact. (c) Criterion 3_Supports the Expansion of Housing for Low- and Moderate-Income Persons by Providing Additional Housing Units Not Previously Available. The proposed program clearly must support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from the rehabilitation of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structures to residential use, or new construction projects for which the proposed program will provide non-construction or construction assistance. Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely affect program impact. Applicants should address the areas of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing feasibility from the standpoint of project financing. Consideration will not be given to proposed programs which will rehabilitate occupied units or displace current occupants. The impact of the proposed programs will be based upon the degree of needs, the number of units to be created, and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. (d) Criterion 4_Addresses a Serious Deficiency in a Community's Public Facilities. Consideration will be given to the extent of deficiencies, and their relative seriousness, of the identified need. The following factors will be considered: _Documentation of the seriousness of deficiencies. Appropriate documentation should be provided to substantiate the degree of seriousness. Those deficiencies which directly affect the public safety and welfare will be considered most severe. _The nature and cost of the proposed activities in relation to the percentage of need to be addressed. _The extent to which the proposed program will address a variety of deficiencies in public facilities within a defined area. _Coordination with other activities within the defined area. _The degree to which the application addresses such feasibility issues, including but not limited to, the validity of cost estimates by qualified sources, the availability of other funds, site control, and environmental constraints. _The number of persons to benefit.
