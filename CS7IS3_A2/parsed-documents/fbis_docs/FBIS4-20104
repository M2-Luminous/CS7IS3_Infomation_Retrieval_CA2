This afternoon the international community seems determined to make sure that this new ultimatum is respected, even if President Mitterrand thinks that it will be unnecessary to resort to air strikes. Francois Mitterrand was interviewed by Ralph Pinto in Tashkent, Uzbekistan: [Begin Mitterrand recording] I believe that the UN forces are thinking that the ultimatum is going to be respected by the deadline. I have nothing else to add. My wish, naturally, is for military intervention to be avoided if it is not deemed necessary -- that is, if Serb forces and their positions conform to the conditions set by the international community. You will then be informed and so will I. I hope that all this will be settled in a peaceful way, and that is why France took the initiative to call for the holding of an international conference -- and it is a good thing that it has been taken up by others. Unlike what happened in the past, this conference will be held parallel to the ultimatum and attended by at least the United States, Russia, and the EU [European Union] under the aegis of the United Nations.
