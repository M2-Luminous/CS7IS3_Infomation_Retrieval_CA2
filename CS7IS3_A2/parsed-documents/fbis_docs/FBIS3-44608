Yesterday, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng had an informal discussion with some of the delegates and gave important instructions on strengthening political and legal work, maintaining social stability, and safeguarding reform, opening up, and economic development, which fully showed that the party Central Committee and the State Council set much store by political and legal work and are determined to uphold the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously and attaching importance to both, thus greatly inspiring comrades attending the meeting and vast numbers of capable policemen on the political and legal front throughout the country. The key agenda item of the national political and legal meeting is studying how to implement on the political and legal front the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and how to strengthen and reform political and legal work to ensure smooth and healthy development of our socialist market economy in light of the outstanding issues which affect social stability. The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is the overall plan for establishment of a socialist market economic structure in our country and the program of action for reforming our economic structure, as well as a working guide of our legal and political front. The current domestic and international situation offers us a rare and excellent opportunity, but in the process of transforming the old system into a new one and readjusting various relations of interests, all kinds of conflicts often arise. In a certain period of time, criminal offenses and economic crimes may increase and such corrupt phenomena as embezzlement and bribes will still grow, and all these may affect political and social stability. Hence, under the new situation of developing the socialist market economy, the political and legal front is undertaking a even more arduous task and political and legal work can only be strengthened and never weakened. Centering on economic construction, the political and legal front is faced with two key tasks: First, they must spare no effort to create a stable social and political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization; and second, they must furnish the development of the socialist market economy with good legal protection and services. The relationship between reform and opening up, economic development, and social stability is a dialectic, reciprocal, and integrative one. The solid foundation of consolidating the stable and unified political situation is to deepen reform, open up wider, and accelerate development; whereas the precondition of reform and development is to maintain political stability. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out, "To reform, we must have a stable political environment; we can do nothing without this condition." Only when we uphold the four cardinal principles and maintain social and political stability, can we vigorously ensure the smooth proceeding of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Hence, we must resolutely smash disruptive activities launched by hostile forces, continue to fight against all kinds of criminal activities in a strict and fast manner according to law, unremittingly wipe out various hideous phenomena in society, resolutely keep launching the anti-corruption struggle, and devote our energies to investigating and punishing large and important cases. Leaders at all levels must learn how to handle internal conflicts among the people under the new situation and make efforts to go deep among the masses to resolve conflicts. We must carry forward the glorious tradition of integrating special work with the mass line and rely on the masses to do a good job in the comprehensive management of public security. The development and protection of the socialist market economy relies on the legal system. The structure of the main body of market, the operation of market behavior, and the government's macroscopic regulation must all proceed according to law, and it is only under these conditions that can we ensure that the market economy develops in a fair and orderly direction. The political and legal front must give full play to the function of serving the socialist market economic structure, further strengthen economic, civil, and other kinds of judicial work, accelerate the pace of reforming the lawyer and notary system, and accomplish all kinds of work related to legal services. At the same time, the political and legal front must strictly investigate and punish economic criminal cases, such as smuggling, fraud, tax evasion, refusal to pay taxes, trade mark imitation, and production and selling of fake and poor- quality goods, ensure normal operation of the market economy, and establish a legal order of the socialist market economy. To fulfill the arduous task of political and legal work under the new situation, leaders at all levels must conscientiously do two types of work simultaneously while attaching importance to both. At present, some leading cadres really do not have a clear and firm understanding of the thinking of "simultaneously doing two types of work" and do one type of work while neglecting the other one. They are relatively competent at economic work and appear impressive, but they do not give much consideration to cultural and ideological progress, party building, and the work of maintaining stability. Moreover, some of them merely pay lip service to the work without making any conscientious efforts. "Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all." The situation of attaching importance to economic work without paying heed to political work and attaching importance to material progress without paying heed to cultural and ideological progress is very dangerous and must be changed thoroughly. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out long ago: "Without enhancing cultural and ideological progress, material progress will also be destroyed and we will take a tortuous path." Even if we have rich material conditions, if hideous social phenomena break out, corruption runs wild, and the social atmosphere is very bad, this type of socialist modernization is not the one we want. Hence, we must arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reach a common ideology and understanding, and strengthen party's leadership over political and legal work. First of all, we must be determined to solve the kind of problems which are related to the ideology and understanding of party and government leaders at all levels. We believe that through the national political and legal work meeting, all the comrades on the political and legal front, under the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, will definitely be able to uphold the basic party line, conscientiously perform their tasks, spare no effort in blazing a new trail, and be of one heart and one mind to make greater and new contributions to fulfilling the glorious mission entrusted to us by the epoch!
