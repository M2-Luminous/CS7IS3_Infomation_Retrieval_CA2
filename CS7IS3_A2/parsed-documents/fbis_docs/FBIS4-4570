Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi) designed to discuss and study new defense policies held its fourth meeting at the prime minister's official residence on the morning of 30 March. In the meeting, positive views toward participating in a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) plan were expressed. In the meeting, the members received a briefing by Maritime Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki and Air Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Isao Ishizuka about the current situation. In response, with the tense situation on the Korean peninsula in mind, an opinion was expressed by committee members that "we wonder if there are ways to deal with a missile attack. The TMD is an effective system for strengthening Japan's exclusively defensive defense." Meanwhile, the view was also expressed that "comprehensive study has to be given to the TMD plan because it relates to the issue concerning use of space for peace purpose, and the collective self-defense right."
