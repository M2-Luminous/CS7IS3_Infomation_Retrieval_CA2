He made the call after civilians shot and wounded six policemen escorting a UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] aid convoy in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking alongside the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia, British General Michael Rose, with whom he had held a short session of talks, Silajdzic said: "People are dying of hunger while some people block roads. Whether they are Serb, Croat or Bosnian, they should be bombed because they're killing the population through hunger.... Freeing up aid corridors is the key issue, anything else is of secondary importance." He regretted that although UN forces on the ground sought to help, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) did "not have the mandate." Rose, who took over the troubled UN command on Monday amid acrimonious debate on how the international community should end the conflict here, refused to comment on the Bosnian's remarks. But he said that earlier, during his first meeting with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, he had assured Ganic the UN force "would do all it could to continue to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to assist with the peace process in this country". "I don't think in the near future we are going to see any changes in the mandate I have been given," he added. Earlier Wednesday, six Bosnian policemen were shot and wounded as the UNHCR aid convoy they were escorting came under fire from civilians in central Bosnia, a spokesman for UNHCR said here. Another policeman was wounded by civilian fire Tuesday in the same circumstances and in the same area, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said, adding that the Zenica-Kakanj road had been closed after the two attacks. The attacks took place in the village of Ticici, near Kakanj, 60 kilometres (35 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, in an area controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. The UNHCR convoy heading toward Tuzla and accompanied by 12 Bosnian policemen was stopped by civilians at Ticici, where gunfire coming from one of the houses hit and wounded six of the policemen. The police escort had been strengthened after the first armed attack on Tuesday, Janowski said. In the Tuesday incident, the convoy had left Zenica, 70 kilometres (44 miles) northwest of the capital, for Kakanj with a five-man Bosnian police escort Tuesday morning. It was stopped near Ticici by a crowd of some 300 Moslem men, women and children. Janowski said the UNHCR was "very worried" about the growing number of incidents aimed at UN convoys over the past few weeks. Since the beginning of January, several UNHCR aid convoys have been blocked in central Bosnia. The crowds blocking the convoys, usually made up of women and children, often managed to flee with part of the aid. Much of the region's population is suffering from food shortages.
