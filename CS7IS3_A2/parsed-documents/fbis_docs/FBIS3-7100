Kim's trip, his first state visit to the two countries since taking office in February 1993, was originally designed to strengthen South Korea's economic ties with its nearest neighbors. Kim told reporters Tuesday he hopes his visit will serve as a turning point in resolving the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. He said besides in-depth discussion of the North Korean problem, bilateral economic cooperation and closer trade ties will top his agenda in talks with Japanese and Chinese leaders. Kim is scheduled to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday and Friday, and with Chinese President Jiang Zemin next Monday. He will return to Seoul on Wednesday. Kim is being accompanied by his wife Son Myong-sun and three cabinet ministers. In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport, Kim said he will try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve the nuclear issue and also bring North Korea around to reform and openness. "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said. He said North Korea has created confrontation on the Korean peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue. "While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea, with firm security commitment of the United States, is also fully determined to fight against any possible provocation by North Korea," he said.
