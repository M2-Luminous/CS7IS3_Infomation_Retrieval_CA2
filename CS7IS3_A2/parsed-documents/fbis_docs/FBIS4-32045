Because of its stable preferences in preelection polls, it has good prospects for the fall elections. In spite of this, it is being alleged that there are disagreements among its leaders, a rift within the party, and even a secret plan on a postelection coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. [Gembicky] Mr. Weiss, under what circumstances would the SDL be ready to form a coalition with the Meciarites after the elections? [Weiss] If we had the certainty that no HZDS deputy would give the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to a recent incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament, who has black hair and wears a moustache, with a "Heil Hitler"] and that the policy of this movement, which incites the people and sets Slovaks against one another and Slovaks against Hungarians, will change; if they stopped fabricating theories about a conspiracy against the Slovak Republic and if we had the certainty that their policy will be based on expertise and that HZDS representatives will be able to abide by agreements and will give up the idea of steamrolling and breaking up other parties by rectifying or dismissing their leaderships. It would be possible if we were linked, moreover, by a relative proximity of our programs. In that case, we would be ready to consider even a coalition with the HZDS. [Gembicky] Does all of this apply to a coalition with the HZDS even if it is headed by Mr. Meciar? [Weiss] I do not think the problems of HZDS policy are caused only by the personality of Vladimir Meciar, even though he did everything within human power to damage relations with all of the other parties. The extempore performance staged in parliament by Ivan Luptak demonstrated what kind of undercurrents there are in this movement and in which direction it could evolve. The decision about what will happen after the elections will be made by the voters, but the further direction of the evolution of the HZDS must be determined by this movement itself. The HZDS is in evident foreign political isolation, and, despite its considerable influence in our society, it has also drifted into domestic political isolation. Its inability to prepare any coalition is proof of this. [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the formation of a coalition with the HZDS, including Vladimir Meciar, after the elections, in case it shows interest in it? [Weiss] If the HZDS keeps reverting to the political tone it uses vis-a-vis the SDL, I must raise the question of whether he who spends his entire energy on breaking up his future partner can be trusted as a partner for cooperation. [Gembicky] Would the SDL reject postelection cooperation if the demand of the HZDS or its chairman was: Yes to the SDL but without Weiss and [SDL Deputy Chairman] Ftacnik? [Weiss] I do not think the HZDS will be in a situation, after the elections, in which it will be able to set conditions. Such an ultimatum is unacceptable to us. The decision on with whom we will enter into a coalition will be made by the Republic Council or an SDL congress. [Gembicky] The SDL's preferences are relatively high, and the Left Choice could have the decisive influence on the formation of the government coalition after the elections. What is the ranking of the SDL's potential partners? [Weiss] In view of the proximity of programs and acceptance abroad, the Democratic Union of Slovakia [DU] is the most natural ally. After all, a leftist-liberal coalition is nothing exceptional in the world. We would again offer cooperation to the Association of Workers of Slovakia (ZRS) and, depending on the correlation of forces, we would consider other potential partners. We continue to proceed from the idea that the depth of the crisis in Slovakia and the complexity of the tasks that will have to be tackled by any government are so huge that broader cooperation will have to be sought. And such cooperation rules out diktat by any of the partners. [Gembicky] Did you come across any negative reactions to the rejection of cooperation with the HZDS during your recent meetings with the [SDL] mayors of towns and villages in central and eastern Slovakia? [Weiss] Both citizens and mayors understand why it was necessary to support the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar. This is not the SDL's main problem. The SDL's problem is, rather, that some of our members and supporters cannot comprehend why we entered into a coalition with the right-wing Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The emotional reactions to some statements by KDH representatives about the SDL before the 1992 elections are still vivid in memory. Because we had to say a resolute no to the confrontational style of politics, the systematic search for an enemy, and the neoparty [neostranicka] terminology of labeling anyone a traitor, a janissary, and a saboteur, it was necessary to look for allies. It was necessary to put an end to the political crisis generated by the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS], two political entities without a clear-cut profile, by their falling apart. A minority government would be unable to accomplish this. That is why a new majority was found that was able to stabilize the situation and agree on calling early parliamentary elections. The historical dimension must be taken into account as well. Slovakia has experienced several political coups since 1938. Each of them produced many losers, who can become exponents of longing for revenge and the settling of accounts. It is very important for Slovakia not to exhaust its energy on hatred but on cooperation. A coalition of the left, the center, and the right is a certain experiment in Slovak political life. However, it forces all political parties to cooperate, in defiance of differences in their programs. Slovenia has had good experience with such a coalition, and a red-black coalition [of Socialists and the conservative People's Party] is working well also in Austria. The KDH, too, is having problems accepting the SDL as a coalition partner. However, if we were to build only on negative experience, it could easily happen that we would stop talking to one another and be unable to shake hands. My idea of politics is such, however, that, regardless of different programs and divergent political values and irrespective of a tough electoral contest, we must not hate one another. [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the coalition with the KDH continuing after the elections, should this become necessary? [Weiss] This possibility is open but so are other options. The HZDS's speculations and calculations with the SDL's breakup are self-serving. The dictum I am the strongest current [allusion to a statement by Vladimir Meciar] does not apply to the SDL. The SDL is not founded on a single political star. It has a constellation of experienced politicians. Even though these personalities have different views on some tactical steps, we discuss these differences democratically in order to arrive at a common opinion.
