Shaymiyev said he was receiving numerous telegrams and phone calls from representatives of Tatar diasporas in various regions of Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). They note that the Tatar population there was faced with certain problems and had definite fears, which have now been dispelled. At the same time, the Tatar president said he was disturbed by the fact that "feeble voices", as he put it, have appeared in the Russian State Duma and in Tatarstan, protesting against the treaty. Such people, in his opinion, are coming out not only against this historical document, but also against the peoples of Russia and Tatarstan. Replying to those who demand self-isolation, President Shaymiyev said: "Sovereignty means self-restriction. It is not without reason that the former members of the Soviet Union, which have gained sovereignty, are now voluntarily restricting it and asking to be admitted to the CIS. Objective factors call for economic and political integration. The main task is to safeguard civil peace and tranquility in the republic and to concentrate all the available forces on construction. The first action will be to actively take part in the repeated elections to the Russian parliament, which will be held in Tatarstan on March 13. [no closing quotation marks as received]
