FR940323-2-00151 FR940323-2-00114 (2) The conduct of its County Manager and Airport Manager proves that the ski season exception was repealed prior to October 1, 1990. That is, a Board Resolution of August 7, 1990 authorized the County Manager to direct the Airport Manager to notify the FAA National Flight Data Center to delete the ski season exception, (3) Adoption of Ordinance 90&hyph;12 on November 27, 1990, merely codified, and/or ratified, the repeal of the ski season exception which, the County continued to contend, occurred on August 7, 1990; Ordinance 90&hyph;12 is irrelevant because it is merely a housekeeping and codification measure, and (4) Repeal was necessary because the Board was concerned about the safety of its citizens. In addition, the County responded that it would not agree to rescind or permanently not enforce Ordinance 90&hyph;12, an alternate method of compliance with ANCA or Part 161, as advised by the FAA in its NOAV. The FAA has reviewed the evidence contained in the record and carefully evaluated the County's claims. It is the FAA's preliminary conclusion that the County's Response to the FAA's NOAV did not provide any additional evidence or arguments which would indicate that repeal of the ski season exception was proposed before October 1, 1990 within the meaning of ANCA. First, the usual meaning of ``tabled'' as applied to a piece of legislation is that consideration of the legislation was postponed. Tabling the June 1990 draft ordinance on August 7, 1990 left the existing airport rules, including the ski season exception, in effect at ASE. Second, while the County argues that the Airport Manager's revision of the FAA Airport Facilities Directory (A/FD) evidenced the County officials' intent to repeal the ski season exception, that argument is not dispositive of the ANCA issues. Revision of the A/FD did not have a regulatory effect. It was not supported by an official proposal by the Board of County Commissioners or any other government body with authority to adopt the proposal. The Airport Manager does not have the power to repeal or amend ordinances independent of the Board. Third, the County's position that the notice and reading of Ordinance No. 90&hyph;12 was a mere housekeeping measure is contradicted by testimony at the August 7, 1990, hearing. In summarizing the options available to the Board at the August 7, 1990, hearing, Commissioner Ross noted that a significant change in the proposal to liberalize the curfew would require another reading (Minutes of the Pitkin County Board of County Commissioners, Special Meeting, August 7, 1990, p.2). The difference between the June 12, 1990 proposal to liberalize the curfew and repeal of the ski season exception appears to have been a significant change, requiring public notice through another reading. Therefore, the County appears to have been required to introduce and read Ordinance 90&hyph;12 on November 13, 1990. This supports a conclusion that repeal of the ski season exception was not proposed within the meaning of ANCA prior to October 1, 1990. Fourth, the FAA invited the County to provide technical data or studies in support of its safety contentions. In its Response, the County has reasserted the arguments it has made previously against all night operations at Aspen (and other high-elevation mountain airports). The airport itself is certificated by the FAA under 14 CFR Part 139, and is served by an FAA air traffic control tower. The FAA does not find, and the County apparently does not argue, that there is any safety issue with the airport facility itself. With respect to arrival and departure routes for Aspen, the FAA Flight Standards Service has encouraged specialized training and planning for mountain flying generally, but has not found a need for a prohibition at Aspen or other Rocky Mountain airports.
