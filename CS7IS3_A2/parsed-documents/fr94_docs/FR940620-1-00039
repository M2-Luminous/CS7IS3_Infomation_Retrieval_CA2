FR940620-1-00039 FR940620-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 211, 227, and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Rights in Technical Data AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed Rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: DoD is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to prescribe the technical data regulations required by 10 U.S.C. 2320, Rights in Technical Data. The proposed regulations are intended to establish a balance between the interests of data developers and data users, encourage creativity, encourage firms to offer DoD new technology, and facilitate dual use development. DATES: Comments on the proposed rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before August 19, 1994 to be considered during formulation of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Deputy Director Major Policy Initiatives, 1200 S. Fern St., Arlington, VA 22202&hyph;2808, ATTN: Ms. Angelena Moy, OUSD (A&T)/DDP. Please cite DAR Case 91&hyph;312 on all correspondence related to this proposed rule. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Angelena Moy, (703) 604&hyph;5385/5386. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This proposed rule publishes for public comment regulations that adopt the recommendations of the Government-Industry Technical Data Advisory Committee established pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;190). The Act required the Secretary of Defense to form a Government-Industry advisory committee to develop recommended regulations to supersede the interim regulations which presently implement requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2320, Rights in Technical Data. Committee meetings began in July 1992 and ended in December 1993. The committee concluded that the existing regulations are a disincentive to companies that create new technology with their own funding to provide that technology to the Defense Department. The committee believes this proposed regulation establishes a balance between data developers' and data users' interests and will encourage creativity, encourage firms to offer DoD new technology, and facilitate dual use development. The protection of privately developed data is crucial, particularly for developers that have limited product lines. This proposed rule revises and retitles Defense FAR Supplement Subpart 227.4, Rights in Technical Data; adds a new Subpart 227.5, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation; amends Subpart 211.70, Acquisition and Distribution of Commercial Products; and, amends Part 252, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses. Significant differences from the exiting regulations are summarized below. a. License Rights This proposed rule identifies any government rights in technical data or computer software as specific, nonexclusive, license rights the contractor has granted the Government. The standard license rights are defined in the proposed clauses at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' and 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation.'' The rule provides that the contractor retains all rights not granted to the Government. b. Non-Standard License Rights This proposed rule permits the negotiation of nonstandard license rights whenever the parties agree that the standard rights are not appropriate for a particular procurement. c. Elimination of ``Required for Performance'' Criterion Existing DFARS regulations permit DoD to obtain unlimited rights in technical data if development was ``required for the performance of a government contract or subcontract.'' This proposed rule eliminates that criterion. d. Clarification of Indirect Cost Treatment 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires implementing regulations to define the treatment of indirect costs. The existing regulations require indirect costs of development to be considered government funded if development was required for the performance of a government contract. This proposed rule provides for all development accomplished with costs charged to indirect cost pools to be considered development accomplished at private expense. e. Standard Government Purpose Rights The existing rule gives the government unlimited rights in technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes developed with a mix of private and government funds unless the developer requests the exclusive right to commercialize and a license can be negotiated. It does not permit negotiations when the government anticipates the data will be needed for reprocurement. This proposed rule replaces those criteria with a standard license, applicable in all mixed funding situations, which is intended to recognize mixed funded development. The license allows the government to use the data for governmental purposes, including competition, but does not allow commercial use. Government purpose rights will be effective for five years following award of the development contract or subcontract or such other period as the parties negotiate. The Government has unlimited rights in the data upon expiration of the government purpose rights period. f. Segregation of Development Costs This proposed rule allows private expense determinations to be made at the lowest practicable level when determining rights in technical data or computer software. g. Commercial Items (Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation) The clause at 252.211&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data and Computer Software_Commercial Items is removed. This proposed regulation adds a clause at 252.227&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data_Commercial Items'' that generally requires DoD to acquire only the technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes that are customarily provided to the public. h. Separate Treatment for Computer Software A new Subpart 227.5, ``Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' and a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' are proposed to separate Computer software from technical data. This separation increases the volume of the regulations but provides greater flexibility to deal with new statutory requirements or technological advancements that affect either technical data or computer software only or affect both to varying degrees. The term computer software documentation is defined in these regulations to mean owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, and similar items that explain the capabilities of the software or provide instructions for use. Therefore, although computer software documentation is a form of technical data (10 U.S.C. 2302(4), most applicable requirements are contained in the software Subpart and clause. i. Software Related Definitions (1) The definitions of ``computer program'', ``computer software'', and ``computer software documentation'' are revised. Definitions of ``developed'' are added for computer programs, software, and documentation.
