Two days of talks on a ceasefire and a territorial division of Bosnia wound up in Talloires Thursday. The source close to the talks said they had made some progress. "It was neither a failure nor a success, but we did not expect significant progress," the same source said. In Talloires, a diplomat close to the talks said Thursday that the European, United Nations, U.S. and Russian negotiators were ready to try to impose a territorial solution on the warring parties, presumably by threatening to withdraw peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the new territorial plan was rejected. But a Croat press source earlier the Moslems and Bosnian Croats were ready to negotiate on the basis of the European Union territorial division plan, earmarking 51 percent of the republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serb side.
