He says he will not meet with PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, that the dialogue with the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] is still open, and that significant agreements could be reached soon. Messages of concurrence between the EZLN and the government continue to be released. This will enable an announcement of progress in the Chiapas peace accords very soon, Camacho Solis said. [Begin Camacho recording] Through the mediator, I have received an EZLN communique from from which I am able to report the following: 1) the EZLN's clear determination to maintain a cease-fire; 2) the certainty that channels of dialogue with the EZLN are fully open; and 3) the EZLN's awareness that the government has issued messages of harmony backed by evidence in the past few days. This prompts us to reactivate this form of communication, which has proved so effective. [end recording] Asked on whether he would meet with PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo, who initiated his political campaign in this state, Camacho said this: [Begin Camacho recording] It is also important for the commissioner to remain politically impartial, so the negotiations can reflect a national consensus rather than the position of one, two, or three political forces. [end recording] Camacho said that he will continue to seek the consensus of all political forces in the country regarding the Chiapas conflict and that the solution to the problem must come from a true national agreement.
