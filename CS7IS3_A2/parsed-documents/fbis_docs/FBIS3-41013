He had sent a draft of the treaty to Russia's Boris Yeltsin "back in March," following which the two governments were told to finalize the document. The document "tackles the issues of military cooperation and use of testing grounds in Kazakhstan and the Baykonur space launch pad." Nazarbayev explained that the treaty also provided for training of Kazakh officers in Russia, cooperation in manufacture of weapons and coordination in drafting a common military doctrine. "If we are to create a common defense space, which is what Kazakhstan wants, we have to cooperate very closely in border protection, personnel training, military doctrine and other areas," the president said. In his view, the Russian army would have to spend huge sums of money to build new testing grounds if it ceased to use those in Kazakhstan. Over 32.5 Mn hectares were in the past used for testing grounds while making such large areas available for military needs is out of the question now. Kazakhstan is prepared to lease the installations there on mutually beneficial conditions. The Kazakh president dismissed the reports that Almaty had demanded that Russia pay $7 Bn yearly rent for the Baykonur launch pad. He emphasized, however, that Russia was not the sole country that kept Baykonur in working order. Kazakhstan supplied 1 Bn kW hrs of energy yearly to Baykonur which also used underground water, which "is in short supply in the Syr-Daria River." New buildings in Baykonur were constructed of Kazakh materials. "For this reason, the expenses of renting Baykonur for joint operation by Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh rocketry are being computed," Nazarbayev said. (Interfax Note: Russian and Kazakh negotiating teams in the talks which started in Moscow Monday are discussing the text of a new agreement on the status and operation of the launch pad and the town of Leninsk. According to a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, the treaty on the lease of Baykonur and the issue of which legislation would be in existence in the areas rented from Kazakhstan are issues that will be discussed shortly.) The president thinks that discussion of the status of Russian troops in Kazakhstan would be premature at this stage. He said that he had an understanding with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, with whom he had met in Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum, on having experts to meet in early February in order to hammer out an agreement on the issues involved. Nazarbayev rejected accusations of conservative thinking leveled at Chernomyrdin and his new government by the Russian press and recalled that Chernomyrdin's activities during the Moscow events of October 3 and 4, when he was unambiguously on President Yeltsin's side, had been welcomed by the mass media. Now it is wrong to describe him as a hardliner even before the government has announced its program, the Kazakh president said. Currently any Russian government "will have to stay on the course of reform," Nazarbayev thinks.
