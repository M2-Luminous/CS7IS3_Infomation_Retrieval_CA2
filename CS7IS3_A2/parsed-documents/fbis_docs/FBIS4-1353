The National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] has tried to reassure motorists that things will improve, but all the refineries are out of action. Those who do manage to fill their cars are paying a high price as the government says it doesn't have enough money for imports. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] From Lagos to Maiduguri in the extreme northeast, and from the southeastern coastal city of Calabar to Sokoto in the northwest, the major preoccupation of motorists in the past 10 days has been search for fuel for their vehicles. The perennial traffic jam in Lagos has disappeared because only a fraction of vehicles are now plying the roads. Most are either parked at the garage or on vigil at filling stations, expecting fuel. I left home at five o'clock this morning in the hope that I would be one of the first to arrive at a station on Lagos Island which got its supply yesterday evening. I could not even get near the station in my car. All the approach roads were jammed with motorists who either slept there overnight or got there as early as four o'clock. There is chaos everywhere a filling station is located. Station attendants are making brisk but illegal business, selling into plastic containers at up to five times the official price to taxi and bus operators or to private motorists who cannot afford to ground their vehicles or spend up to 18 hours on queues. Lagos is even better off compared to most other towns. In Abeokuta, there was no drop of petrol at any filling station yesterday. In Ilorin and Ibadan, only a handful of stations had anything to sell. This has led to frayed (?nights) among motorists at the stations and street fights break out now and then. In Ilorin, northern Nigeria at the weekend, soldiers and policemen fought openly in the streets following a scuffle between two servicemen at the a filling station. Military administrators of the 30 states have been visiting the NNPC depots and filling stations ostensibly to find out the cause of the shortage and to ensure that there is not hoarding, but the effort has so far been fruitless because the four refineries in the country are hardly producing as a result of breakdown of machinery.
