[koranic verse] Prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad and all his kin and companions. In these blessed days all our people from al-Maharah to Sa'dah are hoping for an end to the crisis that has affected every aspect of our lives and aggravated our people's pain and suffering. Our people have been waiting for their political leaders to return to attend to their duties and for state agencies to fulfill their Constitutional tasks and carry out the accord document after it was signed in Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February]. Thus, our patient people are surprised by the military movements and the incidents that have sparked off the crisis anew and threatened the unity, security, and stability of the homeland. These incidents were orchestrated as a device to weasel out of the responsibility for implementing the provisions of the accord document and then to drift to only God knows what fate. The higher council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping has been following these developments and the irresponsible media hype about them. It contacted official circles with the aim of bringing the situation under control and keeping irresponsible actions from getting out of hand. The higher council condemns these regrettable incidents that can only harm the homeland and the citizens and play into the hands of the haters of the homeland's unity, security, and stability. It calls on all the parties to be equal to their religious, national, and historic responsibilities and work toward bringing these incidents to an end and ensuring that they do not recur. The council calls for the relocation of all military units to their positions and for the Armed Forces to be kept out of political and party disputes. This is in order for them to remain a source of strength for the homeland and a shield for the country's sovereignty and independence and the community's security and welfare and to be kept unaffected by political considerations and narrow party interests. The council calls on all political forces and the citizens from all walks of life to exercise vigilance and not allow themselves to be drawn into any actions that may hurt the homeland or its unity. It also calls for forestalling the advocates of sedition who do not care for the well-being of the Yemeni people and are used to living in a climate of bloody conflict and deception and breaking promises and breaching charters. The higher council calls on the competent authorities to speed up the enquiry into the incidents and name those who were responsible and disclose facts to the people lest they remain at the mercy of internal and external misinformation. We pray that God keep our country and people and spare us all [word indistinct] and lead us all to all that is good and our leaders to the right ways.
