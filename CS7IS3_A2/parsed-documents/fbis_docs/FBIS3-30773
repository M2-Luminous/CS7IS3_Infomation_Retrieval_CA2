He said this at a press conference after a meeting between Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus and four ministers in charge of trading between countries-signatories of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). Klaus said that the agreement proved that the Central European countries were capable of free trading, which can help in their incorporation into European structures. The ministers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- Bela Kadar, Leslaw Podkanski, Jan Ducky and Vladimir Dlouhy -- agreed that even if the transition period was shortened and trade liberalisation achieved there would still be certain exceptions, which would not fall within the overall liberalisation. They said agriculture was one of the most problematic areas. The ministers agreed that the CEFTA countries would individually seek conclusion of free trade agreements with other countries -- Hungary with Slovenia and Croatia, Poland with Lithuania and Slovenia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic with Turkey, Estonia and Romania.
