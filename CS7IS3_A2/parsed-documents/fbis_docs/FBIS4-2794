Thus, some communication lines were seriously damaged, and serious economic losses were brought to the state. The relevant data showed: From 1991 to 1993, 209 cases of these cases took place in the province, 2.959 million communication lines were cut, 87,000-meter-long electric wires and cables were stolen, and the direct economic losses reached 1.146 million yuan. Particularly since the beginning of 1993, the number of cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone cables increased by a big margin. In the first quarter of 1993, 18 cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone cables took place in Jiamusi city. A total of 2,157-meter-long electric cables of various kinds were stolen and more than 2,200 telephone subscribers were forced to stop using telephones. This directly brought about 157,000 yuan of economic losses. In March 1993, 11 cases of stealing urban telephone cables and trunk lines successively occurred in Wuchang city. Thus, 21,700 communications lines were cut and over 100,00 yuan in economic losses were generated. In addition to the many cases in Jiamusi, Shuangyashan, and Qiqihar, criminal offender Yang Zian committed a series of five such cases from 3 January to 4 February this year at Yichun city airport, Wumahe, and goods yards; stole 880-meter-long urban telephone cables, cut 12.2-meter-long communication lines, and caused over 30,000 yuan in economic losses. Since last Autumn, the province has built optical fiber communication lines on a large scale. Simultaneously, some law offenders fixed their eyes on the optical fiber communication lines. They ran away after failing to sell the stolen optical fiber communication lines totaling several hundreds meters in length. All this has brought about gigantic losses to the state. A few days ago, the provincial postal and telecommunications department conscientiously studied the situation in which increasingly more cases of stealing communication lines took place, particularly of theft of the state first- and second-grade trunk lines; worked out methods to solve these problems; and implemented measures to keep a lookout for key projects, such as optical fiber communication lines. Simultaneously, the department urged that all local postal and telecommunications departments should positively work in coordination with the security organs to deal strict blows to the criminal activities of damaging communications lines so as to ensure constant availability of communication lines.
