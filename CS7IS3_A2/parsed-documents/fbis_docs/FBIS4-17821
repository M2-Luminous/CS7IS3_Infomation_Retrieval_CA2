This was announced by Chief of the Black Sea Fleet headquarters, Rear Admiral Petr Svyatashov in an interview with INTERFAX. He repeated that in accordance with Ukrainian legislation on power-sharing the Crimean leadership and its executive and legislative bodies must be informed on the establishment of new military units and dislocation of the troops. Svyatashov suggested that the Ukrainian defense minister had considered his authority to be higher that the Ukrainian law on power-sharing adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. The last developments when a Ukrainian Navy patrol post had been established in order to control the Black Sea Fleet naval infantry in the Kazachya Bay (Sevastopol) undermined all the statement by General Vitaliy Radetskyy on friendly intentions and peace civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue, Svyatashov said.
