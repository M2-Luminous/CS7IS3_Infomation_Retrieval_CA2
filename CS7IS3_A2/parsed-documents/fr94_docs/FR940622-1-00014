FR940622-1-00014 FR940622-1-00004 Sikorsky Aircraft: Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;18&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear), failure of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following: (1) From component records, determine the TIS for the ring gear, part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, (i) If the TIS on the ring gear is 2,400 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. (ii) If the TIS on the ring gear is less than 2,400 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized ring gear at or before reaching 2,500 hours' TIS. (2) If the TIS on the ring gear cannot be determined, replace it in accordance with the time since last overhaul (TSO) as follows: (i) If the TSO on the ring gear is 1,150 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. (ii) If the TSO on the ring gear is less than 1,150 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace with an airworthy serialized ring gear at or before reaching 1,250 hours' TSO. (3) Create a component log and a serial number and apply the serial number to the ring gear between the ring gear flanges in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service No. 58B35&hyph;32 (ASB 58B35&hyph;32), dated July 6, 1993. (b) Create a component log and a serial number for replacement ring gears and apply the serial number to the ring gear between the ring gear flanges in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB 58B35&hyph;32, dated July 6, 1993, prior to installing a replacement ring gear on the helicopter. (c) This AD establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS for the ring gear. However, ring gears with 2,400 or more hours' TIS or, if the TIS cannot be determined, 1,150 or more hours' TSO on the effective date of this AD, need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Boston Aircraft Certification Office. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on June 14, 1994. Eric Bries, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
