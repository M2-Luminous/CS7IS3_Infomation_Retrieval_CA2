FBIS3-52642 "drnes004_p_94009" FBIS-NES-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 SOUTH ASIA Afghanistan Correspondent on 3 Jan Fighting 94P50075A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 4 Jan 94 pp 1, 4 94P50075A London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:CSO [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan] [Text] Peshawar, London--The clashes in the Afghan capital intensified yesterday and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's forces continued their attempts to take control of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's headquarters. Hezb-e Eslami, led by Hekmatyar, distributed statements in the name of the "Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Jihad," which demanded "revolution against the current regime." Sources close to Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that the "Coordination Council" is an opposition political front that includes, besides the Uzbek militias (led by General `Abdol Rashid Dostam), the Hezb-e Eslami, the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat (supported by Tehran) led by `Abdol `Ali Mazari, and the Islamic National Front led by Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, in addition to other field commanders. This [front] forms what appears to be a coup attempt against President Rabbani's regime, especially since the Hezb-e Eslami has disclosed its alliances and the parties supporting it under the banner of the opposition front. Foreign correspondents in Kabul reported the opposition forces (particularly the Hezb-e Eslami and the militias) pounded Kabul with hundreds of rockets and continued attacks on the government buildings in an attempt to capture them. It was reported that the clashes caused more than 80 dead and 800 wounded. Until late last night, President Rabbani's forces, led by former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, still defended most of the government buildings. The correspondents reported from those near the president that he is in the Presidential Palace in southwestern Kabul. The Hezb-e Eslami announced that its forces had come within 200 km of the palace. [sentence as published] An opposition statement described the events in Kabul as "a comprehensive popular revolution in which all the jihad's parties and sides and the field commanders and the armed forces were participating in all parts of the capital." The statement said that these forces "were indignant at Rabbani's and Mas'ud's policies, which are contrary to Islam." The opposition added in its statement that "these forces formed a council to coordinate the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan and agreed on the necessity of eliminating President Rabbani without any reservations. This was announced through the news media during a call for the commanders of the mojahedin factions to meet quickly and agree on forming an interim government. If Rabbani refuses, we call on the Afghan people to support this movement." Mohammad Sadiq Tashkari, the Afghan president's adviser, told AL-HAYAH that the president's forces "have been able to deal with the attackers in Kabul and send them back to their positions in Bala Hesar and Tappeh-ye Maranjan." Tashkari disclosed that government aircraft yesterday bombed Bala Hesar and Chehar Asiab (Hekmatyar's headquarters) south of Kabul. Tashkari charged the prime minister with firing rockets at the capital. AP reported that the Uzbek militias continued to tighten their control over the Kabul airport, which was being fiercely defended by Rabbani's supporters. Hezb-e Eslami and Jam'iat-e Eslami sources that AL-HAYAH spoke to reported that the two sides "have been able to bring more forces into Kabul, increasing the deterioration and bloodiness of the situation. Uzbek militia sources said they were able to capture the Jam'iat-e Eslami positions in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif in cooperation with other mojahedin factions. Nasim Mehdi, one of Dostam's aides, yesterday told reporters that his forces had been able to do that with the cooperation of all of the mojahedin parties, with the exclusion of the fighters of the Ettehad-e Eslami, led by `Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf. Mehdi disclosed that the commander of the Jam'iat-e Eslami, Mowlawi `AIm, had joined the allied (opposition) forces. The official spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad told journalists that President Rabbani's forces had been able to capture the Mazar-e Sharif airport, but Pakistani diplomatic sources resident in Mazar-e Sharif told Islamabad by radio that Dostam's militias control the airport and are in possession of the city. Gen. Homayun Fowzi, the Uzbek militias' representative in Kabul, said that they want a change in the politicial system in Kabul to be a change that is acceptable to all of the minorities. Fowzi added, "A single district cannot control Afghanistan," indicating the district of Panjshir, Mas'ud's headquarters (the real commander of Rabbani's forces). Afghan sources expect fighting to flare up today if weather conditions improve, since the Uzbek militias were not able to use their aircraft in the battles. The same sources told AL-HAYAH that if the weather improves, the militias, the militias will resort to air raids on the Presidential Palace.
