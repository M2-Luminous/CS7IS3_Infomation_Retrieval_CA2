On behalf of the defense industry in the Far East (which remains the patrimony of the military-industrial complex), a "conference of commodity producers" that convened in Khabarovsk has already expressed its views perfectly clearly. The directors who gathered there stated that in the pst two years their production volume has amounted to nearly 30 percent, and more than 122,000 specialists have left the region than have come there during the same period. The major council of the Siberian Agreement Association that met yesterday identified a similar situation in Siberia. However, Siberia's raw material producers may count not only on Moscow but also on themselves. The main proposals to the government from the governors of the krays and oblasts across the Urals have to do with a very sizeable expansion of the territories' export rights. The Siberians believe that the "institution of special exporters" ought to be abolished as a concept, granting everyone equal rights to engage in foreign economic activity. At the same time, export quotas should be increased to 20 percent of the output produced in the region--by decision of local authorities, without getting the Center's consent. In the opinion of Siberian Agreement, the share of collected customs duties and export taxes that is left in the region should be raised to at least 30 percent. However, the export duties themselves, the Siberians insist, should be reduced, and import duties for medicines, food and equipment should be abolished entirely. Aleksey Gumilevskiy, director of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relation's Main Administration for Coordinating the Foreign Economic Activities of the Components of the Federation, told ITAR-TASS that "such favorable treatment cannot be granted to any one territory taken by itself," and that "a number of the problems mentioned would be eliminated if there were a gradual transition from nontariff methods of regulating foreign economic activity to purely tariff-based methods of regulation." However, it does not look as though Siberia will agree to wait until that finally happens. Valeriy Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray, has repeatedly stated that the use of regional export revenues may become the only alternative to federal budget subsidies to money-losing enterprises. As for the military-industrial complex's directors themselves--the "commodity producers" (although the word "commodity," i.e., what is bought and sold, is somewhat strained when applied to their products)--they continue to count on being bailed out by one form of support or another. Despite the industry's crisis, fewer than 4 percent of the enterprise's in Khabarovsk Kray have been shut down, and just a little more than another 7 percent have gone to a reduced work week. Employment is being artificially maintained: with official unemployment of 6,500 persons, hidden unemployment exceeds 50,000. In the meantime, in neighboring Maritime Kray the defense industry has already wangled money from the government to pay the power engineers. What's sensational about the situation is that the power engineers' debts were not paid anyway, and the emergency economic situation in the kray has been extended until 7 March. According to some information, the directors of the defense industries preferred to put the money into circulation and put off repayment of the debts "until later."
