It killed four people and injured 10 more. Interfax's correspondents report that an armed unit of the Chechen opposition, Ruslan Lobozanov's group, is based there. A prominent official from Chechnya's Interior Ministry told Interfax that the mine was set by another criminal group for the purpose of revenge. It was placed between the 3rd and the 4th storeys of a building. The blast claimed the lives of two Lobozanov militants and killed two local residents. It is believed that this is a continuation of the events that took place earlier this year, when nine people died in an armed clash between Lobozanov's men and another grouping. Lobozanov's gang lost two men in that fire exchange. After Tuesday's blast Lobozanov's men went in the direction of their enemy's headquarters. According to the Interior Ministry, it is doing its best now to stop the armed conflict from getting out of control.
