Chernyshev under the rubric "The Fate of the Voucher": "Privatization-93: Moscow Review"] [Text] One of the most prominent features of last year was privatization, which was broadly launched all over Russia. It was this process which, despite inflation, political instability, and legislative mishaps, was to start the formation of a broad stratum of private property owners as the basis of the future free market society. Of course, the conditions, pace, volume, and specific details of privatization differed considerably from region to region; however, the supercities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, with their immense volume of potential facilities for privatization, found themselves in the most difficult situation in implementing denationalization of state property. An important factor in speeding up privatization in the capital was the fact that the Moscow Property Fund, set up in 1991 in accordance with the Law "On Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the RSFSR," became in 1993 the lead organization in matters of privatizing facilities of federal and municipal property on the territory of the capital. During the time of its operation, the fund's specialists frequently participated in expert evaluations of draft normative documents on privatization issues and in the development of proposals for drafts of state and city privatization programs. The fund entered a coordination and division of responsibilities agreement with the Moscow Committee on Administration of Property, which made it possible to remove many points of contention between the two agencies and establish a single privatization procedure for Moscow; the fund's transfer to the jurisdiction of the capital city government after the October events gave the fund's activities a new impetus. Over the past year the fund has considered more than 1,500 letters, petitions, and complaints on matters related to privatization of state and municipal property, to which replies and clarifications were issued or necessary petitions to appropriate bodies of authority prepared. The fund's management has set up a reception room for representatives of enterprises, as well as legal and physical persons undergoing privatization. More than 3,000 of them received the consultations they needed on organizational, legal, and methodological matters of privatization. In 1993 Property Fund specialists participated in more than 300 sessions of arbitration courts, at which more than 120 lawsuits were considered and resolved, in which the fund participated as an initiator of a suit against the Moscow Committee on Administration of Property, its territorial agencies, and various legal entities. For the purpose of improving the work in various areas of privatization, a wide network of middlemen has been organized and is operating under the fund's auspices; they act as distributors for securities sold by the fund, hold real estate bids and auctions, conduct market research, and do other auxiliary work that raises the effectiveness of privatization. More than 120 middlemen firms work today on a contract basis with the Property Fund and are accredited with it. These firms have opened 57 facilities where applications are accepted for participation in specialized voucher auctions. In 1993 the fund's specialists handled more than 2,000 privatization cases; this immense volume comprised the main content of the Property Fund's activities. Despite a difficult operating environment and great volume of work, the fund signed 1,900 sale contracts on privatized facilities. Among them were 60 contracts that resulted from commercial bids, which in the end brought more than 13 billion rubles [R] in proceeds, and 196 contracts to sell securities of publicly held joint-stock companies created in the process of privatization of state enterprises. The fund regularly held open money auctions where stocks of joint-stock companies that had completed a voucher auction were sold for rubles. The fund's specialists also were actively involved in such a new endeavor as development of a secondary securities market, using proven information exchange technology on the basis of the F-Broker information system. In addition, there was an ongoing information exchange on non-exchange security trading. The Property Fund paid special attention to information support and public disclosure in the conduct of privatization. Twice a month the fund put out an information bulletin in which it regularly published all the necessary information on state and municipal enterprises offered for sale; sales of stock of joint-stock companies; the terms, place, and date of privatization deals and their results in the capital and other industrial centers of Russia. The fund's bulletin was also distributed electronically through computer information networks, which have more than 100,000 subscribers. Materials covering various aspects of the fund's activities were published throughout the year in various publications under the terms of information distribution agreements the fund has with leading information agencies. Overall, one may say the fund has accomplished the tasks set for 1993. Much remains to be done, however: to complete "small business" privatization, and in the summer of 1994 to bid farewell to the voucher. Work will continue in the area of identifying property contributions made by state and municipal enterprises to the charter capital of small business and joint venture enterprises on the territory of Moscow. Control will be increased over how privatized enterprises comply with the terms set in sale contracts. One of the serious tasks for the coming year is to delve into problems of privatization in the sphere of land relations. Work will continue on setting up trust companies and joint-stock companies, whose development is in the interests of the population.
