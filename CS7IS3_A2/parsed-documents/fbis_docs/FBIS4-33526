FBIS4-33526 "drlat110bb_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti Resolution `Rules Out' Armed Intervention PY0706224394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2113 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0706224394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Report by correspondent Jose Carlos Santana] [Text] Belem, 7 Jun (AE) -- The OAS General Assembly approved here today a resolution that rules out military intervention in Haiti and states that the restoration of democracy in the Caribbean country, through the reinstatement of the government led by Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was elected in 1990 and ousted in September 1991, should be achieved by reinforcing the trade, commercial, and financial embargo approved earlier by the United Nations and the OAS. The committee charged with drafting the resolution worked until 0300 today to iron out wording problems, to avoid ambiguity, and to make it reflect the thinking of the majority of the OAS member countries. This effort was aimed at ensuring that the draft resolution would be readily approved by the plenum. In a speech before a special session on Haiti yesterday, ousted Haitian President Aristide stated that he was not calling for a military occupation of Haiti because to do so would entail violating the Constitution. "In any case," he said, "I truly believe some action can be taken to free our nation from the thieves who are holding it hostage and to restore democracy. I will not waste time describing what type of action should be taken. The international community knows how to proceed." Aristide's words sounded at the plenary session like an endorsement of a prompt military intervention that would be immediately followed by his return to Port-au-Prince along with the UN technical assistance mission. The OAS has decided to pay heed only to Aristide's request that the trade embargo and the isolation of Haiti be strengthened, even if this means prolonging the hardships the Haitians are enduring. The embargo is being violated by some countries that the diplomats have chosen not to identify, with the exception of former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who charged Colombia and Venezuela with violating it. The embargo is reportedly hurting only the lower income groups of the Haitian population, especially those residing near the border with the Dominican Republic. On the first day of the assembly, at least two delegates endorsed President Aristide's proposal to remove the military regime. One of them was Dante Caputo, UN special envoy to Haiti. Speaking at the plenary session, he said he doubted the effectiveness of the economic sanctions because there are countries that are not observing them. Defending the forceful removal of the Haitian military, Caputo said: "The time has come to say no to the Haitian dictatorship." Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, stated that the United States fully endorses the proposal to strengthen the embargo, and that it would not mind unilaterally suspending commercial flights to and from Haiti should this measure be unacceptable to the other OAS member countries. He also expressed doubts about when the economic sanctions would yield results, and noted that Washington would not oppose military intervention if the coupists resisted. Yet voices contrary to this intention, including that of Brazil, have apparently prevailed. Most foreign ministers ruled out this possibility and expressed confidence that the embargo will yield results as long as it is observed by the entire Latin American and international community. The OAS resolution approved today begins by citing earlier resolutions and by noting that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission "has confirmed that the overall human rights situation in Haiti reflects an extremely serious deterioration of and disregard for essential human rights, as a result of a systematic plan of intimidation and terror used against a helpless people." The resolution notes that "the coup disrupted constitutional order, which affected the exercise of democracy. It is essential to restore this." It then outlines the approved decisions, including appeals, condemnations, and recommendations. The OAS congratulates the International Civilian Mission for its dedicated effort to guarantee a minimum of freedom in Haiti. It asks for a greater number of personnel so the group can cover the entire Haitian territory. It proposes starting, without delay, an educational program in the area of human rights to help the Haitian people, and reiterates the need to reinforce the embargo with measures "such as the suspension of commercial flights, the freezing of the assets of the de facto regime and its supporters, and the suspension of international financial transactions with Haiti." The resolution also requests that neighboring countries "examine the possibility of providing the Civilian Mission with the radio broadcasting facilities needed to carry out educational programs on human rights." Finally, it urges the OAS member states and the international community to help deal with the problems of Haitians who are leaving their country at great personal risk, by granting them the status of refugees and offering them temporary protection
