(4-4-63 Miyabara, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka-shi; president: Y. Shimomoto) has developed and will soon put on the market a rapid battery recharger that is able to recharge different types of batteries including open and sealed type lead batteries in less than one hour (photograph [not reproduced] shows super high-speed recharger). The device has made it possible for batteries to be recharged in shorter periods of time by supplying large amounts of recharge current intermittently. Demand for the rapid recharging device is expected in electric vehicles, forklifts, and in certain types of robots. There are seven types of rechargers corresponding to several battery voltages ranging from 12V-192V and costing between ¥500,000-¥5,000,000. It used to take about 10 hours to recharge the 96V-120V batteries used in electric cars, but now this can be done in less than an hour. When supplying large current loads during rapid recharging, the terminal assemblies of the battery tend to become overheated and damaged. The rapid recharger avoids this by intermittently supplying and cutting electric current while monitoring the terminal voltages of the battery. Doing this not only prevents the terminal assemblies from overheating, but also enables rapid recharging by breaking down the oxide film on the surface of the electrode to make the current flow easier. The intermittent charging periods are automatically calculated by computer.
