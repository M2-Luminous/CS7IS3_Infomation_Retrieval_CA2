President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced the price increase on 28 January, but the disturbances had begun a day earlier when the media reported the measure. At least four policemen and an unspecified number of young people were wounded in skirmishes from 27 to 29 January, and more than 20 students were arrested. Leaders of trade unions and other groups announced today they will promote a nationwide strike and demonstrations on specified days this week to protest the increase in the price of gasoline. "The government must understand the people cannot bear any more adjustments," Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers Front (FUT), the country's largest union, said. Ponce predicted the government's economic policy will cause "social outbursts" as the ones that took place recently in Chiapas (Mexico) and Santiago de Estero (Argentina). The price of many staple products began to rise in public markets as a result of the gasoline increase, local television stations reported. The government ordered a 71.2-percent increase in the price of the most widely used gasoline and stated it was forced to do so to ease the drop in the international price of oil, which is the source of half of its revenues. Cesar Robalino, finance and public credit minister, announced one gallon (3.8 liters) of "extra" gasoline--which, despite its name, is the most common and most widely used--would rise on 29 January from 1.46 sucres to 2.50 sucres (from $0.70 to $1.20). A gallon of higher quality "super" gasoline rose 25 percent, from 2.40 sucres to 3.00 sucres (from $1.14 to $1.43), and a gallon of "eco" gasoline, which has fewer pollutants, rose by 47 percent, from 1.90 sucres to 2.80 sucres (from $0.90 to $1.33). Robalino also announced "drastic" cuts in government spending, the suspension of investment programs, dismissal of tens of public employees, and a 15-percent ceiling on state employee pay increases in 1994.
