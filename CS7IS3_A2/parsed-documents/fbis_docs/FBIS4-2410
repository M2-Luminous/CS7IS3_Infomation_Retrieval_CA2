An official from the municipal government said that the enterprises with their shares rights transferred to foreign businessmen would be pillar ones in the city. They are now making good economic profits and their products already enjoy a broad market. The Dongda (Holding) Company, for example, has over one million square metres of land and is producing a range of famous daily-use chemicals and electrical and machinery products. The news of the transferring of enterprise shares rights has aroused the strong interest of businessmen overseas with three enterprises' shares rights being sold to businessmen from foreign countries including Singapore and it is expected that another ten enterprises' shares rights will be purchased by foreigners within this year.
