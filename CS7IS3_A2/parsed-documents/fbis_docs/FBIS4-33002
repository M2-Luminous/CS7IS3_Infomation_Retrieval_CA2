FBIS4-33002 "drlat105_k_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Paraguayan, Uruguayan Requests for Compensation Rejected Paraguayan, Uruguayan Requests for Compensation Rejected PY0106014894 Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish 31 May 94 p 16 PY0106014894 Buenos Aires CLARIN Spanish BFN [Report by Miguel Angel Rouco] [Text] Argentina will reject the Paraguayan request for additional financial compensation to pay for damage caused by the filling of the Yacyreta dam. A similar position will be assumed with respect to the Uruguayan Government request that Argentina assume a greater portion of the cost for construction of the Martin Garcia channel project. The government made this decision following a meeting between Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. During the meeting both ministers established the groundwork for future negotiations with both countries to prevent further economic damage against Argentina. A spokesman said: "Negotiations will be difficult, particularly considering the construction schedule for both public works." This schedule provides for the Argentine-Paraguayan hydroelectric power plant to start operating on 1 September. Ten days ago Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy warned that the filling of the dam reservoir would be delayed until the issue of expropriations and the relocation of people living on the Paraguayan side are resolved. The area scheduled to be flooded on the Paraguayan side involves some 40,000 hectares of poor land, but with some settlements. According to the Argentine Foreign Ministry, the problem must be resolved by the Yacyreta Binational Entity (EBY), which must provide more funds to compensate Paraguayan settlers. "Those lands are probably owned by people close to the Paraguayan Government, and not by simple settlers. This is probably why there is so much interest in Asuncion in modifying the mechanism for compensation." On the other front, Uruguay wants Argentina to pay two-thirds of the total cost of the Martin Garcia Channel dredging, maintenance, and sign posting, while Uruguay pays the remaining one-third. "This demand is inadmissible, because both countries will benefit equally from the project. The decision to navigate through the Emilio Mitre Channel or the Martin Garcia Channel is one of cost. Surely those using the Martin Garcia Channel will dock at Uruguayan ports. In the end the benefit will be for both countries, and thus our position is that each country must pay half of the total cost," Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria said. The dredging of the Martin Garcia Channel will have an initial cost of more than $100 million. The channel will permit the passage of ships having up to 32 feet in draught, which means that ocean ships will be able to enter the channel. Maintaining the channel will cost some $25 million annually.
