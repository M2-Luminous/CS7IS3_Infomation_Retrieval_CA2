The PLO leadership decided on this during a meeting in Tunis. The move follows the Hebron mass massacre by a Jewish settler, who killed over 50 people. [passage omitted] Singapore has condemned the massacre. The Foreign Ministry called on Israel to immediately impose security measures to protect the population of West Bank from such criminal act by extremists. Singapore also adds that Israel and the PLO should not allow the act of violence to derail the Middle East peace process. Less fights would speed up progress at the peace talks. The spokesman said this is the best way to prevent more killings and the acts of revenge, which would only further inflame emotion and delay and complicate the peace negotiations.
