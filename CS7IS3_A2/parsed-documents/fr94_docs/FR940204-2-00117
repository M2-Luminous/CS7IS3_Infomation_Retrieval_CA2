FR940204-2-00117 FR940204-2-00086 [Notice 94&hyph;009] Invention Available for Licensing AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ACTION: Notice of availability for licensing. SUMMARY: The invention listed below is owned by an agency of the U.S. Government and is available for licensing in the U.S. in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research and development. U.S. Patent Application Number 08/141,294, filed October 19, 1993, and entitled ``Optical Flameout Detector''_The present invention relates in general to flameout detectors for monitoring the presence of a flame and more particularly to an optical-based flameout detector. An optical flameout device according to the invention monitors the presence of a flame within a combustion chamber. The optical flameout detection system responds to gross changes in combustor light intensity, which are monitored in two spectral bands. A photomultiplier tube makes optical measurements in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, and a silicon photodiode covers the visible region. The detectors, located outside the combustion chamber, receive the light energy radiated from the combustion process through fiber optic probes designed to operate in a high pressure environment. The optical fibers are aimed diagonally through the center of the injector at the combustion chamber wall downstream of the injector. The probed observe events occurring within a narrow conical-shaped field of view so that the system can quickly detect longitudinal movement of the flame front away from the injector. If a change in intensity of the flame is detected, the fuel supply to the combustion chamber is shut off, limiting the amount of unburned fuel in the combustion chamber which could reignite. The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing this technology. ADDRESSES: Licensing information and a copy of the U.S. Patent Application (without the claims) may be obtained by writing to Kimberly A.
