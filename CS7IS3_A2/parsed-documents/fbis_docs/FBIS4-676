The IFP is ready, willing and able to begin the mediation process immediately as we have been ready for the past 12 hours. The IFP stands by the consolidated terms of reference agreed upon between then ANC and the IFP on Sunday, April 10, 1994 , which the IFP believes must form the basis on which negotiations must begin and proceed. In fact the mediators were brought to South Africa on the basis of these term of reference. If the South African Government wishes to submit to the mediators an additional document in which they set forth any different or additional concerns or any other matter, they may do so. During today's discussions it appears that the South African Government does not have an objection to the contents of the consolidated terms of reference agreed between the IFP and the South African Government which are basically reflected in the document produced by the government. However, the government seems now to require that the IFP accepts a precondition as a price to pay to enter the international mediation effort. This request of the South African Government has been supported by the ANC which has reneged on the consolidated terms of reference previously agreed upon. This precondition is that the IFP agrees that the election shall be held only on the scheduled date of April 26 and 27, 1994. This means that by virtue of having agreed to such a date, the IFP could no longer sustain and advocate its policy position that the election date is to be postponed in any other fora in which the political debate is taking place. There is no doubt that the issue of the postponement of the election date is the crux of the present national crisis. In fact, any possible analysis of the situation shows that only through a postponement of the election will it be possible to ensure that a constitutional compromise can open the doors to enable the IFP to rejoin the electoral process on an equal footing with all other parties. The IFP has agreed to consider the possibility that the issue of the election date is not to be raised during mediation but can not agree under any circumstances on the imposition of this precondition in breach of all previous agreements related to international mediation. Furthermore, the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance and the National Party are now requesting that the IFP agrees on an implementation procedure which would effectively preempt and prevent the participation of the IFP in the election process. They request that the IFP agrees that the only implementing technique to translate into reality any positive result emerging from negotiations shall be a "solemn pact". This means that whatever constitutional compromise produced through international mediation will be delivered to a constituent assembly after elections, rather than being translated into constitutional amendments prior to elections. The IFP would not be represented in such a constituent assembly and it would be forced to operate as an extra-parliamentary force. In this light the only purpose of the "solemn pact" appears to be to ensure that the IFP has no political or moral ground to continue to oppose the legitimacy of the election process and the empowerment of a constituent assembly after elections. During over four hours of negotiations today neither the ANC nor the South African Government has shown any flexibility with respect to the imposition of these two preconditions. The IFP rejects the notion that it should accept these two preconditions in order to sit at the mediation table. The IFP stresses the fact that the final purpose of international mediation is to create the basis for a political compromise which will enable the IFP to participate in elections. There will be no stability in this country or any certainty about future democratic developments if a significant political force such as the IFP is not part of the process. The ANC/SACP alliance and the National Party wish to close the only available options to ensure that such a result is achieved. The IFP regrets that it might not be the role of the mediators to get involved in the issue of the election date of the election dat or the issue of whether any rasults of mediation should be translated into a solemn pact rather than constitutional amendments. However, it is not fair or just to require that the IFP accepts that the options of amending the constitution prior to elections an postponing the election date be eliminated from any political debate in the country at the outset of mediation as a precondition to begin mediation.
