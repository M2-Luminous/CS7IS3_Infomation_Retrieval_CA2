Until then, it will concentrate on achieving a good result at the elections. This earlier decision was confirmed on Sunday [24 April] in Budapest, during a meeting by the party's National Council. SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar reported about the meeting at a press conference. He said that if the SZDSZ achieves a good result at the elections, that will imply a guarantee for replacing the current government coalition, and for forming a new government. Magyar also said that the chances of the SZDSZ are now better than ever before, and the party will most certainly be a political factor to be reckoned with when forming the new government. SZDSZ prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze briefed journalists about his participation in the founding session of the Democratic Union of Slovakia, in Bratisla on Saturday [23 April], and his talks with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, who was elected chairman of the union. Kuncze said the good will exists in Slovakia to settle bilateral relations and uphold the dialogue.
