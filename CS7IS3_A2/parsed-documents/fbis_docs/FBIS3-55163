In the words of the foreign ministry representative, all three Baltic States have already expressed their wish to become integrated in the security structures of Europe, among them NATO. In what forms one or another state expresses its plans is no longer that important, considered (Reinart) in the interview given to the BNS. He said that the question of Lithuania will not be discussed in Brussels separately, but in the joint context of central and eastern European states. (Reinart) emphasized that joining NATO was a lengthy process, in the course of which armaments, control of troops and many other questions would have to be generalized. This was enabled by the Partnership for Peace program offered by the United States of America, which, in the words of (Reinart), was supported by all three Baltic states.
