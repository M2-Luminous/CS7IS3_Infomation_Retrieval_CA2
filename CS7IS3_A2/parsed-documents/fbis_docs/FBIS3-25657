The whole continent's eyes are focused on South Africa. ANC President Nelson Mandela told Dr. Salim in Johannesburg that threats by the right wing over the election must not be underestimated. He added that negotiations will continue in an attempt to find a solution and allay their fears. In Dr. Salim's meeting with the PAC later, the organization's mediation role came up for discussion. [Salim, in English] I've encouraged the PAC to do what they can towards the participation of all the political forces in the country, in the democratic elections. [Van Zyl] PAC Deputy President Mr. Johnson Mlambo confirmed that his organization has held several meetings with the Inkatha Freedom Party. [Mlambo, in English] Our efforts are continuing on that front, to try and get them and all other parties involved in the process. [Van Zyl] A follow-up meeting will probably take place later this week. Before his departture, Dr. Salim signed a condolences book for the late APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army -- PAC military wing] Commander Sabelo Phama. In Pretoria this evening Dr. Salim held discussions with AVF leader General Constand Viljoen and other members of the front. Dr. Salim conveyed to General Viljoen the OAU's stance on the latest developments in the contry. In turn, General Viljoen gave the reasons why the front has not yet committed itself to participation in the April election. He then explained to Dr. Salim the right-wing Afrikaners' demand for a homeland. [Viljoen, in English] We will have a homeland, and in the homeland we will be part of Africa. We'll be a very valuable partner of the new South Africa, if the Afrikaners can settle down and be peaceful in their own homeland. [Salim, in English] I think that the Afrikaner people in this country can play a very significant contribution with in the context of a united South Africa. We feel very strongly on the question of unity of this country. We believe all the ethnic groups and all the people of all colors, of all creeds, can be accomodated in South Africa. [end recording]
