EIB Chairman Sir Brian Unwin said the so-called European Investment Fund would generate guaranteed loans of ECU6 billion (about 6.9 billion dollars) immediately and nearly three times that much later on. The money will be targeted on long-term pan-European rail, road and tunnel networks aimed at boosting economic growth and European competitiveness. The EU has already identified 11 such projects on which it wants an initial ECU32 billion (about 37 billion dollars) invested by the turn of the century. The EIF fund will also be used to fund subsidised loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. Unwin said the fund comprised ECU2 billion of subscription capital. Of this, ECU1.4 billion comes from the EU budget and the EIB itself, ECU300 million from EU governments, and ECU300 million from 58 financial institutions -- some of them private -- in all 12 EU countries. "It's about getting sensible capital into worthwhile projects," he told a press conference. The European Commission has scaled down ambitious plan to finance transport, telecommunications and energy projects networks originally estimated at ECU120 billion (about 138 billion dollars) over 12 years. Now the Commission is struggling to keep the skeleton of the programme intact in the face of unwillingness among many EU countries to spend public money on ambitious projects at a time of economic recovery. The debate will feature high on the agenda of an EU summit next week on the Greek island of Corfu.
