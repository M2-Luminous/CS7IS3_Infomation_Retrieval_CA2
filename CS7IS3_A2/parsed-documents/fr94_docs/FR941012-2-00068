FR941012-2-00068 FR941012-2-00048 [FRL&hyph;5088&hyph;2] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information or to obtain a copy of this ICR, contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Water Title: Municipal Water Pollution Prevention (MWPP) Program Evaluation (EPA No. 1728.01). Abstract: This is a new collection of information to support the self-auditing of municipal wastewater treatment facilities under the EPA's MWPP program, as authorized under section 104 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). CWA section 104(b) (7), as implemented through EPA's MWPP guidance (March 1991), authorizes EPA to develop effective and practical processes, methods, and prototype devices for the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution. The MWPP self-audit is needed to provide managers of municipal wastewater treatment facilities a framework with which to diagnose problems and design actions to deal with them. This information collection applies to MWPP programs that are presently operated by EPA Regions 6 and 10, and does not apply to State-delegated programs. These EPA Regions may choose to make the preparation and submission of the self-audit to the EPA region mandatory under the authority of CWA section 308(a). Respondents conducting the MWPP self-audit may use the EPA self-audit form, or alternative methods, to provide information documenting: (1) Actual, design, and potential influent flow and loadings, and number of overflows and bypasses; (2) operator needs, training and certification practices; (3) biosolids treatment, storage and disposal capacity; (4) facility age; (5) effluent quality versus permit limits; (6) new requirements (impact of changed water quality standards); (7) financial status of the facility; (8) collection system information; and (9) other information necessary to clarify responses. Facility operators will prepare a corrective action plan and resolution that will be submitted with the self-audit to facility owners (i.e. municipal governing bodies) for review and approval. Facility owners will then forward the audit and relevant materials to the EPA Regional Office. The information may be used by facility owners/operators and local officials to assist in resource allocations and encourage efficient use of existing facilities. EPA Regional Offices will use this information to target assistance and develop priorities to better meet facility and municipality needs. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26 hours for facility operators and 2.5 hours for facility owners, for an estimated average of 28.5 hours per response including time for reviewing questions, gathering the data needed, completing and reviewing the information, and submitting the information to the EPA Region. Respondents: Subject operators and owners of municipal water treatment facilities in EPA Regions 6 and 10. Estimated Number of Respondents: 865. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Frequency of Collection: Annual. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 24,650 hours. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Matt Mitchell, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: October 4, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25203 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
