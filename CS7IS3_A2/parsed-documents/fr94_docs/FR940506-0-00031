FR940506-0-00031 FR940506-0-00012 The National Registry submitted comments stating that its understanding of the Working Group 5 agreement was that any company having one or more D-U-N-S numbers would supply at least one valid D-U-N-S number to the pipeline. According to the National Registry, the only exception to the requirement is when a company does not have a D-U-N-S number. The National Registry further contends that D-U-N-S numbers should be included in any of the data sets when releaser or bidder company name information is supplied. Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) supports the Working Group 5 proposal because parties can acquire D-U-N-S numbers at no charge and the use of D-U-N-S numbers is self-implementing by capacity release participants. The Commission already has adopted the revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 & 2 which contain fields for display of D-U-N-S numbers. No further Commission action on this proposal seems required at this time. Those using the EBB should provide the pipelines with their D-U-N-S numbers (if they have them) and the pipelines will display those numbers on their EBBs and the downloadable data sets. B. Common Transaction Point Codes In Order No. 563, the Commission accepted the consensus approach proposed by Working Group 5 for identifying common pipeline transaction points. Under this approach, a third-party code assignor, the Petroleum Information Corporation (PI-GRID), will prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified and updated by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code will maintain the cross-reference table on their computers and can convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and vice versa. All transactions with the pipeline will take place using the pipelines' proprietary codes. In the communication protocols, the Commission required the pipelines to provide the validated computerized data base by November 1, 1994. Pipelines were required to verify the required information about their transaction points to the code assignor. The Commission also required each pipeline to provide the code assignor with sufficient information to enable users to locate the position of each common code point on that pipeline in relation to other points, such as by using geographic coordinates, line numbers, or line markers. In line with the Working Group proposal, the Commission required the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the common code data base from PI-GRID, and any updates, without charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees. 1. Pipeline Responsibility To Provide the Data Base and Ensure Reasonable Fees Columbia Distribution contends the use of the common code translation table is an inefficient method of communicating common codes. Instead, it maintains the Commission should require the pipelines to adopt the common code. Several parties object to the Commission's requirement that the pipelines be responsible for ensuring that a validated computerized base is available by November 1, 1994, and that the fees charged by PI-GRID are reasonable. 34 They contend the Commission's requirements are at odds with the Working Group 5 process in which an industry consortium would be negotiating and signing the contract with PI-GRID. TGPL argues that placing the compliance burden on the pipelines gives PI-GRID unreasonable leverage in negotiating its duties as code assignor. TGPL asserts the Commission should do nothing more than accept the Working Group 5 proposal and require the pipelines to validate their proprietary point information to PI-GRID. KGPC suggests that the Commission set up a process to monitor the provision of services by PI-GRID, rather than placing that burden on the pipelines. AER/MRT argues that instead of placing the burden on the pipelines to ensure a November 1, 1994 implementation date, the Commission should set a compliance date for PI-GRID and, if this deadline is not met, should give the pipelines additional time to comply with the common code requirements. 34 KGPC, INGAA, Natural, Tenneco Gas, TGPL. TGPL, Tenneco Gas, Natural, and KGPC contend that pipelines should not be responsible for ensuring the reasonableness of fees because they will not be signatories to the contract with PI-GRID and, therefore, can have only an indirect influence on the contracts. Natural further contends the requirement to ensure reasonable fees is unduly vague and establishes no basis for determining when such costs are reasonable. INGAA maintains the industry consortium approach of Working Group 5 provides a competitive market mechanism for controlling fees that is superior to imposing a requirement on only one segment of the industry. INGAA points out that the contract with PI-GRID requires that PI-GRID make the codes available at a cost covering only shipping and handling. On the other hand, NGSA contends the Commission did not place sufficient requirements on the pipelines to ensure that the November 1, 1994 implementation date is met. It suggests the Commission require the pipelines to cooperate with the code assignor by designating, prior to a specified date, a pipeline liaison who will work with the code assignor to establish and validate the transaction points. The Commission denies the request by Columbia Distribution to require the pipelines to adopt the common code. Such a requirement goes beyond the consensus reached by the Working Group. The translation table provides users with the benefits of common codes within a reasonable time frame, while, at the same time, pipelines need not incur the burden and expense of making an immediate conversion of their computer systems and operations to accommodate the common codes. However, as pipelines review and update their financial systems to accommodate the new business conditions created by Order No. 636, the Commission fully expects them to incorporate the use of common codes.
