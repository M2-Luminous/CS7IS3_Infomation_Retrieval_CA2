He said that during talks at different levels between Russia and Japan, Japan had more than once posed the question of the withdrawal of Russian Armed Forces from the South Kuril islands. In answer to this we have always made it quite clear that the issue of the stationing of Russia's Armed Forces on Russian territory is our country's internal affair only and cannot be a subject for discussion at the talks with Japan, Karasin stressed.
