Observers said that Pyongyang may introduce a new negotiations card in settling the nuclear issue, since Ho Chong was in North Korea while the Reverend Billy Graham was there with a message from President Clinton The source said: So far, North Korea has kept in contact with its mission to the United Nations via communication facilities, such as telephone or fax. North Korea's summoning of Ho Chong is an indication that the North Korean side is worried over leakage of information on their negotiations strategy through wire taps by the United States into the communication links between Pyongyang and the North Korean missions in New York.
