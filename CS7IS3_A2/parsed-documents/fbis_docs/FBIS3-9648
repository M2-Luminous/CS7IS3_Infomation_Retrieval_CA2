[passage omitted] At this afternoon's meeting the Governing Board of the Bulgarian Private Radio Stations Association decided to prolong the protest actions another 24 hours. Private radio stations will therefore not resume their programs until 0600 on 30 March. The association applied for a meeting with Snezhana Botusharova, deputy chairman of the parliament, at which they will demand that VAT for commercials be abolished, this being the private radio stations' only source of income. Regardless of whether the meeting takes place or not, private radio stations are resolved to resume their broadcasts the morning of 30 March but to pursue their protest actions in other ways. Our local correspondents and BTA are reporting that several local newspapers and local radio stations in Plovdiv, Vratsa, Sliven, Silistra, and other towns in the country have interrupted their publications and programs in solidarity with their colleagues. At today's meeting the Secretariat of the Bulgarian Journalists Union once more confirmed its solidarity with the newspapers and radio stations on the strike against VAT. In a letter to the parliamentary groups, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] also expressed support for the demands of the journalists on strike, insisting that the problem be resolved by 1 April 1994, when VAT comes into force.

Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov officially declared to journalists at the Council of Ministers that he is not against freedom of speech, that he has never prevented anyone one from writing whatever he wishes, but that he is in favor of everyone paying his taxes.
