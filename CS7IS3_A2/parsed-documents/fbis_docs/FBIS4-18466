Miglio explained that Bossi, "within the League, has always used harsh language, violent. But he has often followed attacks by hugs," declared the senator who said he was optimistic that Bossi and Berlusconi would patch things up. On federalism, the leading item on the League's agenda, Miglio said, "Difficulties are derived from our firmness on the federal constitution. And on this there is a difference between us and Fini," Gianfranco Fini, the head of the neo-Fascist National Alliance holding up one end of the Berlusconi-led Freedom Front. "And Berlusconi is in the middle," the man considered the architect of League theory said. "We want iron-clad guarantees on the launch of the skeleton of a federal constitution within 90 days." After having said he was confident of a future "embrace" between Bossi and Berlusconi, Miglio warned that these gestures are always "very relative" in politics. "What counts are relations of loyalty to commitments taken on, not loving relationships." On the problem of government formation, one which has been keeping political observers guessing since the general election tally was completed, the senator said, there is no majority in the new Parliament "without Fini. Nor is there one without us. And we cannot go back. We have our shoulders to the wall because without the federalist project, the League has no sense and there will be no move on to the Second Republic." On Bossi's talk of extending dealings to the parties in the center and the left which provoked Berlusconi's anger, Miglio linked the League leader's meetings with Mario Segni, whose Pact for Italy sent a dozen MPs to the Lower House, and the Progressive camp's Democratic Alliance, to a bid to re-write the constitution of 1948. "It's not true that this is a betrayal of the will of the voters," he said to counter Berlusconi's objection. "The 49 percent represented by the opposition is not dead. Bossi is doing the right thing in listening to them on a new constitution," he added.
