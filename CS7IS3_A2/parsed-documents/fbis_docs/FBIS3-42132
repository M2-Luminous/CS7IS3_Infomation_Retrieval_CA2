It is an unpardonable grave military challenge of keying up the tensions on the Korean peninsula to scheme to introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But this is no more than a plea to justify their dangerous introduction of lethal weapons. The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for "nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. If the United States and its followers think they can subdue the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from resolving the problem.
