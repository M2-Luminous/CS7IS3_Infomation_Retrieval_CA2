This is stated in a statement by the TIO of the Slovak Government Office that was made available to TA SR yesterday. The statement draws attention to the fact that the TIO of the Slovak Government Office considers the failure to make public a single idea from Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's speech, while at the same time including a statement by Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Deputy Olga Keltosova, a violation of the objectivity of information. The STV is legally obliged to maintain objectivity, the statement says.
