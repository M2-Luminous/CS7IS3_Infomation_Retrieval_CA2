FR940720-0-00018 FR940720-0-00001 Section 170.20‚ê£Average Cost Per Professional Staff Hour This section is amended to reflect an agency-wide, professional staff-hour rate based on FY 1994 budgeted costs. Accordingly, the NRC professional staff-hour rate for FY 1994 for all fee categories that are based on full cost is $133 per hour, or $231,216 per direct FTE. The rate is based on the FY 1994 direct FTEs and NRC budgeted costs that are not recovered through the appropriation from the NWF. The rate is calculated using the identical method established for FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993. As noted earlier, in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The method is as follows: 1. All direct FTEs are identified in Table II by major program. For FY 1994 the NRC has traced additional direct effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The budgeted costs for these activities had previously been included in overhead but are now being directly assigned to the class of licensees that they support.
