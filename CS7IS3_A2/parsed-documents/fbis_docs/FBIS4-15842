Today, the president met Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen, as well as making a private visit to the Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II. Harvijs Baumanis reports from Copenhagen: [Begin Ulmanis recording] The world's countries need to create for us the opportunity to set up in Latvia a certain support fund, which would have several aims. It can even be said that this is the main reason for our visit to Denmark, Britain and France, and these issues will also be raised in France and Britain. They have already been discussed in Denmark. The main objectives of such a fund would be, first, to eliminate the consequences of the Skrunda radar functioning in Latvia. Without doubt, money from this fund would also have to be used to tackle social problems in Latvia. It would also be necessary to promote the return of military pensioners to Russia, if they want this themselves. The Danish side has decided to participate in a fact-finding mission at Skrunda, working together with British experts. The aim of such a mission would be to determine the negative influence on the environment of the work of the Skrunda radar and how it affects people. Denmark once again underlined that the Yeltsin order of 5 April was unacceptable for Denmark and European countries, and that it has in no way improved the international climate -- rather it did the opposite. [end recording] Ulmanis left later for Paris, where meetings with French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe are scheduled for tomorrow. After that Ulmanis intends to go to London where he will meet British Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
