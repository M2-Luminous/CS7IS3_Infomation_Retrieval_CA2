Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj said Donaldson will be based in Port of Spain, as economic constraints have forced government to increase the number of non-resident ambassadors where diplomatic postings in faraway countries were concerned. "I'm optimistic that being able to be in closer contact with the cabinet and the government, a non-resident ambassador will be better positioned to deepen relations ... And will prove more productive than what existed before," he said. The minister also said that a delegation of Korean businessmen was expected in Trinidad for a trade fair in April.
