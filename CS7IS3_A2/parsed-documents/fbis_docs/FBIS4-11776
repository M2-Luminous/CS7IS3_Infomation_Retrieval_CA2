According to the fresh arrivals, the people in the Iraqi marshlands especially the women and children, are suffering through shortage of foodstuffs and medicine. The radio "Voice of Iraqi People," operating from somewhere inside Iraq, reported today that scores of refuge families in al-Basrah, Nasiriyah and al-Amarah have left their homes for safe havens, near the Iranian borders in the southeast. The Iraqi Arabs betrayed by the U.S. and its coalition forces which incited them against Saddam Husayn and then deserted them in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, have been subject to rigorous economic sanctions. The Iraqi regime launches periodical attacks on the southerners and other opponents in the central and northern parts.
