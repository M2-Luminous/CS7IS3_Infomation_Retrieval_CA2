FBIS4-49569 "drchi089_n_94018" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Offshore Oil Firm To Become International Conglomerate Offshore Oil Firm To Become International Conglomerate OW0705142294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0828 GMT 7 May 94 OW0705142294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has worked out a new strategy to build itself into an international conglomerate in the near future. A CNOOC official today revealed that under the new strategy the corporation is to develop itself into an international conglomerate with multinational oil companies as its backbone, within a time span of five years. The future conglomerate will also embrace a series of solely-funded subordinates with limited responsibility and a number of share-holding companies, he said. This marks a big step for CNOOC, the only state firm in charge of China's offshore oil and gas exploration and development, to rid itself of the drawbacks of the planned economy and get used to the fledgling market economy. The official said CNOOC will continue to expand co-operation with the outside world and seek more domestic investment in the exploration and development of offshore oil and gas. Meanwhile, he said, the corporation will speed up the expansion of its overseas business and activities, adjust its industrial structure and incorporate upstream and downstream operations. Multiplying the trades and the sources of investment will surely speed up as well as upgrade the development of the corporation, he asserted. Founded in 1982, CNOOC has, over the past 13 years, attracted about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment and signed 94 contracts with 55 companies from 15 countries. By the end of last year, the corporation, together with foreign partners, had proved 1.2 billion tons of oil in place and developed and built 11 oil and gas fields. It is expected to produce 12 million tons of crude oil and four billion cu m [cubic meters] of natural gas in 1997, according to the estimation of experts. However, CNOOC, which now has 12 subordinates, believes that bank loans being the only source of investment has caused a chronic short supply of exploration funding. It also blamed the static industrial structure for the corporation's incompetency in dealing with possible risks. In addition, the changes in China's macro-economic climate, with the reform of the systems of taxation, foreign exchange and investment in particular, have weaned the company from most of the state's preferential treatment it used to enjoy. Wan Yan, president of CNOOC, said: "We must find a good way out to complete the transition from the planned economic system to the market economic system so that we are able to achieve new and even greater developments, from a new starting point."
