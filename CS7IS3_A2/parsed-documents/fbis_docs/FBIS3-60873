According to INTERFAX reporters, on Thursday the local administration is planning a reception for the participants in the operation to release the hostages. Meanwhile, the Chechen Interior Ministry has informed INTERFAX that not a single dollar banknote has been found on the territory of the Chechen republic: The terrorists claimed that they scattered banknotes flying over the republic.
