B&M has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) that the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies); 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports); 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter); 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication); and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen , 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. This exemption will be effective on March 24, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by March 4, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by March 14, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 1 Because MBTA will continue to provide service over the line, there is no need to provide for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions, or to include offer of financial assistance language, routinely provided for in abandonment proceedings. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: John R. Nadolny, Esq., Vice President and General Counsel, Law Department, Boston and Maine Corporation, Iron Horse Park, No. Billerica, MA 01862.

Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3921 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
