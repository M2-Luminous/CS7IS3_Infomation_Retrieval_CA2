For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 553; the NRC is proposing to adopt the following amendments to 10 CFR Parts 20, 30, 40, 50, 51, 70 and 72. PART 20_STANDARDS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST RADIATION 1. The authority citation for Part 20 continues to read as follows: Authority : Secs. 53, 63, 65, 81, 103, 104, 161, 182, 186, 68 stat. 930, 933, 935, 936, 937, 948, 953, 955, as amended (2 U.S.C. 2073, 2093, 2095, 2111, 2133, 2134, 2201, 2232, 2236), secs. 201, as amended, 202, 206, 88 stat. 1242, as amended, 1244, 1246, (42 U.S.C. 5841, 5842, 5846). 2. In 10 CFR 20.1003, ``Definitions,'' the definition of background radiation is revised and new definitions Critical Group, Decommissioning, Indistinguishable from background, Readily removable, Residual Radioactivity, and Site-Specific Advisory Board are added in alphabetical order to read as follows: ยง20.1003 Definitions. * * * * * Background radiation means radiation from cosmic sources; naturally occurring radioactive material, including radon (except as a decay product of source or special nuclear material); and global fallout as it exists in the environment from the testing of nuclear explosive devices or from past nuclear accidents like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and are not under the control of the licensee. ``Background radiation'' does not include radiation from source, byproduct, or special nuclear materials regulated by the Commission. * * * * * Critical Group means the group of individuals reasonably expected to receive the greatest exposure to residual radioactivity for any applicable set of circumstances. * * * * * Decommission means to remove a facility or site safely from service and reduce residual radioactivity to a level that permits (1) release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license, or (2) release of the property under restricted conditions and termination of the license. * * * * * Indistinguishable from background means that the detectable concentration of a radionuclide is not statistically different from the background concentration of that radionuclide in the vicinity of the site or, in the case of structures, in similar materials using adequate measurement technology, survey, and statistical techniques. * * * * * Readily removable means removable using non-destructive, common, housekeeping techniques (e.g., washing with moderate amounts of detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive waste requiring subsequent disposal or produce chemical wastes that are expected to adversely affect public health or the environment. * * * * * Residual radioactivity means radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media at a site resulting from activities under the licensee's control. This includes radioactivity from all licensed and unlicensed sources used by the licensee, but excludes background radiation. It also includes radioactive materials remaining at the site as a result of routine or accidental releases of radioactive material at the site and previous burials at the site, even if those burials were made in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20. * * * * * Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) means a committee constituted by the licensee to provide advice to the licensee on decommissioning. * * * * * 3. In ยง20.1009, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:
