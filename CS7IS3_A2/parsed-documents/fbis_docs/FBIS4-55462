This statement was made yesterday by Christian Democratic Movement Chairman Jan Carnogursky on Slovak Radio's Radiozurnal program. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said in this context that the Slovak Government is considering this plan carefully and, at the moment, is devoting attention to the text of the document that should be adopted. "We can only accept the whole plan under the prerequisite that it complies with our interests," said the prime minister. Milan Ftacnik, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left Deputies' Club, said that, in the original plan, the questions of adjusting the borders were modified; they were unacceptable for the idea of Europe as it is arranged today, where any kind of movement on the borders may have unforeseen consequences. "Nevertheless, it is necessary to discuss the pact because a joint point of view on resolving the problems that exist between countries--first and foremost, on the issue of the minorities--is desirable, and I think that the Slovak Republic is ready for the pact," emphasized Ftacnik. Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak National Party, expressed his conviction that the Stability Pact "will lead to the destabilization and not the stabilization of this region." "The countries that adopted an intolerant attitude toward the minorities will be given a large whip against the countries that have been tolerant, and I personally consider this to be interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Europe toyed with minority ideas in the 1930's, and it all turned out very badly. The Stability Pact now envisages bilateral negotiations between neighboring countries under the supervision of a third country. In other words, the European Union is expressing its lack of confidence in the competence and capability of the countries of Central and East Europe to resolve their own problems," he said.
