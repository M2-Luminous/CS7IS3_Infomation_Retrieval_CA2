After his visit to Sakhalin, Kamchatka and the maritime territory, he firmly said that Russian border guards are fully combat-capable. Nikolayev held consultations with maritime territory head Yevgeniy Nazdratenko on strengthening cooperation between border troops and civil population to guard natural resources. Nazdratenko stressed at the meeting that it is high time to put an end to the pillage of the Russian Far East: Chinese poachers rapaciously pick up jinseng in the Ussurian Taiga, while Japanese, Polish, Chinese, North and South Korean fishermen illegally fish in the Russian sea economic zone. However, the first days of the poach-control dragnet have shown that, apart from foreigners, Russian fishermen are also guilty of rapacious attitude to natural resources. The coastguard service detained several Russian ships which had no fishing licences. Nikolayev departed for Khabarovsk on Monday.
