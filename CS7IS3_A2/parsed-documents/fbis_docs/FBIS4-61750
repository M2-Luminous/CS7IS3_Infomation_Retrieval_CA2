Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Zaveryukha described these proposals as a "rash" and blamed the radical democratic circles for them. "Radicalism is unacceptable in agriculture. The land reform will yield fruit only if it develops in an evolutionary way," Zaveryukha said, adding that "some radical democrats dislike it". The vice- premier did not explain whom he meant. Plans to decollectivize agriculture before the spring sowing campaign could be advanced only by "a man, who is poorly versed in agricultural production in our country, and who has no idea about developments in other countries," the vice-premier stressed. Moreover, Zaveryukha noted that the overwhelming majority of Russian collective and state farms had already changed their form of property. He said that more than 90 per cent of such husbandries have already been turned into joint-stock societies. "They are no longer collective and state farms, but associations of free commodity producers with their own land plots and shares. They are already owners. And nobody has any right to tell them how to work and what form of management to choose," Zaveryukha stressed.
