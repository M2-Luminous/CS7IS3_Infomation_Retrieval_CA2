How can the Bosnian Serbs be won to sign the agreement? [Manolic] This agreement is opening the door to the settlement of all problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, it is much easier to solve the problem between the Muslims and the Croats than that with the Serbs. The war between the Muslims and the Croats should have never started, and was more the case of unfortunate circumstances than of policies working in the interests of either the Muslim or the Croat sides. In the search for the answer to the question of how to include the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations, one should go back to the beginning of the Serbian aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic cleansing, and the killing, which resulted in the conquest of about 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite this, Serbia did not manage to force its opponents to capitulate. This fact will actually affect their future conduct. They will have to decide whether to carry on with the war to the end, until the military defeat of one or the other side, or stop at this point and join efforts to solve the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic and those around him will, in any case, have to explain to their people why the war was waged and why lives have been lost. Why Were Lives Lost? [Erceg] Will the Croatian politicians who accepted the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina have to answer the same question? [Manolic] Yes, this question will also be raised here, although I think that it is more important at present to concentrate efforts on the consistent implementation of the agreement. This means observing peace, searching for an internal solution that would suit everyone in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and providing constitutional guarantees to each group. [Erceg] You are therefore not questioning common life in Bosnia, like some other politicians who have been claiming for some time that cohabitation in this state has always been false? [Manolic] Those who have been advocating such views, in the Assembly and outside it, should today feel ashamed of their statements, because these statements were not founded on either Bosnia-Herzegovina's past or present. [Erceg] So, there is a sudden turnabout in attitudes toward the Muslims. President Tudjman says that the current denouement is the result of "consistency in Croatia's policies." What do you think about this? Has this policy indeed been consistent? [Manolic] The thesis that is in circulation, as you can see, is that there is no turnabout in the policy and that this policy has consistently been implemented. However, if one looks at the development of Croatian-Muslim relations, one could see turnabouts and changes. Did we not first wage a war with the Muslims against the common enemy, the Serbs, did we not then clash with the Muslims, and are we not, today, again looking for ways of cohabiting in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a peaceful solution to the conflict? Every normal person will conclude that two turnabouts were made. I do not have anything against everyone adhering to their own assertions and theses. However, one should not impose one's own views, by using deceits and by passing the ball to the opponents' court, that all those who have been claiming that the war against the Muslims should never have taken place, or that such destruction and genocide, for which both sides are responsible, were unnecessary, were wrong. [Erceg] You, Stipe Mesic, and some other people were in favor of preserving Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Why were you not listened to? [Mesic] The situation in politics is not the same as in the army. The dispute in the Croatian Democratic Community, which happened over the policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, was won by the faction that, favoring the war option in Bosnia, did not anticipate all the consequences for Croatia and its interests. Minority Was Right [Erceg] The struggle between two factions in the Croatian Democratic Community was in fact a struggle for Tudjman's support. The solution to many problems, including that of Bosnia-Herzegovina, depended on this support. [Manolic] It is normal that a faction that prevails in politics should play the lead role. One can remain in a minority with his own views, but this, of course, does not mean that one is wrong. This only means that one should let time reveal the value of his policies. [Erceg] Will the proponents of such a Croatian policy be an obstacle to the realization of the Croatian-Muslim agreement or will they have to go? [Manolic] The values of the multiparty system are such that even the line detrimental to the state can win sometimes. The Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in the last two years has been between a rock and a hard place. While the opposition and the ruling party were united over the Serbian aggression, they were divided over the clash between the Croats and the Muslims. [Erceg] I will repeat the question: Will some people represent an obstacle....? [Manolic] Yes, a number of people will be an obstacle to the realization of the agreement with the Muslims. [Erceg] Who are these people? [Manolic] Gojko Susak [defense minister], for instance. He should not be seen only as a carrier pigeon between Zagreb and Grude, but also as a man responsible for that policy, as well as for statements and moves regarding the clash between the Croats and the Muslims. [Erceg] Why do such people not resign and why is the institution of resignation almost unknown in politics in Croatia? [Manolic] This only means that the mechanism of democratic institutions is not sufficiently effective to force the people responsible for the conflict to resign. [Erceg] Were you ever afraid of a conflict among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the duality in the Croatian politics: Two completely different policies were applied toward the Croats in Herzegovina and the Croats in central Bosnia. [Manolic] You know, about 10 months ago a proponent of the war option asked me: "Why are the Herzegovina Croats fighting at all when one half of the Croatian nation is against their Herceg-Bosna?" This question has not been answered to this date. Both history and the proponents of that policy will have to answer this question. [passage omitted]
