FBIS3-266 "drafr043_c_94030" FBIS-AFR-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 4 Mar MB0403131094 MB0403131094 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Call for CP, IFP To Register for Election -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 3 March in a page-6 editorial notes that Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi "is wise" to keep his "options open" by considering to provisionally register his party for the election. He can participate in the election "if he succeeds in getting his basic demands addressed, or he can continue to boycott the election if they are not." THE CITIZEN's advice to the Conservative Party (CP) is to "register -- and decide what you want to do afterwards." THE STAR Anxiety Over National Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 March in a page-14 editorial believes there are "real reasons for anxiety" over the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) members' strike over pay. The strike, as well as reports of "drunkenness, insubordination, desertion and racism within the ranks" reinforces perceptions of the NPKF as "an ill-disciplined, if not mutinous force." "To top it all, the NPKF commander and former military ruler in Venda, Gabriel Ramushwana, has been accused of being in receipt of money from the Venda Pension Fund to which he is not entitled." "Meant to serve as a model for the future, the NPKF has so far been a generator of gloom." No Time for International Mediation -- A second editorial on the same page welcomes international mediation if it will bring Buthelezi back into the constitutional process. "But it needs to be realised that the mere logistics of this process are daunting." The mediators would need more time "than is available before the April election, which it would now be highly unwise if not downright impossible to postpone." BUSINESS DAY Inadequate Security for Election Process -- "How many times have we heard government and police spokesman saying that `violence will not be tolerated'?" notes a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 March. "With the best will in the world, police cannot guarantee public safety." Just as worrying as the security of the polling stations is "the problem the police will face in combating ordinary crime with their depleted numbers on election days. If 70,000 policemen are indeed going to be on election duty, who is going to be on the beat, or chasing criminals?" Although thousands of foreign monitors will be on hand, "their job is to observe, not keep the peace." "It is hoped that security chiefs will swallow their pride and call on the expertise of their knowledgeable critics in revising their strategies." SOWETAN `Disjointed' Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 4 March in a page-10 editorial notes that the latest reports are that "the Conservative Party is so racked by internal dissent that it could see a breakaway rightwing group registering for elections. There is general confusion and distress -- not unexpected for a strange and disjointed grouping united only by expedience -- in the Freedom Alliance. There is likewise uncertainty in Natal and, it must be said, in the rest of the country. For all these reasons Mandela must have read the signals well -- there can be no lasting solution to the country's problems without Buthelezi's inclusion and active co-operation." CAPE TIMES `Political Opportunism' in New Housing Scheme -- "Housing Minister Louis Shill's unveiling of the government's massive new housing subsidy scheme is a classic example of political opportunism jeopardising political progress," points out Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 2 March in a page-6 editorial. "If the National Housing Forum [NHF] is correct, and Mr Shill has jeopardised the scheme through a premature announcement, he and his party will have much to answer for. The NHF and the ANC [African National Congress] for that matter should, however, avoid making the threat self-fulfilling." "Just as the incumbent government does not deserve all the blame for failures in the transition process, it cannot claim exclusive ownership of the successes either." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Official Indifference To Township Bloodletting -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 4-10 March in a page-16 editorial says: "At first sight, the swift reaction by state and private institutions to the Merriespruit slimes dam disaster seemed to send messages of old. In sharp contrast to the absence of meaningful response to violence on the East Rand, where the average weekend death toll matches that of the dam burst, the 15 white fatalities and destruction of property in the [Orange] Free State provoked the prompt declaration of a disaster area. Massive aid appeals were launched, topping R[rand] 1 million within a week. Why, we might ask, have government and the public not been able to react in a similar fashion to the wholesale destruction of the communities of Thokoza, Katlehong, and Vosloorus? Why is it that an apparent act of God can generate a sense of urgency, while the daily bloodletting in the townships meets increasing official indifference?" BEELD De Klerk Shows `Welcome' Leadership -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 1 March says in a page-10 editorial: "In his address to Parliament yesterday, State President de Klerk showed why he, as an analytical thinker, has no equal in the government and the National Party. In a short, powerful address he analyzed the state of constitutional negotiations and summed it up in a nutshell, and with a single stroke laid bare the political opportunism of the leaders of the Freedom Alliance. His conclusions were equally convincing: there is no longer any reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election and the national constitutional process." "For the first time he left no doubt among Freedom Alliance and left-wing radicals that the government would use every means at its disposal, including the security forces, to protect the democratic process. The firmness with which he declared that the police and the defense force would defend the integrity of the state and the constitution points to a newly found confidence in their loyalty -- an assurance which all democrats will welcome and the kind of leadership which the majority of South Africans expect of him. President de Klerk's understanding of the concern of the Zulu king and his followers over the future of the monarchy is only partially shared. We do not believe that the Zulu king ought necessarily to hold a unique position in any constitution. In South Africa, with its unique ethnic diversity, such ethnic exceptions create a recipe for ethnic conflict." PAC Hostility Toward Journalists Intolerable -- A second editorial on page 10 says: "The Pan-Africanist Congress' [PAC] open hostility towards journalists, and in particular white journalists, is becoming intolerable." "At the weekend PAC leaders and supporters called for the summary shooting of white journalists attending the funeral of PAC's Sabelo Phama in Transkei. The guns of the organization's armed wing should be turned on the white journalists, mourners said." "This kind of naked racism is worrying. In the emotionally laden atmosphere of such a funeral things could easily have taken a tragic turn. Until the PAC leadership publicly repudiates these statements, the PAC should not be surprised if journalists give a wide berth to its election rallies. And that could only be to the disadvantage of the PAC itself." Criticism of Peacekeeping Force Members' Strike -- The strike by National Peacekeeping Force members "necessitates urgent and real steps by authorities and leaders involved in the government in the transition process," says a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 March. "It just does not seem as though the peace force is getting its act together." "If there is so much disaffection in the peace force, how on earth will it succeed in ensuring peace during the election itself?" "South Africa's political leaders must realize that the problems in the peace force have the pontential to make the transition, which is already proving to be very difficult, even more so. Which is why urgent steps must be taken." Housing Issue Too Politicized -- A second editorial on page 10 of BEELD says: "National Housing Minister Louis Shill yesterday landed in the crossfire once again over his efforts to ease the problems of South Africa's millions of homeless people. In the Transitional Executive Council yesterday Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC went so far as to demand Mr. Shill's resignation" for having allegedly acted without the approval of the National Housing Forum. "The announcement of the housing scheme, said Mr. Ramaphosa, was made for political gain in the run-up to the election. Last year Mr. Moses Mayekiso on several occasions accused Mr. Shill of unilateral action. As was the case then, it is difficult to separate valid critism from politically motivated criticism. One thing is certain: the whole issue of housing has for a long time been highly politicized. In the circumstances, one could hardly imagine that Mr. Shill could believe he could issue such an important announcement unilaterally. The ball is now in Mr. Shill's court to prove that he acted with the necessary support of the National Housing Forum." ILANGA Call for Community Protection -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu for 28 February-2 March in a page-4 editorial notes it is a "mere eight weeks" before election day. ILANGA cannot figure out "when the ANC, and other groups that are campaigning, will begin preparing to ensure a peaceful election. We do not know when the government itself will flex its muscle to put some fear into these lawbreakers who insist on disrupting the lives of people." "Ideally voters should be experiencing peace already in their communities. Even those from overseas cannot bring peace if there is no peace within the country. We have peace agreements that were signed by various groups in the country, they too are broken day and night and nobody cares. Parties on the election campaign trail have their rallies disrupted by lawless groups, and some party leaders even end up canceling meetings in some areas." "The nation is without any protection. It has become a cardinal sin to belong to a political party, and yet Mr. de Klerk and others say there can be no disruption of elections. Does this mean that the protection of the masses will only begin on election day? We feel that the protection of communities should have long begun, so that come election day all is quiet, with everyone wary of disturbing the peace, but as things are now, lives are in danger. When will the campaign to protect the people of this country from strife begin?"
