But energy consumers alone owe one trillion 200 billion, and 4.2 trillion hang in mid-air. Commenting on the situation, National Bank of Belarus Board of Directors Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich said: "We bought it cheap, sold cheap, and are living well. All this for the sake of supporting industry, in order to reduce the cost of production. But this has led us into a blind alley, because if the consumption of power is not cut down, and one has to pay, then after all it must be recovered from someone." The chief treasurer of the republic noted that an idea is already wandering, according to which the national bank will have to "create out of air" 4 trillion and pay up. "But the way this question is formulated is devoid of common sense," he emphasised.
