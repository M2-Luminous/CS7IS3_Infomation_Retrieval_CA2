Commenting on the current Croatian-Serb relations at the Zagreb Airport, Churkin told ITAR-TASS "they are not as smooth as they could be. I will do my best to achieve any progress". He said there are considerable obstacles on the way of post-Yugoslav settlement, but the sides must find a possibility to progress. The London meeting with special envoy of the U.S. President on Bosnia Charles Redman on Friday resulted in mutual understanding and readiness for the most close cooperation in the conflict settlement, said Churkin. On Sunday the official will meet leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo and on Monday he will leave for Belgrade.
