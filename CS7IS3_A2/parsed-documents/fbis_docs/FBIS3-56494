According to reports from our Simferopol correspondent, out of the six candidates running, no one received the required number of votes for an outright victory. Viktor (Alsufiev), chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, said that the commission will have to discuss a runoff between the two candidates receiving the most votes in yesterday's election. Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the Republican Party of the Crimea, came in first in both Simferopol and Sevastopol, as well as in many rural areas. Yuriy Meshkov received 540,000 votes altogether. The second-place candidate for the presidential office is Mykola Bahrov -- chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet -- who received 245,000 votes. Third place is occupied by Serhey Shuvaynikov, of the Russian Party of the Crimea, who won 186,000 votes. Leonid Hrach, leader of Crimean communists, received some 180,000 votes.
