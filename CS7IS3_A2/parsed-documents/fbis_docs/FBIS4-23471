This has been taking place since 4 May with the consent of the Namibian authorities, and the Angolan consul in the city of Rundu, the capital of Okavango Province. With the current compulsory recruitment, hundreds of youths have just been flown to Luanda, but the campaign continues and is scheduled to reach 2,400 men. The Bagani, Omege, Mukwe, Andara, Kangongo, and Chobe areas are currently the most affected. In February the Namibian president guaranteed that his country would defend the international rights of the refugees, but it seems that this is no longer so, since he is assisting the Luanda communist government.
