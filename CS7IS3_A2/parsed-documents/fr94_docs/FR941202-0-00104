FR941202-0-00104 FR941202-0-00011 40 CFR Part 70 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5116&hyph;2] Clean Air Act Final Interim Approval Operating Permits Programs in Oregon AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final interim approval. SUMMARY: EPA is promulgating interim approval of the operating permits programs submitted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority (LRAPA) for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements for an approvable State program to issue operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Copies of Oregon's submittal and other supporting information used in developing the final interim approval are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following location: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne Dalrymple, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, Washington 98101, (206) 553&hyph;0199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Purpose Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (sections 501&hyph;507 of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'')), and implementing regulations at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70, require that States develop and submit operating permits programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to Section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to two years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program. On September 14, 1994, EPA proposed interim approval of the operating permits programs for ODEQ and LRAPA, provided certain proposed revisions to Oregon rules were adopted and submitted to EPA as a program revision prior to EPA's statutory deadline for acting on the State's submittal. In the alternative, EPA proposed disapproval of the Oregon program if the proposed revisions were not adopted and submitted prior to the statutory deadline. See 59 FR 47105 (Sept. 14, 1994). EPA received four public comments on the proposal. In this notice EPA is taking final action on its proposal to promulgate interim approval of the operating permits programs for ODEQ and LRAPA. II. Final Action and Implications A. Analysis of State Submission and Response to Public Comments 1. Changes to Chapter 340, Division 28 On July 11, 1994, ODEQ proposed for public comment revisions to OAR Chapter 340, Division 28 (Stationary Source Air Pollution Control and Permitting Procedures). EPA discussed these proposed changes in the September 14, 1994 Federal Register notice proposing action on Oregon's title V submittal. 1 See 59 FR 47108&hyph;47111. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission (EQC) adopted the revisions to OAR Chapter 340, Division 28 on October 21, 1994. These rules became effective on October 28, 1994. Oregon submitted these revised regulations to EPA on November 15, 1994 as an amendment to the Oregon title V submittal. The revisions make the regulatory changes necessary for the Oregon program to receive interim approval. 1 Unless otherwise stated, all references to ``Oregon,'' ``Oregon's submittal'' or ``Oregon's program'' refer to the operating permit programs submitted by the State of Oregon on behalf of ODEQ and LRAPA. The following rules were adopted or revised in response to EPA's September 14, 1994 Federal Register notice: OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(15); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(3)(c)(E); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(7) (renumbered to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(8)); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2120(3); OAR 340&hyph;28 2130(3)(a)(E); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2130(3)(c)(B); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2170(1); 2 OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2200(1)(d). 2 This regulation was erroneously cited in the proposed Federal Register as OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2170(a).
