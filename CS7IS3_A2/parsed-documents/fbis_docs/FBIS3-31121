It is also beginning to discuss what Tadeusz Mazowiecki proposed a year and a half ago: the proposal to turn Sarajevo into a demilitarized zone. Do you think there is a possibility that NATO will eventually decide to use air strikes against the heavy artillery surrounding Sarajevo? [Dziemidowicz] There is such a possibility and, as a matter of fact, NATO has for many months been studying whether or not to take firmer steps... [Bninska, interrupting] It has been thinking about it, but it has not taken any such steps. [Dziemidowicz] Well, it is by no means a simple decision. On the one hand, everyone is saying....[Dziemidowicz pauses] The pressure of world public opinion is unequivocal. One cannot passively watch entire nations kill one another, watch them practically disappear as a consequence of all kinds of ethnic cleansing. On the other hand, launching military action--even limited action--entails the risk of further fueling this war, spreading it to other areas.... [Bninska, interrupting] This is what Milosevic keeps saying. [Dziemidowicz] It also threatens to fuel terrorism. It is difficult to take on such a responsibility and I understand the hesitation before the final decision is made. This decision certainly must be reached. The senseless slaughter in Bosnia must be stopped; however, despite all the lofty and nice headlines in newspapers, which say what should, ought, or must be done, the decisionmaking process is very complex and.... [Bninska, interrupting] What does that work? Is global diplomacy based solely on money and interests? Now, in the case of the Gulf war and Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, the decision was made almost immediately. A few months after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, the Security Council gave its assent for the allied forces to retake Kuwait. In the case of Yugoslavia, no one has done anything for 22 months--aside from peace talks which have not yielded any results. Of what does global diplomacy really consist? [Dziemidowicz] It is difficult to speak about diplomacy in the global dimension, of course. In every region, different--most often conflicting--interests come into play. However, in the case of Kuwait, the situation was rather simple: there was an invader and an invaded country. We can, of course, still talk about the various interests.... [Bninska, interrupting] However, in the case of Somalia, the situation was not that simple. [Dziemidowicz] Still, the decision was made relatively quickly, you must admit. It was backed by public support around the world and by practically all major politicians. The carrying out of this operation is a different story. Now, in the case of former Yugoslavia--because we are now speaking about the entire area--the situation is really quite equivocal. No one knows how to cope with this problem. We keep hearing threadbare expressions about the Balkan crucible, a keg of gunpowder. However, there is something about it: decades pass by and such a conflict cannot be settled. [Bninska] Last week Poland signed the Partnership for Peace, which means that we are somewhere in the corridor of NATO. Now, in the case of making such a decision, does this partnership envision the following: if NATO decides to bombard Yugoslavia, and after all, we are closer to Yugoslavia than France for instance, will NATO hold any talks with Poland? I understand that it does not consult with us about such things, but does this Partnership for Peace envision Poland being informed before the media? [Dziemidowicz] Definitely yes; yes, of course. The principle of nothing about us without us, is also binding in this case. I think that the mechanisms of protection, information, and consultations within the Partnership for Peace program will be discussed many times in the media: we have only just begun, we have only just joined this program, we have only just started the talks with our partners at NATO Headquarters, with the individual member states of the organization. Therefore, everything will gradually smooth itself out. The more support for our stance, for our readiness to take part in this program, we gain in these first few most important months, the more fruit we will receive later on. [Bninska] Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] think NATO should use air strikes against Yugoslavia, especially in light of the recent massacre in Sarajevo? [Dziemidowicz] I cannot give you an unequivocal answer to this question. The decision will certainly be broader. It will not be a decision made by one state or a group of states; it will be a decision for the Security Council; it may require a consensus. I do not think that one single state will take on the burden, not to mention the odium, of such a decision. [Bninska] Do we have enough money to implement the Partnership for Peace? National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk claims that this year we will need at least half a trillion zlotys, which the Ministry of National Defense [MON] simply does not have. How much does MSZ think will have to be spent on the program? [Dziemidowicz] It may either be half a trillion or even several times as much. Partnership for Peace consists, among other things, in the fact that a state contributes to the program as much as it wants to or is prepared to contribute. We can take part in undertakings which we accept or which we initiate. Therefore, we do not necessarily have to look at these matters in terms of money.... [Bninska, interrupting] However, how much is the government prepared to contribute? [Dziemidowicz] Naturally, Minister Kolodziejczyk is right in saying that MON does not have this amount of money. The partnership was signed after the money was initially distributed. Thus, it is simply not possible for any decisionmaker in MON to pay this amount of money from the coffers of the ministry. It is certainly a decision for the government, and therefore.... [Bninska, interrupting] Is MSZ prepared to pay this money? [Dziemidowicz] MSZ will definitely not pay such a sum; however, it will participate in any expenditures related to the Partnership for Peace to a rational extent. [Bninska] Is this Partnership for Peace profitable from our point of view? It entails spending a lot of money, taken out of our pockets, which probably means that teachers or physicians, for instance, will have a little less money. Will it pay off? What are we going to get in return? [Dziemidowicz] At the beginning you mentioned this corridor. Now I will repeat the quotation that has been referred to many times: It is better to be in the corridor than out in the cold. I simply think that there is no alternative for Poland: it must join Western structures, that is, the European Union and NATO. We must do this for the future of our reforms, the process of democratization, and first of all, for the feeling of security for 40 million Poles. It is simply indispensable for us to join those structures. [Bninska] As far as I remember, in the autumn of 1990 in Krakow, the Visegrad Group was established with a big bang. This Visegrad Group comprised Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary; apart from developing close economic cooperation, these three countries decided to build up political cooperation and make efforts to join West European structures. Does the Visegrad Group still exist? [Dziemidowicz] Yes, it does. I will not say that it is in good shape; it is going through a crisis. However, I will say what Mark Twain once said: The rumors about the death of this group are quite premature. It is merely.... [Bninska, interrupting] Is it angina or perhaps lung cancer? [Dziemidowicz] I would say it is angina, but not in the most acute form. Please note that the public is being informed about very spicy details from the statements of various politicians which undermine.... [Bninska, interrupting] Including the prime minister? [Dziemidowicz] Which undermine, although not entirely, certain forms of the functioning of the Visegrad Group; we think that there are no such forms, such as the striving for institutionalization. Now, the Visegrad Group is functioning quite well. I am saying this on the basis of MSZ experience at lower levels, where consultations are held. In the individual countries where there are embassies of the four.... [Bninska, interrupting] However, what do these consultations yield? [Dziemidowicz] A lot. Many joint initiatives; first of all we inform one another about what we are going to do in this or that area. This is extremely important. [Bninska] The agreement, signed a few years ago in Krakow, also envisioned the establishment of a duty-free zone between these three states. Has this zone been established? [Dziemidowicz] This duty-free zone has already been established and it will be extended, or deepened, as it were. Namely, as the years go by, we will broaden the list of goods that can be bought or sold in Visegrad Group states without great difficulties. Also, as a result of internal discussions, the process of establishing the free trade zone has been expedited. At the beginning, in line with preliminary plans, the finalization of this project was supposed to be in the next century. Now we are certain that it is a matter of several years. [Bninska] How did the Visegrad Group become ill? I understand that from the economic point of view, it is functioning so-so. Why is it not so that these states do not unanimously defend each other and each other's political interests? [Dziemidowicz] I think that this is a kind of angina or mild flu which has affected the people and the political elites in this part of Europe. Namely, after the euphoria of 1989 or 1990, everything seemed to be clear and simple: we cooperate with one another, we are linked by common interests, we are striving for economic and political integration with the West at the same pace. At the very beginning, we probably failed to note that there are conflicts of interests among us as well; that our economies are not very compatible and that they are very similar and therefore competitive for similar groups of commodities; that all this calls for time. [Bninska] What are the conflicting interests among Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary? [Dziemidowicz] If you are referring to political interests, I can see none. However, as for economic interests, there certainly are conflicts. We have similar commodities that we want to sell, either on each other's markets or on third markets. [Bninska] The Czech Republic accused Poland of trying to be a kind of boss for this group, to be the best, and to submit the other two states... [Bninska pauses] Three states--the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary to itself. Is this true? [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that this is the truth. We certainly launched many initiatives; on many occasions we invited our partners to discussions on various problems. I think that this is simply normal and we will keep on doing this. Someone must come up with ideas. However, I think, or I am even positive that we are not at all trying to impose our point of view; we are rather trying to set off our common interests. [Bninska] For a few days we have seen frictions between the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Do these disputes affect the work of MSZ in any way? [Dziemidowicz] No, they do not. However, I fear that as a result of them, commentaries less favorable to Poland may start coming in from abroad. We have not seen this as yet. The Pawlak government was rather popular with the foreign press, especially after the prime minister's visit to Brussels. I do not know yet what it will be like this time. [Bninska] A subcommittee of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee has been established to check the personnel of MSZ. Do those who established it belong to the government? How is the ministry functioning within the coalition structure? [Dziemidowicz] The ministry is functioning fairly well. The initiatives are quite varied. There has been a deputies' initiative concerning Poles living in Lithuania. Thus, I think that we will resolve many problems and.... [Bninska, interrupting] Minister Olechowski was indignant at the establishment of this subcommittee. Has MSZ changed its mind? Will it want to cooperate with this subcommittee? Will this subcommittee be just like former verifications? [Dziemidowicz] Deputy Micewski is going to meet with Minister Olechowski. I do not imagine that any binding decisions can be made without this talk talking place. [Bninska] The creators of this concept of establishing the subcommittee claimed that personnel matters, concrete persons in concrete posts, would not be discussed. However, Deputy Micewski did not conceal that names may be mentioned there. Who is entitled to select employees for the ministry: the Sejm or the minister? [Dziemidowicz] The personnel policy in the ministry is definitely carried out by the minister. One of his tasks, duties, and prerogatives is to appoint and recall employees: in other words, it is his personnel policy understood as a broad concept. There is also no doubt that the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee is the organ with which the ministry is obliged to cooperate in various areas.... [Bninska, interrupting] The committee also has sessions with candidates for ambassadors, does it not? [Dziemidowicz] Exactly. It is also a body which issues opinions on ambassadorial candidates. [Bninska] Do you think that this committee can directly or indirectly cause any changes in the various posts in the ministry? Is it so that the minister listens to the committee and then decides to do whatever he wishes? [Dziemidowicz] Personnel policy is certainly the responsibility of the minister. However, let me reiterate that any suggestions, especially submitted by bodies which have been appointed to issue opinions on foreign policy, such as the committee, are quite important and taken into account in MSZ. [Bninska] In those disputes between PSL and SLD, we have once again heard about the issue of political deputy ministers in the so-called presidential ministries. MSZ is one such ministry. Does MSZ see the possibility of turning the posts of under secretaries of state into political ones? [Dziemidowicz] First of all, MSZ is just about to start the modernization process, that is, the adjustment of the ministry to criteria that are imposed on us by the interests of the Polish state, the necessity of strengthening the position of Poland among our neighbors, near and far, and the need to take a more economic look at the diplomatic service. I said we are just about to start this modernization. We hope that it will be started very soon, with the full consent of the government, of course. It must be preceded by discussions with the Foreign Affairs Committee. Minister Olechowski promised this to the deputies. Thus, it will be a broader discussion, a broader debate. We hope that as a result of it, we will shape a diplomatic service that will measure up to our needs, both today's and tomorrow's. [Bninska] When you already have this new diplomatic service, do you think you will allow it to become political? [Dziemidowicz] I do not think that will be necessary. However, the final shape does not depend on me. [Bninska] Thank you very much for the interview. [Dziemidowicz] Thank you.
