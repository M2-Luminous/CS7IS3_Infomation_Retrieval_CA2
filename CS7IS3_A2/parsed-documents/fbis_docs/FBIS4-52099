Nagano has justified Japan's aggression during World War II by claiming his country wanted to liberate Asian colonies from Europe. He also dismissed the "Rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese soldiers are believed to have killed some 300,000 Chinese civilians, as "a hoax." His comments immediately raised temperatures in South Korea, a victim of over three decades of Japanese colonial rule before liberation at the end of World War II. Seoul and Tokyo had reached a political understanding last summer to close the book on their unhappy history. In addition to their own ire at Nagano's remarks, lawmakers here are concerned that his comments were not a slip of the tongue but representative of the new faction advocating Japan's remilitarization. After all, they cite Nagano's high status as justice minister and the fact that he is the first cabinet member since the war who was a member of the Japanese self-defense forces. Ruling Democratic Liberal Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called Nagano's words "bombastic, against the world current." "We cannot but express serious regrets that a cabinet member of the Japanese Government that champions political reform has such a skewed perspective of history," he said in a party commentary. "There has to be a clear explanation from the person himself, naturally, and from the Japanese Government." Rep. Kwon Ik-hyon, former chairman and now adviser to the Korea- Japan Parliamentarian Union, said he cannot understand "such betrayal of common sense." "I hope it was nothing more than a spur-of-the-moment thing," he said. Rep. No Chae-pong, a member of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs-Unification Committee, wondered why Nagano made such comments when Seoul and Tokyo were finally working on building a future relationship. Deputy Spokesman Son Hak-kyu was worried about a revival of Japanese militarism. "But South Korea-Japan relations should not be influenced by this incident, and we send our full support to the majority of the Japanese people who want peace through resolution of the past," he said. Opposition Democratic Party spokesman Pak Chi-won wanted to know if the Japanese Government has indeed changed its perspective on the war. "Our government must demand a clear-cut explanation and prevent any repetition of this kind of incident," he said in a commentary. Rep. Kim Won-ki, saying it was not an accidental outburst, insisted Nagano's comments reflect what Japan has believed all along. "The whole world is turning into regional blocs. Japan, too, hasn't given up its hopes for hegemony," he said. "Nagano's talk could turn into a real threat for us if we don't build up our political role." "It's nothing short of historical distortion proving the war of colonialism has not yet ended," Rep. Yim Chae-Chong said. Rep. Son Se-il blasted the new Japanese Government, accusing it of being more backward than the Liberal Democratic Party on historical issues. "Our government is even considering military cooperation with Japan, but we have to review South Korea-Japan relations from the basics," he said.
