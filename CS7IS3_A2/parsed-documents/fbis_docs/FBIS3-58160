Manfred Woerner, opening a summit in Brussels which will determine the future shape of European defence strategy, said the vital objective was "to build a new comprehensive Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or against, Russia." The NATO's secretary-general said NATO alone could guarantee security to its member nations "because it is the only functioning collective defence organisation on the globe." It was the "key element" of stability in a world hit by instability, crises and conflicts. No new security order in Europe was conceivable without NATO, insisted Mr. Woerner. But he warned that NATO could "wither away" without a clear sense of purpose and that it could be threatened by stagnation and even erosion. "Our Alliance needs continuous investment, not only of resources and manpower, but even more so of political energy and the determination on both sides of the Atlantic to use it as the main forum of consultation and the most effective instrument of our security and defence." Mr. Woerner applauded U.S. President Bill Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative as the way to extend defence cooperation and stabilise the whole of Europe. "We will allow no one and nothing to manoeuvre our Alliance into a false alternative; to have to choose between Russia and the other cooperation partners." He said the message to the new democracies in central and eastern Europe was: "We shall not leave you alone. We care about your security which is of direct and material concern to us." But Mr. Woerner gave no clue as to a timetable for opening NATO's doors to new members. He said that when NATO membership was extended to new countries it would be to help stabilise Europe and not to divide it again. He emphasised that a significant level of U.S. forces permanently based in Europe -- pledged last night by Mr. Clinton -- would remain "an indispensable component" of the security strategy. Mr. Woerner said that Alliance structures had to be developed for more flexible security and warned: "More flexible structures will serve our purpose only if we maintain an adequate level of well trained and well equipped armed forces backed up by adequate resources. The fewer the means at our disposal, the fewer our options." He told the summit that NATO had to prepare for new security risks, particularly arising from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. "Nonproliferation is our priority, but it may not suffice. We have to look also at the appropriate means of protection."
