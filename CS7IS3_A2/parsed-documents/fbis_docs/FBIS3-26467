It has been learned that the mainland achieved greater development in securities administration last year. The State Council promulgated the first group of laws and regulations on securities management -- "Interim Regulations on the Administration of Stock Issue and Transactions" -- to provide the stock market with an important legal basis and guarantee. At present, apart from establishing the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, two national stock exchange quotation systems have been set up in the mainland. In order to guarantee rapid, accurate, and highly effective stock transactions, more than 17 regional stock exchange centers -- dealing primarily with such transaction items as treasury bonds, local enterprise bonds, and investment funds -- and 86 professional companies running the business of various securities are being built in the mainland. In addition, more than 370 credit investment companies have set up securities business departments and there are over 2,000 stock transaction agencies spreading all over the country. Using such advanced means as computers, this stock exchange network helps investors purchase all sorts of securities and facilitates stock transactions at any time.
