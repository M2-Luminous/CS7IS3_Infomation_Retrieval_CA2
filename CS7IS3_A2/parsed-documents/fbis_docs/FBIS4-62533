FBIS4-62533 "drsov095_u_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Latvia Russian Military Ship Withdrawal Set for 1 Jun Russian Military Ship Withdrawal Set for 1 Jun WS1305145194 Riga LETA in English 1145 GMT 13 May 94 WS1305145194 Riga LETA English BFN [Text] Riga, 13 May (LETA) -- On Thursday [12 May] Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs received the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Rannikh, who presented a fixed timetable for the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia. During the handover of the document the Deputy Commander of Western Military Group Fedor Melnichuk, the Commander of the Latvian defence forces, Dainis Turlais, and other officials were present. Under the document Russia pledges to withdraw all military ships from Liepaja and Ventspils by 1 June. However, as the Latvian premier stated after having viewed the timetable, the document is a detailed variant of the previous one handed over earlier and indicates 14 military units whose presence Latvia was not aware of. The agreement provides that Russia must present a full timetable of its forces pullout which is to be accomplished in June under the agreements signed in Moscow. Speaking on whether the Russian Army will be withdrawn earlier than by 31 August, Birkavs said that the new timetable indicates only this date as a deadline, although Mr. Melnichuk reminded during the talk that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev to speed up the process. All issues concerning troop withdrawal will be discussed at the special government session on Friday where commissioners for the control over the Latvian-Russian withdrawal agreements were confirmed. The prime minister highlighted unpleasant news reported from the firing ground in Adazi, whose installations were destroyed and plundered. This incident will be specially discussed with the commandment of the north-western military group.
