Maluf imposed a condition for his possible support for the governor's candidacy: that it result from a consensus between parties like Magalhaes' PFL [Liberal Front Party], Maluf's PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], and some other ticket. He said: "Governor Antonio Carlos is a good candidate. I could support him if he were the consensus candidate for the PFL, the PPR, and the PP [Popular Party]. I am not a candidate myself, but I have not renounced my candidacy." In his opinion the main point is that the candidate for president should be chosen by an alliance of several parties. Maluf disclosed that for more than 3 months he has been talking with leaders of several parties in an attempt to build such a union. In addition to his own candidacy and to that of the Bahia governor, Maluf includes the following leaders in the list of possible PFL presidential candidates: ex-Minister Jorge Bornhausen, Pernambuco Senator Marco Maciel, his fellow party member and Para Senator Jarbas Passarinho, and PP President Alvaro Dias. He said: "If we can make a consensus decision in March, why should we make it in February? In politics, agreements are announced only after they have been reached." Maluf said he liked the idea of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Senator for Rio Grande do Sul Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, making an alliance between the PMDB, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. He disagrees, however, that the objective of the coalition should be to find a candidate to oppose the candidacy of PT [Workers Party] President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. "It should be an alliance for Brazil," he said. As he usually does, however, Maluf did not lose the opportunity to criticize Lula. He reiterated that the PT candidate does not have enough experience to govern the country, noting that he, Maluf, "would not vote even for his own brother if he were to be a beginner at Planalto Palace." Maluf did not spare criticism of Itamar Franco, either, saying that the president "has neither a liking for nor devotion to power," while complaining about the government's delay in designating the new cabinet: "We have been without a government for 60 days and, worst of all, no one has realized this." Maluf charged Itamar Franco with having no political will to enforce an economic plan that can curb inflation. He said the fiscal adjustment proposed by the government is not sufficient for reducing the cost of living, and that the government must cut spending. "Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's main adversary is the government itself," he said.
