This situation emerged in the negotiating process in the past few days despite the objective desire of Brussels and Moscow for an accord. I would remind you that in Brussels on 9 December President Boris Yeltsin and EU leaders signed the "Joint Political Declaration on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union." The point of this document, both sides believed, was that at that moment the Partnership Agreement was not completely ready -- a whole series of technical points had to be cleared up. So, in order to enshrine at a high political level the joint will and readiness to sign the main document, the leaders of Russia and the EU decided to formulate a declaration of intent which would reflect the main points of the Agreement. Without going into the details of the Partnership Agreement itself, I should merely like to note that this is the first legally significant international document in which Russia is regarded not as a state with a centralized economy but as a country with an economic system in transition to the market. This gives us a whole series of trade advantages, both immediate and long-term, and makes it possible to shift our relations with the EU countries to the level that exists between the EU and the United States or the EU and Japan. However, the aforementioned "technical difficulties" in the text of the document consequently developed, contrary to the sides' expectations, into difficult obstacles to the signing of the Agreement. One of them emerged over the appearance in November last year of Yeltsin's well-known edict on Western banks; another is connected with the trade in nuclear materials and affects the interests of France, an EU member. The optimism shown by Moscow and Brussels last December during Yeltsin's visit to Belgium was well founded -- Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and Sir Leon Brittan, deputy chairman of the EU Commissioner, the chief participants in the talks, had managed at that time to find a solution to the tangle of contradictions that had developed. This solution is a most complex sequence of mutual compromises and concessions in various economic sectors where a snag at one level would ruin all the rest. At the start of May Shokhin and Brittan met again for the same reason -- their previous accord had not worked. The second solution seemed to have opened the way if not to the signing of the Agreement then at least to its initialing in June. However, at the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Monday France's Alain Juppe unexpectedly stated that the draft Agreement on Partnership with the Russian Federation was unacceptable. For the same reason as before: Paris is concerned that Russian exports of uranium will harm its trade in nuclear materials in the EU. "We are very worried about the recent development of events over the agreement with the EU," Georgiy Gabuniya, leader of the Russian Government delegation to the talks with the EU on the economic section of the Agreement, said in an exclusive interview for IZVESTIYA. "The French position puzzles us, to put it mildly, because it has no economic foundation. That is not simply our objective assessment -- during the talks we did not hear one convincing argument from the French in defense of their position. And the general fears that Russia might dump its uranium in the EU in the future have no concrete substance. "We have already made a concession in the solution that we found: If the uranium agreement is completely unacceptable to the French, let us live within the old regime which has existed since 1989 as part of the previous trade and economic agreement between the USSR and the EC, so as to preserve everything that has been achieved through the most complex negotiations. But even that does not suit Paris. Meanwhile no one has yet complained that we are disrupting the market or creating complications for Western industry." I would add to what Georgiy Gabuniya said that the uranium sector in France is concentrated in the interests of the Cogema firm, which employs thousands of people and which in recent years has recorded a sharp increase in profits (around $10 million in 1993). For the time being Paris' position remains really unclear. If a purely sectoral interest (uranium) is being pursued here, why has that not been backed up with documents? Or is this just a pretext for wrecking the whole agreement -- in which case the arguments are indeed difficult to formulate. In the present situation Moscow is quite willing to continue trying to break the deadlock on this problem. However, the ball is now in the court of the EU, with which we are officially holding negotiations. Perhaps some light will be shed by the expected arrival of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in Moscow today.
