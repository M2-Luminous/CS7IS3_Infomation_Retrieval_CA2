The meeting addressed several issues on the local scene, as well as the efforts being made by the committee to end the political crisis. The conferees also reviewed the decisions reached by the committee during its recent meetings in the commercial and economic capital, Aden. These decisions aim at implementing the accord document, activating Constitutional agencies, enhancing trust between political leaders, and supporting efforts to lead Yemen to a safe haven. The purpose of this is to safeguard Yemeni unity and democracy and build a modern Yemeni state. During the meeting, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council welcomed the members of the committee and blessed the committee's decisions. He said: We bless you and highly appreciate the committee's efforts that resulted in the accord document. This shows concern on the part of everybody. The homeland is, after all, for everybody and it is the duty of every patriotic and well-meaning individual to seek an end to the crisis that has plagued our people for more than seven months. Addressing the dialogue committee, the brother chairman said: We do not want you to be biased toward this or that party. We want you to favor the homeland and to champion it wisely and adroitly. The interests of the homeland should be placed above all other considerations. The political forces and all the sons of the homeland are responsible for ridding the homeland of the ongoing developments and schemes to foil the homeland's unity. These schemes cannot succeed unless there are domestic tools to implement them and unless the doors are open to them. We should close all doors and not allow the fragmentation of national unity, whatever the differences. We should have recourse to dialogue and not infringe on constant national principles and not harm our unity. It is better for us to sit at the negotiating table right from the very beginning to find solutions to our problems, instead of resorting to armed struggle and violence and later sitting at the negotiating table, having shed blood and destroyed the homeland. The brother chairman stressed the need for the dialogue committee to monitor the official media and make sure they abide by the committee's decisions and end the media campaigns. He said the Dialogue Committee should make a decision to assume direct supervision, through work teams, over all airports and seaports in Aden, Sanaa, Hadhramaut, al-Hudaydah, Ta'izz, and other Yemeni ports to make sure no weapons or military equipment and hardware are imported from abroad, and to stop military escalation. The brother chairman reiterated the commitment of the General People's Congress [GPC] to any decision adopted in this regard. He also denied press reports that Yemen has imported internationally banned weapons. He expressed extreme regret over hearing such unfounded rumors. He said: Whatever the political differences between the political organizations, we should not allow this to reach the level of harming Yemen and its international reputation. Repeating such false rumors does not harm just one political side alone; it harms all the Yemeni people and distorts their image worldwide. Consequently, it will be difficult to remove such a distorted image in the short run. Everybody should enjoy national responsibility toward such irresponsible practices. We should enhance mutual trust. The Dialogue Committee should also intensify its efforts so the homeland can recover and trust can be restored. This will enable everybody to devote their efforts to promoting a safe, stable homeland enjoying unity and democracy. The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council and GPC assistant secretary general.
