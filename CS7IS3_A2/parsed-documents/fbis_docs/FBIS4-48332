Witwatersrand army command spokesman Maj Christo Visser told SAPA the South African National Defence Force [SAVDF] cordoned off the area around Hostels One, Two and Three after claims that minibus taxi commuters had been abducted and were being held in the hostels. A taxi passing the hostels was shot at at about 3.30PM on Sunday, he said. Its occupants tried to flee but were allegedly abducted by hostel inmates. African National Congress supporters marched to the hostel and demanded to accompany a search of the hostels but this was rejected by hostel dwellers. Maj Visser said SANDF reinforcements had been sent to the area and on Sunday night members were trying to stabilise the situation which was described as "tense but under control".
