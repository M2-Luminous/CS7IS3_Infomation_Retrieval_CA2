Tajani also stressed that Berlusconi's decision to suspend all government-formation talks with his allies of the Northern League and the National Front was "irrevocable" and that the ball is now in the president's court. According to the Constitution, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must name the prime minister, who in turn names his cabinet members, but Berlusconi until yesterday was conferring with potential government allies without waiting for a mandate from the head of state. Berlusconi apparently gave up trying to pave some common ground between Bossi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini and lost his patience with Bossi's radical and unpredictable changes in position. Tajani in his statement conceded that "it is up to the president to interpret the election results and issue a mandate" to form a new government. "This is not a banana republic," said Tajani, adding that Bossi's "unlikely and useless" negotiations with his former arch-rivals of the Pact for Italy "only add confusion to confusion." But Pact leader Mario Segni denied having been contacted by any officials of the Northern League. "I have not yet received any phone call from Bossi, nor from any other League official, so I cannot say when we will meet." Segni did confirm however that he will be meeting with League officials but declined to reveal the agenda of the talks.
