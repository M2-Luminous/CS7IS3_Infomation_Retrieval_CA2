An Army source said the two, now naturalized Americans who were named in a Supreme Command complaint to the police on Wednesday, were believed to be in the United States. The request was conveyed through the US embassy in Bangkok as well as through the Thai military attache in Washington, the source said. He said a similar request was conveyed to Canberra on Wednesday through the Australian Embassy's military attache here in case the two might be in Australia. Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Laotian border after the 1975 defeat of the US-backed Hmong guerrillas by the Communist government in Vientiane. He then migrated to the United States from where he frequently returned to Thailand, the Army source said. According to the source, the United States could possibly arrest the two generals and extradite them to Thailand under a law which prevents Americans from trying to subvert foreign governments. However, the Supreme Command's Intelligence chief Col Chanya Warakhamin said the Army had not yet asked the United States to arrest the two. But he said the United States had made suggestions on legal angles which could be used to allow action to be taken against them. He did not explain. The Supreme Command on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the Crime Suppression Division asking the police to arrest the two for violating Thailand's national security laws by organizing the United Independent Front and Laos United Independent Force and making forays into Laos to carry out sabotage. The complaint also covered Vang Pao's followers in Thailand. The move signalled the Army's complete break from the generals who in the past were allies to the Thai Army and American troops in the anti-Communist movement along the Thai-Laotian border. Washington had always refused Thai requests for cooperation to stop Vang Pao, saying the US government did not support him. On Aug 20 last year, the supreme commander ordered that action be taken against anti-Vientiane guerrillas residing in Thailand, Col Chanya said. The Army has mounted a campaign to suppress the guerrillas during the past two years which led to the arrests of dozens of Vang Pao's supporters and members. Legal action has been limited to immigration law violations. "Most of them were arrested, checked for possession of weapons and sent back to whichever country they had come from," Chanya said. Chanya said the Army had run out of patience in trying to thwart the group's activities so it had to resort to asking for the arrest of the two leaders under criminal law. Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday said there was evidence that the two generals had raised money from Lao expatriates in the United States on a monthly basis to help the Lao liberation movement in Thailand. Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he believed the police would be able to trace the movements of the group as its members frequently crossed back and forth along the Thai-Laotian border.
