He is 54 years old and has spent 34 years in the Navy. He has served in various posts on all types of ship apart from submarines. His last post was head of a training center in Karlskrona. Olle Jonsson gave an interview to our correspondent. [Gromak] Mr. Jonsson, we are living at a time when new relationships are being established between states. This leaves its mark on the reform of the armed forces, including the navy. Changes are likewise taking place in the Russian Navy. In particular the fleet forces are being significantly reduced today. I am interested in whether the Swedish Navy will suffer cuts? [Jonsson] The arms reduction process has also affected the Swedish Navy with all its force. We have already been forced to cut a proportion of officers this year. A series of small naval warships which, given their length of service, could go on serving for another 10 years, is being withdrawn from the combat strength. Minelayers are also being withdrawn from the combat strength due to the expense of servicing them. [Gromak] What prospects do you see for further cooperation between Russian and Swedish seamen? [Jonsson] It is a very good thing that Russian and Swedish ships are taking part in joint exercises for the second year running. This allows us to get to know each other better. For example, Russian military medics came on board and visited our ship Goteborg when we put in together to the port of Kiel. They discussed the generally understood topics of providing emergency medical treatment at sea and of dealing with an emergency. [Gromak] The Baltic Fleet is on the whole based in Kaliningrad Oblast. During a recent visit to Kaliningrad, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas stated that the large concentration of troops in the area seems to be an anomaly. I am interested in hearing the opinion of a member of the Swedish military on this matter. [Jonsson] First, I have not heard about this statement by the prime minister [as published]. Second, I will express my personal opinion. I consider that it is essential for Russia to have a military base in Kaliningrad Oblast, especially now that you have to all intents and purposes left all your bases on the Baltic Sea....
