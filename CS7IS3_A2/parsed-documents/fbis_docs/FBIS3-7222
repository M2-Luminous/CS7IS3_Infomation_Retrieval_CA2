While it is said that the two nations are increasing their interdependence, they are deepening their mutual distrust. Why is this happening? The cause of this situation is the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, which ended with no agreement being reached. Japan has not taken voluntary and persuasive actions to resolve the economic frictions between Japan and the United States after the prime minister said no to U.S. trade demands. In the United States, the President has increasing taken a hard-line stand against Japan on trade while hinting at the possibility of slapping sanctions on Japan. The relations between Japan and the United States, which account for 40 percent of the world's gross national product, should not be left as they are. Worsening Japan-U.S. relations would not only hurt the national interests of the two countries, but would also bring instability to Asia and would affect the world negatively. Many nations are now concerned by how Japan-U.S. relations will develop in the future. Therefore, the two countries should by all means overcome their current economic frictions. If the two nations pool their wisdom, they will certainly overcome their economic frictions. Where, then, is the heart of the economic frictions? What should the two nations do to ease their economic frictions? We hope that both Japan and the United States will return to the starting point of their relations and think calmly about how to improve and move forward their relations without criticizing each other. The most important point is that shock waves resulting from the end of the cold war have now reached the economic imbalance between Japan and the United States. In that sense, it can be said that the latest developments involving Japan-U.S. relations are a totally new and difficult trial for postwar Japan-U.S. diplomacy. Break Away From "Optimism" During the Cold War Age First of all, Japan urgently needs to discard the optimistic view that it held during the cold war era and to fundamentally change how it handles its relations with the United States. Japan-U.S. trade frictions during the cold war era, no matter how fierce they were, were prevented from developing to the breaking point by the 11th-hour intervention of the Departments of Defense and State because of the existence of the Soviet Union, which was a common threat to the two nations. It has been pointed out that the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off because this time the traditional mediatory role played by the Departments of Defense and State did not work in the end. The so-called "water table" of security in bilateral economic talks has dropped, thus pitting the two nations against each other over economic interests. This is an important point. While the United States does not care about the decrease in the "water table," the weight of the United States in Japan's security remains unchanged. This is clear if we look at the situation on the Korean peninsula and in Asia, which remains unstable. The heart of problem lies in the combination of the Asian situation and Japan's $130 billion annual current-account surplus and its $50 billion trade surplus with the United States. Japan's Huge Surplus Is the Problem Japan's huge surplus has given the impression abroad that Japan is the only nation that won the cold war. Japan's massive surplus has already reached a level that cannot be tolerated politically, although it can be justified by academic analysis and logic. We cannot help but say that Japan does not fully understand this stern view. Japan, in a flurry of trade white papers and official government documents, has continued to criticize U.S. trade policy, which increasingly has tilted toward managed trade since the Clinton administration was inaugurated. It can be said that Japan's criticism has been so well-grounded that U.S. experts have echoed it. However, we regret actions taken by Japan itself after its criticism of the United States. Japan has failed to speedily take measures to turn the Japanese market into a transparent and open market. The brakes will be put on managed trade only when Japan firmly stands up for maintaining the free trade system. It is clear what tasks Japan should accomplish as a frontrunner of the world economy. The government should take measures to expand Japan's domestic demand and further open the Japanese market. What is important for Japan is speedy action. The private sector should reject the government's intervention, which disrupts the market, and should make independent efforts to boost imports. To that end, the government should first voluntarily set a medium-term target for reducing Japan's current-account surplus. Second, the government should speedily overhaul the current tax system and decide to cut the income tax for three years prior to raising the consumption tax. Third, the government should try to add more than 100 trillion yen to the basic plan for public investment after making clear how it will secure revenue to cover the additional amount. Needless to say, the government should review the conventional allocation of public investment in the basic plan to prepare for the arrival of a graying society and the information age. The government also should take measures to relax regulations and to liberalize direct foreign investment in Japan. We hope that the government will more boldly relax regulations and liberalize foreign investment in Japan than is the case in other industrialized nations. The promotion of fair competition through the stringent enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is indispensable. It is important to employ publicity to get the message across to the world that Japan is taking action. We would like to propose anew holding an "import summit" where Japanese entrepreneurs and ordinary Japanese meet together to discuss how to boost Japan's imports. Americans' attendance at the summit is welcomed. The U.S. Withdrawal of Sanctions Against Japan Is the Key There is a major prerequisite for Japan's voluntary actions: The United States should withdraw its approach of unilateral sanctions against Japan, such as the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, and indicate its intention to deal with trade frictions with Japan on the basis of sound thinking. The U.S. International Trade Administration (ITA), which had examined a dumping complaint filed by U.S. steelmakers against Japanese steelmakers involving steel wire being sold on the U.S. market, handed down a final ruling on 17 March that the Japanese steelmakers did not inflict any damages on U.S. steelmakers. It can be said that the final ruling was a decision that reflected the actual state of the Japanese and U.S. economies, which rely on each other. Mutual retaliation between the two countries have ended in both of them shooting themselves in the foot. It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to work to broaden the scope of their diplomacies from a medium- and long-term perspective. The creation of a wise men's conference of Japanese and U.S. opinion makers is worthy of a full study. The conference is expected to play the role of preventing any fresh frictions between the two countries by providing early warnings of them. We would like to refrain from commenting on the lack of political leadership in Japan in this editorial. But, now is the time for politicians to break with their past practice of using "external pressure to accomplish Japan's domestic reforms."
