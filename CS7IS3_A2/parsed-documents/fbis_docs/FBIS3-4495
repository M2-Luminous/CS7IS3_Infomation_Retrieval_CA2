Li made the remarks when meeting with a U.S. delegation of the committee of 100, headed by 76-year-old renowned architect I.M. Pei, the committee's governor. Li said that both China and the United States are big countries and their relations have an impact not only in various fields of both countries, but also on the peace, development and stability of the world as a whole. Therefore, he said, leaders of both China and the United States should carefully handle relations between the two countries, with a highly responsible attitude. He said that both China and the U.S. share common understanding and cooperation, and also have differences. Yet from the viewpoint of the process of the development of bilateral relations, differences and opposition are reducing in a winding way, while the common understanding and cooperation are growing though in a difficult way, he said. To develop bilateral ties is the will of the peoples of the two nations and is in accordance with the trend of history as well, he said, adding: "We are fully confident about the prospect of the Sino-U.S. relations." Li noted that many members of the committee are well-known Americans of the Chinese origin. "There is no doubt that you expect a powerful China, and of course a powerful United States since you are living there," Li said, adding that he believed in their sincere hope for a closer Sino-U.S. relationship. The CPPCC chairman also voiced appreciation and thanks for the great efforts that the committee has made for the promotion of Sino- U.S. relations, and hoped that it will continue to do more for the further development of such relations. I.M. Pei said that they are delighted to see China's achievement in its reforms and opening up, and that his committee is willing to make contributions to the development of Sino-U.S. relations.
