FR940505-1-00089 FR940505-1-00012 Producers of such pesticides must determine the VOC content 54 of their products as defined by an analytical method. All agricultural and structural pesticides registered in California must be tested, regardless of whether the producer is located inside or outside of the State. Distribution, application, and storage of pesticides with high VOC contents will be restricted in California. 54 The actual volatility of the organic compounds in a particular pesticide depends on the temperature, moisture, substrate, application technique, and other conditions under which it is applied. Therefore, ``VOC emission potential'' might more accurately reflect the result of the analytical test methods. EPA, however, is using the term ``VOC content'' to be consistent with analogous coating regulations. 9,500 pesticide formulations may be subject to the analysis requirement, and sale and use of several thousand may be subsequently restricted. EPA cannot determine how industry will respond to restrictions on each specific formulation. Generally, however, EPA expects that low-VOC reformulations will provide feasible alternatives for many restricted pesticides. The proposed rule is not intended to apply to consumer-oriented pesticides that are subject to consumer products regulations in this NPRM (40 CFR 52.2957) or in the California Code of Regulations (Title 17, Division 3, Subchapter 8.5_Consumer Products, §§94507&hyph;94517). The proposed rule is also not intended to apply to production or distribution of pesticides intended for use outside of California. (2) Specific provisions. Required submission of data. By June 1, 1996 or 120 days after the effective date of the rule, whichever is later, producers must submit analyses identifying the VOC content of all affected pesticides. EPA believes that 120 days is ample time to perform this analysis, and notes that the requirement is being proposed over two years before the analysis will come due. Concern has been raised that independent laboratory capacity may be insufficient to analyze all regulated pesticides within 120 days. EPA believes, however, that most large pesticide manufacturers will perform the required analysis in-house, and that independent laboratory capacity will be sufficient to handle the remaining analytic demand. Analysis is required of all California-registered pesticides including those not currently in use. This information is needed to determine an accurate base-year VOC emission inventory to compare against future emission reductions. It is also important to identify all available low-VOC pesticides regardless of whether they are currently in use in order to maximize the available pest-control options. Establish VOC limit. The proposed rule describes a six-step procedure for establishing a VOC limit for pesticides. (i) EPA will establish a base-year pesticide use inventory for each pesticide registered in California. This inventory may consist simply of the amount of each pesticide applied in the State according to the 1990 pesticide use report (PUR) combined with the inerts data-base, both of which are maintained by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). The proposed rule is drafted, however, to provide the Agency discretion to establish the base-year inventory using other information. EPA could, for example, use an average of the 1990 to 1993 PUR data for just the three FIP areas if that was determined to be more appropriate. In any case, EPA intends to discuss the base-year inventory actually used when promulgating the VOC limit pursuant to §52.288(c)(2)(vi). (ii) EPA will rank the pesticides according to their VOC content. The pesticide with the largest VOC content (i.e., a gas or highly volatile liquid) will be ranked # 1. If EPA determines that adequate data for a particular pesticide is not submitted by the deadline, EPA may assign the pesticide a VOC content equal to the largest VOC content reported for any pesticide (i.e., also ranking it # 1). This would effectively prohibit distribution and application of this pesticide in the affected area pursuant to §52.2960(c)(5). EPA's intention is to provide an incentive for manufacturers to submit the required data while simultaneously enabling the Agency to implement the regulation in the absence of some data. Nevertheless, the regulation is drafted to provide the Agency some discretion in assigning VOC contents for pesticides in the absence of adequate data. EPA might, for example, determine it more appropriate to assign VOC contents for such a pesticide based on the largest VOC content reported for its formulation type (e.g., oil, emulsifiable concentrate, pressurized liquid, etc.) Or, if analysis of a pesticide failed to demonstrate a specific VOC content but did demonstrate that the VOC content fell within a discrete range, EPA might assign the pesticide the largest VOC content within that range. In any case, EPA intends to discuss the VOC contents actually assigned when promulgating the VOC limit pursuant to §52.288(c)(2)(vi). (iii) EPA will multiply the VOC contents (weight percent basis) by the base-year inventory (kilogram-per-year basis) to establish the individual base-year VOC emissions (kilogram-per-year basis). A pesticide not used in the affected area in the base-year(s) would have a base-year inventory and a VOC emission of zero. (iv) EPA will add the base-year VOC emissions of all affected pesticides to determine the total base-year VOC emissions in the affected area. (v) Starting with the highest-ranking pesticides (i.e., those with the largest VOC content and those without adequate data), EPA will add the individual base-year VOC emissions until the sum equals 40 to 65 percent of the total base-year VOC emissions. The VOC content of the last pesticide needed to achieve 40 to 65 percent is the VOC limit. EPA has assumed that restricted pesticides will be replaced on a one to one mass basis with pesticides at the VOC limit. 55 Based on an analysis described in the technical support document (TSD) for the proposed rule, EPA has calculated that a 40 to 65 percent threshold value will achieve emission reductions of 20 to 45 percent off the base-year inventory. The target reduction of 20 to 45 percent was chosen for consistency with the range of target reductions of the stationary source cap rules described in section III.C.5 of this NPRM. Based on planned modeling and inventory analysis and comments received during the comment period, EPA hopes to select a specific reduction target from within this range for use in the final rule promulgation. The relationship between the 20&hyph;45 percent reduction target and the 40&hyph;65 percent threshold value is discussed further in the TSD. 55 Imbedded in the one-to-one replacement assumption is another assumption that, in the aggregate, pesticide efficacy is not reduced by reformulation to lower VOC products. For some specific pesticides, efficacy may decrease and applicators may respond by using greater quantities of the reformulated product. Emissions associated with this phenomenon will be somewhat offset by replacement of specific restricted products by pesticides with VOC contents below the VOC content limit. (vi) EPA will publish the VOC limit. EPA intends to publish this limit in the Federal Register with a discussion of the data and assumptions used to generate the limit. If the limit is generated by a straightforward execution of the procedure described in this NPRM, EPA may publish the limit directly in final form. If, however, EPA exercises significant discretion (as provided for in the proposed rule) in generating the limit, EPA intends to take public comment on a proposed limit before publishing the final limit. Restrictions on pesticides. One year after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from distributing in the affected area pesticides with VOC contents greater than the VOC limit. After that time, distributors with remaining inventory of high-VOC pesticides could still sell them to persons outside the affected area.
