Birkavs declared this at a briefing staged after a special sitting of the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday in Riga which considered this order issued by Yeltsin. As it was reported earlier a package of interstate agreements determining the date for troop withdrawal from Latvia, namely August 31, 1994 and several additional provisions, including the one concerning Russia holding on to the early-warning radar in Skrunda for 5.5 years, is being prepared now to be signed by Latvian and Russian presidents. At the briefing, Birkavs pointed out that the initialled agreements do not stipulate that this site would have the status of a military base. The official statement of the Latvian Cabinet says that "the Latvian government has never agreed and will never agree to create Russian military bases on Latvian territory and to test new armaments and military equipment on its territory, it also rules out the possibility of any negotiations on these issues." Birkavs added that the order of the Russian president appeared "under the influence of Russia's conservative circles whose goals coincide with the interests of Latvia's national radical circles -- to prevent conclusion of the Russian-Latvian treaty."
