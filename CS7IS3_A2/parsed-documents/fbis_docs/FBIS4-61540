Khabarovsk Residents Are Not Going To Cede the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy Island to the Chinese"] [Text] Border guards of the Far Eastern Border District have prevented a penetration by five Chinese military vessels. As Khabarovsk Kray administration chief Viktor Ishayev told SEGODNYA's correspondent, on the afternoon of 1 May Chinese vessels, in line formation, were moving in to breach the Russian-Chinese border in the area of the Kazakevich outpost, 40 km from Khabarovsk. Mr. Ishayev demanded that the border district command use all legitimate means to curb this attempt. As a result of decisive actions by patrol boats and vessels of the Amur Flotilla, the Chinese military vessels were not allowed across the border. No casualties, fighting, or damage are reported. Viktor Ishayev said that "these actions by the Chinese side are a provocation aimed at infringing the Russian Far East." He related these actions directly to the upcoming visit to the PRC by Russian Federation Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled for the end of this May. Mr. Ishayev expressed the supposition that the actions by Chinese military vessels came as a result of a still unrenounced agreement, little known to the wide public, which was signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh on 14 May 1991. Article 8 of this agreement says, "Chinese vessels of all types, including military, may navigate the Amur freely. The rules of navigation will be elaborated by the competent bodies of the two countries additionally." Because the rules of navigation have not as yet been worked out, military vessels as well as civilian steamships from China will not be allowed into Khabarovsk at the Kazakevich checkpoint. Touching on the evolution of Russian-Chinese relations at the local level, the head of the kray administration believes that "at present China is undertaking latent expansion to the Russian Far East, infringing and humiliating the Russian people." If the treaty signed by the former USSR leaders "is not renounced, the administrations of adjacent Far Eastern krays and oblasts will take their own measures," he said. According to Mr. Ishayev, "the provocation by the military vessels was also a demonstration, timed to coincide with the start of work by a joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission on 6 May." As is known, in the process of border revision between Russia and the PRC the latter has acquired more than 2,000 islands with more than 1,000 hectares of arable land. The stumbling block in the commission's work is the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy island with an area of 350 sq km, located close to Khabarovsk. On its maps published in China the southern neighbor stubbornly marks this fertile island as Chinese territory and has an eye to seizing it from Russia. According to Viktor Ishayev, however, "the residents of Khabarovsk Kray intend to maintain their island by any methods."
