The metropolitan daily EXPRESO published the results of the opinion poll conducted by Datum, a private company. The poll shows that in the event of runoff elections, and should Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar run for president, Fujimori would get 43.8 percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar would get 42.8 percent. Datum feels that "technically" these figures should be considered a "tie." The opinion poll shows that during the first electoral round neither candidate would obtain 50 percent plus one vote. The current president would get 39.9 percent and the former UN secretary general would get 32.2 percent. Peruvian presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for April 1995.
