Tan Dongsheng, director of the Mobilization Department of the General Staff Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] told reporters that, since the current military service law, which was approved by the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress [NPC] was promulgated on 31 May 1984, servicemen and people across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, have worked diligently to enforce the law and have achieved noticeable results. -- A good trend has been formed in which everyone has shown concern for and supported national defense work. The state has listed the study of the military service law as an important part of the efforts to popularize legal knowledge. All localities -- in light of their local realities, especially their annual conscription work -- have regularly publicized the law and applied themselves to enforcing it, enabling the masses to be more national defense-minded. Party committees and governments at all levels and all social sectors have endeavored to do a good job related to military service and militia and reserve service, and a good job in giving special care to and making job placement for disabled servicemen and to family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Moreover, many provinces and cities have established and promulgated relevant regional laws and regulations. -- The vast numbers of military service-age youths have enthusiastically enlisted themselves for military service, providing large numbers of high-quality soldiers to the troops. During each year's conscription season, people in both urban and rural areas across the country scrambled to enlist themselves for military service. The number of newly enlisted young people with college or special secondary school educational level has been on the increase year by year. -- The large numbers of militiamen and reserve service personnel have actively participated in military training and endeavored to perform their duty to stay combat-ready, making themselves the PLA's right hand and a powerful reserve force. They have played an important role in building bridges, constructing roads, developing mines, harnessing rivers, building water conservancy projects, reclaiming lands for farming use, afforesting lands, taking the lead in studying and applying sciences, tackling key quality problems, and helping the poor to improve their lot. -- Work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs has been strengthened and has developed in the new situation. "Regarding the troops as the great wall and servicemen as one's family members" has been truly practiced among the people. In particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping wrote the inscription for the "Model Double-Support City" in early 1991, the country's double-support work has been raised to a new level and large numbers of model double-support cities (counties) and advanced double-support individuals have emerged. -- Importance has been attached to giving preferential treatment to active duty servicemen and to job placement for demobilized and retired servicemen. The State Council has held annual meetings on job placement services for demobilized military cadres and party committees, and governments at all levels have regarded the work as a political task, enabling demobilized military cadres to be properly resettled. The "Regulations on Resettling Retired Compulsory Servicemen" -- promulgated in 1987 by the State Council -- have assured employment for compulsory servicemen retiring from active duty. Governments at all levels have given various preferential treatments to active duty servicemen and their families, and this has played an important role in raising the servicemen's social status and in helping them perform their military duty free without worries. -- Military training for college and secondary school students has been widely conducted. As demanded by the military service law and the "Outline for China's Educational Reform and Development," which was jointly issued by the party Central Committee and the State Council, as of this date, 1.04 million college students and 620,000 secondary school students have received military training.
