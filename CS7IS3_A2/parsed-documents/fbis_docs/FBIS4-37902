FBIS4-37902 "drnes123_c_94004" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 Egypt Mubarak Addresses University Youth Camp Mubarak Addresses University Youth Camp NC2506192394 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1700 GMT 25 Jun 94 NC2506192394 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has once again urged the Yemeni president to stop the fighting and pull back troops to allow dialogue to take its course. President Mubarak said: On our part, we are fully prepared to mediate to bring viewpoints closer to each other. He warned that the end will be bad, saying: I have warned that if fighting breaks out in Yemen, it will continue for years and the potentials and resources of the state will be consumed. The resources of the country will be squandered on procuring weapons for war and destruction, instead of being devoted to providing the basic minimum for a decent life for the Yemeni people. This speech came in a meeting President Husni Mubarak held at noon today with university youths attending the annual Hulwan summer camp. Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that President Mubarak was keen on starting a dialogue with his sons, the university youths. He was also eager to inform the youths of the various dimensions and aspects of issues of national interest to Egypt, be they internal or external matters. Mubarak was asked about the crisis in Yemen, which is ongoing despite the advice given to the Yemeni brothers to stop the bloodshed and fighting and to learn about the dimensions of the crisis, particularly since Yemen seems to be following in the footsteps of Iraq. Mubarak answered: During the Gulf crisis, I advised Iraqi President Saddam Husayn through scores of letters. I did so separate from any personal feelings and with great honesty so that we can avert any results from dangerous problems, as well as avoid inter-Arab differences. President Mubarak added: In the Yemeni crisis, I have repeatedly advised from the outset to stop the fighting. But there was no commitment. He noted that there is a difference between what happened in the Gulf and what is happening in the Yemeni crisis. President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt is not opposed to Yemen's unity. But, as a general principle, we do not believe that unity can be imposed through military force, because it then becomes occupation. We also believe that unity has to be established through agreement and consent and has to be requested by the people. The president clarified that if this process of unity is not accurately worked out, it will backfire and the effects will be extremely negative. The information minister said in his statement that President Mubarak explained the various viewpoints of the brothers in Yemen, both in the north and the south. He clarified the differences that caused the crisis. President Mubarak also explained that he cautioned against the crisis before it even started through meetings with the Yemeni leaders and during Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to Egypt. He affirmed to the Yemeni leaders the importance of containing the situation and not turning to weapons. But the crisis worsened and the fighting continued. He said it is an accursed war; blood is being shed and the infrastructure is collapsing. President Mubarak renewed his call to the Yemeni president on the need to stop the fighting and pull back forces in order to let dialogue take its course. President Mubarak said: I have begged the Yemeni parties to stop the fighting--and I hope they listen to me because I have no objective but to establish stability in Yemen, which is a fraternal Arab Islamic country. I tell all the parties: Enough of the collapse that has taken place. He added that the Yemeni people are in the custody of their leaders and the leaders have to look after this charge. We will continue, together with all our brethren, to exert every effort for the sake of the Yemeni people and their stability. Answering a question on his views on the national dialogue, its effects, and the extent of its continuation, President Mubarak said: The objective of the national dialogue is for all sections of the society and the legal forces to participate in it. The dialogue should not be restricted to the political parties alone. He added: Therefore, the National Dialogue Preparatory Committee, as well as the General Congress, consists of representatives from over 20 institutions including associations, unions, and universities; intellectuals, artists, literates, journalists, and experts in various fields are also taking part. They represent the cream of society participating in this Congress, particularly since the world around us is changing and challenges are imposing themselves on various local, regional, and international levels. President Mubarak pointed out that there are radical economic changes taking place. He said: This prompted me to call for a dialogue so that all the Egyptians can participate in discussing their issues, setting priorities regarding national action, and polishing their ideas on how to develop the Egyptian march economically, politically, socially, and culturally. President Mubarak said that the participants in this dialogue will discuss various issues since they are specialists and experts and the parties most concerned with this issue. They will propose ways to address our problems, because we have major issues to address, such as unemployment, increasing production and exports, dealing with international economic agreements, creating jobs for workers, and enhancing overall and continuous development. He stated that all these issues comprise Egypt's economic and social stability, which is the basis for achieving political progress. President Mubarak said: I wanted to make sure the dialogue would not be confined to political parties alone, but open to all the society's institutions. He noted that the recommendations would receive proper attention and all new ideas would be welcomed as long as they were in line with the people's interests. He underlined that the dialogue would not be confined to a certain issue but would address all issues that concern the public. He stated that he has given the Dialogue Preparatory Committee complete freedom to define priorities. He said that despite our efforts, certain parties are not going to participate in the dialogue. They declined to take part and wanted to put preconditions or impose priorities. Regarding calls from certain parties for setting priorities for discussion during the National Dialogue General Congress, President Mubarak said: Since the president of the republic, who called for the dialogue, did not set any priorities or impose views regarding certain priorities, I expected everyone to let the discussions come up with priorities for the agenda of the dialogue. He stressed that we would hold on to any benefit gained through the national dialogue, because all our efforts are aimed at serving the interests of Egypt and its people--whether through the national dialogue or in all work sectors. He stated that the committees that will stem from the National Dialogue General Congress are expected to complete their work within two weeks and that the National Dialogue General Congress will complete the discussions of the recommendations after these committees end their work. Responding to a question on the security situation and the extent the security forces control the real roots of terrorism, President Mubarak said that all the people have denounced the acts of terror that occurred in Egypt; that Egyptians did not expect any Egyptian to emerge from among them to kill his brothers. He said: Our people cherish their noble feelings, values, and adherence to principles. He said that an intellectual dialogue began with these extremists in 1982. He expressed his regret that these extremists thought the dialogue was a sign of weakness by the state and raised their arms in the face of the people. He said: I maintained my patience for a long time but I shoulder a responsibility toward the people; I have to safeguard their lives, property, security, and stability. He added: When my patience ran out because all peaceful overtures since 1982 were to no avail--I have always respected the law--I decided that the defendants should be referred to investigations and the judiciary. President Mubarak said that those who violate Egypt's security exploit the lengthy legal procedures and commit more acts of violence. They threaten the lives of people, destroy the national economy, and affect the livelihood and job opportunities in the field of tourism and investment, and distort Egypt's image. He said: For this reason it was inevitable that a firm stand must be taken to confront them, and to refer the defendants to the military judiciary so that the trials may be more expeditious within the framework of fully respecting the law and constitution. He stated that the military judiciary is part of the Egyptian judiciary according to the constitution and it fully complies with the law. Trial before the military judiciary does not mean denying any rights of citizens. Mubarak expressed astonishment at the reports that some people in a certain country are discussing conditions in Egypt and debating its stability. He said: I say to those people that Egypt is stable and secure with a civilization going back 5,000 years. He remarked that the world's first administration and government were established in Egypt on the banks of the Nile and that the country is stable now and will remain stable forever. He announced: The sons of Egypt who at first fell victim to terrorism have begun to wake up and return to the right path. He declared that the haters' attempts to undermine Egypt's role will fail. President Mubarak asserted that he is shouldering the responsibility entrusted to him by the nation and that when certain matters reach a certain point and threaten to harm the people, then one cannot remain silent about them. In response to questions about publications spreading rumors or encouraging terrorism, the president advised the young people: Do not listen to rumors. You must learn to distinguish between true and false reports. We have nothing to hide because truth always prevails. Rumors and lies eventually collapse. Concerning Egyptian-Sudanese relations and the recent series of measures adopted by the Sudanese regime, including the closure of [Egyptian] universities and most recently the seizure of Egyptian-owned irrigation installations in Sudan, President Mubarak explained that the relationship with Sudan has a special delicate status and for this reason, he avoids going into the details of any disputes with it. He noted Egyptian support for the Sudanese regime since it came to power despite the subsequent attempts to undermine Egypt's stability--a reference to the Hala'ib dispute. He said that the two countries' ties are historical and more than three million Sudanese citizens live in Egypt as the Egyptians' honored brothers. Recalling what he said during his meeting with the Sudanese leader, he declared that Egypt has not fired a single bullet at a Sudanese citizen and that the reports about Egyptian military concentrations on the border with Sudan are not true. He asked: Why should we mass troops when we know we will not fight our brothers? President Mubarak explained that the Egyptian forces stationed in the Hala'ib area do not exceed 2,000 officers and soldiers and that they do not have heavy weapons as the Sudanese regime used to believe. He said that Egyptian and Sudanese officers and troops on the border between the two countries are friendly with each other and understand each other. Commenting on the Sudanese regime's recent claim that Egypt incited Sudanese al-Ummah Party leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, President Mubarak said Egypt is governed by principle and will not conspire against the existing Sudanese regime or any other regime. He pointed out that Egypt will not incite any Sudanese national against his own country and it has no connection with any claims about al- Ummah leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. President Mubarak affirmed: We do not fight Sudan. We wish to safeguard the Sudanese people. We will not fire a bullet against any Sudanese person. We welcome the Sudanese among us and on our territory. We wish to help Sudan but at the same time we cannot let anyone impose his view on us in matters connected with our sovereignty and stability. Regarding the Middle East peace process, the information minister reported that President Mubarak said that [former] President al-Sadat had a lot of foresight and had it not been for his peace initiative, this region would not have witnessed the current major peace developments. President Mubarak said that the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East conflict and pointed out that after Egypt regained its lost territory, it continued and is continuing now to do its utmost for the sake of peace and the restoration of Arab territories and legitimate Arab rights. The president noted that the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement was the first and most difficult step. He said it gave the Palestinians the opportunity to return to their own land for the first time. He stressed that Egypt assists the Palestinians but does not dictate any options to them. He remarked that Egypt utilizes its international relations for the good of the Palestinian cause and other Arab causes to enable the concerned parties to reach a just and comprehensive solution that will preserve their legitimate rights. He declared that Egypt, as the largest Arab country, is seeking a real, not illusory, peace and that peace strategy must have its own credible components. President Mubarak said the progress on the Palestinian- Israeli track is still difficult and that the forthcoming phases are the most difficult because they will deal with the settlements and with Jerusalem. He added that the Jerusalem question is viewed in a Christian and Islamic framework and that it is not only an Arab or an Islamic issue but has several dimensions. Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak also discussed the developments on the Syrian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks. Replying to a question on the talk about establishing a Middle Eastern market, the president explained that the issue is still in the stage of proposals, interpretations, and analysis and that we should put things in context without oneupmanship. He noted that there are centers for research, analysis, and discussion all of which are good signs but that the issue is still in the form of mere proposals and interpretations. Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak answered a question on the Social Development Fund and its role. The president said that the Fund has played its role according to the resources available and that any obstacles to its performance, such as the interest rate and so forth are being removed. Replying to another question on developments in Rwanda, President Mubarak said it is an African issue and some proposals were discussed at the recent African summit but (?implementing) these proposals would require a huge expense. He added that France has begun to play a role to help achieve peace and that Egypt is helping with observers in the United Nations. President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt does not help one party at the expense of another and is not biased to any side and said: We have suspended an arms accord that was signed before the conflict broke out between the two sides. The president commented on the UN secretary general's role in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and in handling various issues. He said we should not burden the secretary general beyond his capabilities and jurisdictions for he does not issue resolutions but implements the Security Council and UN resolutions and he has no funds or troops at his disposal. Answering a question on economic reform, President Mubarak explained the inevitable situation that required the initiation of the economic reform process and said that a complete collapse would have occurred had there been no economic reform. He added that had economic reform not been initiated, Egypt would have been in a hard situation in which the provision of bread or minimal level of services would have been difficult. He noted that the economy had neared a collapse because of problems that accumulated over successive years and that the international community had stopped dealing with Egypt because its economy could not meet any commitments or repay debts. He added: We needed loans to procure basic commodities to secure living provisions and we also had to establish an infrastructure to attract investment. Replying to another question on wage increases, President Mubarak pointed out that economic issues are interlinked and that revenues are linked with expenditure and wages. He added that any wage increase is linked with a genuine increased production and that printing (?bank notes) means more inflation and more price hikes. Therefore, he said, economic performance must be controlled to maintain an acceptable and reasonable balance between wages and prices. He added: We must bear in mind that Egypt's population has increased by approximately 15 million people during the period of the economic reform plan and that salaries and pensions also increased by various rates over the past five years. He noted that despite all the burdens on the citizen, economic reform made a great progress and that no matter how hard the burden is, it is still better than the collapse that we would have encountered. Asked about the amount of Egypt's debts, President Mubarak pointed out that these debts had reached 45 billion dollars as borrowing had been necessary to rebuild the infrastructure. He added that 50 percent of the debts, an amount equivalent to what has been spent on the infrastructure, has been forgiven. He added: Now that the debts have come within the normal and reasonable limits, we are in a better position and Egypt can fulfill its debt obligations. He noted that the availability of reserves at the Egyptian banks does not mean that this money belongs to the government. These reserves, he adds, belong to the people and are held as deposits with the banks. They provide the Egyptian economy with the necessary liquidity to fulfill its obligations in meeting the basic requirements, he added. He noted that the whole world is facing a wave of similar problems, such as debts, unemployment, rise in commodity prices, and the lack of balance between wages and prices. He added: We must never forget that in the sixties Egypt's population was 16 million and now we are close to 60 million. This means extra burdens to the economy and to the development and service sectors, he noted, adding that we always need the money to be able to carry out development plans and provide a reasonable minimum standard of living. Minister al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak had begun his meeting with the university students with a speech in which he stressed that they represent the hope of the future, adding that the work of the present generation is for the sake of the coming generations. Mubarak was asked about the future of development in Upper Egypt following the establishment of the Southern Valley University, which represents a qualitative cultural leap for Upper Egypt. Mubarak emphasized that the development plan makes no difference between Upper and Lower Egypt. We must encourage the wealthy and the investors from Upper Egypt to establish small or large industrial or agricultural projects there, he added. He noted that if the experiment proves to be successful and if investments increase, we hope there will be no need to obtain an approval from the Investment Authority to establish any project, regardless of its magnitude. He noted that small investors have been encouraged to establish projects in the governorates where they live, adding that attention is given to Upper Egyptian governorates to raise the standards of living there and create jobs in productive projects. This is because the government no longer can hire new employees now that the salaries of the civil servants cost the treasury approximately 16 billion Egyptian pounds per year and the government's resources are limited, he added. Before meeting with the university students, Mubarak met with university presidents and students to listen to a number of suggestions on developing university education and research centers and on the university's role in serving the society. Education Minister Dr. Husayn Kamil Baha'-al-Din spoke during the meeting and noted that President Mubarak, who opened the National Dialogue Congress today, wanted to meet with the university youth to involve them in this dialogue. He noted that the university students are proud of President Mubarak's efforts to develop Egypt and its universities. During the two-hour meeting, the students cheered and applauded President Mubarak several times during his speech. Dr. Baha'-al-Din pointed out that the group of students who met with President Mubarak today comprised approximately 650 students from various Egyptian universities. He added that each group stays at the camp for one week during which the students play sports, receive cultural and religious orientation courses, and meet with a number of officials. He noted that similar camps free of charge exist for university students in Alexandria, the Suez Canal area, Asyut, and al-Minya.
