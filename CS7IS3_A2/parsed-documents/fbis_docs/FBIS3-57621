The Patriot missile was used in the Persian Gulf war and performed well. Station commentator Yuriy Solton writes on this: The Pentagon discussed this matter at the request of the commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, though President Clinton has not approved it yet. Quoting U.S. CIA materials, the Pentagon is planning to deploy Patriot missiles--which is an antimissile system--in South Korea because Pyonayang is capable of attacking U.S. military facilities with [word indistinct] missiles. It is difficult to believe that such an attack is possible. First of all, recently the U.S. CIA said that a North Korean military aggression is almost impossible. Also, according to a report by an independent U.S. [word indistinct], the Nodong-1 missile, which is modeled after a Scud-type missile, does not pose a big threat. Considering these factors, it can be estimated that the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea is made to apply pressure on Pyongyang. It is also estimated that through such a pressure the United States attempts to lead North Korea to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities which have been under the suspicion of developing nuclear weapons. Pyongyang should have cleared such suspicion by returning to the Nonproliferation Treaty. However, the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea will not be conducive to solving the nuclear issue. Rather, it will lead Pyongyang to take countermeasures, thereby further aggravating the situation of the Korean penisula.
