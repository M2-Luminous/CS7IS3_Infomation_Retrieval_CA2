That is according to NOTICIAS which cites a statement issued by the government. NOTICIAS says that is the first government reaction to the recent UN Security Council resolution on the Mozambican peace process. The statement says the apparent delay in the confinement of government troops is not in any way caused by political or logistical reasons. The UN Security Council resolution vigorously urged the government and the Mozambique National Resistance to speed up the confinement of troops, and asked the sides to begin demobilizing their forces.
