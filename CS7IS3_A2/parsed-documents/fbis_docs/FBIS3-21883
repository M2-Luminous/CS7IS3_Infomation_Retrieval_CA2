The cocaine, smuggled in on a boat from Colombia in a banana cargo, was seized overnight Saturday. Police announced its seizure on Monday. The drugs, with a street value of about 300 million dollars, were seized when a truck taking the cargo from the port of Genoa to a warehouse in a village near here was stopped on a road in northern Italy, police said. In order to divert attention, the drugs traffickers had left the cargo in the warehouse for two months from its arrival before moving it, police said. When the cargo was moved, the driver was joined in the cab by his three year old daughter and pet dog in order to allay the police's suspicions, officials said. The seizure, a record amount in Europe, followed months of joint investigation by police in Milan and Genoa, Turin police said. Twelve people were arrested during the operation, including several suspected Mafia members. Only two of the suspects were identified--Adrea Lia, 22, and Maurizio Lo Russo, 28, who had rented the warehouse where the cocaine was to have been delivered. The drug was probably destined for sale outside Italy, in several other European countries. Inquiries are continuing in Switzerland, Germany and Lichtenstein. Police said that the recent increases in frontier controls in areas bordering on the former Yugoslavia had pushed the drugs traffickers to use the Turin region as the major conduit for the drugs trade out of Italy. "If the traffickers chose Turin as the base for the passage of such a quantity of the drug, that means that the mafia has the capacity in place to manage such a volume," a police source said. It shows their heavy implantation into northern Italy, he added.
