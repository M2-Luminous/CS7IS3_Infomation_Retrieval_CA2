While food prices remained virtually unchanged, compared with December 1993, there were marked increases in housing rents, water and sewage rates, the cost of heat, municipal transport fares, and other services. Payments for housing rents and related services rose 30 percent in the course of a single month. This was made possible by the government's decision to partially liberalize regulated prices in this area. A similar situation pertains to the cost of heat and hot water supply, which is almost 16 percent higher than in December 1993. Gasoline prices went up 2 percent, chiefly as a result of a change in the consumer tax rate. These systemic interventions alone led to 0.8-percent price growth. These systemic changes were compounded in January by other extraordinary influences. A number of newspapers and magazines raised their prices, for example. Overall, these onetime changes brought a price growth of over 1 percent. Compared with January 1993, consumer prices are now 10.9 percent higher. The lowest has been the growth in food prices, which went up by less than 5 percent [since January 1993].
