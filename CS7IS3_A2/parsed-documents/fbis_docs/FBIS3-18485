The Commission is optimistic that last year's prolonged conflict over the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU can be avoided. The latest round of talks, which ended in Tokyo at the weekend, had shown for the first time that little divided the forecasts of the two sides, Mr Martin Bangemann, European industry commissioner, said yesterday. The EU expected new vehicle demand in West Europe to remain virtually unchanged at last year's very depressed level, said Mr Bangemann, while the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was forecasting modest growth of up to 3 percent. The EU market for cars and light commercial vehicles fell by 15.9 percent to 11.739 million last year, the steepest decline of the postwar period. In its original estimates last year Tokyo had refused to accept gloomy European forecasts of a steep fall in sales and was then forced to curtail exports drastically last autumn to bring shipments in line with the 1991 EU/Japan accord on Japanese vehicle sales in the Union. Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year by 18.4 percent to 980,000 units. The Commission expects a second round of talks with Tokyo to be held in mid-March. Addressing a European car industry forum organised by the Commission and the European Parliament, Mr Bangemann gave his clear backing yesterday for a continuation of the current controversial "block exemption" for the motor industry, which allows carmakers to use a selective distribution system with exclusive dealers in breach of European competition law. The 10-year block exemption is due to expire in mid-1995, and the Commission is still divided over whether to accept the motor industry's demand for the selective distribution system to continue. Mr Bangemann said that the system played an important role in the monitoring of Japanese vehicle sales in the EU. "On no account should this be endangered," he said. He also dismissed arguments from European consumer organisations that the system was responsible for high car prices in the EU. "I do not believe that getting rid of the selective and exclusive distribution system would lead to more choice and lower prices -- but just the reverse," he said.
