The enlargement has been postponed but a new phase of cooperation starts, a sort of sweetener for the candidates. It is possible that in the future there will be NATO intervention without the Americans. Washington does not want to be involved in some of the complex situations such as Bosnia and leaves the decision to its European NATO friends. Antonio Esteves Martins reports from Brussels. [Martins] By signing the American proposal, Partnership for Peace, today the 16 member states have definitively relaunched NATO into a new area of cooperation and have opened the door for new membership but only in the medium or even long term. This is the price to be paid in order not to irritate Russia's nationalists and to calm the Visegrad Four, the countries applying for immediate membership: Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. [Begin Cavaco recording in progress] ...a door which opens to a future enlargement. I think this will be an important contribution to a greater security in Europe without creating new divisions in Europe.
