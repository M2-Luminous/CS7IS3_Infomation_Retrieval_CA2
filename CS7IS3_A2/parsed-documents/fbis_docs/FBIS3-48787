Seishu Miyazato, Japan Communist Party member of the Prefectural Assembly, also asked Takayama to stop the live-shelling exercises. Yamakawa and his party protested the prefectural government's proceeding with construction work for the P3C communications station. They criticized the prefectural government for this, saying: "We cannot permit the construction of a new military base. Sneaky construction work amounts to a betrayal. I hope you work harder to realize the governor's peace ideals." Protesting the U.S. Forces' live-shelling exercises, Miyazato said: "The prefectural assembly has repeatedly asked that such exercises be stopped. The discontinuation of the exercises is the consensus of the Okinawan people." He asked the prefectural government to take measures concerning this problem. Takayama replied that he plans to petition for stopping the exercises with the U.S. Forces Okinawa, the U.S. Consulate, and the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau shortly.
