Aliyev welcomed his guests and said that he highly appreciates the role of the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation in the effort being made to resolve the Karabakh dispute. He said: The talks have entered a new stage. We have held talks with the leading officials of the CSCE Minsk Group and the representatives of the Russian Federation on the solution to the Karabakh problem. The significance the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation attach to the ending of the Karabakh dispute is in conformity with the laws. However, I am convinced that more work can be done if the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation adopt a common approach on the solution of the problem. We believe that more effective measures have to be taken and an optimal approach has to be adopted for the ending of the dispute. Jan Eliasson stressed: We have reached a formative [preceding word in English] and responsible era in the effort being made to resolve the Karabakh dispute. A new opportunity has been created for the solution of that problem. We are convinced that a cease-fire must be implemented as the first step and then international observers must be sent to the disputed zone. We have agreed on those matters with the Russian leaders in Moscow and the CSCE's leading officials. We have also informed the UN Security Council. A group of international observers is ready to leave for the disputed zone. We need official approval on that matter. A [words indistinct] is being drawn up for the work of the observers. Later, measures will be taken in stages. Vladimir Kazimirov said that he highly regards Jan Eliasson's views. He said: Russia is very interested in the resolution of the dispute and the establishment of peace. The sphere of our [word indistinct] and relations is very wide. The military units must withdraw from the occupied areas and problems related to the exchange of prisoners of war, refugees, and other issues must be resolved after the cease-fire agreement is implemented. President Aliyev said that he is convinced that the initiatives made by the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation will quickly yield results and that the [words indistinct] will be realized. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijan National Assembly; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; and Vefa Gulizade, state adviser on foreign policy, attended the meeting.
