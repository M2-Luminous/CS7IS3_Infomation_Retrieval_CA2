He said the situation in the first brigade of defense of the Ukrainian Navy area (the former 318th Black Sea Fleet division) was calm. "The planned work was supervised by the new commander, Second Rank Captain Marchenko," Voronkov pointed out. The Ukrainian Navy First brigade was set up on 12 April 1994, on the basis of the dismissed 318th Black Sea Fleet division. The Ukrainian military leadership undertook this measure after the division had got involved in the incident with the Cheleken boat which had withdrawn hydro geographical equipment from Odessa without the consent of Ukraine. A total of eighteen servicemen of the division (most of them are officers) refused to swear the oath of allegiance to Ukraine and expressed their desire to serve in the Russian fleet. The Black Sea Fleet command repeatedly stated that it had warned the Ukrainian authorities about the boat leaving Odessa and considered this action as a seizure. Voronkov said former commander of the 318th division, Captain First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and other officers unwilling to swear the oath of allegiance to Ukraine had been transferred to Russia to continue their service. Feoktistov will serve on Novaya Zemlya (Arctic Ocean). The others will continue their service in Novosibirsk.
