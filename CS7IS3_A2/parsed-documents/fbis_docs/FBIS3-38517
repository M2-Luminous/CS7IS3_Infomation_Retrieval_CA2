That person is Environment Minister Valdo Spini, always on the left of the PSI in opposition to Craxi, and who one year ago was defeated in the vote for party secretary by Giorgio Benvenuto. [Credazzi] Why do you want this alliance? Are you afraid of not getting the all-important 4 percent and being left out of things? [Spini] Maybe we will get it, but we could also stick on 3.9 percent. It is certain, however, that not everyone will get through. If we were united, we would be able to win 8 or 9 percent and play a competitive role in opposing a very aggressive center that is fighting its electoral campaign against the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] (or as Berlusconi himself says, the communists). The question is a political one, however -- if there is a solid reference point then the numbers will increase. [Credazzi] Benvenuto and Ruffolo made the same offer to Del Turco. [Spini] I appreciate that very much, as I do any effort that aims to bring the Socialists back together. [Credazzi] So you have sided with Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco? Officially, however, you have been "isolated".... [Spini] In Tuscany I founded Socialist Action, which anticipated the party's decision on the progressive choice. Now Del Turco has invited us to the party's general meeting tomorrow, and I will make the speech outlining our program. In 10 points I will say how we can move Italy from a sort of communistic socialism with a moderate leadership to a liberal socialism with a progressive leadership. [Credazzi] What do you think those socialists such as Piro, Sacconi, Boniver, and Ando who founded the Union for Democracy and Socialism and who are lining up with the moderate pole, will do? [Spini] I can see little room for them because, I repeat, the socialists voters are progressive. However, they asked for it by voting for straightforward one-round voting rather than the two- round system. They, and Martinazzoli with them, thought that the center would be the favorites, but at the last elections we saw Fini and Mussolini in the runoffs. [Credazzi] What do you think of Acquaviva and Covatta lining up with Segni? [Spini] It is an attraction toward the Catholic world they both come from. [Credazzi] They are accompanied by Laura Fincato and Mauro Seppia... [Spini] That is a different matter. They were close to Giuliano Amato and they thought that Amato would make that choice. [Credazzi] Do you think that Craxi will stand? [Spini] I do not think so, but I cannot be sure since I have not seen him for quite a while. [Credazzi] What stance do you take concerning the people under investigation? Mattina maintains that they should not stand... [Spini] I agree. At the end of 1984 I asked for complete transparency in the party and in the electoral campaign, and in my speech on our program my first point will be about "clean politics." I believe that if the institutions want clear standards, the judges should only intervene in pathological cases.
