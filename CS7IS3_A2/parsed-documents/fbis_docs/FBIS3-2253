On top of the 128 office bearers in Hong Kong's district councils, China extended its united front to another 146 prominent community leaders and one legislator. The group will advise Beijing on local district affairs up to 1997. Notwithstanding the 274 community leaders offered the new title, China is prepared to enlarge the team of district affairs advisers in the near future. With the change in sovereignty 3-1/2 years away, China's team of district affairs advisers is comparable to those serving the British Hong Kong administration. One hundred and eight out of 414 district board members were offered the title, including 20 out of 76 municipal councillors. More importantly, 12 of the 19 district board chairmen were appointed. With the two municipal council chairmen and three district board chairmen already Hong Kong affairs advisers, only four district board leaders are left with no Chinese post. But the four remaining district board chairmen are likely to be among the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers to be announced soon. Nearly all district board chairmen have strongly supported China in the Sino-British row over political reform. Also named yesterday were 40 out of the 140 appointed district board members who are set to lose their seats after the board election in September, when appointed seats are to be abolished. Among the 274 appointees, 62 have party affiliations. The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, which is pro- China topped the list with 43 members appointed. Second on the list is the biggest party in the Legislative Council, the Liberal Party, which had seven members named. The party's former executive director Sylvester Tse Tak-kan was also appointed. It is followed by another conservative party, the Liberal Democratic Federation, with six members, including the party's only legislator, Alfred Tso Shiu-wai. Two liberal parties, the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting Point, had four and two members appointed respectively. But liberal flagship United Democrats had no members named. Those without party affiliation came from neighbourhood kaifong associations, pro-China trade unions and local district groups. Two expatriates were appointed -- Urban Councillor Brook Bernacchi and Eastern District Board member Joseph Salaroli. Mr Bernacchi, who came from Britain in 1945, said he believed his experience in the Urban Council would be helpful to a smooth transition. "China is entitled to understand the organisation of Hong Kong at the district boards and the Urban Council," said the most senior Queen's Counsel and veteran leader of one of the oldest political parties in Hong Kong, the Reform Club. Mr Bernacchi, 72, admitted the advisory body was set up partly for the purpose of propaganda. But he said China knew little about the operation of the district boards and the municipal councils. Another appointee, Mr Salaroli, an Italian, said he had accepted the appointment in view of the Sino-British row. Asked if he was happy about the appointment, Mr Salaroli from the Democratic Foundation said: "Why should I be happy... But after all, I was picked from so many people and I am quite proud. [no closing quotation marks as published] As for the appointment of liberals as district affairs advisers, Meeting Point legislator Fred Li Wah-ming said his party respected members' decision to accept the offer. He said he hoped the two advisers from his party would reflect their opinions about district affairs to the Chinese Government. He said China should appoint more people from the liberal camps to think tanks such as the Preliminary Working Committee and the future Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative Region. "I think the Chinese side should at least let Hong Kong people feel that it can tolerate different views to enhance the credibility of their organisations and advisory bodies," he said.
