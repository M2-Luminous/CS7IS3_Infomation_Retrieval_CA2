The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed that "no matter what side had carried out an air raid in Bosnia in violation of respective U.N. Security Council resolutions on the `no-fly' zone, it shall bear all responsibility for that." "According to the available information as of this hour, aviation controlling the `no-fly' zone in the air space of Bosnia-Herzegovina shot down planes-violators this morning, while carrying out bomb strikes near the city of Travinik, that is in the zone of Moslem-Croatian fighting," the spokesman said. He said: "At the same time, there have been statements that these planes could have belonged to Bosnian Serbs, although their military commanders denied such a possibility, work is under way to investigate into the circumstances of the incident." According to an ITAR-TASS news agency report from Belgrade, the Bosnian Serbs army headquarters said its air force planes did not take off from the air base in Banja Luka on Monday [28 February]. It said this could be proved by U.N. observers at the air base, Banja Luka is the only air base of Bosnian Serbs which is now under U.N. control, the ITAR-TASS said. Their planes cannot perform flights without U.N. consent as envisaged by U.N. Security Council resolution on the "no-fly" zone in the former Yugoslav republic adopted about 18 months ago, the news agency added.
