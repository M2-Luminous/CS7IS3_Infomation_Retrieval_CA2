What Will the Civil Code Be Like?"] [Text] Of the draft laws which the Russian Federation president intends to submit to the State Duma as part of his legislative initiative, he is putting the Civil Code to the fore. Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov has reported that the first section of the document, which lawyers are describing as the market economy code, has already been prepared for consideration. Civil law specialists consider this new collection of laws second in importance to the Constitution, since "it is designed to lay the legal foundations for civilized market relations in a country undergoing reform in all spheres of its life." It should replace the virtually obsolete 1964 RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic] Civil Code. The draft is being created by a working group of lawyers set up at the government's behest from the Private Law Center, the Justice Ministry, several institutes, and the Supreme Court of Arbitration. The Court, incidentally, is very interested in the adoption of the code, which will "make it possible to streamline the legal regulation of economic relations that have developed with the transition to the market," Vasiliy Vitryanskiy, a member of the group and deputy chairman of the Court, explained. He stressed that the compilers of the plan are "proceeding on the basis of the constitutional provisions on civil legislation as an area under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation on the unity of the economic area throughout its entire territory, and on the free movement of goods, services, and finances." He called the "recognition and equal protection of private, state, and municipal property, and freedom of economic activity" the most important provision of the document. Particular attention is being devoted to the legal regulation of the creation and activity of economic companies and partnerships, which are becoming the main participants in entrepreneurial activity. A special chapter is devoted to the state's role in civil legal relations. It is envisaged that it will take part in such relations on an equal basis with other parties and is responsible for its commitments. Many of the document's concepts go back to the classic provisions of private law. The draft consistently implements its norms, which are based on "the quality of the sides building the relations, and on their right to independently resolve matters without interference from others, including state organs." By granting citizens an opportunity to exercise their rights as they see fit, the draft obliges them to "act conscientiously, reasonably, and fairly, observing the demands of the law, moral principles, and the rules of business ethics," Vasiliy Vitryanskiy pointed out. There are three sections in the draft of Section One of the code, including a section on the right of ownership. This fundamental document contains 450 articles. It has been discussed by the Russian Federation Government Presidium. A working group with the participation of representatives of the State Committee for the Management of State Property, the Ministry of the Economy, and the banks has also examined proposals from Russian Federation components and several dozen interested institutions. The draft has had expert scrutiny from world-famous civil law scholars in the Netherlands, the FRG, the United States, Italy, and France. Its adoption will "ensure the stability of civil legislation, without which the economy cannot develop normally."
