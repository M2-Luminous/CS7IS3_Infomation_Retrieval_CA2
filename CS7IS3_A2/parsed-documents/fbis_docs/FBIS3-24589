A. Zhuravlev, Dnepropetrovsk Mining Institute, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine; UDC 550.831] [Abstract] This article describes an algorithm to calculate corrections for sea bottom relief. The main problems to be solved in developing this type of algorithm are automating the construction of a digital model of the sea bottom, and simplifying and speeding up calculations of the effects of elementary bodies (approximated by a layer of water). The article presents a new approach to solving these problems. Points at which the depth of the sea is known are arranged in an irregular grid, and depths are calculated in a regular grid within that portion of the survey area. Two interpolation methods are described. The collection method is described. It is used to calculate the gravitational effect of rock beneath the sea. The algorithm has been implemented in the software of an automated system to process on-board gravimagnetic measurements. Product testing is described Results of its use are presented. The algorithm is used to study Bouguer anomalies. Figures 2; references 6 (Russian).
