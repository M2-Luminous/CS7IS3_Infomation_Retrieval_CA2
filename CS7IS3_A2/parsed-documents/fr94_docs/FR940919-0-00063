FR940919-0-00063 FR940919-0-00016 c. Organics_Wastewaters i. The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's Rule The set of wastewater UTS proposed in September 1993 was virtually identical to the F039 wastewater standards promulgated in the Third Third Rule. Applying UTS to F- and K- listed wastes changes organic constituent wastewater standards in a handful of codes (F024, K001, K011/13/14, K015, K040, K038, K036, K037, K060, K099, K103/104, and U051). Commenters raised specific concerns with three of the organic wastewater treatment standards, and EPA is revising the proposed standards for two of the three constituents: the wastewater standard proposed for carbon disulfide will change from 0.014 mg/l to 3.8 mg/l, and the proposed wastewater universal treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane has been withdrawn. Changes to the treatment standards for these two constituents is explained in the following section. The third constituent was acetonitrile. Monsanto, Dupont, Cytec and other acrylonitrile producers, together with the Chemical Manufacturing Association's Acrylonitrile Group, objected to EPA extending the UTS to acrylonitrile production wastes K011, K013 and K014. Their comments stated that the acetonitrile wastewater UTS was unachievably low in acrylonitrile wastes. The Agency is promulgating an acetonitrile UTS of 5.6 based on steam stripping performance data. This level also appears achievable by WAO (wet air oxidation) followed by PACT@ (a combination of powdered activated carbon treatment and activated sludge). ii. Treatment Standard Modification Made in Response to Comments Carbon Disulfide. In response to data submitted by the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's Carbon Disulfide Task Force, EPA is promulgating a treatment standard of 3.8 mg/l based on data submitted by several facilities which generate high concentrations of carbon disulfide in wastewaters. The proposed wastewater treatment standard (0.014 mg/l) was based on one data point for biological treatment. After receiving substantially more treatment data representative of more significant influent concentrations, EPA is promulgating a carbon disulfide wastewater number of 3.8 mg/l, based on the performance of activated sludge at one of the facilities generating carbon disulfide. 1,4-Dioxane. Eastman Chemical reported that serious analytical problems, namely wide variation in detection limits, precluded reliable and accurate quantification of 1,4-dioxane. After reviewing detection limit data, EPA decided to withdraw the wastewater treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane pending technical resolution in a later rule. This decision changes the treatment standard for U108 (1,4-dioxane) wastewaters. Formerly the wastewater treatment standard was 0.12 mg/l; today's rule promulgates a method of treatment as a standard for U108 wastewaters, namely wet air oxidation or chemical oxidation followed by carbon adsorption or incineration.
