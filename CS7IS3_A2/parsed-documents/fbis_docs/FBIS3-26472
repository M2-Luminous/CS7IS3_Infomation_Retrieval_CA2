How to unload the heavy historical burdens from their backs and compete with enterprises in other economic sectors by proceeding from the same starting line, thus creating greater wealth in the rivalry in the market economy, is a pressing question that they must solve as soon as possible. Beyond question, the state-owned enterprises should be credited with their contributions to China's prosperity today and the current solid material foundation for reform and opening. However, with the continuing in-depth development of the economic structural reform and the establishment of the socialist market economy, the state- owned enterprises have been facing more and more difficulties in their operations and the key problem is the slow growth of their economic results. Between 1980 and 1992, the taxable profits made by the state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 110 percent, which was markedly lower than the 314-percent growth rate marked by collective enterprises and the growth rate of enterprises in other categories, whose taxable profits multiplied 33.5 times. Some state-owned enterprises even found it hard to make further development and a large number of state-owned enterprises in some trades incurred business losses to a serious degree. Of course, the difficult conditions in which the state-owned enterprises are now bogged down were caused by the problems of the long-standing monolithic planned economy. It is still undeniable that the heavy historical burden borne by the state-owned enterprises is also a major reason why it is so hard for the huge dragon to soar vigorously. How do we unload the burden? The only option is reform and problems should be solved by both the state and the enterprises themselves. According to expert analysis, the historical burden carried by the state-owned enterprises includes four major parts, namely: The debt burden; insufficient accumulation for paying retirement pensions to old workers; transfers of redundant personnel, their unemployment and reemployment; and the social welfare undertakings run by the enterprises. It is necessary to relieve the state-owned enterprises of their historical burdens and create necessary conditions for the innovation of their management system. This top-priority issue is to rationalize and adjust the asset-liability structure of the enterprises and thus relieve them of their debt burdens in order to enable them to join the fair competition in the market. The current measure for achieving this purpose is to change the loans offered to the enterprises in place of government appropriations into state investments according to certain limits and proportions, thus increasing the state assets in the enterprises. Debts in other forms may also be changed into stock rights in different ways. Efforts should be made to seek some new ways to raise and distribute funds for worker's retirement pensions and other labor insurance compensations through some insurance institutions in society, thus solving the state-owned enterprises' difficulties in paying pensions to retired workers. In the course of auctioning and merging enterprises and transforming the enterprise property rights system, a certain proportion of assets in the state-owned enterprises can be used to keep a social security fund. This method can be used on a trial basis. Thus, the burden on the back of the enterprise can be unloaded and workers can be freed from concern over their livelihood after retirement. Overstaffing is another problem caused by the long-standing planned economic structure in the state-owned enterprises. If this problem is not solved, fair competition on an equal footing among enterprises of all types will become empty talk. In order to resolve this problem, the department concerned has decided that the redundant personnel arising in the course of enterprise reforms should mainly be transferred to the tertiary industry. The government will give certain favorable treatment in the fields of taxation, credit, and real estate. At the same time, some people will be encouraged to seek new jobs in township and town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private enterprises; or will be encouraged to seek new jobs by themselves. In order to change the situation in which state-owned enterprises have to run social welfare undertakings, the state has explicitly decided that nonproductive undertakings will be gradually separated from the enterprises. Over a long period of time, the enterprises have had to run schools for their workers' children and various service undertakings and perform various social welfare functions. Such undertakings should be made independent from the enterprises as soon as possible. Some of them should be taken over by the local governments; some can be run by community organizations; and others can be run by new service enterprises. The huge dragon will eventually soar high. In the coming year, through the reform of their organizational and management structures, they will certainly be able to stand various stern tests in the competition in the market economy.
