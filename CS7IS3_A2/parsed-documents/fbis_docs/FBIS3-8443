[Ciorbea] Unfortunately, we noticed that they showed a tendency to drag things out when it comes to finding solutions to the problems that we are currently facing. Most of the 14 claims formulated by the CNSRL [National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Fratia were on a list that was submitted to the government as early as in May 1993 and those claims can be found again in the protocol concluded on 6 May 1993 between the confederations that started the general strike and the government. Eleven claims were included among the requests expressed by our trade union confederation at the 18 November rally. Immediately after the rally, during the round of negotiations held on 20 November, certain solutions were agreed upon and were to be adopted by the government within two weeks at the latest. This has not happened, so the problem is still topical, but meantime, another three claims have been added to the previous ones. In conclusion, the discussions held recently with the government representatives have remained at a level of information exchanges and the government presented certain intentions and proposals that can be found in the draft activity program of that institution. Looking at things realistically, we believe that by not granting our claims, there was no way for the 28 February strike to be avoided. [Mesenschi] What problems do you currently have to face and how do you believe they can be solved in time? [Ciorbea] The 14 claims can be divided into two main groups. One refers to the acceleration of the reform process, that is, privatization, economic restructuring, ways to halt the subsidizing of those sectors that are working at a loss, and the need to introduce a new fiscal system, etc. The other refers to claims of a social nature, such as the need for the memorandum [with the IMF] to be accompanied by a program of social protection measures, particularly for the most disadvantaged groups of people, that is, the unemployed, the young, and pensioners. Thus, our claims could be solved in a very short time, a minimum salary throughout the economy and a salary-price ratio could be established, and negotiations regarding the amount of money that will be allotted for the budget could start at once. But, first of all, it is necessary that the government and the Ministry of Finance show openness in connection with the draft budget, since both the provisions of Law 13/1991 regarding the collective labor contract as well as Article 15 of the collective labor contract at national level are currently being completely ignored. These laws stipulate that before the endorsement of the law on the budget, the representatives of trade union federations in all budgetary sectors and the representatives of the executive should hold negotiations on how much money will be allotted for the respective areas. We are at the end of February and those discussions have not even started yet, and we were not even given the document that contains the draft budget for 1994. We have never had such a delay in negotiating the collective labor contract at the national level. The position adopted by the employers' association recently was extremely rigid, and even culminated with their representative being absent from the round of negotiations convened at the meeting with Dan Mircea Popescu. Thus, we can see that neither the employers' association nor the government are displaying any real desire to find solutions to the problems that we are currently facing. Another group of claims refer to the need to have urgent programs endorsed immediately or to have them included in the norms, government decisions, or draft laws that have to be submitted to the parliament in urgent procedures. In this category I can mention some measures of social protection, such as establishing tripartite bodies, to ensure professional retraining, and modifying the package of laws that refers to the rights of trade unions and to labor legislation. But mainly they should refer to concrete measures to accelerate the reform process in the economic sector: privatization, restructuring, finding solutions to the economic-financial blockage problems, etc. [Mesenschi] In that respect, how do you view the program of measures and actions drafted by the government to achieve the goals included in the government program for 1994? [Ciorbea] Unfortunately, many provisions in this program can be found only a few years after the time we claimed them. The provisions regarding other claims are stipulated in extremely general terms, without any presentation of measures through which they could be implemented. Solutions to this program will almost totally depend on the implementation of the provisions included in the Memorandum concluded with the IMF. But, as is well known, there are real difficulties in this respect, because certain previous conditions have to be fulfilled and they have not been achieved to this very day. After the Memorandum is approved, there is still the question of the political will of the government to implement the provisions. Therefore, I must repeat our viewpoint that, in order to find solutions to those clauses stipulated in the memorandum, which are so very necessary to achieve macro-economic stability and mainly to obtain foreign financing, it is absolutely necessary to establish a new parliamentary majority. We believe this to be necessary because, in practical terms, we are currently witnessing an obstruction at the parliamentary level. That became even more obvious when the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PRM [Greater Romania Party] broke off relations, something that has become a reality. It is absolutely necessary to draft a new government program that basically should include concrete measures to enable the implementation of those provisions and the achievement of real social protection for the more disadvantaged social strata. Obviously, on the basis of this new parliamentary majority and of the program that I was talking about, a new government should be established. We would like to have a coalition government that should include the main opposition parties as well, because the social and economic crisis that we are currently facing can be solved only if we start solving the political crisis. [Mesenschi] What have you done to achieve that goal? [Ciorbea] We have recently been holding meetings at various levels. On the one hand, we have held discussions with the representatives of the government in an attempt to solve these claims and, on the other hand, we have held talks with our colleagues at the Alfa-Cartel, the leaders of the major opposition parties, and the PDSR leaders. During those discussions we wanted to find out what possibilities there are to establish a coalition government and a parliamentary majority, and to work out a new ruling program. [Mesenschi] How are relations between the CNSRL-Fratia, Alfa- Cartel, and the BNS [National Trade Union Block] in terms of new trade union activities? [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decision made during the latest meeting of the Executive Committee of our confederation, we are cooperating with the Alfa-Cartel with a view to carrying out certain joint activities. We noted with satisfaction the change of date of the general strike announced by the Alfa-Cartel, from 16 February to 28 February, as this has allowed the actions of our confederations to take place simultaneously. Similarly, we have agreed that if the general strike on 28 February does not have the expected effect, in March or April we will organize actions of greater scope such as rallies and a march in Bucharest and other towns. We might also organize a general strike by blocking roads, major arteries, etc. For the time being, we are cooperating with the National Trade Union Block so as to finalize the collective labor contract for this year, a contract that the three confederations CNSRL-Fratia, Cartel- Alfa, and the BNS wish to sign on behalf of the trade unions. We would be pleased if the BNS participated in the organization of other joint activities in the coming period. [Mesenschi] Mr. Ciorbea, please tell us what you think will be the consequences of the establishment of a government that would include the current parliamentary majority? [Ciorbea] We hope that such a government will not be established, because this is one of the goals of the 28 February actions, to prevent such an act. The separation of the PDSR from the PRM represented a positive sign in this respect. We hope that a similar evolution will take place also regarding relations with other extremist, nationalist, and anti-Semitic parties. If, nevertheless, such a government were established, it is certain that the reactions, at least on the international plane, would be extremely unfavorable. There would even be a very big question mark next to the approval of the Memorandum if such a government were established. Similarly, the entire range of Romania's foreign relations and actions aimed at integration into European structures or NATO would be affected by such a decision. Obviously, international reaction would also have consequences for the domestic arena. All these things also concern us, that is, trade unions, because such actions will be reflected directly in the evolution of the Romanian economy and the social and economic crisis in our country. [Mesenschi] How will you hold a dialogue with such a government and how far will you go with your action in March or April? [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decisions passed by the leading bodies of our confederation, we have not had, we do not have, and we will not have any relations with extremist, nationalist, or anti-Semitic parties. Thus, the problem of our relations with such a government would become an extremely serious problem, if we were to accept a dialogue or negotiations with an executive that includes such a formula. Obviously, our actions planned for March or April would be more aggressive if the executive opted for such a formula. I believe that our actions would reach extreme limits. [Mesenschi] What do you mean by reaching extreme limits? [Ciorbea] To stop the establishment of such a government. If, nevertheless, it were to be established, our actions would be directed toward dissolving such a government and replacing it with another one, based on a new parliamentary majority and a new program, which I mentioned before. [Mesenschi] There has been much talk about the possible presence of the CNSRL-Fratia leaders at the helm of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. What should trade union members expect -- and not only they -- from a minister of labor who comes from their ranks? [Ciorbea] No doubt such an act would also have positive aspects, but it would also involve certain risks, both for the respective organization as well as for the person in question. Among the advantages I could mention that the respective leader would take all the necessary measures to establish the legal basis for the tripartite leadership and social partnership, for a new labor legislation, and for new rights for employees in the industrial sectors and union members, which would be in accordance with generally accepted European and international standards. He would consider the trade union a serious partner in the social dialogue and would immediately proceed to the establishment of those triparty bodies, ensuring professional retraining, and establishing a socioeconomic council, etc. Similarly, such a leader would be concerned with ensuring real and adequate social protection mainly for the most disadvantaged strata of the population in this period of transition, using all the available funds in that ministry to maximum effect: the unemployment fund, social security, and important sums that come from the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program or from loans obtained from the World Bank and the IMF. He would do all this to curb as quickly as possible the substantial, even twofold, increase in unemployment that is expected by the end of this year . However, such a government would also take special risks because it is certain that currently or in the near future, of the ministries in our country, the Ministry of Labor will be the one most difficult to manage because it is necessary to ensure social protection while financial resources are limited as we know. [Mesenschi] In your view, is it possible that a political pact, including a social pact as well, will be signed in the current political situation? [Ciorbea] If, by political pact we understand an accord concluded with absolutely all the parliamentary parties, then my answer is negative. I do not believe that there are adequate conditions in this respect and, I repeat it, the break between the PDSR and the PRM emphasizes the impossibility, at least for the time being, of achieving such a pact. On the other hand, it is very possible to conclude a government pact based on a new parliamentary majority that at the same time might include the necessary -- albeit not sufficient -- conditions to begin negotiations regarding the social pact that the country badly needs to overcome this period of crisis.
