The Serbian side is very interested in complete calm in Sarajevo, and I believe that we are well on the way to achieving a cease-fire that would begin tomorrow, providing of course, that the Muslim side accepts it. The Muslim side has one motive for accepting the cease-fire in Sarajevo, and one motive for not accepting the cease-fire. The motive for accepting is that this would free a large part of its forces that they could deploy on the fronts in central Bosnia against the Croats, and on other fronts throughout Bosnia against the Serbs. The motive for not accepting the cease-fire is that Sarajevo would stop being an international media hit, that is, the Muslims would lose a significant trump card, which they use to apply international pressure to the Serbs. However, I hope that reasons for accepting a just and stable cease-fire will prevail.
