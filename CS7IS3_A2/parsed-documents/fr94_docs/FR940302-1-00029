ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This notice proposes to alter the Charlotte, NC, Class B airspace area. This proposal would maintain the upper limit of the Charlotte, Class B airspace area at 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) and redefine several existing subareas to improve air traffic procedures. The primary goal of this Class B airspace area modification is to improve safety while providing the most efficient use of the terminal airspace. This action is intended to improve the flow of traffic and increase safety in the Charlotte/Douglas terminal area. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``Terminal Control Area,'' replacing it with the term ``Class B airspace area.'' DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 2, 1994.
