In this article, we examine the question of whether the integrated election law, the Local Autonomy Law, and the Political Funding Law, created aiming for a new political climate of "clean politics" and "elections that do not take money," can actually recreate Korean political culture, the blueprint presented by political-reform legislation, and concrete problems associated with putting the legislation into action. Will "elections that do not take money" and "clean politics" actually be realized? The three pieces of legislation (Public Election and Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, Political Funding Law, and Local Autonomy Law) passed in the Assembly plenary session have various institutional mechanisms for the realization of clean politics. An integrated election law, the Public Election and Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, in particular has many more new provisions regulating money-corrupted elections than any of the succession of election laws before it. When viewed only as a legal statute, it provides for the realization of elections that do not take money, the foundation of clean politics. First of all, it limits to a great extent various kinds of election expenses. In the case of a National Assembly election, it set a limit of an average of 65 million won [W]. It in fact abolished the salaried-election-campaign-worker system, pointed out as the main culprit behind overheated, corrupt elections, and changed election campaigns to make them volunteer-service oriented. Also, it prohibited party-unity rallies and the street distribution of small-sized, leaflet-type printed material during the campaign period, both of which have caused trouble every election. Instead, the Central Election Management Committee [CEMC] reduced the burden of personnel expenses resulting from distribution by forwarding to each household the small-sized printed material of each candidate. To this was added the strengthening of institutional regulation so that such mechanisms for the minimization of election expenses could be effective. In the past, each candidate reported election expenses to the CEMC as a total amount after an election. In the future, however, receipt and payment of money must be done only through a deposit account and expenses must be recorded in detail as follows and presented to the CEMC: --date and time, --location, --person receiving money, --address, and --resident registration number. It also authorized the publication of election-expense details and the viewing of these by opposing candidates and voters. It made it possible for the CEMC, when there are suspicions of misconduct, to request materials from the appropriate financial institution, despite the financial real-name system emergency order. Additionally, it strengthened penal regulations. For cases in which a fine of W1 million and above or a suspended prison sentence and five years and above is given for election-law violations, a ten-year restriction is placed on the violator's right to hold a public-service leadership position. Also, the range of joint responsibility resulting in election annulment was expanded to include election officials, persons in charge of accounts, spouses, and even direct descendants. Therefore, if exposed in connection with illegal, corrupt election campaigning, not only will a person be driven from public office, but it is as plain as day that he or she will end up ruining his or her self and family. "It is a law strong enough to have the effect of a guillotine on candidates," explains one person associated with the Special Political Committee. The problem, however, is dependent on how reality supports the ideals of this law. The fact is, few people believe past election practices, described as unjust, corrupt, and excessive, will disappear with just a revision of the law. As always, illicit exchanges of gifts and money will not disappear from the election process. Some even foresee that the tricks used will become more sophisticated. Even the lawmakers who passed the politics-related laws confess that it leans too much toward the "idealistic," hinting at the difficulties which lie ahead until the purpose of the legislation is actually fulfilled. There are actually many among lawmakers of the opinion that "It is a fantasy law, made by those bewitched by ideals." That is, it is pointed out, as voter awareness and the mood of society are not changing, it is excessively ambitious to try to realize clean politics by creating laws based on the election laws of the United Kingdom, a politically advanced country. On the premise, "The three main elements of an election are organization, funding, and personality," one ruling-party lawmaker asserted, "It is too much to expect us to carry out an election with organization and funding cut off." In short, for the forces with vested interests, the disposal of this politics-related legislation was definitely unwelcome. However, despite the negative perspective of some, there are many more of the opinion that the "will for clean politics" contained in these election laws should be rated highly and definitely must be realized. It is as plain as day that, if for nothing else than to clear up the public's deep distrust and cynicism toward the political world, politics must be cleaned up and that the first step must be election reform. In this sense, assessing this disposal of politics-related legislation as "the greatest result of the civilian government's reform, a new milestone for the advancement of politics," the ruling party core is praising the integrated election law in the extreme, even using the term "revolution." That is, in spite of the fact that there were also mechanisms for clean elections in the previous succession of election laws, these were not supported by the will of the ruler to put them into action; thus they became dead letters. In consideration for this fact, the election laws passed this time were meant to suggest that the ruler's will and a strong enforcement of the laws will follow. Together with the passage of the election laws, the fact that the local-autonomy elections to take place in the spring of next year are forecast by those in the periphery of politics to be the "slaughterhouse of violators" can be understood as a reading of the inner thoughts of the ruling-party leadership. * Effects of Political Reform Law [Second installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 6 March issue on page 3: By reporter Yi Chae-ho] [Text] In response to a question on 5 March asking about the future influence of the new politics-related legislation on the political domain, Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] Secretary General Mun Chong-su said this instead of answering. "Now we have no choice but to run with our feet. There's nothing else we can do. Even so, at least we are a little better off..." His words, "We are a little better off," seemed to be permeated with the confidence of the old Democratic Party [DP] faction within the ruling party of having long carried out elections from a position of financial and organizational inferiority. Does this then mean that the Democratic Justice Party [DJP] faction has been put at a relative disadvantage? The new politics-related laws have content which will bring change to politics worthy to be called a revolution. They severely restrict money and organizations, and free up speech. With money and organizations restricted, the form of elections cannot help but change. As a result, this can lead to a change of the political class and structure. With the establishment of the new election laws, Mr. Y (41), who has been an aid to members of the National Assembly for over ten years, made up his mind to run for office in the 15th General Election. His constituency is K-ku [as published], with a population of over 80,000. According to the new laws, he must prepare about W600,000 in campaign funds. Money having been his greatest worry, there is now no longer a reason for him to hesitate. An "election that does not take money" offers him an unparalleled opportunity. This is because, first of all, the entrance fee into the political arena for newcomers has dropped. "It is a fact that political newcomers are now in a favorable position for challenging the establishment," said DLP lawmaker Choe Pyong-ryol. Will not the young, conscientious people of local society, who had avoided running because of fear of money and the established organization of the ruling party, think of trying at least once, he asks. If only the laws are enforced, the merit of money and financial power will disappear, he said. DP lawmaker Yi Chol made a similar prediction. "Although, due to the continued existence of government organizations, it cannot be said that the organizational advantages which the ruling party has enjoyed in successive elections have completely disappeared, there will at least be a change in the aspects of elections which had been decided by money," he said. If opportunities are broadened for political newcomers, it could become that much more difficult for those with vested political power to defend their positions. If the utility of money and organization disappears, character, achievements, name recognition, novelty, and morality will become more important variables. The prediction that a change of personnel will be brought about in the political arena due to the new laws is based on this. In its recent selection of chief organizers for 14 problem local party chapters, the DLP excluded "financial power" from its list of qualifications examined for each candidate. Thus, an item has been dropped which until now has been considered important, in examinations for party nomination of parliamentary candidates, by Korea's conservative political parties, regardless of whether they were ruling or opposition parties. Secretary General Mun said, "In the future, there will have to be a revolutionary change in the selection standards of candidates for public office." The DLP plans to first begin putting things in order with 30 weak local chapters and increase this as the election draws near. Since the time they came out last year, some lawmakers within the DLP have taken the new election laws as a sign that personnel changes were going to take place. Change is unavoidable in the opposition parties as well. It is still difficult to determine what changes will come to districts with deep-rooted, "incumbants-first" traditions. However, if "elections that do not take money" are brought about properly, at least the opposition parties will have no justification for selling nominations for candidacy to run for the nationwide constituencies in order to provide for campaign funds. Until now, one of the most important justifications opposition parties have had for selling ahead of time national-constituency seats has been "for the party to provide campaign funds for candidates with no money." "Elections that do not take money" may also bring change to the traditional, factional politics of opposition parties. This is because if a candidate does not receive funding support from a faction boss, the need to form and maintain a servile relationship with the boss will become that much diminished. The probability of a change of personnel through party nominations is predicted to be relatively lower for the opposition parties. "Despite the new laws, a hacking-style change of personnel is unlikely for our party due to involved human relationships unique to an opposition party," said a DP official. However, there are no opposition figures confident the opposition parties can continue to survive merely by maintaining these traditions. Changing people through party nominations is a "top-down change of personnel." Traditionally, the range of these personnel changes has been broad for the ruling party and narrow for the opposition parties. Apparently, the political-reform legislation will be somewhat of a shock to this tradition. However, what is drawing more attention is the "bottom-up change of personnel." If the political-reform legislation brings change even to the political awareness of voters, the "bottom-up change of personnel" will be even more conspicuous. If a political culture is established in which policy and vision have power instead of money and agitation, and voters respond to this or instigate it, as is the aim of the political-reform legislation, then personnel changes in the political arena will come about more rapidly and broadly than is generally anticipated. In an interview with a reporter asking for one thing most needed for political reform, a high-level figure of the ruling party said bluntly, "changing people." It was a pointed reference to the urgent need for a change of personnel. This time, this will of the political world even got the support of institutional reform. The results cannot help but be closely watched. * Parties Face Major Changes [Third installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 8 March issue on page 2: By reporter Chang Pyong-su] [Text] The organization and structure of our country's political parties are huge compared to their normal operations. They have long suffered "chronic obesity." In United States and other politically advanced nations, there are many cases in which local-party-chapter organization is practically non-existent. The few full-time workers of even party headquarters cannot be compared with those in Korea. Why does this strange phenomenon continue to exist in years without elections, with its hundreds of paid party members watching the enormous central party building, even though they have little to do? The Korean thinking that "a political party must have party influence, and for party influence it must have a very strong organization and a large number of personnel," has been pointed out as the main reason for this. Also, because of the climate in which one has to make one's face known around the party to have an advantage in party nominations, political hopefuls have crowded into the periphery of the party. Some even understand the inclusion of these people, not based on any general principle, to have resulted only in the growth of the organization. It is inevitable that the political-reform legislation passed this time operate on this serious illness of our political arena. First of all, in the case of the ruling party, with political funding having been greatly reduced, it has no choice but to greatly cut back personnel costs. With the creation of political funds more difficult due to the implementation of the financial real-name system, apart from organizational downsizing there is no other method available for doing this, it is explained. Last year, the DLP brought in about W36.7 billion: a government subsidy of W8.48 billion, a designated trust fund of W19.9 billion, and party fees and support funding from the Party Supporters Association of W8.2 billion. However, party finances are left in the red when total expenditures are at W40.4 billion: - operational expenses, including personnel expenses, W23.5 billion; - organizational-activity expenses, W8.6 billion; - policy expenses, W7.5 billion; and - publicity expenses, W700 million. Fortunately, the DLP last year sold the plot of its Karak-tong training institute, bringing in over W70 billion. With the interest it was able to make up its deficit. The DLP has about 780 salaried officials: over 300 clerical personnel at the central party headquarters and municipal and provincial branch offices; and 474 secretariat directors and organizational department directors at 237 local party chapters. A characteristic of the party is that, due to the aftereffects of the three-party merger, people from the three factions are "evenly" dispatched to be full-time personnel; hiring is not centered on ability or work. Even apart from causes such as financial pressures, public opinion is growing for the entire political culture to be reformed. The DLP is considering "getting rid of the flab" in party operations from various angles. In the central party, a proposal is being actively considered to leave a few committees, such as organization, policy, and public relations, but reduce the number full-time personnel as much as possible. There are also some who observe that local party chapters will move centered around an operations committee, with one full-time employee, and that the number chief organizers at the tong, t'ong, and pan [t'ong and pan are administrative subdivisions of a tong] level will be cut back on a large scale. In the DP, persons are working who have long stood in the front lines of the struggle against dictatorship, in the "democracy-versus-anti-democracy" political framework of the past, making artificial reduction of the organization unlikely. Because of this, in the Supreme Representatives Council held on 7 March, all that was decided upon was the principle that in the next meeting of the Executive Committee the issue of forming a special committee for organizational strengthening would be discussed and party-organizational-reform proposals would be reviewed. However, a large-scale reorganization of the system is unavoidable in order to cope with the new political environment, according to the analysis of the Party Policy Committee given through this day's policy report. "An improvement of the presently lax party operational structure and a reordering of the central party and local party chapters in keeping with the new law is urgently needed," the Policy Committee pointed out. With 191 full-time personnel at its central-party office, the DP's expenditures totaled over W7.68 billion last year. It brought in a total of over W8.72 billion: a government subsidy of W6.72 billion and party fees of W1.63 billion [as published]. Its settlement of accounts ended in the black purely because of "stingy management," it insists. The DP's policy-promotion expenses for last year were W83.2 million, less than 1 percent of its total expenses. In keeping with the mood that now opposition parties too must seriously pursue policy development, policy-related expenses this year are predicted to increase tremendously so finance management will be as tight as always, says a party source. Saying he thinks policy development to be the only way for the opposition party to survive in keeping with an era demanding new politics, DP Secretary General Kim Tok-kyu stressed that now the opposition party too would make considerable investment in the policy field. There are many voices stating that a new party management is unavoidable for both ruling and opposition parties, and there many of the opinion that ultimately a climate will have to be created in which at election time party representatives directly select candidates for public office, as is the example of advanced countries. It is clear that only this bottom-up political reform is capable of uprooting the wrong practices of central politics. Together with political-reform legislation, ruling and opposition parties are preparing for various future elections and promising to put things in order internally. This beginning will become a yardstick for measuring ahead of time "clean politics" in the 1995 local-government elections and in the 1996 general election. * Reform Law's Flaws Outlined [Fourth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 9 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong Un-taek] [Text] Passed unanimously in the National Assembly on 4 March by both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers, the three politics-related laws are in the spotlight for having prepared a framework for political reform. However, there are also shadows concealed by that light. These shadows are cast by the inability of each of the negotiating parties, the ruling party, the opposition, and the Ministry of Home Affairs, to shake off their own interests. This is also something to watch carefully in the succeeding process of revision by the president, National Assembly regulations, and regional ordinances. In this integrated election law, the ruling and opposition parties charged the Electoral District Demarcation Committee [EDDC] with debating the issue of adjusting electoral districts, which had long been done arbitrarily. This is a step forward. As a result of this, however, the right to adjust the electoral districts of local assemblymen is exercised as always by the National Assembly. This is self-contradictory. This makes possible the observation that, even while it is being claimed that local autonomy is being greatly expanded, the conception remains that local assemblies are agencies subordinate to the National Assembly. The question of how to compose the National Assembly EDDC is not simple either. There is a great probability of conflict arising between the ruling and opposition parties. This is because the local-district-adjustment issue is directly related to the political survival of individual lawmakers. Therefore, both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers hope the EDDC will be composed in a way maximally beneficial to them. There is plenty of room for conflicting interests. The EDDC may present a proposal to reduce local-district representatives to within the quota of 299 members for the National Assembly and increase the ratio of national-constituency representatives. That is how great its power will be. The political trust-fund system continues to exist in the Revised Political Funding Law. This is a product of compromise. Even so, it was decided that the revised law would not make public the list of designated depositors, as is the case with the present law. Although limited to less than W500 million, a designated trust fund is still a large amount of money. Not making the depositors public is inconsistent with the revision's purpose of raising the transparency of political funds. In the Revised Local Autonomy Law, it was decided to give local assemblymen a monthly parliamentary-activities fee. Even so, it did not reduce the number of local assemblymen, which had been greatly increased on the assumption that they would be unpaid, honorary positions. This will put a great burden on local finances. Local assemblymen number some 5,170 persons: wide-area, 866; basic, 4,304. As for monthly pay, in the future its upper limit will be fixed by presidential decree and concrete amounts will be fixed by local councils in ordinances. There will be cases in which assemblymen from local councils with insufficient finances will stubbornly demand salaries as large as those of assemblymen belonging to "rich" local councils. In several places in the political-reform-related legislation is included the proviso, "limited to the first election after this law is put into effect." First is the Public Election Law. If members of the National Assembly or of local assemblies would run for local council chief, they must resign from their present position 90 days before the election. However, there is a proviso that, limited to next year's 27 June election, all they have to do is resign from their present position before the candidate-registration application day. This is the result of pressure by lawmakers desiring to become the local council chiefs, insisting that they must start their campaigns retaining their identities as lawmakers. Therefore, the time of resignation was put off "to give them sufficient time to carefully consider whether they will run for office." Also, the Revised Local Autonomy Law set the status of deputy mayors, county deputy chiefs, and district office deputy directors as local government officials. Even so, it characterizes them as national government officials, but this is limited to the term of the mayors and county chiefs selected next year. This difference in status brings a difference in the one with the power to appoint them. If the deputy chief of a local council is a local government official, then the chief of the local council is the one with the power to appoint him. If he is a national government official, then he is appointed by the central government. Limited to those selected next year, the central government is supposed to appoint deputy mayors, etc. There is a reason for this. It was done out of consideration for Home Affairs bureaucrats who will loose their positions with city-county unification. The local council deputy chief was characterized as a local government official in both the pre-revision law and in the revised law. It was the Ministry of Home Affairs which stubbornly insisted that, limited solely to persons selected next year, this should be made a national government position. Given this attitude of the Ministry of Home Affairs, there is even the possibility the class of the position of local council deputy chief will be adjusted upward to become a national-government position in the future. The classification of national-government positions is supposed to be set by presidential decree. Upward adjustment does not require the deliberation of the National Assembly. That the law allows for there to be two local council deputy chiefs in 15 cities and provinces has potential to be a problem. Which cities and provinces can have two local council deputy chiefs is supposed to be set by presidential decree. The problem is the criterion. For example, if having a population of 2 million is made the standard, will Taejon, Kwangju, and Cheju Province, which are excluded from this, do nothing? Does this then mean it would be okay to have two local council deputy chiefs in each city and province? * Reform Said To Benefit Opposition [Fifth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 10 March issue on page 2: By reporter Kim Chang-hyok] [Text] On 4 March, the day the "Public Election and Election-Irregularities Prevention Bill" passed the National Assembly, ruling-party lawmakers complained about articles 60, 62, and 141 of the bill, which was distributed to their seats, "Now we're completely naked." --Article 60 (Persons Who May Participate in Election Campaigns). As public-campaign organizations established by special laws, full-time workers, temporary workers, and the central chairmen of organizations receiving contributions or aid from the national government or local councils (Living Right Campaign Council, Sae Maul Campaign Council, Korea Freedom Alliance [Hanguk Chayu Chongyonmaeng]) may not participate in election campaigns. --Article 62 (Assignment of Election-Campaign Office Personnel). The number of campaign office workers who may receive compensation and allowances, for the election of members of the National Assembly with local constituencies and for the election of municipal and provincial local council chiefs, is limited to within 1.5 times the number of up, myon, and tong in the counties or municipalities of districts with a campaign office or campaign liaison office. --Article 141 (Limits on Party-Unity Rallies). Beginning 30 days before the day of the commencement of the election-campaign period through election day, political parties may not hold party-unity rallies or party-member workshops in electoral districts in which an election is scheduled or in progress aimed at party members who are district residents, regardless of whether for party-member training, unity, or other purpose. Lawmakers complained because these articles choke the life out of organization and funding, which in the past have been called the "premium" of the ruling party. From the exact opposite standpoint, opposition-party lawmakers shouted with delight. In an informal gathering of DP lawmakers quickly convened on the night of the 4th when the election bill was passed, floor leader Kim Tae-sik declared, "The ruling party, which has depended on funding and organization, in now a Ben Johnson out of drugs." As though many were reminded of the scene of Carl Lewis running past Ben Johnson, all the lawmakers applauded. Bringing up the bill's Article 79, which allows the use of vehicles and loudspeakers, campaigning on roadsides, vacant lots, markets, etc., DP lawmakers exchanged "serious talk in jest," saying that it was now the "Era of the Opposition-Party Premium." Has the ruling-party premium, the hotbed of past illegal and law-evasive elections, actually disappeared to the extent that people would be using the words "opposition-party premium"? Has, therefore, truly equitable competition between ruling and opposition parties been achieved, so that the will of the people is reflected in elections without distortion? The majority of both ruling and opposition parties answer, "Yes, for now." Actually, during the early and middle portions of past election-campaign periods, and at the very last, with on two or three days left before election day, ruling-party lawmakers gave funds to even pan [a subdistrict of a tong] organizers. The pan organizers would then hold guest symposiums, actually party-unity rallies, passing out money to voters. Thus, this was only regulated in a superficial way. The new election laws, however, stop this in a fundamental way. The covert support of government-sponsored organizations can no longer be hoped for either. In the past, even though illegal campaign activities or those evasive of the law were exposed, a candidate could be "safe" by avoiding directly "having blood on his hands." Now, however, with a guilt-by-association system, election-law violations by head election officials, spouses, direct descendants, or persons responsible for campaign-office accounts result in the annulment of a candidate's election. Not only this, but candidates can now object to a prosecutor's wrongful disposal of an action as an election offense and even apply for adjudication. Thus, it is the DP's analysis of the election laws that it is now possible to exclude the arbitrary application of prosecution authority and hold fair elections. The attitudes of ruling-party lawmakers are also changing naturally. "I don't know about other people, but in the 14th General Election, I myself tried very hard to keep the law," said DLP lawmaker Rep. K, confessing, "But at least in political funding, you can't keep the law. I finally ended up using several billion won." Rep. (DLP) Hwang Yun-ki too, who had been a politics-related legislation negotiator, said, "Without the understanding that the party in power, depending on the situation, may become the opposition party, we can now no longer carry out an election." In some corners of the ruling party there is tension, and it is even said, "The real reason President Kim Yong-sam mentions English-style clean elections at every opportunity is to signify that he will arrest and invalidate the election of election-law violators, even if they belong to the ruling party and regardless of their number, as the United Kingdom did during the early period of its election reform." According to the evaluation (Situation Report) of the DP, "The unfair election practices of the past, which saw the ruling party's organization and funding square off against the opposition's wind operations [as published], have for now been changed into a climate in which it is possible for the ruling party and opposition to carry out elections from positions of equality." However, as far as election campaigning goes, it is still too early to state that the ruling party and opposition have achieved a "relationship of complete balance" with the new election laws. For now, it is predicted that we will see pre-election activities by private organizations, such as family associations, hometown-friendship associations, and factional gatherings. If private organizations end up having a decisive influence on elections, it will no doubt be due to the advantageous position of ruling-party candidates, who have strong funding-raising capabilities. "The moment I looked at the election laws, the first thought that came to my mind was that I'm going to have to pay a little more attention to factional gatherings composed of market merchants and to family associations, which have only had a few personnel changes for appearance sake," responded ruling-party lawmaker Han Chae-son. Despite the concerns of some, it is the general consensus that a large framework for equal competition between the ruling and opposition parties was created with the new election laws. Now all that remains is to create a strong will to enforce the law at the government level as well as an intention to keep it in the candidate, and to change the public's perspective so that it views as a "natural spectacle" the "unfamiliar environment" in which a ruling-party candidate does not use money. * Fair Election Culture To Develop [Sixth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 11 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong Un-taek] [Text] With the integrated election laws enacted recently, the tradition of drawing lots to select the order in which speeches are to be given at joint election-speech rallies has become more important. At joint election-speech rallies, the person speaking first is generally at a disadvantage. This is because afterward, one does not have a chance to defend oneself against an attacking opponent. One of the reasons unknown candidate Choe Uk-chol (DP) was able to upset national political giant candidate Kim Myong-yun (DLP) was Choe's luck in drawing lots. Being a compound electoral district, in every one of the four rounds of joint election-speech rallies he got a good draw. Taking the stage after Kim, he monopolized opportunities to criticized Kim's parachute nominations of parliamentary candidates and to refute in detail Kim's campaign promises. Compared to present law, the recently passed Public Election Law reduced the number of joint campaign-speech rallies, in the case of candidates for the National Assembly, from three to two. The hands of candidates drawing lots have come to tremble even more. Over 80 percent of the audiences going to the joint campaign-speech grounds have been people mobilized by candidates to show off their power. These were loudly-cheering units of applauders. They would continuously called out their candidate's name while another candidate was giving a speech and then applauded when their candidate spoke regardless of what was said. However, it is only naturally that these scenes will disappear beginning in the next election because candidates cannot use money, the most effective means for mobilizing people. Now they will have to go around to places where people gather, not gather people together. The new election laws authorized the street campaign speeches of individual candidates without a limit on the number given. Concerned candidate's throats may get sore, the laws put a loudspeaker in their hands. Accordingly, this means that whether or not one is elected may be decided by how one makes use of a loudspeaker. Basic loudspeaker-usage rules (based on a general election) are as follows. First, only one authorized loudspeaker with a CEMC seal of approval may be used. Second, one loudspeaker may be used taking turns with one's spouse. One can now gain an advantage because of one's husband or wife. Third, one may not turn on a loudspeaker while moving in a vehicle. A loudspeaker may only be used in a fixed state. Lastly, there are also usage-time limitations: usage is authorized until 2300. Apart from these usage rules, accountability follows the words going out through the loudspeaker. In a position of attack, the opposition-party candidate is wrong if he thinks he has obtained a weapon by which he can attack the ruling party to his heart's content. Laws against libeling a candidate have been strengthened. If a person uselessly brings up a fact, slandering a candidate or his or her spouse, direct descendants, brothers or sisters, that person is subject to up to three years imprisonment or up to a W5 million fine. Even apart from these matters demanding special attention, thought must be given for cases in which street campaign-speeches degenerate into noise pollution. Even if saying what is right, if everyone chatters away with a loudspeaker, this of itself can stir up antipathy. Although authorized until 2300, care must be taken not to cause "sleep disturbance" in the vicinity of residential areas late at night. Finding people to work for free is one of the keys to the next election. This is because the new election laws reduced the number of salaried election-campaign workers, calling instead for the use of volunteers. Because of this, people who in the past worked in social movements are even predicted to have somewhat of an advantage. This is also the cause of the recent increase in trips by members of the National Assembly to their districts. It is also the answer at which they finally arrived after anguishing over how to gain the hearts of voters, if not with money, organization, or wind tactics. This is because, although it is commonly said that, in the future, victories will have to be had with fresh policies, they think that there is nothing like making one's face known in one's district and scratching where voters itch to gain points. One representative who participated in political-reform negotiations confessed that even while carrying on daily, night-long negotiations, the thought kept occurring to him, "I shouldn't be here doing this." Rather than rewards and recognition for his efforts concerning his participation in an historical work, he is more concerned about reactions that question why he is staying in Seoul and not coming down to his district. There is even concern over adverse effects of the recently-passed Public Election Law: difficulty distinguishing between who is a local assemblyman and who is a member of the National Assembly. * Changes Seen for Voters [Seventh and last installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" appearing in the 13 March issue on page 2: By reporter Han Ki-hung] [Text] "Seoul may be a little better. But the narrowly confined country is different. Most voters are closely connected by school, blood, all kinds of personal ties. When meeting them after a long time, it is not easy to then just go our separate ways. There are many times when they come out expecting food and alcohol. Even if it costs a lot, you have to greet them without disappointing them. If you just leave without doing anything special for them, they'll say you are a rotten person. Apart from the question of success or failure in an election, what politician wants to be called that?" Mr. K is a DP lawmaker originally from a rural area who has been elected three times. Whether at election time or during ordinary times, money is always a concern, but an "election that does not take money" will not be so easy either, he says. So, as he looked at the integrated election law passed in the National Assembly on 4 March, he was actually worried more than anything else, he admitted. With their words, voters condemn corrupt elections. They change, however, when they are the ones concerned. If someone else takes something, it is "corruption"; if I take something, it is "gratitude." They seem to have a duplicitous way of thinking. "Could it be that they're accustomed to the long years of illegal elections? Voters feel no sense of guilt when they are treated to dinners or are even given money envelopes by candidates." Voters' sense of guilt is dull or atrophying, according to the diagnosis of Kap Nak-kyun, president of the Alliance of Korean Women Voters [Hanguk Yosong Yugwonja Yonmaeng]. Thus, to make "elections that do not take money" successful, the work of restoring this atrophied awareness is needed, Kap points out. What do voters have to say? The results of a poll of voters' opinions by the CEMC show a significant trend. An opinion poll was taken immediately after the March 1992 14th General Election. It asked voters who said they had taken money, gifts, or been entertained their reasons for doing so. 36 percent responded that they accepted it, "Because I could not refuse." However, 27.5 percent answered, "Because it is a common occurrence during elections"; 15.2 percent, "I don't really know"; and 9.6 percent, "Because I directly or indirectly demanded it." There are not many instances of voters themselves demanding and receiving money or gifts. However, one thing was clear from this survey: many voters think nothing of accepting money, gifts, or entertainment. A voter-opinion poll was taken in several districts before the April 1993 National Assembly Special Election. The greatest number, 37.8 percent, responded that for clean elections, voters should not vote for candidates committing unlawful acts. However, 87.1 percent of voters said they did not know which candidate better obeyed the election laws. The thought that one should not vote for a candidate who breaks the law easily becomes hollow. Furthermore, 88.9 percent responded that they do not report it even though they witness the illegal election acts of a candidate. The election laws contain statutes punishing voters accepting money and gifts as well as the candidate giving them. However, the CEMC and public prosecutors have concentrated on monitoring the law violations and evasions of political parties and candidates. They were lenient toward voters. Now, however, people are beginning to point out that voters too must work jointly for clean elections, prepared to submit to punishment if they commit illegal acts. The mood of society is gradually increasing that, casting off the passive attitude of merely not accepting money, gifts, or entertainment, voters must display an active, citizen's spirit, monitoring and reporting violations committed by candidates and voters. CEMC Public Relations Management Officer Chong Il-hwan said, "Although reporting by voters is increasing, it needs to become more active." Son Pong-suk, director of the Korean Women's Political Research Center, pledged that citizens organizations, including the Women's Political Research Center, will lead the way in monitoring to ensure the success of "elections that do not take money," the aim of the newly created integrated election law. That voters must demonstrate a spirit of citizenship is not merely for clean elections alone. It is also for putting politics in its rightful place. Members of the National Assembly and local assemblymen must be liberated from having to participate in events for congratulations and condolences -- generally, weddings and funerals -- and local functions in order to be faithful to their work in the legislature. The resolution by the DP's Political Reform Group [Chongchi Kaehyok Moim] (chief executive Im Chae-chong) not to send out money envelopes or floral wreaths is one attempt to move in this direction. This kind of movement must also arise among voters, or at least this kind of determination.
