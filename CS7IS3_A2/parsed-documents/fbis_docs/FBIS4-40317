He underlined the special importance of unity with Russia: "Should we be left without Russia, it would be our ruin. One should be a realist in politics and remember that the wheel of history can only roll forward, not backward." Millions of people see no life without a single union of fraternal peoples. In Belorussia [Belarus] nearly three-quarters of the citizens are for the revival. The most consistent supporters of restoring the Union of SSR on a new, mutually acceptable basis are Belorussian communists. It was they who proposed to hold the next meeting of representatives of the communist parties of the former USSR republics in Viskuli where the shameful Belovezhskaya Forest agreement was adopted.
