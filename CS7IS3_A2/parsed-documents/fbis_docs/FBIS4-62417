During today's session, a number of parliamentarians put forward the issue of stripping the head of state of his special powers relating to reaching a settlement in Abkhazia. However, owing to the absence of the quorum at the evening sitting, the issue was not put to the vote. Since some deputies believed the protocol decision adopted yesterday had no legal power, a proposal was made firstly to hold a vote on stripping the head of state of his powers regarding Abkhazia and then vote for a second time on yesterday's protocol decision. This resulted in heated debate among deputies, which signaled the end of the session.
