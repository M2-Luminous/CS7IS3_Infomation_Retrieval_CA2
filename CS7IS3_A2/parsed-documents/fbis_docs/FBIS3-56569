We did not [words indistinct] down with this government and we do not believe that a new government will work miracles. We came with the belief that destruction must stop in Georgia. Anarchy must stop in Georgia. This terrible process must be stopped and let us all together start construction. If this happens and if these are not our union's empty words, then we will gain a civil [Georgian: mokalakeobrivi] right to be a leading and fundamental force in a democratic Georgian state, in the state of Georgia. I can draw a more dramatic picture [of the situation in Georgia] than the orator who spoke before me. I profoundly respect Batoni Chkheidze, who is one of the greatest patriots of the [Tbilisi] city and, also, an expert in his profession. I can draw an even more terrible picture. I can say how many people are perishing, including how many have starved to death, how many people are being killed, how much violence there is, how many houses are being destroyed, how many streets are full of [uncollected] refuse and so on and so forth. You will then, naturally, ask me what we should do. There are two ways. One way is to lose heart and say that nothing will save this country. I am categorically against this. This is not true. The country can be saved. I have said it before and I am repeating this for a third time. Georgia will be saved. These are not empty words and phrases. The country will be saved, if we do something about it, if we start working, if everybody minds their own business, if professionals do their job, if the government does its job and if citizens and the government struggle together to save the country. I spent a day and a half in Turkey. There was a television report about (?the visit). One cannot report everything. It is impossible to report everything. The television camera fails to catch everything. I decided to refrain from a television interview only to tell you first about my impression. We were received there as worthy representatives of a worthy country. And, not only there [in Turkey]. In every country I have visited--and there will probably be more visits in future because we have no other choice-- we (?were received) as representatives of a democratic country which enjoys full rights and has a future. They are ready to have relations with us. In Turkey, I remembered Ataturk's words. I think that the television carried this. This person who saved Turkey--and you can see his pictures anywhere you go in Turkey--said: we need a strong and good neighbor east of Turkey, and Georgia will be such a neighbor. They are saying this today as well. The current president and prime minister are saying this: we need Georgia as a good neighbor and friend. When I was talking about neighborhood and friendship, [Turkish President Suleyman] Demirel said: I do not agree with you, we are brothers, we want to build fraternal relations with you, with our strong and good neighbor Georgia. They believe in us more than we do in ourselves, more than we believe in our (?abilities). I do not share the terrible pessimism which has hit our society. We are competing with each other in drawing the most terrible picture. This applies to any party. This applies to any parliamentarian. Of course, I do not mean our majority faction here. [Reference to majority faction in the Georgian parliament which supports Shevardnadze]. They all believe that the present government should resign and a new government should come. I assure you that--of course, this is not an ideal authority, nor is the head of state ideal, and (?he) can be blamed for many shortcomings and many disasters--a better government will come tomorrow. Young people spoke who here today, Zurab [apparently, Zurab Zhvania, the secretary-general of the Citizens' Union and the leader of the Green Party] and others, will come to the fore. However, we, representing an older generation, should show and prove that we are able to struggle together with them. We can teach them how to live and struggle. We will struggle until we are alive.
