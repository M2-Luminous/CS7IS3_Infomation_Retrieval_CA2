FR940425-0-00044 FR940425-0-00018 S5.1.2␣ Schoolbuses with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds. Each schoolbus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds that uses CNG as a motor fuel and that is manufactured on or after September 1, 1995 shall meet the requirements of S6.4. S5.2␣ Fuel system pressure drop: barrier crash. (a) For all vehicles, the pressure drop in the high pressure portion of the fuel system, expressed in kiloPascals (kPa), in any fixed or moving barrier crash from vehicle impact through the 60 minute period following cessation of motion shall not exceed: (1) 1062 kPa (154 psi), or (2) 895 (T/V FS ); whichever is higher where T is the average temperature of the test gas in degrees Kelvin, stabilized to ambient temperature before testing, where average temperature (T) is calculated by measuring ambient temperature at the start of the test time and then every 15 minutes until the test time of 60 minutes is completed; the sum of the ambient temperatures is then divided by five to yield the average temperature (T); and where V FS is the internal volume in liters of the fuel container and the fuel lines up to the first pressure regulator. (b) For bi-fuel or dual fuel CNG vehicles, the test requirement in S5.2(a) shall apply to the CNG fuel system, and the test requirement of Standard No. 301 shall apply to the other fuel system, if that standard is applicable. S6.␣ Test requirements: fuel system integrity. Each vehicle with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less shall meet the requirements of any applicable barrier crash test. A particular vehicle need not meet further requirements after having been subjected to a single barrier crash test. S6.1␣ Frontal barrier crash. When the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward at any speed up to and including 30 mph impacts a fixed collision barrier that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, with 50th percentile test dummies as specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating position and at any other position whose protection system is required to be tested by a dummy under the provisions of Standard No. 208, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2. S6.2␣ Rear moving barrier crash. When the vehicle is impacted from the rear by a barrier moving at any speed up to and including 30 mph, with test dummies as specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating position, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2. S6.3␣ Lateral moving barrier crash. When the vehicle is impacted laterally on either side by a barrier moving at any speed up to and including 20 mph with 50th percentile test dummies as specified in part 572 of this chapter at positions required for testing to Standard No. 208, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2. S6.4␣ Moving contoured barrier crash. When the moving contoured barrier assembly traveling longitudinally forward at any speed up to and including 30 mph impacts the test vehicle (schoolbus with a GVWR exceeding 10,000 pounds) at any point and angle, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2. S7.␣ Test conditions. The requirements of S5 and S6 shall be met under the following conditions. Where a range of conditions is specified, the vehicle must be capable of meeting the requirements at all points within the range. S7.1␣ General test conditions. The following conditions apply to all tests. S7.1.1␣Each fuel storage container is filled to 100 percent of service pressure with nitrogen, N 2 . The gas pressure shall stabilize to ambient temperature before testing may be conducted. S7.1.2␣After each fuel storage container is filled as specified in S7.1.1, the fuel system other than each fuel storage container is filled with nitrogen, N 2 , to normal operating pressures. Any shutoff valve at the fuel container is in the open position.
