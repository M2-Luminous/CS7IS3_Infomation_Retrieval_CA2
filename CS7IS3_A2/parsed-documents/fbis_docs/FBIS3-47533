After discussing with Malaysian Ambassador H.E. Deva Mohamed Ridzam cooperation in the aviation sector, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh briefed his guest on some events concerning the security problem in the Kingdom of Cambodia. He said that tranquility is prevailing across the country, except in some remote areas along the northern border where the Khmer Rouge continue to conduct their military activities and cause insecurity among the people. H.E. Deva Mohamed Ridzam said from 1957 until it recovered full independence and peace, Malaysia, like the Kingdom of Cambodia, encountered the same security problem. The Malaysian Government, however, adopted stringent measures against border bandits until the country achieved genuine peace. H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the insecurity problem in the Kingdom of Cambodia is insignificant and that many countries in Asia have also encountered this kind of problem. He said he hoped that this problem would be settled in the near future. Later, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh received Mr. Staffdel Wilson, vice chairman of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Relations Committee. [name and title as heard] H.E. Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, was also present at the audience. H.E. Gen. Tie Banh answered many questions posed by Mr. Wilson, who wanted to become acquainted with the situation in Cambodia. He particularly wanted to know about the outcome of the process of merging the armed forces and about the Khmer Rouge problem. H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, which is the merger of the troops of the three former Cambodian parties, are continuing to carry out their tasks. This constitutes a result that we have received with pride and national reconciliation spirit. Soon, the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] will arrange for some uniforms and settle the remaining problems once and for all. With regard to the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh pointed out that the RGC will allow them to join the government if they correctly implement the three points requested by the government. Mr. Wilson thanked H.E. Gen. Tie Banh for his briefing and expressed his pleasure with the political stability and security in the Kingdom of Cambodia. As for Ambassador Twining, he said that with the consent of the U.S. Congress, the United States will give some materials to the RGC; the latter will then give them to the groups of Khmer Rouge which have returned to the national community and have respected the Kingdom of Cambodia's Constitution. The United States will also help restore some damaged roads. Mr. Twining promised that he would continue to envision and provide aid needed by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
