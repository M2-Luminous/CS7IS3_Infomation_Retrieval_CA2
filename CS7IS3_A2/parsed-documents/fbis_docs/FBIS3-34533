A discussion paper addressed to congressmen said that the U.S. Government will make economic and military assistance conditional to freezing, rolling back, and eventual destruction of the nuclear program. It has been clarified to Pakistan also that freezing the nuclear program will not be enough. The program will have be rolled back if it wants to receive the aid which is now lying in the pipeline. Pakistan should not foster any optimism after the clear indication by the U.S. Administration because the United States is not even satisfied with our present position and it wants a total scrapping of the nuclear program. Given this situation, Pakistan is left with no alternative but to achieve self-sufficiency in arms production and to try to become a self-reliant country to get rid of economic aid and loans. The government should pay immediate attention to making basic changes in the nation's economic structure and policies so that the objective can be achieved. It should give top priority to reliance on domestic resources, checking waste, increasing national production, and especially to developing Pakistan's relations with the economic bloc of Islamic countries. It is encouraging that Pakistani scientists and engineers have begun work on attaining the capability to design and set up nuclear power plants. It will at least help overcome the country's power crisis, thereby accelerating the pace of industrial development. Since India has already become a nuclear power, it will not be affected by the U.S. restrictions. Furthermore, the United States is also giving preferential treatment to India. Pakistan has refused to accept any unilateral U.S. restrictions. After the U.S. Administration's latest decision, Pakistan should now depend on its own resources to meet its defense and economic requirements instead of seeking help from the United States. We can fully overcome this trial if we can master the subject of efficient planning and rely on our own resources. We should never think of renouncing the nuclear technology which we acquired with our own labor, talent, and resources because it is a matter of protecting our sovereignty and independence. Any compromise on it will be tantamount to national suicide.
