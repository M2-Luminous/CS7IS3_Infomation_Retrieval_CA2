As many as 55.6 percent of those surveyed said they supported the government's temporary suspension of cross-strait exchanges in order to pressure Beijing to give satisfactory answers about the deaths, widely believed to be the result of foul play. However, 52.4 percent of the respondents said they opposed an across-the-board suspension of cross-strait exchanges. Meanwhile, 57.6 percent predicted that the government will further restrain cross-strait exchanges if Beijing fails to satisfactorily explain the incident. Among the 105 Taiwan manufacturers who have invested or are preparing to invest in Mainland China, 40 percent agreed that the current restraint of cross-strait ties will have a negative impact on their mainland investments. Some 45.7 percent disagreed. Fifty-eight percent of the 105 investors said they will uphold the government restrictions on cross-strait ties, while 20 percent said they will not hold to the restrictions. Results of the April 11-15 survey were compiled from 252 responses.
