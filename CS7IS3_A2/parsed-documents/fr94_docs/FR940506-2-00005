FR940506-2-00005 FR940506-2-00004 International Trade Administration A-421-805 Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Aramid Fiber Formed of Poly-Phenylene Terephthalamide From the Netherlands AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6,1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Katt or Michael Ready, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.; Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482-0498 or (202) 482-2613, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that imports of aramid fiber formed of poly-phenylene terephthalamide (PPD-T aramid fiber) from the Netherlands are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since our preliminary determination on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 65699, December 16, 1993), the following events have occurred: On December 16, 1993, we received a request from the sole respondent in this investigation, Aramide Maatschappij V.O.F. (Arami) and Akzo Fibers, Inc. (the U.S. selling agent) (collectively Akzo) to postpone the final determination in this investigation until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination. On December 22, 1993, we did so and postponed this final determination until May 2, 1994 (58 FR 69329, December 30, 1993). On February 23, 1994, petitioner (E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company) requested that references to tire cord fabric be deleted from the scope of the investigation. On April 21, 1994, petitioner revised its previous request, asking that tire cord fabric be expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. (See ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this notice, below.) Akzo submitted supplemental responses to sections B (third-country sales), C (United States sales) and D (cost of production/constructed value) of the questionnaire, revisions and corrections to its sales responses, and/or revised computer tapes in December 1993, as well as February, March and April of 1994. We conducted verification of Akzo's sales and cost questionnaire responses in the Netherlands and the United States in February and March of 1994, respectively. Akzo and petitioner submitted case and rebuttal briefs on March 28 and 31, 1994, respectively. At Akzo's request, a public hearing was held on April 1, 1994. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are all forms of poly para-phenylene terephthalamide aramid fiber from the Netherlands. These consist of PPD-T aramid in the form of filament yarn (including single and corded), staple fiber, pulp (wet or dry), spun-laced and spun-based nonwovens, chopped fiber and floc. Tire cord fabric is excluded from the class or kind of merchandise under investigation. PPD-T aramid fiber is classifiable under subheadings 5402.10.3020, 5402.10.3040, 5402.32.3000, 5503.10.0000, 5601.30.0000 and 5902.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Changes to the Scope of the Investigation Prior to our preliminary determination, petitioner requested that we clarify that ``tire cord fabric'' constructed of PPD-T aramid fiber is included within the scope of this investigation. After considering comments from both parties, we preliminarily determined that this product is included within the scope of this investigation (58 FR 65699, December 16, 1993). We also invited comments from interested parties on this issue. Subsequent to the preliminary determination, petitioner requested that tire cord fabric be expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Also, Akzo submitted arguments opposing the inclusion of tire cord fabric. We have therefore excluded tire cord fabric from the class or kind of merchandise covered by this investigation. Petitioner also requested that the term ``nonwovens'', as used in the description of the scope of the investigation, be clarified to include only spun-based and spun-laced nonwovens composed of PPD-T aramid fiber. We have made this clarification.
