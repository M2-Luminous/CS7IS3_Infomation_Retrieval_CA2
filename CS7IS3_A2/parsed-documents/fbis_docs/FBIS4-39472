"If until now the government has succeeded in easing the situation by half-measures, then radical steps are needed now necessitated by the Russian leadership's tougher line for keeping down inflation which puts the question of surviving before enterprises," he said. Shaymiyev added that Tatarstan needed a long-term economic program which would be developed with the participation of foreign experts by this autumn. "While now the government should be allowed to implement its proposals which will give it a possibility to survive," he said. In his opinion, the government should in the first place support the oil-extracting industry as lowering volumes were the main reason for a 30-percent production drop in the republic. Among other top-priority measures to stabilize the economic situation, Shaymiyev indicated regulating the movement of capital, forming independent credit resources, refusing expensive credits of the Central Bank of Russia, promoting the circulation of bills of exchange inside Tatarstan, developing a program to support entrepreneurship and forming the market of real estate. Shayiyev pointed out that the power-sharing treaty between Russia and Tatarstan was instrumental in solving existing differences rather than in completely removing them. During Boris Yeltsin's recent visit to Kazan, the republic had managed to draw Russia in such major federal projects as the renovation of KamAZ, the construction of a car-making plant in Yelabuga and an oil-processing plant in Nizhnekamsk as well as a number of military conversion programs, he said.
