The official, who did not want his identity known, said that tomorrow, or the day after at the most, an announcement would be released on the return of the two sides to the resumption of negotiations in Taba early next week. He added that this round of talks will last four weeks, during which time the two sides will discuss a detailed 100-page agreement prepared by both sides and including all issues mentioned in the Declaration of Principles. The Palestinian official said that Egypt's mediation, as well as direct contacts succeeded in convincing the two sides of the need to return to the negotiations and discuss outstanding issues such as border crossings, the area of Jericho, and other less difficult problems. The official said that the 13 April deadline for completing Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area is a firm date for the Palestinians, adding that the Palestinian side is adhering to it and will even fight to keep it unchanged.
