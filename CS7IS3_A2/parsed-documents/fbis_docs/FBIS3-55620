The first one concerns currency exchange rates. Belarus insists that NBB's bills be exchanged for Russian rubles at the one to one rate. Russia demands that the rate be one Russian ruble to three Belarusian ones. Another controversy is that whereas Belarus demands that Russia's internal prices for energy sources be extended to Belarus, representatives of the Russian Government do not agree with this. The Russian Ministries of Finance and Economy present a particularly uncompromising position. Yet another meeting of Russian and Belarusian Government delegations is to be held in January, at which attempts to solve the problems are to be made. The visit last week to Moscow by a Belarusian delegation resulted, as is known, in signing another declaration on intentions to unify the monetary-credit systems of Belarus and Russia.
