About one million local residents need to be moved out of the area where a reservoir will be built on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang River, according to experts involved in the project. Preparations for the resettlement of local residents in the province started in 1985, and the pace of evacuation was quickened last year. The local government has also paid close attention to the rebuilding of the towns and major enterprises that have to be relocated. The present stage of resettlement has focused on land development. A total of 1,865 hectares of land was used for the resettlement in 1993 and about 2,000 hectares of arid land was turned into irrigated farmland. And now in the province, a range of newly-built cities and towns with good roads, housing, sufficient drinking water and electricity are being built for the resettled to enjoy a better life there.
