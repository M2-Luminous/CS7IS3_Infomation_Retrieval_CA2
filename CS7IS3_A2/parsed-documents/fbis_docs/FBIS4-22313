The election that was held a month ago after the signing of a bilateral treaty had heated up the political passions, primarily in the Tatar national-patriotic movement. The nationalists felt that they had been betrayed once again: what appears to be insulting to them is the very fact that the president and the chairman of the Supreme Council of the "independent state of Tatarstan" will occupy deputy seats in the Upper House of the parliament of a "neighboring state," and they feel that it is doubly offensive that they received their mandates as deputies during the days of the holy month of Ramadan. Local author Zulfat Khakim, in an open letter to President Shaymiyev that was published in SUVERENITET [Sovereignty] newspaper -- which is published by the radical committee of the same name -- wrote, "In the freedom-starved soul of the nation and in the history of our nation, you will be marked by black letters, and your descendants will say your name alongside of the name of Shah Ali (Ed. note: who surrendered Kazan to Ivan the Terrible) and other traitors of the Tatar nation..." An associate of Khakim, Milli Medzhlis Chairman Fauziya Bayramova, in a telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov, chairman of the RF Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission], and signed by representatives of five local nationalist organizations, remarked, "The unconstitutional election... has led to a state of civil war in Tatarstan." At a press conference Ms. Bayramova explained that by civil war she meant first of all the aggravation of the age-old conflict between the nomenklatura and the people: "But nevertheless there will be war. Society has already split up." The nationalists say that, during the preparation and the holding of the election, they recorded numerous instances of violations. In the telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov it is stated that "in the course of the election campaign, the national bloc was completely deprived of the opportunity to carry out agitation; picketers were beaten up in Naberezhnyye Chelny; picketers were chased away in Kazan; rallies, meetings, and the preparation of agitation material were banned... The voters in the cities were threatened with nonpayment of their wages and with layoffs, and those in the villages were threatened with a refusal to be given any help in carrying out the springtime field operations. The most rigid censorship was established in the mass media." The bloc of national movements of the Tatar nation has called upon the international public to investigate the "legality of the scheduling of the election by RF authorities on the territory of Tatarstan, as well as the antidemocratic conditions in which the election was held." All these facts, in the nationalists' opinion, indicate that official Kazan "wants to gain favor with Moscow" as a sign of gratitude for the treaty that was signed in February between Russia and Tataria. In the opinion of Ildus Amirkhanov, president of the All-Tatar Public Center (VTOTs), they also mean that "sovereignty has been trampled upon, and it is necessary to raise the struggle for the independence of Tatarstan, to begin everything from the beginning..." The activization of national-patriotic forces in Tataria is occurring against a background of their unification. The same Ms. Bayramova, who calls herself a "national-democrat," is actively seeking points of contact with the local democrats, after apparently recalling the bygone times when most of the current political leaders existed under the aegis of the one and only opposition organization -- the People's Front of Tatarstan. The split into nationalists and into democrats proper occurred on the basis of the attitude toward the republic's sovereignty. In the opinion of Ms. Bayramova, the unification of all the oppositional forces is necessary so that "the scenario that was tested on 13 March does not get used in the forthcoming election to the People's Assembly of Tatarstan: if we lose this election also, then it will be necessary to say goodbye to democracy." Currently the national-patriots are preparing documents concerning the violations in the course of the election, for the purpose of sending them to the court and to RF Tsentrizbirkom. Also engaged in this activity are the candidates for Moscow Electoral District No. 24 -- Yuriy Voronin, former first deputy chairman of the RF VS [Supreme Soviet], and political expert Vladimir Belyayev: on the basis of documentally confirmed data concerning violations, they consider the election of Oleg Morozov, former assistant first secretary of a CPSU oblast committee, as a deputy to the State Duma as never having occurred. In their opinion, the election in Tataria can be considered to have occurred, but it cannot be recognized as being completed.
