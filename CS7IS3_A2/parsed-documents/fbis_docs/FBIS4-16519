"Most probably it was the first time that the head of the Lithuanian state criticized Russia's policy and leadership," Landsbergis told a news conference Friday. In his words, until now, Lithuania carried out a timeserving policy with respect to Moscow. "I now see that the leadership of the LDLP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party) understands Russia's actual policy," Landsbergis said. The opposition leader said he is not certain that the LDLP has decided to view things realistically, but such indications exist. Landsbergis said a realistic view means "to give up "Moscowcentrism," inherited from Soviet times, when Moscow is understood as the big center where Lithuania's fate is decided. "Possibilities to form not a post-communist-single-party, but a national policy may then appear."
