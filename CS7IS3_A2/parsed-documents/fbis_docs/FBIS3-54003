The report was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's office in response to a PLO request. The PLO had called on the Israeli Government to investigate the assassination of several Palestinian figures. The assassinations are believed to have been carried out as part of a scheme to undermine the peace process. The Mosad report notes that a number of Palestinians living in the occupied territories who are opposed to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement are involved in the assassinations. The mastermind of the deadly scheme, however, is a Jewish group calling itself "David's Sword." The group, led by Jewish clerics loyal to [the slain] Rabbi Meir Kahane, is believed to have massed considerable resources through its links to the U.S. Jewish community. The report says that Mosad agents have arrested most of the group's members. In their apartments the Mosad found details of planned operations, weapons, explosives, two-way radios, and bugging devices. One member, Rabbi Efrayim Tolidano, routinely smuggled weapons from the United States to Israel. He was arrested in Lod [Ben-Gurion] Airport as he arrived from Washington loaded with cash and weapons.
