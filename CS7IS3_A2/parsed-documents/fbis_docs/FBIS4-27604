FBIS4-27604 "dreas106_d_94041" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 South Korea Bank of Korea Reports on Current Deficits Bank of Korea Reports on Current Deficits SK3005093994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0836 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005093994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's current account surplus for 1993 turned into a deficit starting in January and had worsened to 2.8 billion U.S. dollars by April, the Bank of Korea [BOK] said Monday. Although improvement is likely in the latter half of the year, Korea is expected to run a deficit of around 3 billion dollars compared with last year's surplus of 453 million dollars, the central bank forecast. April showed deficits of 178.5 million dollars in the trade and 103.8 million dollars in the invisible trade accounts, with the unrequited transfer surplus stopping at 24.4 million dollars to go 257.9 million dollars in the red on the current account. Though last month's current account deficit was an improvement over the 672.3 million dollars in March, it was far larger than the 41.8 million dollars registered in April last year. Together with deficits of 1.4 billion dollars in January and 427.8 million dollars in February, the total reached 2.76 billion dollars in April compared with 822.6 million dollars a year earlier. Exports grew 10.7 percent in January-April but imports climbed 14.1 percent, resulting in a trade shortfall of 3.01 billion dollars and an invisible trade deficit of 1.23 billion dollars. Imports of capital goods like machinery and electronics rose 21 percent, while those of consumer goods increased 16.2 percent due to a surge in cocoa (up 54 percent), knitwear (up 51.7 percent) beef (up 44.5 percent) and electronic home appliances (up 38.5 percent). Companies importing for reserves due to shaky international raw material prices also fanned the import rise. In the first four months of last year, imports for eventual export rose 9.8 percent while imports for domestic sale dropped 8.6 percent due to recession: The former has inched up just 2.7 percent while imports for home use soared 19.6 percent this year, however, proving that the spending habit is back. A BOK official said the current account deficit is unlikely to grow further as it is gradually decreasing. But imports will probably continue to increase considering that international prices of raw materials, including oil, are on the rise. Without radical export growth, the current account is likely to remain mired in the red. The good news is that the export unit price rose 0.4 percent in January-April while the import unit price dropped 3.6 percent, improving 4.2 percent the net trade terms that divide the former by the latter. Net foreign fund inflow for stock investment dropped to 72 million dollars from 909.9 million dollars a year earlier. The overall balance of payments combining the current and capital accounts thus showed a deficit of 227.7 million dollars for the first time in eight months, since the 136.1 million dollars recorded in August last year. The January-April overall balance of payments totaled 333.9 million dollars, far below the 2.14 billion dollars of the same period last year. Foreign currency holdings reached 21 billion dollars in April, up 260 million dollars from the previous month.
