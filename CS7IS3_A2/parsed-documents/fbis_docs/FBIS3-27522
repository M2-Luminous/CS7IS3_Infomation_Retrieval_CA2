A tense situation that lasted more than 10 days was eventually mitigated, and people might be able to relax a little. Public opinion holds that Russia played an important role in settling the Sarajevo crisis. On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum demanding that the Bosnian Serbs withdraw their heavy weapons from areas around Sarajevo before the deadline; otherwise, NATO would launch air strikes against their positions. After NATO issued the ultimatum, Russia reacted rapidly. Foreign Minister Kozyrev sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, explicitly expressing Russia's opposition to the NATO action. Then, Russia carried out a series of diplomatic activities, and reiterated again and again its position on peacefully settling the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the ambit of the United Nations. On 15 February, Russian President Yeltsin pointed out after meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia must not be excluded from the process of settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 16 February, Russian Vice Foreign Minister Churkin, as the Russian president's special envoy, flew to Belgrade and continued to influence the Serb leaders and conveyed to them President Yeltsin's new proposal on settling the Bosnia crisis. The proposal not only satisfied the requirements of the NATO ultimatum, but also gave a sense of security to the Serbs and was acceptable to them. Russia's mediation broke the impasse between the Serbs and NATO. On 17 February, Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic announced that they had accepted Russia's new proposals on settling the crisis, and had begun to withdraw their heavy weaponry in large quantities from positions around Sarajevo. At the same time, Russia dispatched 400 troops stationed in Croatia to Sarajevo to participate in the peacekeeping mission and to help supervise the Serb withdrawal. On 20 February, President Yeltsin and President Clinton reached an agreement in principle in a telephone conversation, thus avoiding imminent air strikes. Public opinion held that Russia opposed air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and played an active mediating role in the Bosnia conflicts mainly due to the following considerations. First, Russia held that the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina could only be solved by political means, and air strikes would only intensify the military conflict and damage the Bosnian peace process. Second, air strikes would be NATO's first military action outside its defensive sphere since its founding. As the new European pattern has not yet taken form since the end of the Cold War, Russia held that this event would be extremely unfavorable to itself in strategic terms. Third, in history, Russia has had its own interests in the Balkan Peninsula. Russians and the Serbs are both Slavs, and both hold the religious beliefs of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The two nations have traditionally had close ties. If Russia sat idly by and did not care about the Serbs mired in a predicament, its influence in the Balkan Peninsula would be greatly weakened. In the last two years, Russia has always tried to coordinate its position with the Western countries in the course of approaching problems in former Yugoslavia, and has sometimes even made concessions. In May last year, the "Russian program" for settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was turned into a "five-nation program" of Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and Spain through consultations and compromises. This was clear evidence of Russia's position. However, this time, Russia resolutely opposed NATO's planned air strikes. The foreign press held that this reflected Russia's new diplomatic tendency. After NATO set aside its air-strike plan, the Sarajevo crisis has temporarily eased, but the overall situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina remains extremely serious. However, people have noticed that Russia and the United States have been more deeply involved in mediating efforts, and Western European countries such as Britain and France had also adjusted their own policies to various degrees in the hope that Russia and the United States would exert their influence on the Serbs and Muslims. Therefore, it seems that a new ray of hope for the prospect of a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem has appeared in people's minds after the end of the Sarajevo crisis.
