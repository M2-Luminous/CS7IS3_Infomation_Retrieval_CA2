The program aims at linking Japan's system with the national information infrastructure (NII), concept of which is taking roots in the United States with the multimedia age nearing. Five areas including education and research have been chosen, and they will be enabled to tie in directly with the U.S. information infrastructure, by improving on the computer-run information and communications networks. For instance, the program will improve electronic libraries so that people would be able to search for library materials using their personal computers, provide information network systems to research institutes, and turn administrative materials into database systems. The government's overall views on the program will be consolidated by the middle of July. MITI then intends to work on the Finance Ministry to make the program a major part of the public works projects in the next year's budget. The project is also expected to encourage investment from private industry. MITI plans to call a meeting of the Industrial Structure Council (an advisory panel to the MITI minister) on 19 May, and will report on the concept of the "program for a new information system" that can be called Japan's version of the NII. This is the first time that a program for the public sector's information system will be formulated. Last September, the U.S. Government announced the NII concept, which was a revised version of Vice President Gore's "concept for a super highway" -- with the revision made to make the private sector lead the project. MITI's concept follows the U.S. Government's way of thinking. The government, as the major user, will push for a buildup of the information system, and this will hopefully contribute to the recovery of the recession-bound market. The five public-sector areas chosen for the new information system program are -- in addition to education and research organizations -- medical care and welfare, general administration, and libraries. In the area of education, 100 elementary and middle schools will be connected in personal computer networks, and projects to conduct classes with overseas schools will begin. Experiments with the new concept might begin even before the end of this year by using funds from the 1993 supplementary budget.
