The Indian president conveyed to Romania "the fraternal salute of India's Government, Parliament and people." He spoke of freedom and democracy and showed that where there was freedom of thought and expression the most differing views could be set forth, to the benefit of democracy. The visit by the Indian president, who is accompanied by a delegation of ministers and parliamentarians, is the first visit after 1989 by an Asian head of state to Romania. Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman assessed in his welcoming address that India was a potential supporter of the development of Romania's relations with other Asian states. He also hoped Romania would be able to be in turn a European gate for India.
