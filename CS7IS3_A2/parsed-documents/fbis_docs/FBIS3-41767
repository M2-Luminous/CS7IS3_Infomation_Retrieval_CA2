It turned out to be a woman form Taldy-Korgan Oblast. Her husband is from Rostov Oblast. For this reason, in the opinion of physicians, the possibility cannot be ruled out that this terrible disease was brought in from a neighboring foreign country. Murat Saparbek, deputy director general of the republic's Center for AIDS Control, informed us that teams of physicians have been sent to Taldy-Korgan Oblast to carry out preventive measures, since this is already the second case of HIV infection noted in the region. In all, however, we are informed by the newspaper KARAVAN there are 19 registered HIV carriers in Kazakhstan. Three of them are homosexuals and two are preschool children. Nine AIDS patients are foreign students who have been deported from this republic.
