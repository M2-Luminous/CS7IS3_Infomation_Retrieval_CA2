Thus in the first quarter the decline of social production accelerated in the country. The gross domestic product decreased by comparison with the same period of last year by 34 percent and the national income produced was down 36 percent. The volume of production as compared with the first quarter of last year dipped by 38 percent while labor productivity went down by 32 percent. Production cutbacks took place at up to three-fourths of the industrial enterprises. The drop in production affected the absolute majority of basic types of production both in industry and agriculture. In the first quarter of 1994 collective and interfarm agricultural enterprises and sovkhozes produced almost a third less meat in live weight than in the corresponding period of last year, 21 percent fewer eggs, and the milk yield was almost at the level of last year. Cattle and poultry breeding decreased by 11 percent. The building of production facilities declined. There was a slowing down in the rates of construction of projects in the social sphere and some 46 percent less housing was made available than in the same period of last year. The operation of transport deteriorated further as a result of the decrease in production, the break in economic ties, nonfulfillment of contractual obligation, and the shortage of fuel: the dispatch of freight by rail was down 25 percent. The greatest drop in shipments (more than twofold) was noted in motor transport. The rate of decrease in passenger transportation on the whole amounted to 18 percent. The report of the Ministry of Statistics stresses that the further growth of processes involving lack of balance in state finances is also one of the manifestation of the crisis situation in the economy of Ukraine. The state budget of Ukraine involves a deficit of 8.6 trillion karbovantsy. The budgets of the Republic of Crimea and of the oblasts and cities of Kiev and Sevastopol were prepared with an insignificant excess of revenues over expenditures. Currency emission in the first quarter of this year came to 10.8 trillion karbovantsy and increased by comparison with the same period of last year by a factor of more than 36. At the same time a monthly decrease in inflation was observed in the first quarter of 1994. In January its index amounted to 119.2 percent, in February to 112.6 percent, and in March to 105.7 percent. During the quarter consumer prices rose overall by a factor of 1.4 as compared with a factor of 2.7 during the same period last year. It should be noted that in the first quarter of 1994 the rate of price increases for nonfood consumer items and paid services for the population outstripped those for food products by a factor of two. A decrease in prices took place for certain groups of foodstuffs, such as meat products, butter, eggs, and citrus fruit. Products in mainly the fruit and vegetable group (except citrus fruit) became more expensive. Parenthetically it is necessary to note here that both domestic and foreign expert economists explain the paradox of a decrease in inflation rates by the fact that wages are not paid the population for months at many enterprises, which further aggravates the already extremely low purchasing power of the citizens of Ukraine. Among essential nonfood consumer items the prices for children's clothing, children's shoes, books, and newspapers, office supplies, and pharmaceutical products increased the most. The cost of public transportation, leisure and cultural services as well as barbering services rose the most among paid services for population. The situation with production of consumer goods remains difficult. Thirty-nine percent less was produced in the first quarter than in the first quarter of 1993. Almost three-fourths of the enterprises cut back their output and by comparison with the first quarter of last year the shortfall in consumer goods amounted to 38 trillion karbovantsy. Over 45 percent of that sum is accounted for by products of enterprises of the State Committee on the Food and Processing Industry and the Ministry of Agricultural Production, and almost 20 percent by those of the State Committee for the Light and Textile Industry. The number of those employed in all spheres of economic activity in the first quarter remained virtually unchanged and amounted to almost 24 million persons (without those engaged in study while on leave from production, military personnel, and those in housekeeping). By the beginning of January the unemployment level in Ukraine as a whole was 0.29 percent of the able-bodied population. Again, let us note parenthetically that what is desired is being depicted as reality inasmuch as that figure certainly does not reflect the massive hidden unemployment that exists today at hundreds of enterprises in the country. The Ministry of Statistics notes that the crime rate continues to rise. The number of crimes recorded by organs of internal affairs exceeded the level reached in the same period of 1993 by 16 percent. Over two-thirds of all recorded crimes were against property: theft of state and collective property and crimes against private property of citizens. There was an increase in illegal foreign currency operations. Some 1,030 cases of illegal trade activity were revealed exceeding the amount in the first quarter of 1993 by a factor of 3.3. The population of Ukraine on 1 April 1994 was 52.1 million. In the first quarter the number of deaths exceeded births by 75,000.
