The just closed provincial rural work conference has defined the objectives and principles for the rural work in the next year and adopted measures to energetically develop agriculture. Then, what is the major problem of agriculture? Although there are a multitude of problems in agriculture, the core of them at present can be summarized as that peasants' enthusiasm in production has been dampened and thus has declined. Since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, the party's various policies toward rural areas have aroused the enthusiasm of peasants. The reason these policies have been well received by peasants is that they have represented and safeguarded the interests of the vast number of peasants. Since the beginning of this year, however, some problems of the rural work have emerged regarding the important issue of protecting the interests of peasants. The price difference between industrial and agricultural products have been widened, the comparative efficiency of agriculture has declined, and the income of peasants has increased slowly, thus leading to a decline in the enthusiasm of peasants in growing grain. Since the beginning of this winter, a few localities in the province have again witnessed the phenomena of indiscriminately raising funds and collecting financial levies, some other localities have even tried to find excuses to withdraw the contracted fields from peasants upon which they rely for existence. Thus, peasants say that the benefits given them at the beginning of the year according to the policy of reducing peasants' burdens are now being withdrawn gradually. Why does the phenomenon of infringing upon the interests of peasants emerge? There are two reasons. First, some leading comrades have only caught sight of the achievements in the rural reform, but have not discovered in a timely manner the new contradictions and new problems cropping up in the rural areas when rural areas begin embarking in the market economy and have not set forth in a timely manner the measures coordinated with the deepening of rural reform. Second, we have overestimated the degree of prosperity of peasants since the commencement of rural reform and overestimated peasants' capacity to adapt themselves to rural reform. In fact, although the province has reaped bumper harvest in agriculture for four years running, only a small number of peasants have truly become relatively well-off or rich, and most peasants just have enough to eat and wear. In the three state-level poverty-stricken counties and the 13 provincial-level poverty-stricken counties, considerably more people are still struggling against hunger and cold. Under such a situation, all fields ought to yield even more support to peasants to let them rest and build up strength and then continue to develop production in order to thoroughly extricate them from poverty. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, stressed again and again at the just closed provincial rural work conference that all localities should consider the interests of both the state and the peasants when drawing up and implementing agricultural policies and should formulate some policies that are in agreement with the interests of peasants. This is a key step to protect peasants' interests. In doing the practical work at present, we should pay attention to the following three things: The policy of reducing peasants' burdens cannot be wavered; IOU slips cannot be given when procuring agricultural and sideline products from peasants; and the advantages given to peasants according to the contracts signed between the state and peasants must be honored and no cases of cheating and pocketing the interests of peasants are allowed. As long as we no longer make peasants the first target of attack in the course of deepening rural reform and actually protect the interests of peasants, it is possible for us to push agriculture into a new stage.
