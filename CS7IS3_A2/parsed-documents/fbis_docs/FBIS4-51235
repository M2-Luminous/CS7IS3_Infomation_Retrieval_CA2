This is his ninth trip to London in the two years since he took office in Hong Kong in July 1992; on average, once every three months or so. There has been much talk about Chris Patten's frequent return to Britain recently in the British media. For example, Chris Patten's frequent return to Britain reflects "his obvious restlessness with his office as Hong Kong governor," he "still cannot forget about the British political arena," "his strong love for Westminster (the British Parliament) has not faded," "he no longer brags about having no intention to return to the British political arena," "he is picking up the topic that under whatever circumstances it is impossible for him to return to the British political arena," and "loves to talk about British politics and how to govern the country with British reporters." As usual, Chris Patten has denied these rumors about himself. Some political analysts in London also believe that there is little chance of Chris Patten returning to the British political arena at the present stage, because "he really cannot find any way which is honorable and helpful to return to the British political arena." Then, how should we account for his frequent trips to Britain? Is it really true that "he has nothing else to do in Hong Kong," and is thus returning to Britain "to enjoy a leisurely and carefree excursion," as some British media have put it? That obviously does not conform to Chris Patten's inclination, which is unwilling to be lonely. People notice that Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July 1992 to take office, but by mid-September, he had already taken his first trip back to London for consultations; on his return he delivered his government address on 6 October, in which he presented a constitutional reform package for Hong Kong, which consequentially sparked Sino-British polemics. In its wake, every time Chris Patten returns to Britain, there is some new action upon his return to Hong Kong. For example, the gazettal of his constitutional reform package, the termination of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for Hong Kong 1994/1995 elections, the tabling of his constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council...and so forth, and every action has caused shock and has added a great obstacle to a stable transition for Hong Kong. Chris Patten's last trip to London was on 30 March this year. Shortly after his return to Hong Kong, the British Parliament's Select Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report on Sino-British relations, which "proposes" that the British Hong Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and an "organization to supervise human rights" which would continue after 1997, and the British Government and the UN Human Rights Commission would "jointly supervise the conditions and development of human rights in Hong Kong after 1997." Indeed, there may be some truth in Chris Patten planning to sound out political conditions in Britain in an attempt to find a way to promote himself during his current trip to London as is being speculated, but the focus of his activities is likely to be on consulting officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the issue of "setting up a human rights commission in Hong Kong." Noteworthy is the fact that a high-ranking Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs indicated that, just like "a drinker's heart is not in the cup," the person who made the proposal to set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong aims to jeopardize the power framework established in the Basic Law, and the proposal "will consequently form `a weird embryo'." Under such circumstances, people wish that Chris Patten would really confine himself to "enjoying an increasingly leisurely and carefree excursion with each passing day." However, experience tells us that a storm is likely to be conjured up in London, which will eventually attack Hong Kong again.
