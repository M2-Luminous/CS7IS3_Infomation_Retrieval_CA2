Calculate the total per-cycle energy consumption, E TE , expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as: E TE =(0.72×E max )+(0.28×E min ) where: E max , E min =as defined in section 4.1 (v) In CFR §430.22, paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B), change the following: From: ``*␣*␣*according to 4.6 of Appendix (j)*␣*␣*'' To: ``*␣*␣*according to 4.2 of Appendix (j)*␣*␣*'' (vi) §430.22 of the CFR, paragraph (j)(2), shall be deleted and replaced with the following: (J) (2) The energy factor for water-heating clothes washers shall be the quotient of the cubic foot capacity of the clothes container as determined in 3.1 of appendix J to this subpart divided by the clothes washer energy consumption per cycle expressed as the total per-cycle machine electrical energy consumption as determined in 4.2 of Appendix J to this subpart. The resulting shall be rounded off to the nearest 0.01 cubic foot per kilowatt-hour. (3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures appropriate to New Harmony's series 1 and 2 clothes washers. (4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the Petition is incorrect. (5) This Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted to New Harmony on June 15, 1993 (58 FR 33089). Issued in Washington, DC March 24, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7877 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
