According to Yakovlev, he was informed about the new appointment on January 24 by the president's chief of staff Sergey Filatov, who met Yakovlev earlier and informed him of his new duties. Yakovlev was born in 1927 in Leningrad. He worked for institutes of law (of the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the USSR Justice Ministry). Since 1975 he has been working for the Institute of State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has said that performing the duties of the Russian president's representative in the Federal Assembly, he intends to continue his membership in the Learned Council of the Institute and use the potential of this institution for developing draft laws. Yakovlev has parliamentary experience because he was deputy to the Soviet Supreme Soviet. As it has become known to Interfax, he was a co-author of the provision "On the President's Representative in the Federal Assembly." Yeltsin signed the decree on introducing the post to help provide the interaction between the president and the Federal Assembly on January 18.
