Participants in the meeting are expected to make arrangements for implementing the guidelines set out at the national education work conference and for further strengthening the education inspection work. The two basic tasks are basically popularizing nine-year compulsory education and basically eliminating illiteracy among the younger generation and people in the prime of their lives by the end of this century. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice premier, met with 58 state education inspectors prior to the meeting. He said that the national education work conference had set out the tasks of accelerating the pace of education reform and development, had decided on the major goals of various types of education, and had clearly set out the tasks of basically popularizing nine-year compulsory education and of basically eliminating illiteracy among the youth and middle-aged people by the end of this century. The basic popularization of the nine-year compulsory education and the basic elimination of illiteracy are fundamentally in accord with the demands for raising the overall quality of the Chinese people and are the most important tasks for developing China's education for a certain period in the future. The key to meeting the demands is to forcefully implement the guidelines set out at the national education work conference. The current education inspection work conference is the first of such practical moves to implement the guidelines set out at the national education work conference. He pointed out that education inspection work is the forceful guarantee to realize the goals of the "two basic tasks." Therefore, all levels of party committees and governments must attach great importance to and enhance this work. Realizing the goals of the "two basic tasks" is the responsibility of the government. All levels of governments should strive to fulfill this task during their terms. Work on fulfilling the two basic tasks should be made the chief criterion for evaluating administrative and personal performance. Li Lanqing expressed the hope that all levels of education inspectors would work hard, give full play to the role of education inspectors, and contribute to the revitalization of China's education. China has set up a complete education inspection system and has established the State Education Commission Inspection Group and provincial, prefectural (city), and county-level education inspection organs since the restoration of the education inspection system in 1986. The inspectors supervise the enforcement of the Education Law. They carry out supervision and inspections, and they provide evaluations of and guidance to subordinate governments' education work, education administrative departments, and schools' work. The scope of the education inspection work at the present stage mainly involves the inspection of secondary school education and below, as well as the supervision of other relevant work. They mainly concentrate their work on compulsory equation and on the elimination of illiteracy.
