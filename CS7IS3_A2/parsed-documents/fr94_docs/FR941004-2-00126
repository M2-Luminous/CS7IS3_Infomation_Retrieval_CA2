FR941004-2-00126 FR941004-2-00073 In her supplemental opinion issued on May 12, 1994, the administrative law judge found that there was nothing on the record from the 1992 hearing or upon remand tending to prove or disprove the allegations of the August 13, 1993 indictment or the January 26, 1994 superseding indictment. The Deputy Administrator adopts this finding of the administrative law judge. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has not considered any of the matters offered on remand and, in this decision, will refer solely to matters on the record from the 1992 hearing. The administrative law judge found that Respondent is a pharmaceutical manufacturer founded by Baldev Raj Bhutani, Ph.D., in 1982. Respondent was registered as a manufacturer of controlled substances by DEA on July 30, 1982, and renewed this registration in June 1983 and July 1984. Respondent developed a generic form of clorazepate dipotassium, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and received FDA approval to market it in 1988. In 1991, Respondent subsequently received FDA approval to manufacture dosage forms of the Schedule IV controlled substances propoxyphene and meprobamate, and acquired Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) for the Schedule IV controlled substance chlordiazepoxide. The administrative law judge found that in December 1984, DEA investigators conducted a regularly scheduled investigation and determined that Respondent was generally in compliance with DEA recordkeeping requirements, except that it had never filed required Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) reports. Dr. Bhutani was advised by DEA investigators of the proper reporting procedure for a manufacturer, and the less stringent reporting requirements under a DEA researcher registration. No further action was taken. In his testimony, Dr. Bhutani disputed this version of the events, but Judge Bittner credited the investigator's testimony, while finding Dr. Bhutani's answers to be less than wholly responsive. In November 1987, DEA investigators conducted another periodic investigation of Respondent. Investigators determined that Respondent still had not been filing required ARCOS reports since the previous inspection in 1984. Dr. Bhutani attributed this problem to a lack of National Drug Code (NDC) numbers for his product, but Judge Bittner again found the investigator's testimony more credible. Investigators also determined that Respondent did not have a required accurate biennial inventory, and had stored controlled substance raw material in a filing cabinet located in an unsecured and unapproved storage area. As a result of this inspection, DEA issued Respondent a letter of admonition. Respondent represented, in a subsequent letter to DEA, that he had reviewed the inventory records and corrected any errors. The administrative law judge found that in July 1982, an investigator from the FDA determined that Respondent was not complying with mandated good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and issued a Form 482 list of deficiencies to Respondent. Subsequently, after an inspection in March 1983, FDA issued a notice of adverse findings to Respondent citing non-compliance with tamper-resistant packaging requirements. In December 1983, FDA issued a regulatory letter to Respondent regarding combination over-the-counter drugs. FDA inspections in October 1984 and November 1985 indicated that Respondent was not complying with GMPs. Another regulatory letter was issued in February 1986. Another inspection in that same month disclosed GMP deviations which let the FDA to recommend against using Respondent as a government supplier. Follow-up inspections in May and June 1986 indicated that Respondent was still not in compliance. Afterwards, the FDA considered obtaining an injunction against Respondent, but follow-up inspections in September and October 1986 indicated that Respondent was then sufficiently in compliance. Respondent was found in compliance in December 1986 and January 1987, but at the next scheduled FDA inspection in September and October 1989, GMP deficiencies were again discovered. Another regulatory letter was issued on April 30, 1990. A follow-up inspection in January 1991 revealed deficiencies that resulted in a Complaint for Forfeiture being filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. As a result, Respondent's prescription drug inventory was seized on March 19, 1991. On July 9, 1991, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois found Respondent's drugs to be adulterated. Respondent was permitted to recondition some of these drugs and was permitted to resume operations in November 1991.
