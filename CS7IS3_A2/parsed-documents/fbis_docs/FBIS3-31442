UN control "will be achieved through permanent, on the ground UNPROFOR armed presence on five or six established sites on each side where heavy weapons are regrouped," UN spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told reporters in New York. "If either party attempts to retrieve those weapons it will have to use force and will therefore be in breach of the accepted conditions. Force will in turn be used against it," Fawzi said. Serbian and Bosnian Moslem forces are due to withdraw their heavy weapons from a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of Sarajevo, or hand them over to UN control, by 0000 GMT Sunday or risk NATO airstrikes. Bosnian Serbs said Thursday they would withdraw their heavy weaponry in time, following an intervention by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
