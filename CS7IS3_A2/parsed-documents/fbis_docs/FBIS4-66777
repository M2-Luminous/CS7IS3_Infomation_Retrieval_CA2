FBIS4-66777 "jpnea027___94018" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 6 May 1994 NEAR EAST REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Al-Bid Interviewed on Crisis Al-Bid Interviewed on Crisis 94AE0110A Doha AL-SHARQ in Arabic 6 May 94 p 5 94AE0110A Doha AL-SHARQ Arabic CSO [Telephone interview of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, by Fawzi al-Jundi, from Cairo, date not given : "I Want To Give Up My Official Responsibilities"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction] [Text] The Arab people, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf, are following with mounting unease the deterioration of events in Yemen. All are eager for the success of the union, a natural thing between the two halves of Yemen, though reckless bullets assassinate the hope in the Arabs' hearts. This war has no winner and no loser. The loser is the spirit of restoring Arab solidarity; the winners are those who seek to extinguish the light in this nation, its movemennt toward development, and collective action for greater stability here and in the Arabian peninsula, the Gulf, and every Arab country, God willing. [al-Jundi] Some observers think the failure of the Salalah meeting between you and President 'Ali Salih was due to your having proposed that the armed forces take action incompatible with Yemeni unity. [al-Bid] That is not true. We never did anything like that. But our brothers in the Congress, or some of them, excel at playing games, at maneuvering, talking, and misrepresenting things. We leave it to you to pursue. We want to formalize the document, nothing else. I hope everyone will abide by the document on national consensus. [al-Jundi] A prominent commander at the General People's Congress has said that the Yemeni union can only be ended by war. [al-Bid] Of course war. Those opening fire are aiming at our union. We consider 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech of 27 April to have opened fire on our unity. Perhaps the rest of the patriots are rectifying this situation, because war and partition are two sides of the same coin. If there is a motive for that, it is the motive to destroy the union, though, God willing, despite all our pains, we can survive this. Our people know that today there are still breakaway groups from the 3d Brigade in the mountains and on the roads. We cannot as yet supply statistics as to who is alive and who is not, because they are still monitoring their preparations in the 3d Brigade and the mountainous regions north of Sanaa. They have their equipment, unfortunately. If the action had been against their wishes, it would have been possible to have no imminent collapse or pursuits of those who lived, but they continued. The strange thing is that after leaving the camp, organized preparations were seen in every city with tribes--they were stacking barrels and clenching their fists. How could this be, if the action was outside their control, a big mistake in spite of those exerting all this control? There are things time will reveal quite soon. We hope to keep those who remain, and that they be destined to live, both the 1st Brigade and the 2d. They are all sorely tried, and offering their precious blood on land far from home. This is not our battle. This is a crime being committed by a small group that does not like Yemen, or the Yemeni people, or its union. It is secessionists who are behind these deeds. [al-Jundi] What is the role of the committee of political dialogue after the militarization of the crisis? [al-Bid] The dialogue committee, outside the coalition, is active. I met them on Monday and Salih on Sunday. I wish them further efforts and we will all cooperate with their initiative. I welcomed it in my meeting with them. [al-Jundi] The Yemeni Presidential Council issued a statement saying that the Council was legally and constitutionally responsible for the protection of the united state in all its regions. [al-Bid] The former legitimacy is finished. What is called the Presidential Council is a partitionist group, not the Presidential Council we recognize in accordance with the Constitution. The Presidential Council has, unfortunately, set itself up as prosecutor, judge, and jury, and everything else, and issued its verdict that the 3d Brigade was the cause before the arrival of the committees--before the committees conducted their investigations. How could it allow itself to do that? Is this the Presidential Council? Is it not our right to admonish this conduct, to understand that the people are aware, that they know what's going on? This is one of their farces to impose secession in the name of unity. This is not pro-union or a legitimate action at all; it is a partitionist and isolationist action on the part of individuals in the Presidential Council. The Yemeni people know this. If they want to preserve the union and stability, let them go back to the pledge document and the accord. [al-Jundi] Is there any hope that you will go back to work in Sanaa, the capital of the united Yemeni state? [al-Bid] I hope to give up my official responsibilities, but I will remain a combatant with the whole Yemeni people and all citizens. As to Sanaa, Aden, or Ta'izz, they are all our cities, and I am the one who recently proposed that the document capital be Ta'izz; that would be where we work, given that it is in the middle, and that most of the government staff is from Ta'izz. At this point we are working from this capital, until the document is implemented and the situation stabilizes in the two capitals: the winter and summer capitals, Sanaa and Aden, in accordance with the provisions of the document.
