[Martirosyan] Mr. Liparityan, in your opinion, is the peacekeeping process progressing, regressing, or not going anywhere? [Liparityan] Most likely, the latter. Although of course there is a certain progress, and certain retreat. For instance, Azerbaijan does not accept any mediating efforts, any cease-fire. It is ready for a new offensive and de facto continues the war, air raids--that is, Azerbaijan's position is evidence of the lack of progress in the peacekeeping process. On the other hand, the CSCE has become more active. Mr. Eliasson has sufficiently analyzed previous mistakes and now is demonstrating a new approach, which inspires certain hopes. That is, as you can see, there are both pluses and minuses, so we may say that as a result they neutralize one another or, in other words, there is no particular progress. At the same time, the opportunities for it undoubtedly exist. To carry them through, however, one has to work hard, in order to first and foremost identify where and how they could be utilized. I would count as an unquestionable achievement the fact that the main parties in the conflict--Azerbaijan and Karabakh--finally came to understand that the problems cannot be resolved in a military way and the process of peaceful settlement remains the only viable option. This may be done within the CSCE framework, the way Eliasson suggests. It could be the Russian initiatives. It is an inarguable fact that Russia as the country in closest proximity, which has a stake in normalizing the situation in the region and has ties with all parties to the conflict, may play a very significant role. We hope in any case that Eliasson will be able to combine the efforts of both the CSCE and Russia, which undoubtedly is ready for it. In this case we will be able to speak of moving toward progress. [Martirosyan] Some Western political scientists and journalists believe that despite the fact that the West had certain interests and plans here, its initially active position on the Karabakh issue is on the wane, and that in the final count the outcome will be determined by Russia. In Russia, however, there is a belief that instead of showing activism in the peacekeeping process--which is within the abilities of the CSCE, and United Nations, and the United States--the West does not miss the occasion to throw sticks in the wheels of Russian initiatives. Would it be fair to say that this disjointedness and asynchronicity, which stems from a certain divergence of their interests, is in fact one of the reasons producing the lack of clear progress in settling the conflict? [Liparityan] Your concern over this is understandable and justified in a sense that relations between the West and Russia are far from clear-cut. Several years ago they were perceived differently, as more difficult. After the disintegration of the USSR and especially now, when the policy of Russia as a state is more clearly defined, many aspects are becoming more clear. And especially how Russia itself sees its place in the world. This is also a multistep process, in which the West does not always understand or accept Russia's position and, vice versa, Russia also does not always correctly perceive the former's intentions. They are both in the process of getting to know one another. There is no doubt, however, that an understanding will come, their positions will get mutually fine-tuned, and they will adjust. One can already see it in the example of Bosnia, where we are seeing precisely this stage of fine-tuning, a step toward cooperation between Russia and the West. Let us hope that this will happen here, too. I must say that newspaper items and even statements of some politicians and diplomats sometimes [line illegible] actions. And I repeat, they reflect not so much the probability of events as the deep fear of the worst. Although there is nothing particularly terrible in it; on the contrary, this is like a warning of danger. It is clear, however, that one cannot form a judgment of the real policy from them. Russia has an image of the country that is quite responsible in its policy and actions. And, I repeat, both Russia and the West are moving step by step [line illegible] all, where each will take its place in a new set-up. Therefore I have no doubt that Russia will not act against international law, the CSCE, and the United Nations; on the contrary, together we will find an approach to settling our conflict. By the way, do not forget that even when there exist apparent similarities, each conflict has its own character and therefore requires a special approach to its resolution. I must say that this is precisely the direction in which our diplomacy is working: finding common points in the interests of Russia and the West in order to strengthen their interaction and impact on the fastest possible resolution of the problem. This is the main approach. Of course, there are disagreements not only between Russia and the West as a whole, but also in the approaches favored by the United States and the EC. But they are not substantive. Thus, I repeat, everything boils down to painstaking work, and I am convinced that mutual understanding is inevitable. [Martirosyan] Do you consider correct an approach that makes cease-fire a cornerstone and only then a search for a peace formula? Perhaps it would be more correct to put the latter ahead of the former, or act in parallel in both directions? [Liparityan] We have discussed this issue in great depth, and not only we but other states as well. From the methodological aspect, there are three approaches. The first is a simple cease-fire. Then, in several phases, resolution of other issues. The second is to first define the status and after that cease-fire and everything else. The first approach is unrealistic, because Azerbaijan does not accept it. They are afraid that in the current reality the issue of returning the seized territories will be postponed until further negotiations. Therefore, it agrees to a simultaneous cease-fire and return of seized territories. The first option alone does not suit it. We and Karabakh are ready to accept the first option, but, as I said, we know that for Azerbaijan it is unacceptable. As to the second--to start with the status--in our opinion, this will lead to exacerbation of the conflict because there are tremendous principal disagreements between the parties precisely on this issue. And there is deep mutual mistrust. Therefore, it is simply naive to assume that under this option the parties will be able to come to an agreement. Thus, our approach is in working from the premise of what is possible and necessary. To find these components [line illegible] move over to more complex issues. Our package consists of three points that meet the requirements of possible and necessary. It is cease-fire, the return of seized territories, and lifting the blockade. All of this is spelled out in the CSCE's Vienna document and the Russian initiative. The problem is that there is no guarantee for a cease-fire without some disengaging forces. We cannot trust Azerbaijan. A cease-fire must be stable and guaranteed. If a cease-fire is guaranteed, we guarantee the return of the territories. Without Lachin, of course, which is subject to further negotiations, because for Karabakh it is a lifeline. And lastly, lifting the blockade. These three points as a package, in our opinion, are the most acceptable and realistic solution. But to consider it all even in parallel with the issue of status, I think, albeit possible, is fraught [as published] because unresolvable issues associated with it will immediately arise. It means that we have to admit that the issue of status--and it is this issue that in the final count constitutes the cornerstone of the peace formula--is the most difficult one and it is not advisable to give it priority. You see, there is one more serious nuance in the issue of defining the status: More weight will be given to the voice of the party that will rake up more military victories by the time of negotiations. Subsequently, this will reduce the guarantees of a real cease-fire process. Which is the most important point. A cease-fire is necessary in order to stop bloodshed; in order for people to return to normal life, taste it again, and realize that nobody will benefit from an endless war between peoples living side by side; and finally, in order to reduce domestic pressure for both sides and for simple human desire for normal peaceful life to prevail. And perhaps it is after the cease-fire, during the period of returning to normal life, that people will find those ways and possibilities for coexistence that we cannot find now. They will reach compromises they now consider unthinkable. That is why I am saying that right now the most important part is to apply all efforts in order to implement the three conditions I have enumerated above. [Martirosyan] Over these years, the conflict has gone through several stages. Initially it was between a republic and its autonomy within the boundaries of one state; then it was considered internal within the framework of one newly formed sovereign state, although in essence it was between one recognized state and another one claiming recognition. Now it has transcended into an international stage, although the world community seemed to try to avoid precisely that. Judging by all signs, however, the world community does not take into account this transformation, because otherwise the legal aspect of approaching the settlement would have been changed. Could this perhaps be the reason why the peacekeeping process is not moving anywhere: the lack of a fresh look, a new legal approach to the conflict, which is going through transformation during its development, which stem from objective changes on the political situation? [Liparityan] You see, internalization of this problem also has gone through several stages. The first was the result of the collapse of the USSR, when it changed from being an internal problem of the latter to an external one, because one of the interested parties, in addition to the ones directly involved, was a sovereign state--Armenia. The second happened at the point when Armenia and Azerbaijan joined the CSCE as members. A CSCE mandate dated 24 March 1992 was adopted that said that the resolution of this conflict must be found through mediating efforts of the CSCE. The third stage is when Azerbaijan called in mujahidin and other contract soldiers. What I want to say is that there have not been any particular legal changes but there obviously have been certain political ones. For instance, now the United Nations has entered the process--an organization which, unlike the CSCE, has its own military contingent and the right to bring it into a territory where certain events take place, and without the consent of the parties to the conflict at that. That is, it is a certain qualitative change in the political approach.... But, I repeat, there are no such changes in the legal aspect. There is still no decision, a CSCE or UN document, presenting the issue differently. [Martirosyan] Still, in your opinion, is a change in the approach on the part of the world community needed? [Liparityan] You see, in a certain form it already has happened. The CSCE has realized that by its very structure it does not possess the capabilities of implementing the decisions entrusted to a peacekeeping mission or group under its aegis. I mean the process of cease-fire. In some decisions the CSCE has acknowledged that by very [as published]. The result of this realization was that Russia directly joined in on the issue. In reality, it already has happened, although officially the CSCE does not say that it is no longer engaged in the issue of cease-fire. Both the numerous statements of the Minsk Group chairman and UN resolutions mention the mediating part of Russian peacekeeping forces in the cease-fire process. This is happening both de facto and de jure, since there exist corresponding UN resolutions. That is, as you can see, when it is obvious that the CSCE does not possess the ability to influence one or another process, it steps aside, handing this right over to whoever has the real ability. In this respect Mr. Eliasson has a very clear position, more active: If Russia can do it, let it happen, while we will send our observers. [Martirosyan] Mr. Gilmore believes that the question of bringing in the troops is not as simple as it may seem, especially in such a protracted and bloody conflict as that of Karabakh, and that it is unlikely to be a panacea. Besides, he says it is a question of time, since numerous issues involving the status and mandate of such a contingent must be resolved--from their rights and duties to subordination and financing. Meanwhile, there are many who do believe that without a disengaging military contingent, resolution and observers alone will not guarantee real compliance with the terms of cease-fire. You have said earlier in this interview that you support the priority of cease-fire and everything else should come later. Does it mean that even this--provided that a peacekeeping contingent does need to be brought in--now will be delayed under the pretext of defining the status of the latter? [Liparityan] Mr. Gilmore undoubtedly is correct when he mentions the problems associated with the mandate. There are, however, forms, accepted by the international community, when this can be dispensed with. For instance, CSCE rules envisage an option of bringing in third-country peacekeeping forces without a special CSCE mandate. We do not see any particular problem in whether these troops will have a CSCE or UN mandate (although of course it would be good) or whether it would be a contingent supplied by the third country. The main item is the scope of their authority. This is what should be in the center of discussion--not the formalities aimed at dragging out the process. [Martirosyan] Do you not think that Armenia's participation in the negotiations' process contributed to a certain degree to its even greater involvement in the conflict as a directly interested party? In any case, this is the way it looks--on one hand, we proclaim that we do not participate in the war and, on the other, sit at the negotiations table. If the former is true, why is Turkey, for instance, not sitting next to us, since they have certain relations with Azerbaijan, or Russia for which this role is more fitting as a legal successor to the USSR than the role of a mere peace keeper? Perhaps if Armenia had not taken upon itself originally the mission of representing Karabakh in the negotiations process, the world community would have been compelled to recognize Karabakh as an independent side in the negotiations sooner, since they had to be conducted with someone. [Liparityan] Armenia participates because its territory is under attack. This is one aspect of our participation. And the second is that we have a direct stake in the security of Karabakh, which is populated by our kin. And finally, the foremost reason for our participation was that at the time the negotiation process began, Karabakh was not recognized by the world community as a subject with an independent right to participate in negotiations. So we had to undertake it. Armenian officials, unlike the ones of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, had the official right to represent Karabakh's interests, and simply speak for it at official meetings at an international level in various countries and organizations. Although of course one could speak of some form of participation by Turkey as an interested party as well. For us, however, what is important is not formality but the work, its results. Now Karabakh participates in this process. Now that this process has started, our role should gradually diminish from that moment on. [Martirosyan] Do you believe that as a result of negotiations we have come even a step closer to ending the war and that something still needs to be changed in the world community's approach to the Karabakh conflict in order to speed up its resolution? [Liparityan] In my opinion, I have already answered quite fully the second part of the question. The international community must apply a certain effort and pressure on Azerbaijan to make it accept one of the options. And second--the international community must combine its efforts. That is, Russian and the CSCE must interact at least to make the former happen--exert influence on Azerbaijan. After all, look, both we and Karabakh are coming up with peace initiatives. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, keeps coming up with delays. On the other hand, it is obvious that its complex domestic situation does not allow those healthy aspirations for peace--which probably do exist there, but do not have the opportunity to manifest themselves--to come through. In short, in order for the peacekeeping process to proceed more actively, we need greater activism by the world community. Everything that depends on us we already do.
