The objects of the survey were students, scientific and technological personnel, teachers, CYL cadres, and young people in other professions whose ages ranged from 18 to 35. Emphasis was placed on young people who have high educational attainments. The issues revealed by the survey are now analyzed as follows: 1. Political Attitudes Become Stable Among respondents to the questionnaires, those who said they "care" or "care very much" about the 14th party congress accounted for 42.6 percent and 46.5 percent respectively, and the total was 89.1 percent. Those who said they "do not care" accounted for only 1.4 percent. Those who said they "support" and "fully support" the resolutions adopted by the 14th Party Congress accounted for 37.9 percent and 37.4 percent respectively, and those who said they "obey the party's decisions" accounted for 17.9 percent, so the total for those who gave a positive and enthusiastic response accounted for 93.2 percent, while 6.8 percent of the respondents said they would "have to think about it." Another survey by questionnaire aimed at university students shows: When a questionnaire-type survey was extended to a wider scope of young people, asking their opinions on China's current political situation, the results showed: Those who thought the political situation was stable or relatively stable accounted for 88.7 percent, those who thought it was not adequately stable accounted for only 9.5 percent, and those who did not care accounted for only 1.8 percent. Looking at their professions, we can find that teachers and students in particular tended to view the political situation as stable or relatively stable, as 90.3 percent and 89.6 percent of them respectively said so; the percentage of scientists and technicians who said so was lower at 76.7 percent. Among those who thought the political situation was not stable enough, young graduate students in particular thought this way, as 18.5 percent of them said so. Before and after the spring festival of 1992, a "red sun craze" emerged in the whole country. Responses by young people to questions concerning this phenomenon were: 1) respect for the leader of the revolution (23.1 percent); 2) new idolatry (7.9 percent); 3) trying to be fashionable (21.2 percent); 4) nostalgia (18.7 percent); 5) dissatisfied with the current situation (15.4 percent); and 6) hard to tell (13.7 percent). What is the status of the party's four cardinal principles in the new period, which centers on economic construction? Among young people, 80.5 percent said "they must be upheld," 14 percent said "some areas must be upheld," and 2.1 percent said "there is no need for them to be upheld." A survey in October 1988 asked a question which read: "In your opinion, is it necessary to uphold the four cardinal principles in order to carry out reform?" Among those who answered only 28.7 percent said "it is very necessary," and a majority of them chose "it is necessary but must not become rigid" (53.56 percent). Those who said "it is not necessary" and "it does not matter" accounted for 7.61 percent. 2. Optimistic About Economic Reform Answering a question on the way for our country's economic reform, 42.5 percent of respondents advocated strengthening the market economy, and 36.4 percent advocated putting the market in the main position and planning in a supplementary position. Persons showing a positive attitude by choosing these two answers accounted for 78.9 percent, while those advocating the planned economy accounted for 21.3 percent. Regarding publicity given by the mass media to the great tide of reform, most young people thought it was conducive to emancipating the mind (42.1 percent) and attracting foreign capital (29 percent), and the total was 71.1 percent. As for the market economy mechanism itself, no one was against it. Concerning the newly announced reform measures, the result of the survey exceeded all expectations by showing that most young people were optimistic about them. We then came to the issue of adjusting and increasing goods prices. In an 1988 survey of ideological conditions among young people throughout the country, 92.75 percent of the respondents to the questionnaires thought that panic buying at that time was caused by a loss of control over price reform and the people's inability to adapt to the lifting of restrictions on prices, 65.71 percent thought that restrictions on prices must be lifted on condition wages are increased correspondingly, and among the "10 most worried about problems," young people put "random price increases" in first position, as 63.79 percent of them said so. But this kind of response changed during the recent survey. The questionnaires tried to find out the reason for calmness among the people in light of recent increases in transportation and fuel prices by the state, and the result was: Among the respondents, 43.6 percent said they "realize that this is required by the development of a socialist market economy," 31.1 percent said their "ability to withstand price adjustments has increased," while 21.2 percent chose the unenthusiastic answer that "there is no method even if one is dissatisfied," and 4.1 percent said the increases "bred discontent." We then came to the issue of not assigning jobs to university graduates. This was an issue which emerged in 1988 and caused controversy. In the past, most university graduates have been opposed to the implementation of this policy, saying that it would lead to unhealthy practices such as going through the back door. But the recent survey showed some changes. Among those responding to the question of "how would you evaluate the state's policy of not assigning jobs to university graduates," 37.4 percent said it "can arouse enthusiasm for study among students," 26.2 percent said the policy would "boost the unhealthy practice of going through the back door," 26 percent said the policy "is a policy not applicable at this time because of a lack of conditions," and 10.5 percent said "it is hard to say." Here we can see that among young people, the proportion of those who support the reform is higher; of the three rival opinions, the one with an optimistic attitude had the edge. 3. Hate Corruption and Call for Reform Young people's grievances against social problems mainly originates from corrupt phenomena among party and government personnel. This situation is basically similar to the results of the 1988 survey. A question in the questionnaires asked: "What is your assessment of the extent of the emerging phenomenon of corruption?" Of the respondents, 89.3 percent thought the corruption phenomenon at this time is very serious or rather serious, and this was an absolute majority; on the other hand, only 2.9 percent said that it was not serious, only 1.4 percent said that it did not matter or they did not care about it, and 6.4 percent said that it was hard to tell. These three answers accounted for only 10.7 percent. Arranged in order of the degree of hatred, the five kinds of evil social phenomena hated most by young people are: bureaucracy, abuse of power for private interest, corruption and bribery, dissolute lifestyles, and others. Among the four choices for the statement that "the crux of our country's reform of the political system is," most respondents chose "eliminating corruption and establishing democratic decisionmaking and democratic supervisory mechanisms," which accounted for 50.3 percent of answers, while the second most popular choice was "separation of the party and government, separation of government and enterprises, and streamlining government and delegating power to lower levels," which accounted for 41.1 percent. In the 1988 survey, the most popular answer to the same question was "separation of party and government (47.8 percent), and the second most popular choice was "democratic decisionmaking" (30.15 percent), while the radical advocacy of "stripping them of their special privileges" ranked fifth among seven crucial measures. One question asked: "What do you think is the most important factor harming the stable situation in the socialist country?" In order of popularity, the 10 choices are ranked as follows: 1) a backward economy and low living standards; 2) the legal system is not sound and the social order is chaotic; 3) a poor law and order situation; 4) lackluster efforts to combat corruption; 5) price increases; 6) unfair distribution; 7) timid reform and opening up; 8) agitation by foreign reactionary forces; 9) influence from contemporary Western trends of thought; and 10) unstable policies. When comparing the process of reform of the political system with the process of reform of the economic system in our country, most young people thought that reform of political system had lagged behind reform of the economic system (57.7 percent), while the other three choices made up 42.3 percent. 4. Young People Are More Chaotic in Areas of Ideology and Theory Within the questionnaire there was a question which asked about the "situation of faith in socialism among most of the young people around you," and the survey showed: Only 7.7 percent said they had firm faith, while 14.2 percent said they had no faith, and both were small proportions. Most young people were in the condition of "having faith, but also puzzled." Analyzing by level of educational attainment, we may see that graduate students are the most pronounced in saying that they "have no faith," as 27.3 percent of them at this level said so, and 5.4 percent of undergraduates and students at higher learning institutes also said this. However, only 6.3 percent of those at the middle-school level said this, and this is far lower than the rate at the graduate-student level. Analyzing by profession, we may see that 9.3 percent of scientists and technicians said they "have no faith," and this is the highest percentage; 6 percent of teachers and students said they had no faith; and only 1.6 percent of CYL cadres said they "have no faith," and this was the lowest percentage. In the questionnaire, one question read: "Listed below are various kinds of understanding of patriotism. Which would you tend to pick? The result was: 37 percent of respondents thought that "to be patriotic, one must love socialism"; 38.2 percent thought that "to be patriotic, one does not necessarily have to love socialism"; and 24.8 percent thought that "to be patriotic, one at least is not opposed to socialism." The first two choices were more pronounced. We then came to the socialist market economy. During conversations and discussions, we discovered that quite a number of young people thought that socialism with Chinese characteristics is in fact capitalism with Chinese characteristics. Within the questionnaire, a question read: "In your opinion, how does China's democracy look when compared with capitalist countries?" Of the respondents, 28.3 percent thought that "China's democratic system was better," 7.8 percent thought that "the democratic system in capitalist countries was better," and a majority, 57.6 percent, thought that "each has its own advantages and disadvantages." The questionnaire also asked about the essence of the great changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe, and 57.3 percent of respondents thought that these changes were peaceful evolution caused by capitalism, 21.4 percent thought that the changes were the "roads of reform chosen by the various countries themselves," and 11.8 percent attributed the changes to the failure of the socialist system. "What is the main reason, in your opinion, for the several student movements since reform?" The answers were as follows: "Caused by social problems" was chosen by many people (accounting for 41.6 percent), while 15.9 percent of young people thought that student movements were a way to express themselves, and 7.5 percent thought that student movements were an embodiment of patriotism. Those who thought that the student movements were influenced by the trend of bourgeois liberation thoughts accounted for 27.4 percent, and those who thought young students were not mature enough and prone to cause trouble accounted for 7.7 percent. An analysis based on the level of educational attainment shows that the graduate-student level was the most pronounced in assessing the student movements with an affirmative attitude (94.8 percent), and this attitude dropped a bit among undergraduates and students in higher learning institutes (65.9 percent). An analysis based on profession shows that more scientific and technological personnel and teachers hold an affirmative attitude toward the student movements, making up 73.7 percent and 69.3 percent respectively. The percentage among students dropped a bit to 62.9 percent. In the past, in the area of assessing student movements, there has been a similar tendency of affirmation. Within the questionnaire, a question asked about the cause of the 1985 student movement, and 47.8 percent of respondents said it was caused by "dissatisfaction with the unhealthy trend at that time"; 18.5 percent said "it was patriotic, opposing the resurrection of Japanese militarism"; 22.6 percent said "it was instigated by people who have ulterior motives"; and 11 percent thought it was caused by the "inability to adapt to the reform, opening up, and new situation." Those who gave an affirmative assessment accounted for 66.3 percent, and those who gave a negative assessment accounted for 33.7 percent. When asked "what is the major worry in your life," most young people chose "too low income" among the seven available choices. Other choices were ranked in order of popularity as follows: a lack of housing, poor interpersonal relations, not being able to apply what you have learned, difficulty in getting married and in love affairs, not having any way to give play to one's talents, and difficulty in going out of the country. In the 1988 survey, the "low income" answer ranked in fifth position, and the other four choices ranked in order of popularity were: random price increases, leaders treating people unfairly, dissatisfaction with current job, and a lack of good recreational venues. In the survey, a question asked: "What, in your opinion, is the goal which is most difficult to reach in the process of catching up with and surpassing the four little dragons of Asia?" Those who chose "level of educational development" accounted for 48.5 percent, 26.2 percent chose "level of economic development," 15.4 percent chose "level of social morals," and 9.9 percent chose the "level of science and technology." Here we can see that young people are very pessimistic about the current situation and future of education. Primary and secondary education, especially primary and secondary education in rural areas, is in many aspects worse than in the period shortly after the liberation. The road to university education for peasant children is becoming narrower and narrower. There is a shortage of funds for universities to the extent that university presidents have no mood to grasp teaching, but spend their energy mainly on creating channels of income. As for going to university with one's own money or the real possibility that one must go to university by paying one's own fees in the future, quite a number of university students and their parents said they could not bear. When answering the question: "What is your view on going to university by your own expense," 43.9 percent of respondents said they "could not bear it," 37.5 percent said they "could bear it," and 18.6 percent said they "do not care."
