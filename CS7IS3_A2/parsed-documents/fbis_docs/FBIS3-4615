KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] spokeswoman Sam Raw expressed the KIO's view on this matter to the BBC by telephone: [Begin Sam Raw recording] The KIO believes that all armed organizations who advocate the non-disintegration of the union will be able to cease fighting in the same way the KIO has ceased fighting against the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council]. The participation of all these organizations is indispensable if the political problems are to be resolved at the table through discussions. That is why a nationwide cease-fire is necessary, as I have just mentioned -- to allow these organizations to participate in the discussions. We also strongly believe that, in resolving the political problems at the table through discussions, the problems can be resolved one by one if all organizations, all political organizations, and all national ethnic groups approach matters with good intentions and genuine goodwill.
