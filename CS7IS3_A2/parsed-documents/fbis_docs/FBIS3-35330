The talks focused on the size of the Palestinian police. Later today, the committee dealing with the transfer of the civilian powers will hold its session. After meeting the foreign minister of Malta, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this morning that the Israeli-PLO talks in Cairo are making satisfactory progress. He refused to say whether the issue of collaborators is being discussed. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin recording] [Segal] The next Arab League convention, which will be held in Cairo in March, will discuss an offer which will probably bring the Arab boycott against Israel near its end. According to the offer, each Arab country will be able to decide whether to end or continue the boycott on its own. Political sources in Jerusalem believe that if such a resolution is made, it would be followed by the cancellation of the boycott by several important Arab countries such as, among others, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Tunisia, and Morocco. At the same time next month, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will arrive on a Middle East shuttle mission seeking to attain a breakthrough on the Syrian track. Foreign Minister Peres this morning addressed himself to the issue of U.S. involvement in the political process: [Peres] The U.S. involvement is not the same on all three tracks. The negotiations with the Palestinians today are, in the main part, held directly between the two sides. Negotiations with Jordan take place in Washington, and I would like to see a faster pace there. As for Syria, for all intents and purposes, the negotiations are at the very initial stages. We would like to see a breakthrough there. [passage omitted] [end recording]
