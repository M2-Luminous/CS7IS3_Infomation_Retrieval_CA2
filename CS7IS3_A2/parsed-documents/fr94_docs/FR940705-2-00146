FR940705-2-00146 FR940705-2-00090 Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;e. Other (BL3&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;e&hyph;(1). BL3&hyph;P greenhouse containment requirements may be satisfied using a growth chamber or growth room within a building provided that the location, access, airflow patterns, and provisions for decontamination of experimental materials and supplies meet the intent of the foregoing clauses. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;e&hyph;(2). Vacuum lines shall be protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA or equivalent filters and liquid disinfectant traps. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D. Biosafety Level 4_Plants (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a. Greenhouse Access (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Authorized entry into the greenhouse shall be restricted to individuals who are required for program or support purposes. The Greenhouse Director shall be responsible for assessing each circumstance and determining those individuals who are authorized to enter the greenhouse facility or work in the greenhouse during experiments. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Access shall be managed by the Greenhouse Director, Biological Safety Officer, or other individual responsible for physical security of the greenhouse facility; and access limited by means of secure, locked doors. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Prior to entering, individuals shall be advised of the potential environmental hazards and instructed on appropriate safeguards for ensuring environmental safety. Individuals authorized to enter the greenhouse facility shall comply with the instructions and all other applicable entry/exit procedures. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(4). Personnel shall enter and exit the greenhouse facility only through the clothing change and shower rooms and shall shower each time they exit the greenhouse facility. Personnel shall use the airlocks to enter or exit the laboratory only in an emergency. In the event of an emergency, every reasonable effort should be made to prevent the possible transport of viable propagules from containment. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(5). Prior to entering the greenhouse, personnel shall be required to read and follow instructions on BL4&hyph;P practices and procedures. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b. Records (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). A record shall be kept of all experimental materials brought into or removed from the greenhouse. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). A record shall be kept of experiments currently in progress in the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(3). A record shall be kept of all personnel entering and exiting the greenhouse facility, including the date and time of each entry. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(4). The Principal Investigator shall report any greenhouse accident involving the inadvertent release or spill of microorganisms to the Biological Safety Officer, Greenhouse Director, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA, and other appropriate authorities immediately (if applicable). Reports to the NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Documentation of any such accident shall be prepared and maintained. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c&hyph;(1). All materials, except for those that are to remain in a viable or intact state for experimental purposes, shall be autoclaved prior to removal from the maximum containment greenhouse. Equipment or material that could be damaged by high temperatures or steam shall be decontaminated by alternative methods (e.g., gas or vapor sterilization) in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c&hyph;(2). Water that comes in contact with experimental microorganisms or with material exposed to such microorganisms (e.g., run-off from watering plants) shall be collected and decontaminated before disposal. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c&hyph;(3). Standard microbiological procedures shall be followed for decontamination of equipment and materials. Spray or liquid waste or rinse water from containers used to apply the experimental microorganisms shall be decontaminated before disposal. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d. Control of Undesired Species and Motile Macroorganisms (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d&hyph;(1). A chemical control program shall be implemented to eliminate undesired pests and pathogens in accordance with applicable state and Federal laws. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d&hyph;(2). Arthropods and other motile macroorganisms used in conjunction with experiments requiring BL4&hyph;P level physical containment shall be housed in appropriate cages. When appropriate to the organism, experiments shall be conducted within cages designed to contain the motile organisms. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;e. Concurrent Experiments Conducted in the Greenhouse (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;e&hyph;(1). Experiments involving organisms that require a containment level lower than BL4&hyph;P may be conducted in the greenhouse concurrently with experiments that require BL4&hyph;P containment provided that all work is conducted in accordance with BL4&hyph;P greenhouse practices. When the experimental microorganisms in use require a containment level lower than BL4&hyph;P, greenhouse practices reflect the level of containment required by the highest containment level microorganisms being tested. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;f. Signs (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(1). A sign shall be posted indicating that a restricted experiment is in progress. The sign shall indicate the following: (i) The name of the responsible individual, (ii) the plants in use, and (iii) any special requirements for using the area.
