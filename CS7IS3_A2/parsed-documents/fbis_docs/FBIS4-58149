The Foreign Office also insisted that it was looking for a rapid reponse from the Iranian charge d'affaires to London, Gholam Reza Ansari, even though he has already "categorically denied" the allegations. The charge d'affaires said that claims of Iranian contacts with the IRA in its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland were "totally unsubtantiated" and suspected "elements" were at work to undermine diplomatic relations. Ireland's prime minister, Albert Reynolds, is also sceptical about the claim. He said Thursday [28 April] he was unaware of any such link and "cannot accept any part of the allegations until they are established." The FINANCIAL TIMES in London suspected that the allegations were connected to the U.S. campaign to isolate Iran economically following the American Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks with the British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, this week. The charges, which have been accompanied by maximum publicity in the British press, are seen aimed at trying to embarrass European countries, who have recently worked to reschedule Iran's debt repayments. The prime minister's office said Friday that it had informed European Union countries, the U.S., Canada and Japan of the fresh allegations and that their response was "supportive." The timing follows several European countries building up better relations with Iran, including Ireland, whose marine minister, David Andrews has just returned from Tehran. The FINANCIAL TIMES also saw the move putting pressure on Japan's friendly ties. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office remained adamant Friday the government was still looking for a "very early response" from Iran to "immediately and conclusively sever" ties with the IRA. But he was unable to explain how this could be done when Iran had already totally rejected the claim. The suggestion was there was never any reply likely to satisfy London's intentions of provoking a new diplomatic row, with the media here implying that it could lead to sanctions or expulsions, that have been so common in Britain's diplomatic policy. The UK's hostility towards Iran has lingered since the Islamic revolution in 1979 causing London to lose out heavily in trade relations that have been filled by its European rivals, which unlike the UK, have been more pragmatic in improving ties with the Islamic republic.
