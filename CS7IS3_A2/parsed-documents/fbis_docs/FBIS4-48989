Kao said he will invite the public and private sectors as well as Japanese firms to jointly invest in the holding company which will have a capital base of at least NT [New Taiwan] $10 billion (US$378 million). After its establishment, the holding company will seek to transfer from Japan the technologies used in manufacturing each product that Taiwan imports, since Japanese imports exceed US$30 million yearly, he added. Kao said that Economics Minister P.K. Chiang and several local business heavyweights, including Honorary Chairman Ku Chen-fu of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, have expressed their support for the proposed company. Taiwan has been disappointed with the result of its efforts to trim the trade deficit with Japan, and the gap is, in fact, widening. The deficit totaled US$14.22 billion last year, and is expected to increase to US$15.5 billion this year. The first- quarter deficit was US$3.7 billion.
