The talks were held in accordance with the initiative that was made by Ambassador Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus. Fearing the possibility of an impasse in the talks, the U.S. diplomats organized a meeting between the Turkish, Turkish Cypriot, and UN officials in Vienna. Many of the points in the UN "miniagreement package" on Maras [Varosha], dated 21 March, which caused uneasiness in the Turkish Cypriot side, were resolved through Robert Lamb's proposals in that city. But then the problem emerged. The UN and U.S. officials failed to put in writing the formula on which the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] agreed. They informed the Turkish Cypriot side as follows: "The understanding reached in Vienna will be taken into consideration in the talks if you agree to the UN package dated 21 March." No one must expect TRNC President Rauf Denktas to adopt a naive approach and say "yes" to unwritten, nonbinding, and abstract promises. Denktas visited Turkey after he returned to north Cyprus from Vienna. Regardless of the suggestions made in Ankara, he refused to agree to the package, dated 21 March, that is, not until the Vienna accord was regarded as a binding document. That was why Prime Minister Tansu Ciller sent Ambassador Tugay Ulucevik, Turkey's number one expert on the Cyprus problem, to the TRNC. A compromise formula was agreed on by Ankara and Denktas through Ulucevik's initiatives in Nicosia two days ago. And Denktas disclosed that he agreed to the minipackage, provided that "the Vienna accord is included in the text of the agreement." He explained his new position in writing to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative, during the dinner he had with him the night before last. Undoubtedly, Denktas can be criticized to a certain extent on this point. It would have been more appropriate for him to make that disclosure, on which Turkey insisted, while he was still in Ankara at the beginning of the week. Nevertheless, the disclosure was made. What was strange at this time was the UN General Secretariat's approach. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted his report to the UN Security Council in New York nearly two hours after Feissel put Denktas' letter in his pocket and bid him farewell in Nicosia. It is common knowledge that Butrus-Ghali's report accused the Turkish Cypriot side of maintaining an irreconcilable approach. Butrus-Ghali's behavior indicated that he ignored Denktas' important step. He hinted in his report that Denktas does not have the political will to resolve the problem by saying: "I am doubtful as to whether the Turkish Cypriot leaders will be willing to reach an agreement even if the changes that have been asked for by the Turkish Cypriot side are realized." Not satisfied with that, Butrus-Ghali proposed "sanctions" against the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to solve the problem. In other words, he urged the UN Security Council to penalize the Turkish Cypriots. Regardless of how the situation is considered, Butrus-Ghali's report has revealed that he maintains an unfair and biased approach, which has further complicated the solution to the problem. Considering the concession Denktas made the night before last, Butrus-Ghali should have withheld or, at least, changed his report. Obviously, Denktas' disclosure created a new opportunity in the negotiations process, regardless of the fact that it was conditional. The proverb that comes to mind in light of all that is as follows: "Do we wish to acquire grapes or beat up the vintner?" Obviously, Butrus-Ghali does not intend to facilitate the solution of the problem. On the contrary, he wishes to reprimand the Turkish Cypriot side. The initiatives he has made on several problems, including the situation in Bosnia, have failed. Consequently, he has decided to take action against the TRNC leaders in the Cyprus problem in order to strengthen his morale. The Turkish diplomats were expected to obstruct Butrus-Ghali's report. That has not been done. Therefore, they should, at least, expose Butrus-Ghali's biased approach in the UN Security Council. Sanctions should also be taken against the UN secretary general for the mistakes he makes. The conflicting UN and U.S. approach on the problem is a good opportunity for Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in that regard. Butrus-Ghali's report indicates that he preferres a scolding approach instead of heeding the norms of diplomacy. Undoubtedly, Turkey is influential and capable enough to react in a similar way. Let us wait and watch developments.
