The officials said the appeal was contained in a report submitted to Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi by the Central Employment Security Council. The report called for widening the scope of job categories from the current 16, including secretaries and interpreters, that such agencies are allowed to handle. The report also called on the government to provide subsidies to corporations which improve working conditions for senior workers. The recommendations include a call for the establishment of a center to help workers over 60 find jobs, the officials said. They said the ministry plans to submit to the next ordinary session of the Diet a bill to revise a job security law to incorporate the proposed measures and make it mandatory for corporations to set the retirement age at 60 in principle.
