In an interview with local television Pyankov said that beginning from January, armed provocations against Russian border guards turned into a series of "incessant operations." According to the Russian general, the situation worsened because Russian border guard posts are being predominantly shelled from the Afghan territory, which provokes Russian border guards to take measures in retaliation. "These provocations pursue far-reaching and dangerous goals - to involve Russian border guards in fighting directly on the territory of Afghanistan so as to hold Russia responsible for conducting military operations on the territory of a sovereign state," the Russian general said. At the same time, the command of Russian border guards in Tajikistan cannot remain indifferent to endless shelling of Russian border guard posts and the death of Russian servicemen. Beginning from January, border guard posts and border guard units came under intensive rocket fire launched from the Afghan territory 21 times. There are casualties among Russian servicemen and considerable material damage was caused to some military settlements on the border. Pyankov pointed out that the Tajik irreconcilable opposition which stakes on military settlement of the Tajik conflict has no chances to win. Coalition peace-keeping forces stationed in Tajikistan, including Russian border guard troops, are strong enough to rebuff any external aggression against sovereign Tajikistan. Hopes pinned by the Tajik irreconcilable opposition on the support of the population are illusory, the Russian general said. Pyankov pointed out that there are separate anti-government groups in Tajikistan, but the majority of the population do not support them. "People are tired of war and they welcome efforts made by the present Tajik leadership to stabilise the socio-political situation, reach civil peace and prevent another civil war in the republic," the Russian general said. He pointed out that this should be brought home both to leaders of the Tajik irreconcilable opposition and certain military-political forces in Afghanistan who not only objected to the creation of bases of Tajik militants on their territory, but who are rendering them direct assistance in carrying out military operations against Tajikistan.
