"We are convinced that the presidential elections must be held without fail within the time limit specified by the law, stressed people's deputy and co-chairman of MBR [interregional bloc of reforms] Volodymyr Hrynyov. The president's arguments on the political situation concerning the elections today do not stand up to criticism and the attempt to postpone the elections with the help of the newly elected Supreme Council, and by doing so to place all the responsibility for this step on it is, in my opinion, destined to fail." Leonid Kuchma, co-chairman of the MBR and people's deputy stressed that groups of the MBR-Tsentr and other centrist forces in the parliament will come up against strong pressure on the part of the "party of power" to postpone the elections, but the position of the MBR-Tsentr should be firm. "I am convinced, said Kuchma, that every day the presidential elections are postponed will be destructively reflected not only on the economic infrastructure but will also lead to the impoverishment of the wider strata of the population. Members of the MBR-Tsentr group had different views on the local elections. While not rejecting a renewal of the power structures in the localities as a whole, they however, expressed concern with the fact the election in 25 oblasts of "little presidents" could seriously destabilize the executive vertical of power. The group will define its definitive position on the election to local bodies of self-government in the course of consultations and meetings.
