FR941213-2-00014 FR941213-2-00006 Export Trade Certificate of Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of initiation of process of revoke export trade certificate of review No. 92&hyph;00008. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce issued an export trade certificate of review to International EXIM Corporation. Because this certificate holder has failed to file an annual report as required by law, the Department is initiating proceedings to revoke the certificate. This notice summarizes the notification letter sent to International EXIM Corporation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: W. Dawn Busby, Director, Office of Export Trading Company Affairs, International Trade Administration, 202/482&hyph;5l3l. This is not a toll-free number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (``the Act'') [15 U.S.C. 4011&hyph;21] authorized the Secretary of Commerce to issue export trade certificates of review. The regulations implementing Title III [''the Regulations''] are found at 15 CFR part 325. Pursuant to this authority, a certificate of review was issued on September 8, 1992 to International EXIM Corporation. A certificate holder is required by law (Section 308 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 4018) to submit to the Department of Commerce annual reports that update financial and other information relating to business activities covered by its certificate. The annual report is due within 45 days after the anniversary date of the issuance of the certificate of review [Sections 325.14(a) and (b) of the Regulations]. Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for revocation [Sections 325.10(a) and 325.14(c) of the Regulations]. The Department of Commerce sent to International EXIM Corporation on August 29, 1994, a letter containing annual report questions with a reminder that its annual report was due on October 23, 1994. Additional reminders were sent on October 24, 1994, and on November 16, 1994. The Department has received no written response to any of these letters. On December 7, 1994, and in accordance with ยง325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations, a letter was sent by certified mail to notify International EXIM Corporation that the Department was formally initiating the process to revoke its certificate. The letter stated that this action is being taken for the certificate holder's failure to file an annual report. In accordance with ยง325.10(c)(2) of the Regulations, each certificate holder has thirty days from the day after its receipt of the notification letter in which to respond. The certificate holder is deemed to have received this letter as of the date on which this notice is published in the Federal Register . For good cause shown, the Department of Commerce can, at its discretion, grant a thirty-day extension for a response. If the certificate holder decides to respond, it must specifically address the Department's statement in the notification letter that it has failed to file an annual report. It should state in detail why the facts, conduct, or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, or if they are, why they do not warrant revoking the certificate. If the certificate holder does not respond within the specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements contained in the notification letter (Section 325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations). If the answer demonstrates that material facts are in dispute, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice shall, upon request, meet informally with the certificate holder. Either Department may require the certificate holder to provide the documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions (Section 325.10(c)[3] of the Regulations). The Department shall publish a notice in the Federal Register of the revocation or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify (Section 325.10(c)[4] of the Regulations). If there is a determination to revoke a certificate, any person aggrieved by such final decision may appeal to an appropriate U.S. district court within 30 days from the date on which the Department's final determination is published in the Federal Register (Sections 325.10(c)(4) and 325.11 of the Regulations). Dated: December 7, 1994. W. Dawn Busby, Director, Office of Export Trading Company Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30535 Filed 12&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;P
