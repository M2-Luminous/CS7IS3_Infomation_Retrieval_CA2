[Thai Phung Ne] "Testing is the final phase of construction for the power network before it goes into operation. According to a schedule drawn up by three parties, namely Vietnam; the (Merland Guerain) company of France, which provides transformer stations; and the PPI-SECVI (of Australia), a technical consultant that participates in supervision of construction, the test period will last for about two months. "The testing program officially began 5 April, exactly two years after the beginning of construction. I cannot recall everything we have done in the past month because the testing involves huge amounts of work." I can only recall the most essential activities, which include finishing the inspection, testing, and adjustment of the entire 1,487 km of the 500-kv power transmission line; completing the inspection and testing of equipment at all five transformer stations and the National Power Regulator Center; completing testing of measuring instruments and switches at the Hoa Binh, Ha Tinh and Danang transformer stations; measuring the electrical resistance of the Danang-Ha Tinh-Hoa Binh, Danang-Play Cu, Play Cu-Krong No, and Krong No-Phu Lam microwave transmission lines; and test-connecting the 15-kv power network with the 500-kv power network. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, were there any problems with the test-run? [Thai Phung Ne] "Generally speaking, the results of the test-run were good." [Correspondent] "Mr. Minister, everyone is waiting for the moment when the switch is turned on, carrying electricity from the north to the south. Could you tell us exactly when that will happen?" [Thai Phung Ne] "As I said earlier, two months of testing are needed before the power transmission lines are connected officially. I have asked the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of Australia) and other testing units to focus their greatest efforts on finishing the remaining testing work promptly." It is necessary to point out here that the remaining work is very extensive. I have asked the National Electricity Regulator Center and the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of Australia) to draw up an operating plan for various power stations in order to ensure a smooth supply of electricity to the national power grid.
