Meeting with a Hungarian delegation led by Kalman at the Great Hall of the People here this morning, Rong said China will use stable and proper methods to control its annual national economic growth rate at about nine percent, so as to ensure its social stability and steady economic development. He said that building up the legal system was an indispensable part of maintaining the country's social stability and economic development. Over the past few years, he said, China has drawn up a great number of laws, but they still did not fully meet the needs of its economic growth. Rong said: "we will rely on our own efforts to build the legal systems. At the same time, it is necessary to absorb foreign countries' useful experience." On bilateral relations, Rong said China and hungary are friendly countries. In recent years, the two countries have enjoyed very good cooperation in the field of economy and sound exchanges in building up legal systems. The frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of the two countries have boosted bilateral friendly ties and cooperation, he said. Rong expressed the hope that the delegation's current visit will play a role in furthering bilateral relations. Kalman said Hungary places great importance on developing its ties with China, adding that it is of great significance to develop such ties because China is one of the countries in the world which are playing a decisive role and also a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. He said Hungary was attentively watching China's building up of its legal system and was willing to develop its ties with the country's law departments. Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's Procuratorate, participated in the meeting.
