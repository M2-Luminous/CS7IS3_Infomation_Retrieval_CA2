The admonitions by the CDU chairman to his opponents in the party were clear and unmistakable, Kinkel said on Monday [21 February] after a meeting of the FDP Presidium in Bonn. Kohl has probably laid the foundation for bringing his party out of the current low in the polls. According to Kinkel, the FDP emphatically welcomes the fact that Kohl did not leave any doubt that he wants the coalition of the CDU/Christian Social Union and FDP to succeed. In addition, the foreign minister considered it positive that the chancellor came out against a grand coalition at the federal level. The FDP politician called on the CDU to make a clear commitment to Europe at its party congress. There are some forces in the CDU that want to reinterpret Europe and want Germany to follow a special path. Kinkel said anyone who wants to reduce Germany's share in the process of European unification is cutting off the branch on which he is sitting.
