The United States may gain a little but will suffer greatly by revoking China's MFN status, for it will pay a heavy price. If China and the United States can work together to overcome the difficulty this year, the United States can avoid putting its relations with China on a narrow human rights basis. Only then can Sino-U.S. relations break free of this ludicrous circle and return to the normal path. Target for American Companies' Overseas Expansion The United States currently has a fairly good share of the Chinese market, and the situation is getting better. Here is a breakdown of U.S. exports to China last year: $2 billion worth of aircraft and parts and components; $1 billion worth of computers and electric power generators; and $272 million worth of wheat. Agreed U.S. investment in China in the past year alone amounted to $7 billion, and actual investment to more than $3 billion. Five hundred and fifty U.S. companies have set up branches or offices in China. Most of the FORTUNE 500 firms are viewing China as their strategic target for overseas expansion. U.S Deputy Commerce Secretary Garten also visited China recently to lobby vigorously for $6 billion worth of contracts for U.S. companies. If the United States revokes China's MFN status over human rights issues, it will be tantamount to announcing that it is surrendering China -- a market with enormous commercial potential for U.S. companies -- to Japan and Europe. As long as Sino-U.S. bilateral ties remain healthy and stable, the future China market will become only more attractive to U.S. companies. The National Commission of U.S.-China Trade, a nongovernment organization comprised of some 200 large and medium-sized firms trading with China, forecast that China will require $40-$100 billion worth of electric power generating facilities in the next 25 years, $30 billion worth of communications facilities in the next five years, and $29 billion worth of demand for automobiles in the next three years. 200,000 More People Unemployed If the United States revokes China's MFN status over human rights issues and if China responds with trade retaliations by doubling import duties on imported U.S. goods, U.S. goods will lose their competitiveness in the Chinese market, which in turn will cost 170,000 to 200,000 jobs in the United States. The U.S. market will be deprived of cheap but good China-made goods, and each of the 94 million U.S. families will pay an average of $170 more annually in consumer goods purchases. If Sino-U.S. relations are destabilized, it will be difficult for U.S. businessmen to invest and do business in China. Manufacturers of other countries will have gained a secure footing in the Chinese market by the time the United States wakes up and renews China's MFN status three or five years later. The Clinton administration will not solve any problems by revoking China's MFN status over human rights issues. On the contrary, it will create new problems and troubles. Will U.S. industrial and commercial sectors sit back and watch the Chinese market being taken over by other Western countries? Will the Republican Party, which represents the interests of industrial and commercial sectors, allow the Clinton administration to isolate the United States in the Asia-Pacific region? The Need To Cooperate With China on International Issues For the sake of U.S. security in the Asia-Pacific region, the United States cannot revoke China's MFN status. Revoking China's MFN status will cause Sino-U.S. relations to deteriorate and will obstruct Sino-U.S. cooperation in various areas. From the late 1980's to the early 1990's, a considerable number of Americans thought that with the end of the Cold War, China had ceased to have any strategic value for the United States. Now, however, it seems that China still has strategic value for the United States; moreover, there are needs and bases for cooperation between the two sides on many international issues. The United States may have to double its efforts, though with fewer results, if China's cooperation is not available on some important international issues. If it is seeking China's cooperation on international issues, the United States should not isolate and undermine China. It may be necessary for the United States to maintain some suitably reasonable pressure on China over human rights [dui mei guo lai shuo, dui zhong guo zai ren quan fang mian shi dang bao chi yi xie he li di ya li ye xu shi bi yao di 1417 5019 0948 0171 6141, 1417 0022 0948 0961 0086 2938 2455 7240 6624 3981 0202 2170 0001 0067 0678 3810 4104 1090 0500 0048 6079 2508 1801 6008 4104], but the United States cannot victimize 1.2 billion Chinese for the human rights of a few. An isolated and enraged China is not good for anyone -- the Asian countries, the United States, or China itself. If the United States is wise, it will not revoke China's MFN status over the issue of human rights without finding out the truth.
