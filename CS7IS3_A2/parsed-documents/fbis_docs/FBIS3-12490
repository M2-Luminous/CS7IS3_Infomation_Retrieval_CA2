Repeated violations by both Serb aircraft and helicopters have been taking place since April 1993 when the UN first enforced the ban. NATO showed little inclination and even less resolve to punish the violators. Now that they have done so, one has some ground to conclude that it was due to either a sense of shame or guilt at allowing the Serbs to continue with their massacre of the Muslims, as the world media looked on. Whatever the reason, the NATO action, belated though it has been needs to be commended in the hope that this will not turn out to be just a solo exception to Europe's consistent policy of turning a blind eye to whatever the Serbs were doing in Bosnia. The reason why this reservation has to be articulated is that both the UN and the NATO have by their inaction, through default or design, helped the Serbs, steeped as their hands are in Muslim blood. [sentence as published] The latest manifestation of that is NATO's reluctance to bomb those heavy weapons of the Serbs which have neither been pulled back from around Sarajevo nor handed over to the UN peacekeepers as specifically stipulated in the UN ultimatum. Canadian General Aikman on duty with the UN forces, has revealed to the international press that six Serb tanks deployed round Sarajevo were taken out by the Serbs in clear violation of the terms of the ultimatum. And these are now likely to be used by them on other fronts. No reason has so far been given by the UN for allowing Serbs to continue their bombing of other Muslim enclaves, most notably Tuzla. Tuzla and half a dozen other Muslim enclaves are surrounded by the Serbs with their heavy guns just as Sarajevo was. The UN must now take next logical step and save those cities too -- that is, if it is really interested in restoring its credibility in the international community.
