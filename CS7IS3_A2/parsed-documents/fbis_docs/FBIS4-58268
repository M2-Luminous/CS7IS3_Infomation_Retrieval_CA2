Another report published in a different newspaper talked about the firm resolve of the Indian PM [Prime Minister] Narasimha Rao not to abandon India's nuclear programme. Explaining in detail introduction of various types of missiles into the Indian defence system, Rao took pains to clarify that the Americans were not pressurising Indians to give up trials of `Agni'. While the 1960s witnessed intense discussion revolving about the operationalisation of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) with nuclear warheads, the 80s and 90s have seen the arrival of precision guided missile system capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional warheads. India embarked upon an ambitious programme of missile development and their eventual deployment some 20 years back. In addition to many strategic considerations, slow development of combat aircraft for deep-strike and interdiction contributed enormously to the accelerated pace of missile development programme. The Indian programme is a fairly comprehensive one which includes missiles like Agni (intermediate range ballistic missile), Prithivi (medium range surface to surface missile), Nag (anti-tank missile), Akash and Trishul (surface to air missile). Some reports suggest that both the Indian army and Indian airforce are going to deploy 75 and 25 Prithivi missiles by the middle or this year. Having successfully completed the third launch of Agni, indicating that India has now acquired a capability of delivering one toner [as published] warheads (both nuclear as well as conventional) to a distance over 2000 km, the Indians are now engaged in a fierce debate whether or not to deploy Agni quickly. With the improvised precision guidance system of Indian missiles, one expects that they would soon be employed. Besides, many in India vociferously stress that the fruits of hard work in this area are beginning to pay dividends now, and that Agni should not be abandoned at this point. Why then the capping of the Agni programme? Four factors need to be analysed for an answer. The official reason is of course the problem of finances. This is hard to believe. A country which has been spending over five crores a day to violently suppress the freedom struggle in Kashmir is unlikely to abandon a programme which has placed it in the exclusive club of those in possession of ICBMs. In any case India will deploy Prithivi missile which costs little over three crores each. Why has this plan not been postponed for the same reason? The second factor can be technical problems. But for the successful third launch, one could have accepted this as, at that time, the problem of nose-cone and some complexities of precision guidance system frequently cropped up. Many criticised huge spending on the Agni programme at the time. But now that the Indians have overcome all the technical problems, and to quote the Indian Chief of Army Staff General Joshi, Agni has put India in a `totally different league', the reasoning sounds absurd. The third reason could be that it is meant as a sop to the Americans. It is common knowledge that the US desperately wants to promote nuclear non-proliferation in the region. Both India and Pakistan, Pakistan much more than India, have been feeling the pinch of American pressure. But PM Rao has been denying there was any pressure on India from the US and that even if there was, Delhi would resist it. It is a matter of fact that the Americans have been dealing with Delhi with kid gloves. But they have their concerns. According to an American analyst working for Carnegie Endowment: `If India decides to make Agni operational, it would escalate US fears about an open ended nuclear missiles race in the region'. He further states that the success of Agni has not only rendered the MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] ineffective but seriously jeopardised one of the US key mechanism to control missile proliferation in South Asia. It seems that the government of India withstood all the pressures until Indian scientists had completed the requisite spadework and conveyed the success of Agni to the Indian PM. Cognizant of the American interests in the area, a short term delay in actual deployment can not only effectively ward off the pressure but may also be styled as a friendly gesture to the US to be encashed at a proper time. The final factor is that it is a tactical withdrawal. The Agni missile can be operationalised within two years even if it is frozen at the present level of preparedness. Besides, Agni has already demonstrated India's technological superiority, putting it on hold for the time being will not be a big step backward. Also the US and many other western nations are viewing the Indian economic market favourably. They want to and are investing heavily there. The postponement of the Agni programme is a symbolic gesture to these potential investors and trade partners that India means business.
