Including 27 ministers (compared with 22 in the previous government), 60 percent of them are drawn from the Frobedu [Burundi Democratic Front], the president's party. The remaining 40 percent come from the opposition, principally the Uprona [Unity for National Progress] and a newcomer, the new Liberal Party. This formula had already been adopted by the late President Ndadaye. Jean Ngendanganya, Burundian ambassador in Brussels, welcomed this re-establishment of democratic institutions and appealed to public opinion, friendly governments, and non-governmental organizations to help the new government team to rebuild the country, deeply marked by recent events. "We have 800,000 refugees to be repatriated, and just as many displaced persons who we must help to return to their homes," he stated, adding that -- for greater efficiency -- this government "is mainly composed of technicians. These qualities took precedence in selecting the future ministers, more than their position in the party hierarchy. It is also clear that the services of those who took part in the attacks were not retained."
