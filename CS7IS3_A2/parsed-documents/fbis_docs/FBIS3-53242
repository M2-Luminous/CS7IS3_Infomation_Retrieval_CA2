Meanwhile, reports from Afghanistan say that sporadic clashes have occurred between government forces and the Dostam militia in the northern and southeastern areas of Kabul. It is reported that the Dostam militia's jet planes bombed various places. PPI says that Afghan President Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani has declared that the current war in Afghanistan has entered a decisive stage, which will continue until victory is achieved. Talking by telephone from Kabul to a group of Lahore journalists in Peshawar, Rabbani said that the war is not a war to secure power, but a war between the religious and what he called communist forces. The Afghan president claimed that the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the Dostam militia, and Mojaddedi are aligned with Hekmatyar, while all the other big and small organizations are against them. He said that the current war has been forced on the Afghan Government and is harming the Afghan people.
