Of course, this would be the first NATO mission, if I see things correctly; but I do not think that it will lead to further such missions. [sentence as heard] It is, above all, also a mission that has to be seen separately from the measures that have been planned in and around Sarajevo, and all those -- at least theoretical -- deliberations as to whether what was stated in connection with the NATO Sarajevo ultimatum could also be applied to Tuzla and other comparable areas.
