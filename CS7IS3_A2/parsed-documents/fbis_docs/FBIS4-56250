He said the programs being implemented, among them those of popular participation, capitalization, and education reform, seek to help the poor and to make the changes the country needs. [Begin Antezana recording] The workers must realize that the government understands their situation and that it acts in solidarity with their demands because they are fair demands. However they must also understand, especially the labor leaders, that the real situation of our national economy does not allow us to immediately carry out a salary policy that will create an inflationary spiral. [end recording] Antezana added that the government goals are: to avoid raising fuel prices and to rationalize and streamline the economy. These goals seek to protect the poor by offering them a real sustainable salary increase. The communications secretary added that the national budget is an innovative tool to benefit the needy. [Begin Antezana recording] The national budget allocations are mainly concentrated in social investments. This is a new element that represents a great innovation compared with the system used in the budgets of the past few years. The national budget includes the innovation that this year it incorporates the participation of the people. By doing so, it establishes a discipline for the distribution of income among the provinces. The Popular Participation Law establishes a fair distribution of resources according to the number of inhabitants of certain municipalities, and particularly benefits the provinces. This means the national budget is based on a social principle and goal. The government's overall economic policy also seeks to benefit the low-income sector and all workers. The government asks the Bolivian people for understanding in these difficult moments. The people must understand that this is not a simple provision. [end recording]
