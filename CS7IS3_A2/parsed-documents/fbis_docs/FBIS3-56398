It seems NATO membership of new states could be the most simple and quick solution to the problem, this is naturally their sovereign right. However, swift implementation of this right would result in new barriers in Europe, said the minister. "NATO has listened to us, Central and East European nations, it listened to Russia, Boris Yeltsin who said in Poland it is the right of each state to decide whether or not to join NATO; but there are realities that require a more well-considered approach," he noted. The Brussels decision provides for a long period of partnership which will help concentrate efforts and determine the fate of Europe. The problem has been discussed with the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the Moscow summit. The U.S. and Russian presidents exchanged their opinions on the issue and expressed satisfaction with the program of Partnership for Peace, said Kozyrev. It is too early to say what the period will end with. It may be so that many states, possibly, Russia (it is not excluded) will join NATO. But the period will not obligatory be a preparatory one. Other options are possible as well. Broader security systems may be created and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation may be consolidated. The more so, in the opinion of the Russian side, all areas should be developed parallelly. It is a new quality of partnership and not new membership in NATO that matters. Kozyrev said they should concentrate on partnership, fill it with specific content and see the final result. The most important is stability and cooperation in Europe.
