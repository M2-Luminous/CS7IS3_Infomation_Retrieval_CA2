"North Korea was determined in its plan for military application of nuclear technology, and according to our assessment it was near success," Lt. Gen. Gennadiy Yevstafiyev, director-general of massive destruction weapon control bureau of the external intelligence office, says in an interview with the weekly in Friday's edition. Pyongyang froze its nuclear development program for two reasons, however, because of the international pressure and the recognition that it could no longer afford the enormous financial burden, Yevstafiyev says. As a result, he says, the communist regime may give up its nuclear program altogether and go entirely public on its nuclear sites. The intelligence officer points out that extra care is needed so as not to upset the sensitive political situation of North Korea, which is in the middle of a power transfer. Moscow agrees with international experts on the gravity of the North Korean nuclear problem, he says, adding that Pyongyang's leaders have long sought to manufacture nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and have already succeeded in developing a delivery systems by modifying Scud missiles into the Nodong-1. Yevstafiyev names North Korea the most dangerous country in the world, with the potential to make nuclear weapons. Next on his list are Israel, India and Pakistan. He says Pyongyang is playing a big game with Washington in their "nuclear dialogue" and Moscow has therefore to put its national interests first to guarantee safety in the Far East.
