It is apparent from the poll that, in the wake of the volatility on the political scene in March, the situation has calmed down and that there has been a slight increase in support for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and a slight decline for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. The Democratic Union [DU] has a real chance of getting into parliament. The poll's results in response to the question "Why would you vote?" are interesting. In essence, the replies can be placed into four categories. Support for a party or movement was predominant in the first category; up to one-quarter of the respondents would vote in accordance with this support. The second category is made up of respondents who give priority to asserting group interests. The replies of workers, national economic minorities, believers, and those favoring the Slovak nation were predominant in this category. Those who give priority to the programs of the political parties were ranked in the third category. The last category was made up of respondents who would vote for a personality. They accounted for 12 percent of the respondents. A typical response to the question on why they would not vote was: "No party is worthy of my vote." According to the FOCUS poll, the greatest trust is enjoyed by M. Kovac (22.8 percent), V. Meciar (22.2 percent), J. Moravcik (21.7 percent), and Peter Weiss (14.1 percent). L. Cernak received only 2-percent support. In reply to the question "Who do you consider to be very pleasant?," the respondents said the following: M. Kovac (29.9 percent), J. Moravcik (29.9 percent), I. Gasparovic (23.4 percent), V. Meciar (22.5 percent), and P. Weiss (22.2 percent). In reply to the question "Who do you consider to be unpleasant?," the rankings were as follows: Miklos Duray (64.2 percent), Jan Carnogursky (52.6 percent), and Vojtech Bugar (50 percent). V. Meciar is unpleasant for 41.5 percent of respondents. According to FOCUS, J. Volf (with 6.7 percent) came last in this category. Some 7.1 percent of respondents acknowledged that they were unequivocally left wing, 6.7 percent that they were unequivocally right wing, and 44.1 percent that they were more toward the center. Almost half of the respondents would prefer a "market economy, if the state influences it to a considerable extent." [The same newspaper on the same date on page 1, under the headline "Many Candidates--Few Chosen," carries the following table, based on FOCUS's analysis of replies to the question "Imagine that new parliamentary elections were to be held this weekend.
