The revised cabinet order, however, will call for strict curbs on sensitive technology and equipment exports to North Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq as in the case of the United States and main European states, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] officials said. Curbs on shipments to former communist nations will be eased. The amendment will retain the global export licensing system for the 113 items, covered by the list of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), in preparation for possible regional conflicts, the officials said. They include high-technology computers and machine tools. Under the system, however, applications to export such goods will be basically approved instead of prohibited, in principle. Confirmation of the final destination for shipments of sensitive technology and equipment has so far been mandatory for exporters. Such a requirement will be abolished. However, the export of 20 highly sensitive items like decoders and high-technology machine tools, will continue to be subject to strict global controls, the officials said. Big trading house officials said, however, that the relaxations would not bring about a rapid increase in shipments of ex-Cocom embargo items to former communist states. They said there will be no big demand for such items in such countries.
