The bombs were found near the main dais from where Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was to address the delegates and then remain seated there for some time. Sources said the bombs were made of `sutli' (rope) and some explosive powder. However, these devices were meant to scare the security agencies and drive home the point that the elaborate network was pierced. The bombs did not have any time device or detonator. These devices were found during the security drill two or three hours before the session was to commence. The bomb disposal experts detected the devices near the dais and took them away for analysis. Sources reiterated that the devices were placed by miscreants or terrorists to make their presence felt. They, apparently, did not want to explode bombs there. Intelligence agencies were now making efforts to trace the loophole. They were alarmed about this breach in tight security. A massive security operation was launched three days before the session was to commence. Experts of the National Security Guards (NSG) bomb disposal squad, the Special Protection Group (SPG) were assisting the Delhi Police to ensure security. The main dais was handed over to the SPG 48 hours before the session was to commence. The bombs were found yesterday morning. Two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP), nine Assistant Commissioners (ACP), ten inspectors, 50 sub-inspectors, 130 head constables and 600 constables of the Delhi Police were responsible for the security along with the SPG and other agencies. Separate parking lots were earmarked for the VlPs and only those cars with special parking labels were allowed to enter. Security was tightened around the State guest houses where the VIPs including Chief Ministers were staying. Entry was restricted to the Talkatora Stadium and metal detectors were installed at all the entrances. The hedges and thick foliage around the stadium were trimmed as a precaution and personnel of the para-military forces were stationed there. Trained `spotters' from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Delhi Police and other agencies fanned out in various places of the city to keep tabs on hide-outs of terrorists.
