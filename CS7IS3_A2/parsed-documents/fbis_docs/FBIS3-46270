The purpose of the tax-sharing system is to recover some of the financial power previously delegated to local governments, strengthen the financial power of the central government, rectify the lopsided situation in recent years in which the central government and local governments shared 30 and 70 percent of financial power respectively, and gradually return to the normal 70:30 ratio between central and local financial powers. This is aimed at checking the unhealthy tendency of localities blindly expanding investments, which leads to an overheated economy, strengthening the authority and macroeconomic regulation and control capability of the central government, and ensure the high-speed, stable, and healthy [kuai su wen ding jian kang 1816 6643 4489 1353 0256 1660] development of the national economy. The main contents of tax-sharing system reform are as follows: First, the central government concentrates the necessary financial resources. The financial and tax revenues directly collected by the central government should account for over 60 percent of the country's total financial and tax revenues. Second, taxation is divided into central taxes, local taxes, and taxes shared by the central and local governments. Central taxes include customs duty, consumption tax, central enterprise income tax, product tax, railways, banks, insurance tax, and so on. Local taxes included business tax, local enterprise income tax, personal income tax, agricultural tax, urban construction tax, and so on. Taxes shared by the central and local governments include value-added tax, resources tax (marine resources tax belong totally to the central government), securities transaction tax, unified industrial and commercial tax, and so on. Third, the central and local governments set up taxation organs respectively. Fourth, the central government implements a system of making refunds and shifting payments to local governments. Some of the central financial revenues will be refunded to local governments in the form of allocations lest the local governments will receive less financial revenues than before the reform. Under the financial pattern practiced over the years in the past, which came into being with the implementation of the central policy of "decentralizing power and giving up profits" to local governments and which was called the "contract system under which each unit is responsible for its own surplus or deficit," the country's financial and tax revenues favor the localities. Under such a system, the proportion of the central financial revenues in the GNP has dropped and its macroeconomic regulation and control capability weakened year after year. Statistics show that central financial revenues accounted for well over 30 percent of the GNP in 1978 but dropped to only 14 percent in 1992. Meanwhile, the central financial revenues accounted only for 38 percent of the country's total financial revenues, much lower than the 60-odd percent level in other countries generally. As a result, the central financial deficits are getting more serious while the local finance enjoys an ample surplus, and this has given rise to a situation whereby the central government is poor while the local governments are rich. However, the substitution of the "tax-sharing system" for the "contract system under which each unit is responsible for its own surplus or deficit" is likely to cause some losses to a few coastal provinces and municipalities, where the economy has developed quite rapidly in recent years, and touched off some objections in discussions last year. For this reason, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who took charge of financial and economic work, went to 16 provinces and municipalities including Hainan, Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Tianjin at the head of work teams to discuss with local leaders the interest relationship of the tax-sharing system. It is said that, after careful calculations, some provinces, which previously had entertained serious misgivings, discovered that the effect of the tax-sharing system was not so big after all and, therefore, supported the central policy with pleasure. On the other hand, some interior provinces in western China, such as Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, have heartily welcomed the tax-sharing system, holding that not only will this measure increase the financial resources of the central government but enable the central government to allocate more funds to help the backward regions develop their economy and thus gradually narrow the gap between the interior and the coastal regions. They consider this beneficial to the overall situation. Jin Xin, director of the State Administration of Taxation, said that the "tax-sharing system" would be implemented gradually. He predicted that it would take five or up to the end of this century to attain the target of raising the proportion of the central financial revenues to over 60 percent of the country's total financial revenues.
