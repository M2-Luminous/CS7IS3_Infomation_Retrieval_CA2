Much of the coverage extended to praising the high voter-turnout and the calm atmosphere that marked the voting, and to quotations of preliminary election count results, which placed the Hungarian Socialist Party in first place and the Alliance of Free Democrats in second place. In its commentary headlined "Calmly", NEPSZABADSAG says, "The task today is to look to the future calmly, irrespective of whether one considers what happened to be a sweeping victory, or a defeat. ...The main lesson for those in power, who will most probably be forced to leave after the run-off elections in three weeks, will be that no political force can dismiss dialogue with society. Those at the helm up to now liked to believe they know exactly what the people, and the nation, needs and desires, while humiliating those ruled by them every day." "What people in Hungary want most is dignity; they wish for their ability and performance to be recognized and for their leaders to give a free rein to their creative power. This is where they were disappointed most over the past four years, and this is probably why they voted the way they did." NEPSZABADSAG formulates the following lessons for political forces emerging on top after the elections: "They must reach understanding with the people and with the opposition, while proving themselves prepared and competent to hold the reins of power. They must be aware that their coming to power should mean respect for popular sovereignty." UJ MAGYARORSZAG says, "Four years ago the majority agreed on what they did not want. Now, it seems that while one half of society does not know what they want, the left wing is fairly capitalizing on electors' forgetfulness, nostalgia, desire for revenge, and discontent. Such is democracy, they say. ...It already seems certain that the Socialists have increased chances of forming a government. This -- in view of their promises and past -- holds not much good for the future. Behind the flickering computer screens, a vision is emerging of people queuing in long lines outside banks to take out the currency they saved at the time of the outvoted coalition. This will also be a vote, costing far more than yesterday's."
