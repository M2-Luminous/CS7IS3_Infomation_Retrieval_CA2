He said the government does not have a program and will not be able to overcome the crisis. Yavlinskiy said he has such a program himself, and one of its elements is the establishment of "a real dollar exchange rate." In Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's estimation, the current situation is characterized by the practically complete lack of investments in 1993, the danger of granting preferential loans and budgetary investments in 1994 ("the temptation is very great to become a good and kind government"), the continuing production recession, and by the dollar's exchange rate being held back by the government when prices are rising (in the EPItsentr head's opinion, the real exchange rate is 3,000 rubles to the dollar at present). In Yavlinskiy's opinion, there is "a vast inflationary spring" of unpaid debts to farmers, the VPK [military industrial complex], and budgetary organizations in the economy today (in the view of the EPItsentr, the total indebtedness amounts to 5 percent of GNP). The attempt to resolve the problem of nonpayments by credit methods led to the point that vast amounts of credit funds did not reach the enterprises and "accumulated in commercial banks," which engaged in conversion, as a result of which $20 billion went abroad. A new negative factor has made its appearance--"collectivization of industry," as the result of 40 percent of the property being turned over to labor collectives in the privatization. The government personnel approved by the president's edict yesterday cannot solve Russia's economic problems, in Yavlinskiy's opinion, inasmuch as it is "a typical government of the Silayev type" which has no program ("only Chubays will be working until the last voucher"). "We do not know whether it visualizes the current situation in the economy or not," Yavlinskiy said, noting that the entire concept of government must be changed, transformed from a sectorial concept into one which takes the federal system of Russia into account. In Yavlinskiy's opinion, the scenario for economic development in 1994 under the current government will be as follows: in the first quarter, inflation wil reach 30 percent monthly and the ruble's exchange rate will fall faster than prices rise. A critical point will be in the spring, when the production recession will reach 50 percent of the 1989 level and inflation will increase even further because of the money added in the first quarter; as a result of state purchases and the rise in prices for energy resources, the budget deficit will increase sharply. The summer should be comparatively stable, since "the main recession will be under way already." The EPItsentr manager is very concerned about months in the fall, since "the risk of losing control over inflation, which may exceed 50 percent per month, will increase." Yavlinskiy said he has his own program, which will make it possible to hold inflation at the level of 20 percent monthly. He said increasing the dollar's exchange rate "to the real rate" is a top priority in such a program. In conformity with this program, the government should assume responsibility for the dynamics of the exchange rate--for example, by concluding transactions in futures, compensating for fluctuations in the exchange rate. The government should also reject any forms of preferential credit and subsidization and put an end to trade with import credits in the currency market. Institutional changes in the structure of the economic system and a structural and technological industrial policy are among the program's measures requiring prompt attention.
