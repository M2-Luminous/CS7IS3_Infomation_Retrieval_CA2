Kim, chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, will be accompanied at the June 28 meeting by An Pyong-su, vice-chairman of the committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun, chief councillor of the DPRK Administration Council (cabinet). Details of the delegation membership were given to South Korean Premier Yi Yong-tok by the DPRK Prime Minister Kang Song-san today. The meeting was proposed by Kang on June 20 as a means of organizing detailed arrangements for a North-South summit. The DPRK accepted the proposal two days later. Meanwhile, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said the outstanding questions between the DPRK and the U.S., including the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and other issues, could be resolved in a package deal at the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks. Officials from the two countries will meet in Geneva in the first week of July for talks over a wide range of political and economic issues. However, the spokesman also criticized Japan and South Korea following their public outcry calling for a "special inspection" of the DPRK's military facilities.
