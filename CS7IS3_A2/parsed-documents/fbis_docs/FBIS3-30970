FBIS3-30970 "dreeu030_p_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 POLAND SLD, PSL Suggest Monetary Policy to NBP WS1102135494 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 11 Feb 94 pp 1, 7 WS1102135494 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Language: Polish Article Type:BFN [Article by Renata Wisniewska: "Central Bank or Office?; Experts for the PSL and the SLD Suggest A Different Monetary Policy"] [Text] On Tuesday, 8 February, experts for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] presented the management of the Polish National Bank [NBP] with a draft of the principles of monetary policies for 1994. According to those principles, the main goals of monetary policies are: lowering the inflation rate by the end of 1994 to the level of 23 percent (in relation to December) and to the level of 27 percent (in relation to midyear), increasing the growth rate in the economy, limiting the unemployment rate, and developing exports. The document conflicts in a fundamental way with a draft of principles presented to the Sejm by the NBP. The planned goals listed in the document prepared by the experts for the SLD and the PSL are supposed to be implemented, among other things, through a "real increase in money supply to economic units and to households, at least up to the level of the planned increase in the GDP--that is, up to the level of 169 trillion zlotys [Z]," (the NBP suggests Z155 trillion), "through an appropriate shaping of the interest rates with regard to bank deposits and credits in relation to the inflation rate," "through a flexible shaping of policies on foreign currency rates, which would take into account the inflation rate," and through an increase in the trend to save. The experts think that the state budget's debt due to financing the budget deficit cannot exceed Z35 trillion. It will be implemented by purchasing Treasury notes from the Finance Ministry. To implement the government proexport policies, the NBP is supposed to increase its contribution to the Corporation for Insurance of Export Credits [KUKE] up to the 25-percent level. In addition, the NBP is supposed to devote part of its foreign currency reserves for the purpose of financing modernization investments in small and medium-size companies. The coalition experts also write that the central bank will undertake necessary measures aimed at bringing banks back to health, among other things by devoting for that purpose the amount of Z3 trillion; by decreasing obligatory reserves; by purchasing shares, long-term bonds, and bills of exchange; by providing guarantees for deposits; and by refinancing credits. The draft also envisages an increase of the trend to save in zlotys, through the NBP's introduction of the burden of obligatory reserves on foreign-currency deposits. The experts assume that commercial banks will be able to get loans from the NBP mainly in the form of rediscounting credits and pawn credits. The banks' debts incurred in this way would be controlled by the NBP, depending on the monetary situation in the country. The draft also envisages the NBP's cooperation with the government while establishing a system of lessening the debt burden of economic enterprises. This applies to those companies that are profitable in terms of their productivity. The NBP is supposed to undertake measures for improving the earnings situation and for a restructuring of the companies' indebtedness. RZECZPOSPOLITA has asked Witold Kozinski (first deputy of the NBP's chairperson) to comment on the proposal submitted by the SLD and PSL experts. According to him, an agreement on increasing the money supply in 1994 and on the NBP's contribution in financing the budget deficit will not be reached at this stage of the talks. W. Kozinski said that an increase in the money supply of Z155 trillion is very large anyway. The Sejm will be an umpire on this issue. If the Sejm adopts an increase in the money supply to Z169 trillion, it will have to bear the responsibility for price increases," Witold Kozinski said [no opening quotes as published]. According to the first deputy of the NBP's chairperson, the draft has many drawbacks. For instance, the NBP's management has already made a decision on increasing its contribution in the capital of KUKE; it also made an appropriate decision on introducing obligatory reserves in foreign-currency accounts. An ordinance on this issue by the NBP's chairperson has been in effect since 31 January of this year. According to the provisions now in effect, the NBP cannot devote part of the foreign-currency reserves to finance modernization investments. It could do this only by borrowing the necessary means on the market. In W. Kozinski's view, there is also a contradiction with regard to basic credits. He stressed that the main goal of the NBP's monetary policies is to lower the inflation rate by the end of 1994 to the level of 23 percent, on the basis of the period from December 1993 to December 1993 [as published], as well as the kind of cooperation in implementing economic policies that would make this goal realistic. Going over the planned increase in money supply to the level above Z155 trillion could take place, assuming the inflation figures will be implemented successfully. According to W. Kozinski, if the practical rate of price increases does not exceed 23 percent on a yearly basis, the NBP will not oppose increasing the money supply to over Z155 trillion, but decisions on this issue should not be made earlier than in the second half of the year.
