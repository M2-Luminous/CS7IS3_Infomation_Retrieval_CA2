FBIS3-31499 "dreeu034__a94020" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Hungary Minister Views 1993 Export-Import Performance AU1702143894 Budapest MTI in English 1159 GMT 17 Feb 94 AU1702143894 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 17 February (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's exports amounted to $8.907 billion last year, down 16.8 percent on 1992, the Minister of International Economic Relations, Bela Kadar, told the press on Thursday [17 February]. Imports totalled $12.530 billion, but this sum includes $713 million worth of MiG fighter planes given by Russia to Hungary in partial repayment of trade debts accumulated in rubles before the dissolution of COMECON. When the fighter planes are deducted, imports total $11.817 billion, 6.8 percent up on the previous year. Government moves made last September to boost exports and improve the trade balance resulted in a tangible rise in exports in the fourth quarter of last year. While the monthly average of exports in the first nine months was $716 million, it rose to $820 million for the last three months of the year and to $866 million in December. Customs statistics showed a trade deficit of $3.623 billion for last year, including the import of the MiG fighters. The trade deficit amounted to $2.910 billion, not including the import of MiG fighters, and to $2.280 billion when other import items which do not appear in the current account were deducted. Exports of agricultural goods and food products fell by 26.6 percent, while exports of consumer goods fell by 20 percent. The export of products manufactured on commission fell $758 million, exports of grain were down $384 million, and food exports were $246 million less than in 1992. The latter three items made up 77 percent of the decrease in exports last year. Ninety percent of the decrease in exports was in sales to industrialized countries. Western Europe continued to suffer from the recession, with 64 to 65 percent of Hungary's exports going to countries like Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and the Benelux countries. The currencies of all of these countries depreciated against the U.S. dollar last year. Hungary's exports decreased by about 10 percent in volume terms when adjustments were made in connection with the appreciation of the dollar, Kadar said. Exports to former socialist countries made up 26 percent of total exports last year, while imports from these countries made up 29 percent of the total. Exports to the United States rose by 9 percent, exports to Poland were up 12 percent, exports to Slovenia were up 30 percent, and exports to the Czech Republic and Slovakia were each up 2 percent. Figures for trade with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in the second half of 1993 had already begun to show the effect of the free trade agreement signed early last year which abolished customs duties and import quotas for 50 percent of industrial goods. Imports of consumer goods from the former socialist countries rose by 59 percent within an overall increase of 7 percent. This compares to a 2 percent rise in imports of consumer goods from industrialized countries. Agricultural exports fell by $700 million compared to the previous year, while imports rose by $100 million. Half the increase was accounted for by products which were not in direct competition with Hungarian produce, such as tropical and citrus fruit. Exports of machinery fell by 3 percent, while imports rose by 15.1 percent, excluding the MiG-fighter planes but including $150 million worth of Boeing aircraft bought by the Hungarian airline, MALEV. The decline in the import of investment goods ceased, Kadar said.
