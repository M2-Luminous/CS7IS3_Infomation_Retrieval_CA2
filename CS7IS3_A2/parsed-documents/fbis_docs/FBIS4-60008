A very big column of all types of armoured vehicles had covered the area and al-'Aziz street in order to prevent the holding of the annual disavowal of polytheists rally by Iranian and other pilgrims. Over the past week Saudi police had harrassed the pilgrims and visitors to the HQ. The besiege was severely condemned by Iranian and other pilgrims, and the Saudi measure has given rise to widespread reaction. On Monday night, the leader of the Iranian pilgrims, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri announced the cancellation of the rally, in order not to give an excuse to the Saudi police to once again desecrate the sanctity of the most inviolable sanctuary the Holy Ka'ba.
