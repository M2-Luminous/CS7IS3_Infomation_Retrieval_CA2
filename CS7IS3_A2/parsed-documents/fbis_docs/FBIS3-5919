"We are very happy," said Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before departure. Rangsi accompanied co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to a meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia on Thursday and Friday. "Before we came we were a little bit anxious because we know that donor countries face many requests from many other countries in many parts of the world," he said. "We were a little bit afraid that people may forget Cambodia. But finally we have noticed that there is still a strong concern about Cambodia and that the world community realizes that without development all the achievements in peace can be jeopardized," he said. The 773 million dollars pledged will go toward reconstruction costs over a two-year period. The meeting, chaired by Japan, was attended by delegates from 32 countries, the European Union and 12 international organizations.
