He remarked that there are currently 42 strategic missile planes, of which 19 are TU-160 and 23 TU-95-MS. According to him, the stumbling block is the astronomical sum demanded by Ukraine for transferring the bombers. Ukraine wants 700 billion rubles of its debt to Russia deducted for its delivering the planes. According to Russia, this sum amounts to about 200 billion rubles.
