If this divine injunction was being properly implemented today, the Serbs would not have been able to slaughter the people of Gorazde on the eve of the Hajj ceremonies without any fear and without paying any attention to this great Islamic gathering at Hajj. The president confirmed: The issue of Hajj and the expression of disavowal of infidels should not become a source of disunity among the Muslims. We believe in and stress the issue of carrying out the injunction of disavowal in the same way that we regard the unity and cohesion of the Muslims of the world as necessary and essential. These two important issues are complimentary. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: In view of the critical condition of the world and numerous difficulties today, Muslims should defend the rights of the Islamic nations in a united manner by making use of common means. Hajj ceremonies being performed next to the house of God provide the best opportunity for achieving this unity. Referring to the obstacles that Saudi officials are creating regarding the number of Iranian pilgrims sent to this year's Hajj ceremonies, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We hope that God will enable them to make appropriate decisions at the very last hours regarding the quantity and quality of the Hajj ceremonies, so that they may satisfy our people and other Islamic nations. Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed out: We will not do anything contrary to the interests and security of Saudi Arabia. The holding of the disavowal ceremonies will not be harmful to anyone except the infidels and the enemies of Islam. As we raise this issue, we wish for the well-being of the nation of Saudi Arabia and its government. As far as the Islamic Republic of Iran is concerned, there is no difference between the nation of Saudi Arabia and its government and the wronged people of other Islamic countries. Referring to today's remarks by the esteemed leader [Khamene'i] and the guidelines of the late imam [Khomeyni] regarding the philosophy behind Hajj ceremonies, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: With regard to the guidelines and instructions of the esteemed leader of the Islamic Revolution [Khamene'i]--which we had also repeatedly heard from the tongue of his eminence the imam--may God's blessings be upon him, our people know their duties and, as in the past, they will act according to their divine responsibilities. The president expressed his hope that the leaders of the Islamic countries--realizing the true nature of Hajj and by making plans and coordinating their activities and adopting an appropriate procedure during the great annual Hajj ceremonies--will make proper use of the great Hajj gathering to solve the problems of the world of Islam.
