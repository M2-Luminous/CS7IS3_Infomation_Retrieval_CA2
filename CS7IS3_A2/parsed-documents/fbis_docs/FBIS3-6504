They opposed the loading of nuclear fuel in and operation of the No. 3 atomic power reactor in Yonggwang. In the demonstration staged under the leadership of the Council for Expulsion of the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Station (Chairman: Father Pak Chae-wan), they held that "there are safety problems in the operation of the No. 3 reactor--a Korean-type model without any operational experience"--and demanded the suspension of "the operation of the No. 3 reactor, which places the lives of Yonggwang County residents under liability." They also demanded that details of the accident that occurred at the nuclear power station and truth of injuries of workers on the spot be disclosed. Prior to this, on the afternoon of 14 March, they held an antinuclear seminar in the Wonbul Buddhist temple in Yongsan, Paeksu-up, Yonggwang County, and resolved to rise in a pan-national antinuclear movement. At about 1030 [0100 GMT] that morning, they held an event to "declare a pan-national antinuclear movement to check the loading of nuclear fuel at the No.3 reactor of the atomic power station" at the Wonbul Buddhist temple in Yonggwang. Following the event, they staged a street demonstration. No. 3 Yonggwang Reactor The No. 3 reactor at the Yonggwang nuclear power station is the first in domestic production, responsible for 95 percent of the domestic manufacturing rate. Construction of this reactor, which has 1 million kilowatt power generation capacity, began in July 1989, and it is now undergoing a trial operation with the goal of beginning operation in March 1995. Unlike other reactors, the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is being built by domestic enterprises. The main design was by Korea Electric Technological Corporation; manufacturing was by Korea Heavy Industry Complex; engineering by Hyundai Construction Company, and the reactor type was designed by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute. CE Company [as published] of the United States and other firms are participating as subcontractors. Ordinary-temperature water-pressure tests for the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor were completed in December last year, and a high-temperature function test is to be conducted soon. After completing this test, nuclear fuel will actually be loaded in this reactor in August, and a final test will be conducted after this. Although the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is called a domestic product, the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and provisions applied to other atomic power stations at home have been applied to this reactor, and a safety evaluation work has also been carried out by a team of IAEA experts.
