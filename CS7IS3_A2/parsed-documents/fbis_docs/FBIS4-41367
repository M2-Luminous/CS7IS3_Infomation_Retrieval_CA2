He said so at a news conference today. The Supreme Council head said that Ukraine's agreements with the CIS countries ought to be deepened because they are not working at the moment and no one is trying to make them work. He said he was concerned with the fact that the world community was attempting to turn Ukraine into an appendage supplying raw resources, and spoke in favor of setting up and developing self-contained production cycles in the state, which would meet Ukraine's demand for the main types of industrial products.
