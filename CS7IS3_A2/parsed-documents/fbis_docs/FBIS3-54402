Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--Jordan and Iraq have agreed to study possibilities of building an oil pipeline to link Iraq with the port of al-'Aqabah after International sanctions on Iraq are lifted, an official statement said Tuesday [25 January]. The statement, issued by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Walid 'Asfur to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, PETRA, said the agreement to conduct a feasibility study for the project was part of an accord Mr. 'Asfur and his Iraqi counterpart Safa' Hadi Jawad signed in Baghdad earlier this week. The statement did not give details of the project except that the agreement also include building a refinery at al-'Aqabah based on studies on Jordan's consumption beyond the year 2010. In the meantime, Iraqi supplied oil in excess of Jordanian consumption would be exported. PETRA quoted Dr. 'Asfur as saying that the project aimed at securing Iraqi oil supplies in a "quicker and safer manner once the sanctions are lifted." The findings of the feasibility study will be submitted to the government of the two countries for approval, he said. During his visit to Baghdad, Dr. 'Asfur also held talks with other senior Iraqi officials and attended a meeting with the energy ministers of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey on linking the power grids of the five countries in a regional network. The agreement signed in Baghdad by Dr. 'Asfur and Mr. Jawad also renewed an arrangement under which Jordan will buy four million tonnes of crude and fuel oil from Iraq during the year 1994. This would roughly mean a daily supply of 50,000 barrels of crude oil and 25,000 barrels of fuel oil--Jordan's full needs of imported energy. According to industry sources, part of the oil will be supplied free of cost and the rest at market prices. The Iraqi oil supply to Jordan is exempt from the sweeping international sanctions imposed against Iraq following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Dr. 'Asfur also discussed with the Iraqi officials possibilities of exchange of expertise in oil and mineral exploration in cooperation with Jordan's natural resources authority and conducting studies on the al-Rishah gas fields near the Jordanian-Iraqi border. The al-'Aqabah pipeline project appears to be a dusted-off version of a plan Jordan and Iraq abandoned in the mid-80s after Israel refused to provide an international undertaking not to attack the installations. The Israel refusal, which was demanded by both Jordan and Iraq, [as published] prompted the U.S. Eximbank to refuse a $550 million loan for the project, which at that time was estimated to cost $1 billion. The project was considered at the height of Iraqi oil exports through al-'Aqabah when part of the Iraqi oil exporting facilities were crippled during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. It envisaged laying a 1,000-kilometre long pipeline of 75- centimetre diameter from the H-3 pumping station in Iraqi territory near the border and down south through the desert to al-'Aqabah. The H-3 station was part of a pre-1948 pipeline that pumped Iraqi oil across Jordan to the Mediterranean port of Haifa in British Palestine. According to industry sources, the Iraqi part of the pipeline remains largely intact. Parts of the line in Jordanian territory near al-Mafraq have been destroyed. Another project under consideration in the late 80s was taping an Iraqi pipeline with the Saudi oil port of Yanbu at midway and building a link with al-'Aqabah. This project envisaged the linkage in Saudi territory near the border with Jordan in the south and would have substantially reduced the cost when compared with the earlier proposal. Officials said the project, which at one point appeared to have been all but finalised, was no longer under consideration.
