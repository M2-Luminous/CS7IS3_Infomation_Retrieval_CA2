Foreign correspondents reported on 10 May that the atmosphere in Sanaa was extremely tense. They noticed military patrols in the streets of Sanaa investigating citizens to establish their identities. Other reports from Sanaa indicate splits in the military leadership as a result of the battles currently being fought in the country, while many military leaders were dominated by restlessness when the promise made by the president that the fighting would end within three days proved to be wrong. Military sources in Sanaa have referred to the recent irregular military appointments made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, such as that of 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi as defense minister. This angered the president's paternal cousin, Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, who regards himself as the de facto commander of the Army and feels that he enjoys the confidence of the family, while there are yet others regarded by the military command as being more competent and more closely connected with the family.
