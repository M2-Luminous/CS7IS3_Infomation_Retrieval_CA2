President Tudjman stressed Ukraine's considerable contribution to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the UN Protected Areas, particularly with help from the Ukrainian battalion serving with the UNPROFOR. Successful cooperation with the UN and the CSCE, as well as Ukraine's support -- on the diplomatic field -- for efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of the situation in former Yugoslavia, were said to be of particular importance for both countries. Both sides reached the conclusion that all the prerequisites exist for a successful development of political, economic, cultural, sporting, and other relations.
