Here are their answers: The National Party Keeps Its Promises [NP leader F.W. de Klerk] This week heralds the beginning of a new life for all South Africans. The quality of that life will depend on how you vote -- that is the heartbeat of democracy. Before you vote I want to share a few ideas with you: I have had the honor of serving as state president for the past five years. As the leader of the National Party I have promised to lead our nation into a new period of freedom. I have kept that promise. I have promised to end apartheid, and I have. I have promised to release Nelson Mandela and to unban political parties, and I have done that. I have promised to hold free elections in which all people would be allowed to vote. I have kept that promise. I have promised to lay down the basis for justice. That has been done. I have kept all my promises. After the election we will have a government of national unity. This means that the most important political parties will share power. It is in the best interest of the country that the National Party leads that government. If we can get the majority of your votes then I can continue my work for a prosperous and peaceful South Africa. It is not just enough to have free and fair elections. The elected government should act in the best interest of the people: - We must create job opportunities so that all our people can support their families and can be independent of the state. - We must build houses so that all our people can be accommodated. - We must ensure that effective standards of education and health care is available to all. - To achieve all these things we have to manage the economy in such a way that businesses, large and small, can flourish. - Above all we must have respect for law and order so that violence, crime, and intimidation, can be wiped out from society. - We must replace racial tension with harmony. We must replace hate with goodwill. We must promote strong family values. In this way this huge nation of ours -- all its people -- will remain the richest nation in Africa and occupy a front seat in the league of nations. The National Party stands for the same plan which has ensured the prosperity of several nations throughout the world. The ANC would like to do all these things, but can they? They do not have any experience in government. They make promises they cannot keep. They are in alliance with communists (SACP) [South African Communist Party) who have totally unacceptable ideas on how to manage the economy. Their plans will ensure the collapse of the economy. They were involved in violence far too often to be trusted to end it. The only safe option for you -- those desiring peace, reconciliation, and a prosperous future -- is to vote for the National Party. With your help I promise that we will build a great new South Africa. And as you know, the National Party keeps its promises. The ANC Has a Plan for South Africa [ANC leader Nelson Mandela] South Africa is in a mess as a result of the National Party's policy of apartheid. Nearly 50 percent of all South Africans are unemployed, there is a shortage of at least 6.5 million homes, and three times more money is spent on educating white children, compared to that spent on black children. South Africa is being torn apart by violence and crime, directly linked to unemployment and the fact that many people are hungry. The only way to address these problems is to give our people hope and to ensure that they will have a better life after 27 April. This cannot be done with vague promises and by spending most of the time attacking other parties, like the National Party and Democratic Party are doing, without a plan on how to save South Africa from the present decline. The ANC has a plan: - We have a plan to create 1.5 million job opportunities within the next five years through a public works program, similar to the "New Deal" [preceding two words in English] so successfully applied by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S. after the Great Depression. Such a public works program will be labor-intensive and will help to build houses and roads, and will provide electricity and running water in townships [preceding word in English], denied to the people for years. - We will support small business development and also create new job opportunities. - The apartheid system of education will be rationalized and one National Department of Education will be created in order to effectively use funds to ensure 10 years of free education for every child. These are just a few of the concrete plans we have to ensure a better life for all in our country. No other party has such an extensive plan. Our children and grandchildren should never experience the violence and suffering, the injustice and pain, that we have experienced. They should enjoy their childhood and should feel safe with their families. They should be raised with equal opportunities so that they can explore all opportunities. I call on all South Africans to build on reconciliation, peace, and a better life for all. Now is the time. Vote ANC. Self-determination can lead to a better life for all [Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi] In spite of their differences, I beleive that Zulus and Afrikaners have one thing in common -- a fundamental belief in the principle and practise of self-determination. Self-determination does not lie at the root of conflict and of competition, but it is a complementary factor and could lead to a better life for us all. Because we blacks comprise the majority of the country's population, self- determination will guarantee for us all freedom from domination. I say this without rancor or reproof, but if we want to be fair toward one another, and if we really wish to find one another, we must accept that we suffered terribly under the Afrikaners. They misused their power to dominate others mercilessly. We, the blacks, are now on the threshold of becoming the 'dominant' group in the country. But I cannot emphasize enough that we are a people with a long history of accomodating other people -- a history of cooperation and coexistence. We are people whose commitment to reconciliation knows no bounds. We can not forget, but we can always forgive. It is for this reason that I can state with absolute certainty that we are prepared to promise, indeed, guarantee, that we have no desire whatsoever to dominate any other group, and specifically not the Afrikaner. Despite the horrors of our tragic past, now is the time to look forward to a brighter common future, as brothers and sisters. It may be that the Afrikaner dominated us, but they were also dominated by others, and that is what gave rise to Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid. We will not repeat that mistake. Support the FF [Freedom Front] for a homeland [Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen] The Freedom Front is not ashamed to say we are a Christian party working for the maintenance of Christian values and the survival of the Afrikaner in South Africa. Many Christians in this country are concerned about the strong influence being exercised by the communists within the ANC. A vote for the FF will give us the opportunity to unashamedly testify to our Christianity in the highest assemblies of the land. This does not mean we are giving recognition to a communist constitution, but rather it offers us the chance to fight communism and this imperfect constitution in the political arena. The argument is used that one should rather vote for the National Party to vote against the ANC. That is totally wrong, and does not take into account the new system of proportional representation. Under the new electoral system the results are calculated in percentages. So it could happen that in the Cape the ANC might get 40 percent, the FF 30 percent, and the NP or the Inkatha Freedom Party 30 percent. Should the anti-ANC parties then agree on certain issues, they would together have 60 percent and they, not the ANC, would govern the region. So no vote is lost, as was the case in the old system. The FF stands for the same freedoms as the NP, but offers you self-determination as a further assurance for the future. If the NP leaders are unable to keep a check on the ANC as a government, how are they going to do so as an opposition? The ANC dominated the NP in the negotiations, and used them to get rid of opponents such as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. Venda and Transkei are not troubled because they support the ANC. Self-determination as a modern concept must form part of any future solution in South Africa. There are those for whom this is not important. The 34th principle in the constitution makes self-determination for our people and for other communities possible. The proviso is that there must be sufficient support within that community for self-determination. Without self-determination for those peoples who desire it, we will have no peace, but will simply become another African state with a strong, dictatorial central government. Prevent that by voting for the FF. That will also make it possible for us to establish a homeland council. According to Article 184 of the constitution, this homeland council will be established after the election. That will become the most important instrument for constitutionally making a homeland possible in the new constitution. The DP Promises Human Rights and Democracy [Democratic Party leader Zach de Beer] The election campaign is now nearing an end, and the Democratic Party [DP], after a difficult beginning, is doing better and better. There are several reasons for this. --- Human rights: There are fears that the human rights which were so trampled upon during the years of NP rule will again be in danger under a future government which wants to hold too much power. Just as the NP was a party of and for whites, so too an ANC government may feel that its first duty is to see to its 'own people', and that causes concern among South Africans about their personal rights. The DP and its predecessors have shown for 35 years that they can be trusted with the rights of the indivudual. In contrast to other parties, the DP has never been identified with any particular ethnic group, and offers a place to every South African as an individual. We want to protect the citizen against the misuse of power. Economic management: The NP government intervened in the economy on a large scale by, for instance, setting prices and interest rates and by trying to manage the flow of labor. That led to disastrous deterioration. The ANC, given its strong ties with communism, will also be under pressure to apply central planning methods. That, as current history has shown, never succeeds. What does succeed is liberal democracy and free enterprise--as has always been propagated by the DP. And people are increasingly realizing this. Prevent one-party domination: Opinion polls have indicated that the ANC could achieve a two-thirds majority, which would mean that to a large degree it would draw up the constitution according to its will. That would be dangerous, and we must prevent them from getting that kind of majority. The DP, which has opposed apartheid for all these years, is a party which can effectively compete with the ANC, as shown by Prof. Maki Mandela who decided that she could not vote ANC and chose the DP as her alternative. Peace: Among the important parties, the DP is the one which has never been accused of being in any way involved in violence -- except as a victim. Our hands are clean, and people know it. So peace, which leads to stability and investment; democratic values which create confidence; and lively political debate. Liberal democracy with free enterprise. That is why the DP deserves support.
