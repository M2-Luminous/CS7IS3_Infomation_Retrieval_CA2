Chinese sources said as the health of the senior leader deteriorated, contenders for power in the post-Deng China were trying to accumulate political capital by claiming to have his blessings. The sources said Mr. Deng was no longer fit to pay close attention to national policy. Before delivering his Government Work Report to the National People's Congress yesterday, however, Premier Li Peng hinted that his report had lived up to the expectations of the 89-year-old patriarch. "Comrade Deng has all along provided guidance to the report," Mr. Li reportedly told the legislators. "He has shown concern for the fact that the contents of the report should highlight the themes of reform, development and stability and that it (the report) must be practical." Analysts said, however, that Mr. Li's report had omitted the bulk of the remarks that Mr. Deng had made in Shanghai before Lunar New Year about "fast-paced reform and development". They said the premier had invoked Mr. Deng's name solely to boost his own authority. Informed sources said members of the Deng family had agreed to use Mr. Deng's name and authority to buttress the power base of the patriarch's proteges. For example, while touring Japan earlier this week, Deng Rong, Mr. Deng's daughter and private secretary, told journalists that the senior leader had entrusted major national affairs to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li and Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. This is despite the fact that on private occasions, Mr. Deng had expressed reservations about the commitment of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li to his reforms. At the same time, members of the Chinese Communist Party's conservative faction have revived those of Mr. Deng's old speeches that advocate iron-clad control in the ideology and media fields. In a recent speech on stopping the "infiltration of corrupt ideas and culture from outside of China", the Minister of Radio, Film and Television, Ai Zhisheng, quoted a maxim of Mr. Deng on fighting "bourgeois liberalisation". In a dispatch last night, the semi-official Hong Kong China News Service [press agency name as published] quoted Mr. Ai as citing this Deng dictum: "While resolutely implementing the open door policy, we must be cool-headed and insist on sabotaging the infiltration of decadent ideas from abroad. We must never allow the inundation of a bourgeois-liberal lifestyle in our country." In their public speeches, however, conservatives like Mr. Ai have omitted Mr. Deng's more liberal views on ideology and propaganda. Western diplomats said as Mr. Deng's health deteriorated, there was a possibility he would be "controlled" by family members and confidants who were in a position to attribute policies and instructions to the patriarch.
