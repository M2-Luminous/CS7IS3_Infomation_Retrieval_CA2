The year 1993 really was not one of stabilization. There are many reasons for this. The absence of a broad segment of property owners in the country had its effect. Another factor was the extremely low level of enterprise investment activity caused by the high inflation. Producers found it impossible to recover from the collapse of trade with the CIS countries. As a result, the production of products of industry and agriculture in 1993 amounted to only 84 percent and 94 percent of the preceding year's, respectively. The volume of cargo shipments dropped by almost 30 percent. Consumer prices rose more than 10-fold and retail commodity turnover decreased by 6 percent. Still, these indicators are better than the ones for 1992. In terms of the absolute majority of parameters the recession is slowing, and the rates of inflation have decreased by more than half. Prognosticatory indicators of the development of the economy in 1994 obtained by the government of the Russian Federation show that stronger tendencies toward stabilization have been observed. According to predictions, in 1994 inflation rates will drop by half, the decline in the volumes of industrial production will be only 6 percent, with more than twofold--in light industry, the volume of investments will stabilize, and the federal budget deficit will not exceed 6 percent of the gross domestic product. Thus the new type of economy that has developed during the years of reform is beginning to settle into a stable operating routine, although still with certain interruptions. Primary transformations have been carried out, which have made it possible to create the foundations of a market economy to replace the administrative-command system. But the modern Russian market is still imperfect in many ways. On the one hand, the roots of the administrative system have remained--there is an extremely strong dependence of enterprises and entrepreneurs on decisions of bureaucrats. On the other hand, many of the worst features of a market environment are appearing. These include, above all, the lack of real legal protection for citizens and enterprises and the lack of responsibility on the part of participants in economic activity to their partners, consumers, and the state. Today, now that the primary reforms have basically been completed, it is necessary to earmark new points of reference for work for the restoration and development of the Russian economy in the immediate future. Putting Economic Legislation in Order One of the major priorities, in whose realization the Federal Assembly will play a special role, is to eliminate the chaos in economic legislation and the practice of its application, which plays a large negative role in the development of the crisis. The lack of the necessary laws, disparate and contradictory acts, and constant revisions of previously adopted decisions make it impossible for industrialists and entrepreneurs to work normally. The practice of adopting special decisions regarding individual branches and enterprises is having an extremely negative effect. It violates the unity of the economic mechanism, gives rise to bureaucratic omnipotence and corruption, and perverts the motivation for the operation of the enterprises (not work but consumer demand and "pushing through" advantageous administrative decisions become the main focus). Finally, there is no real responsibility on the part of the enterprises to their partners, clients, and the state. It is necessary to create an effective and rapidly functioning mechanism for judicial resolution of economic disputes and, the main thing, provide for implementation of decisions that are made. The essential needs of a rapidly changing economy require continuous improvement of economic legislation. But it is necessary to achieve good structure and eliminate contradictoriness of the legislative system and to get away from the chaos in the adoption of normative acts. The following should be included among the legislative acts subject to adoption in the near future: --A new civil code. --On the state budget of the Russian Federation for 1994. --On the interaction of the budgets of various levels. --On a change in the country's tax system. --On a three-year moratorium on making changes to economic and legal legislation. --On mechanisms and guarantees of repatriation of the profit of foreign investors. --On mandatory auctions when the state grants export licenses, rights to work deposits of minerals, rights to fulfill certain state orders and functions, and other property rights. --On concessions and other kinds of leasing of state land and mineral and other resources. --On state credits (privatization, investment, tax, etc.). --On economic legal proceedings. It is necessary to draw up and approve a strict schedule for the adoption of these laws. Delays are inadmissible--the president may wait, but the economy will not wait. The new Civil Code along with the Constitution of Russia that was adopted should be a reliable guarantee of the rights of Russian citizens in all areas, including economic. It is on the basis of these documents that the rest of the areas of legislation should be built. Democratization of economic legislation will be an essential task. This does not mean to produce more and more restrictions on the activity of industrialists and entrepreneurs but, on the contrary, to direct all innovations in economic legislation toward easing the tax and administrative burden of the commodity producers. After changing the tax system it will be necessary to introduce a moratorium (say, for three years) on new taxes and increased rates of taxes and deductions currently in effect. Everyone stands to gain from the introduction of such a moratorium. A new source of stability will appear in the country--and, consequently, more of the enterprise's attention will be devoted to questions of development and not immediate survival. Additionally, it will be possible to reveal the weaknesses of the tax system with greater precision after three years. It is necessary to increase the effectiveness of laws and devote more attention to responsibility for their execution. Democracy turns into chaos if the popular saying "the law is a drive shaft: whichever way you turn it, it will go," remains in effect. All we have to do is change the laws to accommodate immediate interests or interpret them at our own discretion to suit political ambitions--and instability in society will immediately increase and tension will grow. Relations Between the Center and the Regions The provisions of the Federation Treaty on delimitation of authority have still not been fully realized. "Work with the territories" frequently becomes a tug-of-war. The new Constitution clearly defined the functions of the Center and the regions. In order for these provisions not to remain merely on paper it is necessary to organize the process for transferring to components of the Federation functions that are not assigned to the Federation and resources for fulfilling them. The constant conflicts because of transferring taxes to the Center and funds from the federal budget to the regions are inadmissible. It is necessary to completely separate the tax systems of the Federation and its components, granting the regions the necessary financial resources and tax authority. It is necessary to combine independence of the components of the Federation and normal functioning of the vertical executive structure in performing functions of federal power. To do this, local organs of federal departments should be created in the regions. Their functions should be limited to the ones assigned in the Constitution to the Federation, precluding intervention in the authority of its components. The Constitution has strengthened the equality of the components of the Federation, which means that there should be a standard approach when granting them subsidies, benefits, etc. and standard criteria for adopting these decisions (level of employment, average per capita income, etc.). The Constitution and the federal laws must be regarded as the minimum of rights guaranteed to citizens and enterprises throughout the entire territory of Russia. Components of the Federation may use their own resources to expand these rights without restriction, but in no case may they restrict civil liberties, social guarantees, or the possibilities of conducting entrepreneurial activity. Support for Russian Industry The need for financial support for domestic industry is obvious and nobody questions it. Throughout the entire transition period, state intervention in the economy and financial support for it will be unavoidable. The entire question is how to carry out this intervention and provide this support. Today immense state investments are being made in the economy in such a way as to reinforce not market but antimarket tendencies. Mutual offsetting of debts or preferential credit are dangerous not only because they could produce a new wave of inflation. What is even worse is that they generate attitudes of dependency among commodity producers and orient them not toward market demand but toward passive anticipation of help from the state. Indeed, why should an enterprise director be concerned about studying the market, reprofiling production, and updating the assortment if it is possible, as usual, to crank out products that nobody needs, and when the enterprise, its warehouses crammed full, ends up actually bankrupt, threaten the government with mass unemployment and social upheaval and have its debts written off again and be granted new credit? As a result, products nobody needs continue to be produced and the problem of nonpayments is renewed from year to year. The state must help the enterprises provide for product sales and not give them an unconditional opportunity to continue to produce items that nobody buys. To accomplish this it is necessary to change the direction for granting state funds: Credit should be extended not to the producer but to the consumer so that he can buy the products he really needs. We must especially look into a form of organization of sales that is widely used in world practice and is almost unknown in our country. It involves leasing companies which purchase costly technical equipment from the producer and lease it to the actual users. It is precisely in the creation of these companies in all branches that operate costly technology and equipment that state credit should be invested. This way we will help update the fixed capital of the enterprises of these branches and, the main thing, we will force the producer actually to take consumer demand into account. Because the leasing company will place an order only for equipment that is in demand. This mechanism will make it possible to reveal the group of producers whose products nobody needs and actually put in motion a bankruptcy procedure that has been discussed for a long time without results. Of course, such market mechanisms as leasing companies function effectively if they have participating in them not only state but also private capital, which is vitally interested in profit. The creation of such companies with mixed capital has the added advantage that it makes it possible to draw into the production sphere Russian entrepreneurs who are not yet strong enough to decide on large-scale investment without the state as a partner. We see another means of shifting state support from the producer to the consumer in the granting of monetary subsidies directly to the citizens. The first experiment of this kind was conducted in connection with the rejection of state subsidies for the production of bread. It should be utilized more widely. And if an enterprise cannot sell its items, it is necessary to speak precisely about social aid for its workers and about targeted and strictly controlled credit for reprofiling, and not about endless subsidies for the continuation of unnecessary production. Such outlays are much more justified than the expenditure of more and more billions on the production of products of yesterday. The essence of all these mechanisms is that the state supports the consumer and he, with his ruble, votes for the enterprises that are capable of finding their place in a market economy. Only when we master this will we be able to launch a structural rearrangement of production on market principles and create incentives for satisfying the effective demand. In addition to this the state must assist in the structural rearrangement of industry, in increasing its ability to compete and in its profitability, and in reducing expenditures. One of the areas where this work can be seen is purposeful utilization of "natural monopolies" that belong to the state--nationwide transportation, communications, and energy networks. The establishment of prices and rates for the services of these monopolies must be strictly controlled and be subordinated to tasks of the state economic policy. For many goods today the lion's share of the production costs, sometimes up to 40 percent, is made up of expenditures on transportation (and, for example, for newspapers--on communications workers). For the period of stabilization special financial conditions must be established for state networks of nationwide significance that are protectionist with regard to Russian producers. It is necessary to establish lower rates and to prevent their arbitrary increase by local leaders of the corresponding services. Thus significant financial aid will be rendered to all of Russian industry. At the same time it will be possible to refrain from individual support of enterprises, which creates unequal conditions for them, and utilize the released budget funds for maintaining the technical level and wages and for the development of federal systems of transportation and communications and energy engineering. Development of Privatization The program for privatization of state enterprises was one of the few state programs with detailed development and a well-arranged mechanism for implementation. The year 1994 will be one for summing up the results of its first stage--privatization of state enterprises through the use of privatization checks issued to the population. The goals of the privatization program are multifaceted. Among them are political ones--returning to citizens of Russia their share of the national wealth; social--the formation of a large segment of private owners; and economic--the reform of property relations in Russia. The results of the activity of the government and the course of privatization show that we are consistently coming closer to our earmarked goals. At the same time today we are experiencing an ever greater need to shift from global transformations to solutions to current problems of the economic reform. Based on this, we consider it necessary to coordinate issues of privatization with structural rearrangement of the economy and modernization and retooling of Russian industry. Mass check privatization will be completed on 30 June. After that there should be an increase in the role of other methods, which are oriented more not toward social ends but toward high economic effectiveness of the privatized sector. These include, above all, investment competitions which demand from the buyers of enterprises unconditional implementation of a program of investment in the development and modernization of production. There are also great prospects for the sale of state property in installments--through a system of special privatization credit. This system should open up access to property for those Russians who are able to organize production but do not have sufficient initial capital for this--the corps of directors and professional managers. Continuation of the Land Reform An important step in the development of economic transformations was the decision to remove unjustified restrictions from buying and selling plots of land and the formation of the basics of a civilized real estate market. The president signed the corresponding edict on regulation of land relations and work was done in the government to improve individual areas of the functioning of the land market. At the same time today we have far from a complete package of the necessary normative documents on land law. There is a critical need for an integrated code of laws on land that establishes the rights and responsibilities of its owners and delimits authority in regulating land relations at the level of the Federation. This is one of the most important issues facing the country which the new Russian parliament can resolve. Further liberalization of relations involving ownership of the land and its legislative formulation are necessary not only for the development of agriculture but also for the development and the most rapid stabilization of the economy as a whole. At the same time liberalization of land relations should not lead to a loss of state control over the land market, especially the utilization of land for agricultural purposes. It is necessary to consider the question of introducing the status of land under federal jurisdiction for some of the agricultural land that has strategic significance for all of Russia. Reform of the Banking System The development of domestic industry will be successful only if it is based on a solid banking system. Far from everything is going well in this sphere in our country. The Central Bank system has not acquired the flexibility needed under conditions of a market economy. As before there is domination by all kinds of continuously changing instructions, letters, and telegrams sent by the Central Bank. It is becoming increasingly difficult to figure out this pile of them. Even worse is that the Central Bank's independence frequently ends up to be arbitrariness with respect to the commercial banks and sometimes also with respect to all the population and enterprises of the country (as was the case during the summer money exchange). The work of the Central Bank requires restructuring and reform, not shock therapy, but extremely cautious reform that does not disturb the normal operation of the banking system as a whole. It is necessary to take advantage of all the best that has been accumulated in world experience in management of the monetary-credit sphere and in the work and organization of central banking systems. As for the development of the domestic banking system, we still have to determine the limit beyond which protection of national economic interests becomes patronage for inefficient structures that ignore the interests of the clients and are incapable of providing them service at the level of modern standards. Protectionist measures must, in the first place, be carefully weighed so as not to go beyond the limits actually dictated by national economic interests and, in the second place, be combined with increasingly strict requirements on the quality of the operation of domestic banks so as not to preserve the backwardness but gradually to bring them up to the real world's level. Development of Currency Regulation Up until recently questions of currency regulation have been among the most difficult problems of economic policy. The condition of the Russian economy is fatally affected by such phenomena as illegal exportation of capital, the diversion of immense funds for currency speculation rather than production use, branch and regional lobbying in connection with the receipt of currency and other foreign economic privileges. The development of currency control and the regulation and sharp reduction of benefits and special conditions make up an essential task. Stabilization of the foreign currency exchange rate for the ruble is another one of the most important tasks. The economy is not yet ready for a fixed rate. But it is necessary to introduce into practice the establishment of points of reference for changing the exchange rate for the near future and provide for their observance through measures of state policy. This will create a certain stability for industrialists and investors, and will help to shift immense funds involved in currency speculations to production use. Right now we must begin working to prepare for transferring Russia's foreign trade to ruble accounts. Such conditions for accounts for foreign trade operations are typical for developed countries with market economies. As the country's economic situation stabilizes, this task will be increasingly crucial. We must purposefully prepare the economic and political conditions for this decision. With the introduction of such a system there will be a sharp increase in the supply of currency on the Russian market, since the entire volume of export proceeds of Russian enterprises will pass through it. Moreover, there will be a steady and significant demand for rubles on the part of foreign buyers of Russian goods (including raw materials). This not only means an important step toward convertibility of the ruble but it also creates preconditions for the ruble's entry into foreign currency exchanges. The very concept of foreign currency accounts of enterprises will disappear. From the very beginning rubles will be transferred into the exporter's account, and the importer will also use rubles to pay foreign sellers through his bank for goods that are purchased. Such an accounting procedure is an important element in the system of currency control. It will place a barrier on the path to illegal exportation of capital abroad and make an essential contribution to the stabilization of the ruble as a currency used in the world market, even if it is on a very limited scale at first. The task of stabilizing the ruble exchange rate and introducing it into international settlements should also be a reference point for the legislative organ when preparing documents regulating monetary circulation and the monetary policy of the Russian federation. Protection of National Economic Interests and the New Foreign Political Doctrine Russia's entry into the world market is objectively predetermined and it has not only economic but also decisive domestic political significance. Even today it has been clearly revealed that a considerable share of Russian enterprises are trying to export their products. For many of them (for example, high technological ones) this is the only possibility of surviving under modern conditions whereby domestic sales have dropped sharply and the state has no possibility of providing adequate support. Thus the opening of foreign markets for Russian goods was predetermined by an objective process, and it directly involves the interests of tens of thousands of enterprises and millions of their workers. All these people are real or potential bearers of the ideology of Russia's entry into the world market. Such mass support and interest means that Russian goods will definitely go on to the world market. The only question is whether this will be sooner or later, in civilized or savage forms, and because of the government or in spite of it. With their votes, their work, and their resources these people and their enterprises are capable of giving real support to the government that carries out this task. Conversely, indecisiveness, delays, and especially disregard for this problem by the government will actively place them in opposition and force them to seek other channels, bypassing the current authorities, for integration into the world economy, and also to rely on other political forces. Consequently, success in solving foreign political problems will make an essential contribution to the development of the domestic political situation. This is one of the factors that form the social base of the reforms and the reformers, which determine the credit of confidence and support we have for conducting our policy. The solution to the problem of entry into the world market hinges mainly on inadequate foreign political support. The reorientation of foreign policy toward priority partnership with the leading developed countries, which has taken place in recent years, has certain shortcomings along with its obvious merits. There has been a sharp reduction of Russia's presence in traditional foreign markets (for example, the countries of Eastern Europe and the Near East), and the potential for cooperation with developing and new industrial countries (South Korea, Taiwan) is being inadequately utilized. At the same time, relations between Russia and the West are developing asymmetrically at the present time. The developed countries are not at all inclined to allow Russia into international markets in response to the development of political cooperation. Our partners consistently protect the interests of their producers from Russian competition, and Western countries are preserving discriminatory measures against Russian goods and preventing their penetration into their own markets and even into the markets of "third countries" (an example is the memorable story of the delivery of rocket engines to India). The developed countries are applying antidumping measures against Russian goods and introducing prohibitive duties on our products (for example, 104 percent on deliveries of ferrosilicon from Russia to the United States). The quotas assigned to Russia in many cases are linked to deliveries from the CIS as a whole, which aggravates relations within the framework of the Commonwealth because of the distribution of these quotas. And the amounts of the quotas are frequently ridiculous. According to the data of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, say, for sheet metal the quota of the European communities for Bulgaria is 53,000 tonnes, for Romania--45,000 tonnes, and for all of the CIS--49,000 tonnes. Italy allows the shipment from Russia of nine (!) engines, 29 motorcycles, etc. These political restrictions cannot be removed by purely economic methods. It is necessary to have a consistent and firm policy of protection of national economic interests that is enforced in all foreign political activity. This pertains both to cooperation with Western states and to the restoration of mutually advantageous trade and economic ties with the former socialist countries and to political support for Russia's entry into the markets of developing and new industrial countries with competitive and highly technological goods, machines and equipment, and raw and processed materials. Thus political support must play a decisive role in the restoration of Russian exports and their distribution in new foreign markets. This problem is not being resolved effectively enough today. It is necessary to adopt and consistently implement a new foreign political doctrine that protects Russia's national interests. It is important to find a form in which foreign policy would reflect in a balanced way both the political and the economic interests of our country.
