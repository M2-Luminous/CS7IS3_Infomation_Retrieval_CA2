Railway transport is known to be one of the few areas in which most, if not all, operations are regulated by the state. Nevertheless, First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets of the RF Council of Ministers kept asking the railroad administrators who attended a domestic electronics exhibit in the Leningrad Station on 12 April about their relationship to commercial banks and business structures. Can you tell our readers anything about this? [Fadeyev] The Ministry of Railways is in favor of mutually beneficial cooperation with commercial banks and business structures. What is more, it is assisting in the establishment of commercial structures, particularly those that might do something to achieve the current objectives of railway transport. The Railroad Bank, a commercial institution, was established and is operating within the branch, and it already managed to achieve some impressive financial results last year. The capital stock of the bank is now being increased to 1.5 billion rubles, and the figure will rise to 5 billion in the future. According to plans, the Railroad Bank should aid in the establishment of a single banking system for the Russian railroads to speed up the transfer and circulation of financial resources. Virtually all of the railroads have operating commercial banks, and bank branches are being opened in railroad subdivisions and enterprises. The banking system is operating as an autonomous commercial structure, not only to attract investments and extend credit to rail transport enterprises, but also to earn money on its own. This is particularly important in view of the reduction of freight transport revenue. The Ministry of Railways and the railroads have established commercial structures such as Sovfinamtrans, Apparel, and the Railway Joint-Stock Insurance Company, which will have a broad field of operations in connection with the institution of compulsory insurance for freight and passenger transport. An industrial finance company was recently founded to solve the problem of nonpayments. There are plans to establish a structure to handle supplementary pension security. According to railroad administrators, the commercial structures can develop most productively if they solve the specific problems of the branch and secure and improve transport services. [Zhemchugov] Do you want to enlist the services of Russian businessmen in the resolution of current problems in rail transport? If so, what kind of plans have you made? [Fadeyev] We certainly do want to do this. In particular, we want a domestic production base for the construction of rolling stock. You could say that this process has already begun. The production of electric trains, for example, has been organized at a plant in Torzhok, and without the use of government funds. Participation by Russian businessmen in the improvement of transport services could be another important field of cooperation. Railroad administrators are willing to take the priority of certain freight shipments into account when they serve business structures. Besides this, there are already some firms specializing in the safe arrival of freight, in freight expediting services, and in the monitoring of delivery schedules. Interaction with commercial structures is also possible in this field. [Zhemchugov] How realistic are the plans for the construction and operation of private railroads in Russia? [Fadeyev] The construction of private railroads in Russia would be extremely problematic: It would entail large capital investments and a long recoupment period. Private capital still cannot afford to take on projects of this kind without government support. The Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company, which plans to build the Lendmozero-Kochkoma line, and the High-Speed Highways Joint-Stock Company, which has already begun construction work, are experiencing a need for considerable government support. No one could object to the installation of private railway lines for the development of new mineral deposits, for instance, but any new railroad will have to operate at a loss for the first five years or so, and carrying losses for this length of time will probably be too inconvenient and unaffordable for business structures. [Zhemchugov] Tell us what we all want to know: Will there be any fare increases before the end of this year? [Fadeyev] Rail transport is one of the few branches in which the cost of its products and services is regulated by the state. Meanwhile, the prices of most of the products used by the railroads are not controlled. Regrettably, adjusting fares to keep up with rising costs cannot be avoided unless the state subsidizes the expenses of the branch, and this depends on budget prospects. In view of the much more intense rail traffic in summer, the government wants to reduce the fares on suburban trains by 70 percent from 30 April to 10 May 1994 and by 50 percent on holidays and weekends from 14 May to 25 September 1994 and compensate the Ministry of Railways for the resulting losses.
