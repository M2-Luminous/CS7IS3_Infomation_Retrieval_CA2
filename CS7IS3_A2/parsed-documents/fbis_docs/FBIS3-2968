Because the two sides of the strait, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, will all be signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], the Taiwan side may in the future define the relations among the two sides of the strait and the three parties as "one country, four regions" and "two banks, four sides." As to the aviation agreements, the relevant departments of Taiwan will energetically push ahead with Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights and Taipei will also strive to open a Taiwan-Macao air route, because it may even serve as a "cushioning chip [huan chong chou ma 4883 0394 4693 4316]" for the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights. The first phase of the Macao Airport will be completed by the middle of next year. The Macao Government is very interested in opening a Taiwan-Macao aviation line. The term of an aviation contract is five years, so it should straddle 1999. If so, no matter how the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights are progressing, at least the Taiwan-Macao route can serve as an intermediary transit base. But the Macao Government is hoping that the two sides will sign a commercial aviation contract, so as to lower the level of official involvement. Furthermore, the Beijing factor is present in the Taiwan-Macao talks on aviation rights, which will be a significant variable in the negotiation process. Beijing will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 respectively. The evolution of Hong Kong society and Macao society under Beijing's rule and the development of Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao will be a big variable in the progress of cross-strait relations. The departments concerned in Taipei are working hard on the "Regulations on the Relations With Hong Kong and Macao," which will govern exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999. Taking account of Beijing's response, the relevant departments in Taipei have claimed to the outside that these regulations are being deliberated under the framework of "one country, two regions," but in actual fact the preamble of the regulations will clearly define the Hong Kong region and Macao region as distinct from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Thus, with the additional definition of the Taiwan region and mainland region contained in the regulations on the relations between the people on both sides of the strait, the framework of "one country, four regions" is coming into being. Considering that the two sides and Hong Kong and Macao will all be signatories to the GATT and the level of internationalization of the two sides and three regions will increasingly grow, Taipei's decisionmaking body on mainland affairs will probably define the two sides and Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999 as "two banks, four sides" and "one country, four regions," so as to make less significant the comparative appraisal [xiang dui ping bi 4161 1417 6097 3024] of the two sides under the principle of "one country." It is learned that when the group for developing the regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao came to Hong Kong to solicit comments from various circles in the process of drafting the regulations, the people consulted include some pro-China personalities, such as the persons in charge of China-funded organizations, Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference national committee, and advisers on Hong Kong affairs. Following the group's extensive consultations in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the draft regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao have been initially completed. Tomorrow, the Mainland Affairs Committee will hold its first examination session on the draft. In April, the drafting work will officially enter the stage of examination by all ministries and commissions. It is expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before the end of this year.
