Germany and France are proposing three measures to the EU Council: The establishment of a commission of "high-ranking personalities" that is to present proposals with the objective of more tolerance toward foreigners; a "comprehensive" strategy in the European Union to combat racism and xenophobia, and "opportunities for the approximation of legal provisions and practical courses of action" of the member states; joint relevant training for the officers of the responsible authorities. The initiative had come about at Germany's request. Apparently, after the xenophobic riots that are harming the FRG's reputation, the German side was obliged to take action. France complied with its partner's wishes. Two symbolic acts shaped the Mulhouse meeting in a special way: Chancellor Kohl used the summit to return 28 valuable pictures and drawings that had fallen into the Germans' hands during World War II and had finally been taken to a GDR [German Democratic Republic] museum. The chancellor had brought the most important picture, a winter landscape by Monet, as a present for the host. The showing of the works of art in Paris is envisaged. Mitterrand said that the history of the pictures is a veritable "story." Kohl talked of a dramatic facet of Europe's fate in the past 50 years. The chancellor paid tribute to the French president's invitation to the Eurocorps to participate in this year's military parade on the French National Day on 14 July as a "great gesture." In 1988, on the 25th anniversary of the Elysee Treaty, the German Guards Battalion had already lined up as an honor guard in the courtyard of the Invalids. However, no German soldiers have marched on the Champs-Elysees since the end of the war. The application of German-French cooperation also in the military sphere and the joint foreign and security policy of the European Union create the prerequisites for it. The chancellor accepted the invitation to Paris. In addition to Kohl, the heads of government of the other Eurocorps members; Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg, are also to be among the guests of honor on national day. Regarding the European Union's future enlargement by the addition of Central and East Europen states, the opinions of Bonn and Paris have been further reconciled. Nevertheless, the different speeds are obvious. At the final news conference, Mitterrand warned against harmful "competition" in the fixing of deadlines for further entries. The Community must not "gradually lose its meaning" by the enlargement and, in the end, become merely some kind of free trade zone. Kohl agreed with that and said: "For us there is no contrast between enlargement and deepening." Only "an enlarged free trade zone" would not be acceptable. Germany and France will also use their successive EU presidencies for the preparation of the reform of the European Union's institutions, which is to be tackled in 1996. A document that was developed by the two governments, and is to be published after the European summit meeting on the Island of Corfu, serves for the coordination between the two partners in European politics in these "12 months of a uniform presidency" (Mitterrand). A decision on the succession of European Commission President Delors will also be made on Corfu. Moreover, Kohl and Mitterrand announced further joint initiatives for the security of the nuclear power plants in Russia and East Europe, as news agencies reported in addition. Kohl said that he is not satisfied with the fact that other states do not assess the problem in the same way as Paris and Bonn. At the meeting of the seven most important industrial states (G-7) in Naples, one wants to insist on the closing down of the reactors of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. At its 11th session during the meeting in Mulhouse, the German-French Defense Council affirmed that the two countries want to continue their close cooperation on the basis of the EU action plan in order to achieve a peaceful solution and the termination of the hostilities in Bosnia. Germany and France are advocating closer ties between the European Union and the Western European Union, and they also want to promote the introduction of the Central and East European states to the European security organizations. A communique of the Defense Council says: "Both countries also realize that there can be no real stability and security in Europe without cooperation with Russia." Germany and France repeated their intention to develop a large military aircraft. In its statement, the Defense Council affirmed that the new military transport aircraft is necessary because neither the range nor the carrying capacity of the aircraft that have been used in the two states so far -- the C-160 Transall, the C-130 Herkules, and the Alenia G 222 -- correspond to the needs of the two armed forces. Defense Minister Ruehe and Leotard agreed that the transport aircraft should not be designed completely anew but be based on preparatory work and experiences of the civil aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Aircraft manufacturers from Germany, France, Italy, Great Britain, and Spain who are interested in the construction of the aircraft have already formed a consortium. A feasibility study for the "Future Large Aircraft" is to be concluded by the end of 1994.
