At the banquet, the Lao National Assembly president and the speaker of the Malaysian House of Representatives exchanged speeches describing the growing Lao-Malaysian relations. Other Lao National Assembly members and senior government officials attended the function. In his speech, Saman Vi-gnaket expressed his belief that the successful visit to Laos by the high-level delegation of the Malaysian House of Representatives would further strengthen the friendly traditional relations between Laos and Malaysia as well as between the two legislative bodies. He said the result of the visit is a gain of the common effort by the people of the two countries, and the personal effort of the Malaysian speaker of the house. He also said: Laos and Malaysia are in the same region, and have always mutually supported and enjoyed good relations of friendship and neighbourly cooperation. The people of the two nations have shared similarities in their characters and languages. They love peace, freedom, progress and justice, have no wish to interfere in other countries' affairs. Malaysia is a country within the Nonaligned Movement that observes the principles and goals of the movement. This has made the people of the two countries understand and trust one another. Saman Vi-gnaket was pleased with the achievements the Malaysian Government and people have scored in their national development, and thanked them for their support, assistance to Laos in the task of national salvation in the past as well as that of national development at present. The speaker of the Malaysian House on Representatives reciprocated by saying in his speech that he was impressed by the Buddha images, especially the earthen one of the sixth century, he saw while visiting the Emerald Buddha Shine. They served as an evidence of Laos' capability in art works, as well as its long history and civilization. He said that they were pleased at seeing that the two countries had enjoyed a close relationship and we had tried to help one another. He added that Malaysia was ready to provide education and training opportunities in Malaysia for Lao students. He also said that Laos was implementing its five-year development plan for 1991-95 and that the Constitution endorsed in 1991 guaranteed commercial production, private properties and private investment by both locals and foreigners. Besides hydro-power and mineral resources, he said, Laos was abundant with other natural resources. All the potentials will lead the country to a bright future, he added. The head of the Malaysian delegation also said that in the next few weeks, the prime minister of Malaysia will make his first visit to Laos to further strengthen relationship and friendship between the two countries. The prime minister's delegation will include many Malaysian businessmen, who will identify economic investment in Laos. He hoped this visit would help bring the two people closer to each other. He also invited the Lao National Assembly president and its members to visit Malaysia soon.
