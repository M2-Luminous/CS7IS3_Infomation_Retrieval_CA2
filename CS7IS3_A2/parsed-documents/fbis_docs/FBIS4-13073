The Islamic Jihad called for the monthly general strike as it does on the 6th of every month, reminding the locals that the intifadah is, in fact, not over. The streets were covered with rocks and the remains of burned tires. The Palestinians failed to show up for the ceremony the IDF had prepared at the entrance to the al-Shati' refugee camp to hand over the police building. The disappointed Israeli policemen quickly folded up the refreshment tables. The disappointed residents started to slowly move away as IDF soldiers began pushing them with increasing determination, having no choice as the friction became intolerable. Dozens of local residents crowded the gates of the Bayt Lahiya Civil Administration offices, seeking exit permits to Israel, while giant cranes lifted the barracks one by one. It looked as if all that will be left there soon will be the long line of unsolved problems. In the afternoon, when the reports on the 'Afula car bomb started coming in, my taxi driver's face turned gray. He recalled the preintifadah days "when we used to work at a steak house in Rishon Leziyyon from morning till night and go home to the Strip once a week. It was quiet and good." From his point of view, a life of exploitation and humiliation is better that the current situation. "Now they will expand the closure," he said with concern. "You will leave, and we will remain here between the fences. What will we have? All the space between Gaza and Rafah. You can drive through our entire autonomy and the car engine will not even warm up." Twilight is the hour of great hopes and of fears. At the PLO headquarters in the Rimal neighborhood, the deportees who returned the day before through the Rafah crossing repeatedly hug their friends at the local command. There is hope in their eyes. They are certain the road is leading to the establishment of a state. Most of the deportees maintained daily contacts with the Gaza Strip. While in Tunis, Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the Fatah Hawks, was a member of the Gaza committee which liaised between Chairman 'Arafat and his comrades in the field. Upon arrival, he was appointed chairman of the liaison committee with the IDF. As soon as he arrived at the border crossing, he held a business meeting with Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF forces in the Gaza Strip and his Israeli counterpart. A business meeting between two practical men. As a rule, the higher you go in the level of command, the more people speak to the point and not in slogans. Midhat al-Salim, who had been serving a life sentence, was released in the Jibril deal, arrested time and again, and deported in early 1991. He returned yesterday and already wants to start working. He would rather not talk about the past and would not discuss the reason he was given a life sentence. All he would say is that he used to be a member of one the top secret squads operating in the Gaza Strip in the 1980's, named after Rafiq Salama, who, according to him, was killed on 25 December 1990. He pronounces the date in the way a soldier would state his serial number. "It is unhealthy to discuss the past," al-Salim says. "We do not wish to intimidate the Israelis. In the past, I acted like a soldier fighting for peace, and I am going to fight for peace now as well." What will he do now? Al-Salim does not yet have an official assignment but says that the bulk of his work will be against "our extremists." A local Shin Bet? He prefers not to use this word. "We will reach an understanding with them," he assures me. "They will know their limitations." It is to be assumed that he means Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. Al-Salim has no difficulties assimilating back into the Gaza Strip after being away for three years. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a local Fatah leader, was a member of the same terror squad with him. Abu-Zayidah, an eloquent person, carefully puts forth his ideas in Hebrew. Alert to language nuances, he tries to introduce to the Israeli media the idea of peace and coexistence. In an interview he granted Karmela Menashe of Qol Yisra'el, he asked that she say at the end "the PLO offices, Gaza," and not "the PLO offices in Gaza." His office and the office of the Arab affairs adviser at the Civil Administration maintain frequent fax communication. When asked, Abu-Zayidah says that in the autonomy, he will be the Jewish affairs adviser. Abu-Zayidah shares an office at the central PLO building with Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq. There is no clear distribution of authorities between them; everything is being done in cooperation, but Abu- Zayidah focuses more on coordination with the IDF, while 'Abd-al-Raziq is primarily engaged in coordinating with the other Palestinian organizations in the Strip, including Hamas. He is an impressive man, age 39 but looks older. He was released from prison only four months ago, shortly before completing a 20-year prison term, in response to a special request from Yasir 'Arafat. He was appointed a member of the Fatah leadership while in the Nafha prison. There, together with jailed Hamas leaders, he signed a document regulating coordinated operations in the Gaza Strip by the two organizations. As is well known, the Gaza Strip is being run from the city and from prisons. 'Abd-al-Raziq was a student in Lebanon when he joined Fatah. After he returned from his studies, he prepared an explosive charge and took it to Rishon Leziyyon to retaliate for the killing of three Palestinian leaders in the al-Firdan operation (he, too, utters the exact date this happened as if it were the date he joined the army). The charge exploded in his hands, he stresses; there were no Israeli casualties. He still carries the scars of that day: numerous scars, a split lip sewn together by undergoing plastic surgery several times, a twisted hand. He has nothing but praise for the medical treatment he received at Asaf Harofe Hospital. In prison, he expanded his studies. He studied the history of the Haganah and read the writings of Ben-Gurion, Rabin, Dayan, and Begin -- all in Hebrew. He says that the books influenced and encouraged him. "I was impressed by the determination of those men, by their ability to reach their goals despite the difficulties. It helped me through the darkest days." To get to know Jewish history even better, he took an Open University course called "From Jerusalem to Yavne." He is better versed in the history of Yohanan Ben-Zakay and the Roman rule than most Israelis. You must have compared this with your situation, I suggested. You must have viewed the Palestinians as the Jews with the Israeli occupation forces acting the part of the Romans. "There is no comparison," Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says. "The Romans were much worse. They tried to wipe out an entire culture." 'Abd-al-Raziq is also very careful with his choice of words. When I ask him to confirm that he was one of the leaders of the "revolt of the security prisoners" staged in Israeli prisons, he asks that I replace the word "revolt" with "struggle for rights." What is the purpose of making such fine distinctions? "It is important to be precise. We care very much about how the Israeli public opinion reads us." Why do you care so much about the Israeli public? Israel will soon be out of here. Why not deal with your own public? I asked. "The Israeli public opinion is very important. Israel is a democratic society. Public opinion will determine what will take place here. It is important that you realize that we are not extremists. We are sensible people who know what their goals are. Naturally, our goal is an independent state, but it is important to point out that this state will seek peace with Israel. Without it, we stand no chance to exist. We need peace for domestic and external reasons. "Unfortunately, Palestinian public opinion is less important at this time. We are not yet a democratic society. Our people are motivated by emotions. Sometimes I have to speak to the people's sentiments to promote our strategic goals. We have no other option but to become a democratic society. Anyone who fails to understand that understands nothing." His remarks imply that he attributes the failure to understand to the chief leaders in Tunis. 'Abd-al-Raziq is not worried. They will understand. They have no choice. 'Arafat, too, will understand. "So far, our organization itself has been undemocratic," he admits. "The regime is undemocratic. In fact, there is hardly any regime to speak of." Conversations with former prisoners, who constitute the local Gaza leadership, are in some peculiar way easy and relaxed. I am certain that IDF officers come across this daily. These are people who lost their youth in prison, who were subjected to the most rugged interrogations, who proved their character and determination in the toughest tests possible. Lies do not interest them, and the feeling that nothing could scare them any more helps them to speak openly with both Major General Matan Vilna'i and Yasir 'Arafat. 'Abd-al-Raziq says with indifference that he is not concerned about his future station or standing. 'Arafat may decide whatever he likes; he does not depend on his decision. "I have never been a man searching for a position. My position found me." He estimates that whoever comes to rule Gaza will require his qualifications -- his personality, ideological fortitude, organizational skills, integrity, his excellent Hebrew, and his understanding of the Israeli system and Israeli soul. Invaluable assets. The seminar "From Jerusalem to Yavne" taught him how dangerous religious fanaticism is. He has a dream: to establish a universal movement opposing religious fanaticism. And he is the man who oversees the daily coordination with Hamas. "It is true," he says, "that we maintain an open communication channel. I assure you: Hamas knows its place perfectly well, and it knows that it should avoid starting a civil w}F will return to Gaza. I can allay your fears: Even if it happens -- and you know to what organization I belong and how much I want my organization to do well -- even if Hamas comes to power, it will happen democratically, while safeguarding democratic values, because without democracy, we will all go down here." Authoritative Israeli sources also believe that Hamas will not hinder the PLO and that it will play by the rules in the hope of enlisting the support of the majority of the public, the majority that does not identify with any side. The prevailing opinion is that Hamas must not cause a "fitnah." Fitnah, or civil strife, is a major taboo according to the Koran. The practical implication of this Koran law is that Hamas will have to avoid attacking inside the Palestinian-controlled territory. As the PLO is in charge of the Qatif Bloc settlers' security, a Hamas attack on the Qatif settlers will force the PLO to shoot at Hamas members, possibly pitching the entire system into a domestic war. The Hamas leadership will seek to prevent such a development, IDF elements estimate, for practical as well as ideological reasons. "There must be no private militias, either on our or the other side," Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says. Which means, I told him, that the Qatif Bloc settlers will be safer than Israelis anywhere. "That is very possible," 'Abd-al-Raziq says seriously, "and it naturally depends on them as well. We obviously do not want them here; they should start preparing for a possible departure. But it is equally obvious that we must succeed in carrying out the task we have undertaken. If the Gaza First experiment fails, we will never reach a permanent arrangement and independence. And we want independence." Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq and his colleagues understand the reality. In Tunis, it is less understood. Nabil Sha'th placed a mine on the negotiating table by demanding last Wednesday that an armed and uniformed police force enter Gaza amid festive processions. The IDF was opposed, as was the local leadership. The locals understand very well that the deployment of an armed Palestinian police force before it has been granted formal powers will raise unattainable expectations. The locals prefer the policemen to enter quietly, to remain inside their camps, and to train until the right moment when are they able to take up their posts. Right now, there is talk of about 3,000 Palestine Liberation Army [PLA] members. Thousands of locals enrolled at the recruitment offices, but they have had no training as yet. They will be unable to take up their posts for another two months. Actually, 'Arafat's appointments, against which no one dares to speak out, are more than surprising. The PLA generals have had no operational experience, and their knowledge of the terrain is minimal. Even 'Arafat's local appointment is odd: He appointed Zakariyah al-Agha, an engineer, as head of Fatah in the Strip. It is a worthy position, but in practice, it entails very few powers. Al-Agha is preoccupied primarily with settling feuds and conversing with journalists. The PLO's offices in the Strip are situated in his private residence in the Rimal neighborhood. Not to worry, al-Agha owns another villa for his own use. He rarely makes an appearance at the offices. He has nothing to look for among the determined young people who populate the building. When the local leaders waited for the returning deportees at the Rafah terminal, the young people banded together, laughing and carrying on like a bunch of reserve soldiers meeting after an operation. A detached al-Agha remained standing alone by the door. He does not belong to this generation; neither does 'Arafat. It is to be hoped that he is sufficiently astute to give this generation the role which it -- and only it -- can play in the process. Israel is concerned about the security issue. The issue is more or less closed. Yet civilian issues have hardly been discussed at all, and they are a true time bomb. Israel did not really invest in Gaza during its rule. A considerable part of the taxes levied from the residents of the territories was used to pay the Civil Administration personnel's salaries. The Israeli command officers -- soon they will become mere coordination officials -- had the rank of deputy directors and the salaries to go with it. They are leaving the Strip. For a while, they will work from the coordination offices in the Erez checkpoint. The services will be left to the locals. Some of the local administration officials have been mistakenly labeled collaborators. It is to be hoped that 'Arafat will allow them to keep their jobs and that he will not appoint his own people, who have no idea how the system operates. "We will miss the administration yet," a local resident, whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons, told me. "In our system, everything is corrupt. You need to know someone even to get yourself admitted to a hospital. If you do not know anyone, you are dirt." At the moment, people fear the Palestinian rule more than the Israeli administration. For example, there is a Bedouin family, from among the Beersheba refugees, that has been living in Rimal since 1948. They built their house without a building permit, as a matter of course. Several times the IDF issued demolition orders, which were never executed. They are now afraid that their 30-year tenure will be of no avail against the interests of the PLO apparatus officials, who covet the expensive land. Almost every family in the Gaza refugee camps owes money to the Electricity Corporation. The Civil Administration occasionally cut off the power supply and then reconnected it. Now the residents are afraid that the Palestinian regime will cut it off because of its dire need for funds. The health services are in very poor shape, for which Israel is basically responsible. The al-Shifa' government hospital is unable to provide much of the required medical treatment. There is not a single oncology clinic in the entire Strip. In fact, there is only one qualified oncologist. There is still no agreement on how people will receive treatment in Israel. People will simply die. There is still no agreement on how Gaza laborers will work in Israel. The present bureaucracy will double and triple in size when Palestinian rule takes over. There are no development or welfare plans, and people are afraid that, at least at the beginning, oppression will be worse than before. The standard of living will drop. The more it will drop, the less the population will support the peace process. Unless an accelerated economic development process is launched, people will be disenchanted with the PLO and cross over to Hamas, augmenting its strength. A local resident told me: "When a man does not have bread, what else does he have, except God?" At present, Gaza Strip fundamentalists fear that they will be persecuted, as they are in other Arab countries. But with popular support, "Allah is great." "I have as yet to see anything happening," says a local young man at one of the social clubs which cropped up after the Oslo agreement. A club was established in each neighborhood. In the future, they will be the foundation of political power. "In the meantime, there is a curfew. I cannot go over to my brother's after 2100. First we would like to see the PLO lift the curfew."
