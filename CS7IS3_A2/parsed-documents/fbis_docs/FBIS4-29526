"This is why I readily accepted Kim Il-song's offer for a summit as conveyed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter over the weekend," the president said. President Kim made the remarks over a luncheon he hosted at Chongwadae [presidential offices] for a group of 97 bureau directors of non-economic government offices. He said the South proposed to have a working-level meeting on Tuesday next week after the issue was meticulously reviewed over the weekend and Sunday morning. "We offered to them to have a working-level meeting on June 28 since we don't need to have complex talks and all we have to agree to is the place and time (of a summit)," Kim said. He was quick to add, however, that the South cannot tolerate North Korea going nuclear. "There should be no nuclear arms on the Korean peninsula under any circumstances," the president stressed.
