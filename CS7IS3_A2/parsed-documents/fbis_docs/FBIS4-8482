Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who paid a 24-hour visit to Vienna and met with the foreign minister and the chancellor, said in an interview with DIE PRESSE: "In a transitional period, the so-called `Partnership for Peace' is important for states that want to become NATO members, this is quite certain. One cannot go to bed as a Warsaw Pact member and wake up as a NATO partner." "Moreover, we know exactly that a larger NATO would be regarded as a threat in certain Russian circles and an important part of the military establishment." This will not be the case with Partnership for Peace, to which Russia has also been invited, Melescanu said. He explicitly stressed that Russia does not have any right whatsoever to veto entries into NATO. Regarding nationalism in Russia, Melescanu is not dismayed at Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- "he is only a person" -- but at the support for this course. This has to be counteracted by strengthening the democratic elements. Romania itself is striving for entry into the European Union [EU], the foreign minister announced. However, it will only apply when the association agreement with Romania has been ratified by all the EU states, seven of which have not yet done this. "I only tackle things that have reasonably realistic chances of success," Melescanu said. After the present round of accession, the enlargement of the EU will probably be postponed for some time. However, when Austria is in the EU, the Eastern European states will have an "ally in Brussels." "Violence cannot solve a conflict, it can only influence it in one or another direction. Only negotiations can solve it." In this way, Melescanu commented on the NATO air strikes against Serbian positions in Gorazde. If detente, the abandonment of fighting in favor of negotiations are a consequence, the action can also be regarded as a success, he said. NATO's threats finally also led to something like a cease-fire in Sarajevo. "Any pressure is important and has to be welcomed, one only has to calculate the consequences." Have the international community of states made mistakes in dealing with the Yugoslav conflict over the past two years? It is easy to judge afterward, but it was altogether a "period of missed opportunities," the Romanian foreign minister said. He mentioned as an example the proposal that Slovenia and Croatia made to Serbia to form a loose federation, which was rejected by Serbia. Europe tried to do its best, but it always lagged behind developments. Europe's mistake was that it was not quick and determined enough. Melescanu does not want to say whether an early threat of force would have prevented some developments. It might have also had negative consequences. However, pressure in all forms that are permitted and agreed upon in the UN Charter is one of the most important things to solve a conflict. At present, he is "moderately optimistic" regarding the Yugoslav conflict"; at any rate, a positive development can be noticed: for example, the Croats' agreement with the Muslims, the negotiations of the Krajina Serbs with Croatia; now it is important "also to involve the Serbs again." Why did Romania receive Slobodan Milosevic, head of state of an internationally outlawed country, with all honors and in a remarkably cordial way last week? "Let us say: We received him because it is important to talk to everyone," the Romanian minister said to tone this down. However, Franjo Tudjman has been received before -- "with all honors," as Melescanu stressed now -- and a friendship treaty was concluded with Croatia. Bosnia's Izetbegovic will come next week. Why is a friendship agreement with the rest of Yugoslavia, which is outlawed by the UN, being developed? "It is being prepared," but it will only come into force after the ending of the UN sanctions, he said.
