FR940810-1-00052 FR940810-1-00009 (ii) Amendment. Before amending a final statement, the grantee must provide for citizen participation concerning proposed amendments. The grantee must provide citizens a reasonable amount of time to consider a proposed amendment and shall consider any citizens' comments and may make such modifications to the proposed amendment as the grantee considers appropriate. Upon completion, the grantee must make the amendment available to the public and must submit to HUD a description of changes adopted. The grantee may submit a copy of each statement amendment to HUD as it occurs, or the grantee may simply notify HUD in writing that the amendment has been made and, at the end of the program year, submit copies of all amendments made during the year. Letters notifying HUD of amendments and those transmitting copies of amendments must be signed by the official representative of the grantee authorized to take such action. (4) Float-funded activities and guarantees. A recipient may use undisbursed funds in the line of credit and its CDBG program account that are budgeted in statements for one or more other activities that do not need the funds immediately, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (c)(4). Such funds shall be referred to as the ``float'' for purposes of this section. Each activity carried out using the float must meet all of the same requirements that apply to CDBG-assisted activities generally, and must be expected to produce program income in an amount at least equal to the amount of the float so used. Whenever the recipient proposes to fund an activity with the float, it must include the activity in its statement or amend the final statement for the current program year. For purposes of this section, an activity that uses such funds will be called a ``float-funded activity.'' Each float-funded activity must be individually listed and described as such in the statement. (i) The expected duration between obligation of assistance for a float-funded activity and receipt of program income in an amount at least equal to the full amount drawn from the float to fund the activity may not exceed 2.5 years. A loan for a longer term may not be funded from the float, but may be included in a statement if it is funded from CDBG funds other than the float (e.g., grant funds, or proceeds from an approved Section 108 Loan guarantee). (ii) Unlike other projected program income, the full amount of income expected to be generated by a float-funded activity must be shown in the sources section of the statement containing the activity whether or not some or all of the income is expected to be received in a future program year. To justify the inclusion of activities that exceed the sources of funds shown in the statement as expected to be received in the program year covered by the statement, and to assure that citizens can clearly understand the risks inherent in undertaking such a float-funded activity, the recipient must specify in the sources section of the statement the total amount of program income expected to be received and the month(s) and year(s) that it expects the float-funded activity to generate each portion of such program income. (iii) To help citizens assess the degree of risk to activities they support in case the float-funded activity fails to generate program income as scheduled, the recipient must also clearly declare its commitment to undertake one of the following options in the statement that identifies the float-funded activity. The recipient may commit either to: (A) Amend or delete activities in an amount equal to any default or failure to produce sufficient income in a timely manner. If the grantee makes this choice, it must include a description of the process it will use to select the activities to be amended or deleted, how it will involve citizens in that process, and it must amend the applicable statement(s) showing those amendments or deletions promptly upon determining that the float-funded activity will not generate sufficient or timely program income; or (B) Obtain an irrevocable line of credit from a commercial lender for the full amount of the float-funded activity and describe the lender and terms of such line of credit in the statement that identifies the float-funded activity. To qualify for this purpose, such line of credit must be unconditionally available to the recipient in the amount of any shortfall within 30 days of the date that the float-funded activity fails to generate the projected amount of program income on schedule; or (C) Transfer general local government funds in the full amount of any default or shortfall to the CDBG line of credit within 30 days of the float-funded activity's failure to generate the projected amount of the program income on schedule. (iv) When preparing a statement for a year in which program income is expected to be received from a float-funded activity and such program income has been shown in a prior statement, the sources section of the current statement shall identify the expected income and explain that the planned use of the income has already been described in prior statements, and shall identify the statements in which such description may be found. * * * * * 7. Section 570.304 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(4) to read as follows: §570.304 Making of grants. (a) *␣*␣* (4) GPR submissions. All previously due GPRs that have not been submitted to HUD in the prescribed manner are properly submitted. * * * * * 8. A new §570.309 would be added to read as follows: §570.309 Restriction on location of activities. CDBG funds may assist an activity outside the jurisdiction of the grantee only if the grantee determines that the principal benefit of such an activity will be for residents within the jurisdiction of the grantee. The grantee shall document the basis for any such determination. 9. Section 570.500 would be amended by removing and reserving paragraphs (a)(1)(viii) and (b), and by revising paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3), to read as follows: §570.500 Definitions. * * * * *
