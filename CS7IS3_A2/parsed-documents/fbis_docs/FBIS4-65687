A wave of telegrams sent from the Foreign Ministry will make all the ambassadors who represent Italy in the EC countries converge on the Belgian capital Sunday [15 May] so that they can agree with Minister Martino on what should be said and done to begin restoring an image which, at this time, could not be any worse. The next day the minister is to meet with [EC Commission President] Delors and take part in a meeting with his colleagues, even at the price of sweeping aside the planned statements by the president of the Council. "It is essential that we quickly make it understood that we do not intend to renounce Italy's European vocation," said Antonio Martino in his new office on the second floor of the Foreign Ministry. Soon afterward, there will be a visit to Washington. The objective is to complete the "clarification" before the G-7 summit, which is to start on 8 July in Naples and which will mark Silvio Berlusconi's grand international debut. There is not a lot of time, and no Italian Government has ever been so gripped by distrust and reservations. [Brancoli] Minister, how will you be impacted by making a debut at the head of the Italian Foreign Ministry in such a climate? [Martino] It is certainly a difficult time, for objective reasons and also for reasons having to do with our image. We must make it quite clear to both international public opinion and our allies that the radical change in our political system does not mean discontinuity in the basic lines of our foreign policy. Foreign policy will be characterized, above all, by continuity. I do not mean that nothing will change, but I do mean that the basic lines will stay the same. [Brancoli] Good, but I think that your interlocutors will ask you first of all for other explanations and other guarantees. I do not need to remind you of how the government of which you are part was received, or of the alarmed questions that were raised. [Martino] I would say that our country has turned a page in its history and adopted a more modern electoral system which will force us to change the attitude toward what were once considered extreme attitudes, and as such were marginalized. I would then say that we need to look at the government program, which nobody can honestly say is a right-wing program. The same program by the National Alliance was drafted by people who have nothing to do with, I would not say fascism, but the Italian Social Movement. [Brancoli] The NEW YORK TIMES -- and it is not the only one -- wondered whether there is a risk of contamination. [Martino] That is mistaken. It does not make sense to talk about contamination. In our elections it is true that the Left was defeated, but is not true that the Right won. I would explain that Forza Italia, the authentic novel element in this coalition, draws its inspiration from the great liberal tradition, occupying a central position in the old scheme of things. I would also underline the importance of the change made among politicians. [Brancoli] The FINANCIAL TIMES feels that the new government has a "worrying lack" of experience. [Martino] We have already experienced expert politicians, and it was not a good experience. [Brancoli] Meanwhile, however, friendly and allied governments are discussing the "Italian case," and there is even talk of a cordon sanitaire. Do you not fear isolation? [Martino] Honestly no. I do not fear it because the picture is a mixed one. There are governments which have shown that they understand what is happening here in Italy, and the press in some countries has been much more articulate in its judgments than in other countries. We are also taking account of the electoral climate for the European elections, which causes political people in some countries to make strong affirmations for domestic purposes. I feel that when we will come out of this, the climate will change, and naturally we will not be sitting there hand in hand. This image problem is the first thing. [Brancoli] There are also problems of substance. For example, your position on the Osimo Treaty [on borders with the former Yugoslavia] will take on symbolic importance for understanding who you are. [Martino] Among all the members of the pole of freedom there is absolute agreement on some points. First, the borders will not be touched. Second, we have no intention of just throwing out the treaty. Third, there are bilateral problems which can be tackled calmly, without creating a big drama. As a supporter of laissez- faire, I have always loathed the borders. [Brancoli] Let us move on to Europe. You are described not only as a "Euroskeptic," but even as anti-EC. [Martino] Do you think it possible that the son of Gaetano Martino could be anti-European? [Brancoli] I will quote [French Socialist Party Secretary General] Rocard for you: "It is not enough to say that you support Europe. You have to say which Europe you support." [Martino] He is right. But we know that we can also agree on what Europe must do. The point is how do we achieve it. Choosing a mistaken strategy means, in actual fact, creating anti-European sentiment, and thus meaning that we do not achieve it. [Brancoli] You, for example, criticize the strategy of monetary unification. [Martino] That is nothing new. I feel that after what happened in September 1992, with the de facto collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism, defending the strategy of European monetary unification would be the same as defending a problematic position against all evidence to the contrary. However, this does not mean that I am against the European currency -- just as I am not anti- European when I criticize excessive intervention on markets. I would like to reiterate that an excess of directives creates an impression among the people that Europe is just another level of regulation superimposed on national regulations. The reaction of rejection is visible. [Brancoli] I will quote for you a question asked by LE MONDE: What will be the European policy of Berlusconi's Italy? [Martino] It will be a convinced and active policy in favor of a political Europe, something which is absolutely necessary. Europe must find a way of speaking with a single voice only in matters of foreign policy. It must also achieve a common defense. The United States, among others, has asked for this because it realized that the pax americana is an illusion. [Brancoli] How would you reproach previous governments' European policies? [Martino] My criticism would mainly be that they did not allow our presence in Europe to be up to the level of Italians' enthusiasm for Europe. There was also a widespread perception in the political class that the power was only at national level and therefore our presence in the institutions could be entrusted to people with a low political profile. At the same time, paradoxically, the idea prevailed that Europe is the solution to all our problems, when it is actually the opposite that is true. We have to solve our problems independently of our membership in Europe, knowing that if we fail to solve them we will become incompatible with the other member states. [Brancoli] For many years now there has been very broad agreement about our foreign policy. How much value do you attach to maintaining it? [Martino] A lot of value. In fact, I have already had contacts with members of the opposition. Our foreign policy must aim to serve the national interest. It is also important that the main lines are understood and shared by the greatest number of people possible. It seems to me that there are conditions for a foreign policy based on a broad consensus. [Brancoli] Judging by the debate, it would seem, however, that your arrival in the government has swept the issue aside. [Martino] I believe that when we get down to work, if we manage to keep the channels of information open with all the political forces, we will manage to extract foreign policy from the guerrilla warfare of ordinary politics. Naturally, there can be differences of opinion on individual points: We cannot follow a policy which is the weighted average of the opinions prevailing in parliament. However, the general lines can be broadly shared. [Brancoli] One condition is that you do not end up isolating Italy in the decisionmaking bodies. [Martino] Both of these are linked. If we have an authoritative, credible, and acceptable foreign policy, then we will also have the chance to give it prominence in international organizations. This is a new Italy. It has turned a page. It will surprise a lot of people.
