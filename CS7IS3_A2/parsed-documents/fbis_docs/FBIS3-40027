And hegemony cannot belong to Forza Italia, which was created to destroy the League. It belongs to the League." Was this a trick move designed to reassure the grassroots or an open declaration of war? In his interview on "Mixer" [television program] Berlusconi described Bossi as a "paradoxical and coarse" politician, so Bossi replied by saying that Forza Italia was created months ago in order to attack the League. That was all the audience wanted to hear, and at the end they overwhelmed him with requests for autographs, but also with pressing questions such as, "Umberto, why did you ally with Berlusconi?" Bossi, who is well acquainted with his supporters' feelings and sympathies, was combative and talked about past months when the League was in difficulties: "Another operation was in progress -- that of Forza Italia. We realized that it would be a factor which, in the hands of a businessman of the north, could steal votes from the League and add them to those of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of that other Christian democrat, Segni. That was the plan -- to hit the League, to smash it." It was the theory of the grand conspiracy against the League, in which Forza Italia was supposedly involved, at least at the start. Bossi described it clearly for the first time. The bombshell was sparked off by the "gift" of the 200 million lire. "It was [investigating magistrate] Di Pietro who caused it to explode, prompted by Sama, the man connected with the great and mysterious authority that stands above politics in this country." His reference was to big finance, to Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank], to those who do not want "any of the alignments to win, because they want to remain in command." If Forza Italia was involved in this "conspiracy," how does Bossi explain his subsequent alliance with Berlusconi? "The plan did not succeed," the League withstood it, and so, "against its will -- since it was formed in order to steal votes from the League -- Forza Italia found itself trapped in our net and will serve to destroy the DC." This was a veritable mortal triple jump, and to make it more comprehensible to his voters, Bossi raised his tone: "At one point we were in great difficulties. We had arrayed against us all of the television stations, which were in the hands of the party system and of the sons of the party dictatorship." And, Bossi implied, these television stations included those of Berlusconi. Bossi recounted to the audience, in a loud voice, the story of a marriage not for love but of convenience, a marriage with someone who until recently was conspiring against the League, and in which the marriage contract will have to be revised after the elections. He drew applause when he said: "I say that the League will govern this country and that there will be a struggle within the Pole for Freedom and that we will grant hegemony to the League." While Berlusconi has expressed his esteem for [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, Bossi shouted: "I claim that the League destroyed Bettino Craxi." While Berlusconi is suspicious of public spending, Bossi repeated that "Craxi and [former Christian Democrat Prime Minister] Andreotti, like South American dictators, wanted inflation in order to destroy the public debt; it is a shame that they destroyed the economy." At the end of the rally, asked whether his speech should be interpreted as a declaration of war within the freedom alignment, he replied tersely: "The truth is the truth, even if it is uncomfortable." He added: "Things will not turn out as the opinion polls say. Berlusconi will not be the winner in the elections; it will be the League. We will be dominant. Berlusconi -- born of the DC in order to destroy the League -- has become involved in a mechanism that will destroy the DC."
