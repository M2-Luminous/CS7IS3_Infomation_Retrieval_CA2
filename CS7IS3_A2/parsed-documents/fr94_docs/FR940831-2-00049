SUMMARY: EPA has extended temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide halosulfuron (MON 12000) Methyl 5-[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino] carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1- H -pyrazole-4-carboxylate in or on certain raw agricultural commodities. DATES: These temporary tolerances expire April 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT By mail: Joanne I. Miller, Product Manager (PM) 23, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 237, CM No. 2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;7830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, which was published in the Federal Register of June 10, 1993 (58 FR 32535) announcing the establishment of temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide halosulfuron (MON 12000) Methyl 5-[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino] carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1- H -pyrazole-4-carboxylate in or on the raw agricultural commodities field corn grain at 0.1 part per million (ppm); field corn forage at 0.3 ppm and field corn fodder at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances were issued in response to pesticide petition (PP) 2G4073, submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Co., 800 North Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63167. These temporary tolerances have been extended to permit the continued marketing of the raw agricultural commodities named above when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permits 524-EUP-74 and 524-EUP-76, which are being extended under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the extension of these temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have been extended on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permits and with the following provisions: 1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use permits. 2. Monsanto Agricultural Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. These tolerances expire April 1, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permits and temporary tolerances. These tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permits are revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a(j). List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: August 22, 1994. Lois Rossi, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21259 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
