Alarcon said that the workers parliaments have served for collective discussion of possible measures in general so that each worker can express his or her opinion and hear the opinions of others to form a collective criterion. The leader of the Cuban parliament pointed out that just as important as this aspect was the identification by the workers parliaments of problems in each work center as well as the necessary decisions that would permit reduced costs and increased efficiency. Alarcon underscored that, with that in mind, they have been able to obtain thousands of proposals and specific measures, many of which have been implemented. Alarcon went on to say that the solution of economic difficulties is a problem concerning the entire nation and not just a group of legislators. He concluded by saying: We must see the people's government as it really is: a parliament inserted in our society.
