One of Them Is Certainly One Too Many"] [Text] The saying that practice makes perfect is nearly universal. This was confirmed by the publication of SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] -- the first collective newspaper of the CIS countries. The decision on founding it was made 23 December 1993 at the Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] meeting of the CIS heads of government. According to the concept devised by the newspaper's editorial board, which included representatives of all republics that signed the agreement, the new publication was designed to help create a common economic space on CIS territory and also forge closer business contacts between representatives of various states. It was decided to publish the new periodical on the basis of Yegor Yakovlev's OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. The publisher states agreed to earmark 950 million rubles and $200,000 for this purpose. Vitaliy Kovalenko was appointed the newspaper's editor-in-chief. At the beginning of 1994, however, legal inconsistencies inherent in the agreement on setting up the newspaper sparked a conflict between the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA board and SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK's staff, the bulk of which was made up of journalists who left ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA after the October events. On one hand, under the document the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board is to exercise day-to-day control over the new publication's activity; on the other, it does not have the right to intervene in the work of an independent paper. This discrepancy promptly led to disagreements between Yegor Yakovlev and Vitaliy Kovalenko. Both sides have been advancing weighty arguments to support their stances, and the dispute over who is to head the new publication threatens to drag on indefinitely. It can be resolved only by a new meeting of the newspaper's editorial board, at which representatives of the CIS member states will have to decide once again on who should steer their periodical. So far, a paradoxical situation has come about where two absolutely different newspapers under the same name -- SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK -- appeared at an interval of three days, on 12 and 15 April. The first one was published by journalists under Vitaliy Kovalenko, the second by the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA staff. Both sides claim that the only genuine newspaper is theirs.
