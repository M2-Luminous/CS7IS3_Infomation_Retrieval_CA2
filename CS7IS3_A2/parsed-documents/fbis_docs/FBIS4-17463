In the opinion of Radetskyy, the negotiations started rather successfully and the sides reached an essential agreement on the fleet division under which Russia will get over 600 units and ukraine -- over 150. Speaking of basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, Radetskyy said the Russian side offered conditions unacceptable for Ukraine, under which all Crimean bases shall be kept by Russia. He said they are ready to discuss compromise variants and there were no reasons to break the dialogue.
