The Yugoslav Army border patrols are situated exclusively on the territory of the FRY and have not on a single occasion entered Macedonian territory. The same sources claim that the activities of the Macedonian Armed Forces have been observed in the vicinity of the border, but the Yugoslav Army will not react unless the FRY's sovereignty and territory integrity are endangered. Yugoslavia and Macedonia do not share a state border but merely an administrative border. The border problems will be resolved when a mixed commission goes into the field and marks the border with stone markers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in Skopje says. An UNPROFOR observer team has already been deployed on the border crossing between the FRY and Macedonia near Kriva Palanka for 12 days. Some 10 Blue Helmets are monitoring the activity of the FRY soldiers, UNPROFOR spokesman in Skopje Elizabeth Baldwin told TIKER. Macedonia has presented its maps to us and it claims that this is its territory, Elizabeth Baldwin says. She added that Yugoslavia did not present its maps to UNPROFOR even though it was requested to do so.
