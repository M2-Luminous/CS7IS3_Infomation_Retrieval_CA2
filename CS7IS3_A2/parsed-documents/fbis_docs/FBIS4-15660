Acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin disclosed this at a meeting with journalists. He explained that indexation of the earnings of workers in this category during the first quarter was 90 percent while the level of inflation over this period was 36 percent. "What happened was over-indexation." Moreover, according to Dubinin, the 2 trillion rubles for indexation during the second quarter have already been allocated in order to satisfy the coal miners' economic demands within the budget framework. "Any victories by strikers with regard to meeting their demands mean somebody else loses out," S. Dubinin stressed.
