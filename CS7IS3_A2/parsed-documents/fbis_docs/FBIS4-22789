The signing of this kind of document in countries with a traditionally strong orientation toward a mechanism for social protection financed through the budget (the Scandinavian countries, for example) becomes an event that is more significant than presentation of the country's budget. Though foreign documents similar to the Russian General Agreement are not considered every year, but are sometimes in force for decades--in Sweden, for example, relationships among employers, trade unions, and the government are defined by the (Saltshebaden) Agreement signed in 1938. The specific nature of the Russian agreement was apparent in the content. At present, neither entrepreneurs nor the trade unions have sufficient influence (chiefly on each other), and for this reason they look upon the government not as an arbitrator in disputes, but the only force capable of meeting their demands. Based on the text of the agreement that was signed, the conclusion may be drawn that the government has consented to this role, since it essentially made no counterdemands. This conclusion is confirmed by unofficial information that "the social lobby" has practically succeeded in breaking down Ministry of Finance opposition and in bringing about an increase in the minimum wage (it is now 14,620 rubles [R]). It is assumed that the president's edict on increasing the minimum wage by roughly 1.5 times as much will be issued at the end of April. In addition, the government has committed itself to provide for the electoral support of commodity producers, to regulate the prices for "socially important" commodities at the local level, and to review the question of reducing the NDS [value-added tax] and customs duties on individual types of foods imported into Russia. The government's rejection of an active policy to create new jobs is much more substantial. But the situation in which the official number of unemployed is less than one-third of the true number of unemployed is maintained by the methods proposed. The government's commitment to draft special legislation to pay allowances to employees who have been sent on administrative leave or who do not work for full days attests to this, in particular. This actually encourages an increase in "hidden" unemployment. The commitment to define the maximum levels of unemployment that are socially acceptable at the local level is a logical continuation of such a policy. "Extreme measures to prevent mass dismissals" which have never been made more specific are being undertaken to achieve these indicators (in the early stages of preparing the agreement, freezing privatization and implementation of procedures to improve economic conditions were considered). However, the government's failure to make clearly formulated demands of the trade unions may be considered as giving them a distinctive kind of advance payument--in the hope that the trade unions will not be too active in initiating a strike movement. * * * Basic Tasks Defined by the General Agreement in the Area of Employment Assistance --to develop a combination of additional measures for social support of employees under conditions in which restorative procedures are applied --to develop a coordinated program of actions in the event of an emergency situation in the labor market --to develop a draft law on payment of allowances to employees who are shifted to an incomplete work day or are sent on administrative leave Official Forecast of the Unemployment Level by the End of the Year --number of persons registered as unemployed: 3 million --when International Labor Organization methods are used, the number of unemployed may reach 6.5 million --taking "hidden unemployment" into account, the number of persons who are unoccupied may reach 8 million
