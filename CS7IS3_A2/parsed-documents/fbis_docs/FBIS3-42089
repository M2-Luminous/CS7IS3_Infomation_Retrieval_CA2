The aim of this system is to guard against incoming missiles from rival countries. The first hint of such a project came from the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, who expressed the need of an "anti missile-missile system," while addressing a news conference at Avia-India 93, during the Bangalore air show, last week. Subsequent inquiries made by this correspondent with aerospace scientists at the air show threw light on the fact that a feasibility study for such a project was being carried out. They, however, emphasised that no firm decision as yet had been taken regarding the matter. The final decision, as with other projects, lay with the Union cabinet which would go into all aspects, particularly the financial implications and the political fallout, before giving the green signal, they said. Speculation in aerospace circles pointed to the possibility of the anti-ballistic missile system being based on the formidable "Akash" system. The "Akash" system utilises the "Rajendra" multi-function phased array radar in a ground support role which has been developed for the first time in India. It is capable of multiple targeting, surveillance and missile handling. The phased array radar was on display at the air show and drew a lot of interest from foreign delegates. In another significant development, about 80 per cent of the structural components for the prototype of India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) have already been fabricated. The LCA has been designed as a total weapon system where the aircraft constitutes a precision weapon launch platform which can carry and deploy a wide range of weapons and stores with a quick turnaround time.
