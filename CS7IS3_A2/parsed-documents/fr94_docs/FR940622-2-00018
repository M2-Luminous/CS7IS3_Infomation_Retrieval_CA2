FR940622-2-00018 FR940622-2-00011 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication XXX (Draft_April 1994) Announcing the Standard for SQL Environments Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. 1. Name of Standard. SQL Environments (FIPS PUB XXX). 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Database. 3. Explanation. An SQL environment is an integrated data processing environment in which heterogeneous products, all supporting some aspect of the FIPS SQL standard (FIPS PUB 127), are able to communicate with one another and provide shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control mechanisms. Some components in an SQL environment will be full-function SQL implementations that conform to an entire level of FIPS SQL and support all of its required clauses for schema definition, data manipulation, transaction management, integrity constraints, access control, and schema information. Other components in an SQL environment may be specialized data repositories, or graphical user interfaces and report writers, that support selected portions of the SQL standard and thereby provide a degree of integration between themselves and other products in the same SQL environment. This FIPS PUB is the beginning of a continuing effort to define appropriate conformance profiles that can be used by both vendors and users to specify exact requirements for how various products fit into an SQL environment. The emphasis in this first FIPS for SQL Environments is to specify general purpose, SQL external repository interface (SQL/ERI) profiles for non-SQL data repositories. These profiles specify how a subset of the SQL standard can be used to provide limited SQL access to legacy databases, or to support SQL gateways to specialized data managers such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), full-text document management systems, or object database management systems. All of the profiles specified herein are for server-side products, that is, products that control persistent data and provide an interface for users access to that data. Subsequent versions of this FIPS PUB may specify SQL environment profiles for client-side products, that is, products that access data and then present that data in graphical or report-writer style to an end user, or process the data in some other way on behalf of the end user. 4.

Related Documents. SQL Environment specifications will often depend upon existing Database Language SQL standards (see Cross Index above) and upon emerging SQL and SQL Multimedia standards. The following items identify formal ISO/IEC international standards projects for which preliminary specifications and base documents exist, but where the development effort has not yet reached a complete and stable stage (i.e. the Committee Draft (CD) stage). As these specifications mature and move through the standards process, they can referenced more reliably in procurement requirements.
