Kono will be free to decide whether to have a make-or-break top-level meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the issue, they said. The LDP, the main opposition party, reached the decision at a meeting of its Executive Council, the officials said. Kono signaled willingness to have a faceoff with Hosokawa to help break the deadlock brought about by the House of Councillors' rejection on January 21 of the government's political reform package. The more powerful House of Representatives passed the four bills on November 18. "In the face of the difficult situation, I will do my best as the party president to make the party's final decision," before the end of the current Diet session on Saturday, Kono said at the meeting. The ruling coalition and the opposition camp, including the LDP, failed to reach a compromise on political reform Thursday midnight at a meeting of a joint council of the two houses. Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [New Government Party] and the coalition's chief negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise. The joint panel was made up of 10 members from the coalition who voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from the opposition who opposed the bills in the upper house. Both sides rejected the other's proposals. Lower house speaker Takako Doi urged Ichikawa to continue trying to reach a compromise in the joint council. Meanwhile, Hosokawa expressed his willingness to hold talks with Kono in an attempt to break the impasse. In a meeting Friday morning with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa reaffirmed his resolve to meet Kono, coalition sources said. The coalition and the LDP, however, remain far apart over both electoral reform for the lower house and reform of political fund-raising, and even if Hosokawa and Kono meet, the prospects of reaching an accord are slim, political analysts said. If the talks end in failure, some coalition members hinted, the coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of the lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills. This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for the package. If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for a snap election, the analysts predicted. Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he fails to achieve political reform by Saturday's closure of the parliamentary session. The reform package is intended to introduce a new electoral system for the lower house involving a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation to replace the existing multiple-seat districts, as well as tightening curbs on political funding.
