We have complementary industries, which can cooperate for third market projects, the Romanian premier said. The talks revealed the interest of the present Romanian executive in boosting the economic relations with Croatia. He suggested, for the purpose, the establishment of joint ventures, an idea received with interest by the Croatian side. Premier Valentic showed that the road and rail links between his country and Romania were extremely important and requested that "Romania uses its influence" to have them channeled through Serbia. Although no reference was made to the conflict in the former Yugoslav space, the idea of a peaceful settlement of it underlay the top level Romanian-Croatian meeting, the resumption of normal economic relations being a sign that the situation in the zone is stabilizing. In the afternoon Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu had meetings with the speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.
