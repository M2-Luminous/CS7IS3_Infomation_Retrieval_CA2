An Organization and Control Option"] [Text] The deteriorating material and spiritual situation of the Russian people is constantly threatening a sharp social protest by the masses in various forms, including an explosion. The authorities need a counterbalance. The OMON [Special Purpose Police Force], the Spetsnaz [Special Forces], Internal Affairs Ministry units -- these are like a sand damn against a big river: effective for a short period and with small-scale developments. A more reliable barrier is needed, a new defense ring. This ring could be so-called "mobile forces," to whose creation Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is devoting much time and effort these days. The 3-4 October 1993 events showed that the action against the White House was actively supported only by a few prominent generals. At the same time the General Staff -- apparently owing to its unreliability -- was disconnected from lines of communication with the city and troops for the entire period of crisis. It is known that an overwhelming majority of chief commanders and commanders at the Defense Ministry Collegium meeting did not express their support for plans to use tanks to storm a civilian installation. It can be assumed that many Russian officers in the provinces, who have not received their monetary allowances and food rations for two to three months, living with their families in dismal apartments or wooden barracks, hardly sympathized with those storming the White House. In the end the victors themselves admitted that in October everything "was hanging by a thread." Was this not a reason why the possibility of employing armed forces to accomplish internal missions was included in Russia's new military doctrine? The concrete manifestation of this provision can be seen in the structure and methods of organizing the "mobile forces." Nearly all combat-ready general-purpose divisions (brigades) can be formed into a single fist directly subordinated to the Russian president and defense minister. A special command and control post is set up with independent communication and automated control systems. (It is a good thing that they were designed way back under the direction of the General Staff's 8th Main Operations Directorate within the Warsaw Pact Joint Armed Forces structure). The command and control post can well be accommodated at the Moscow Military District's Signal Brigade. In the Moscow area of Sokolniki there is a ready-made complex of installations fit to station such a post. A "toy" of the "nuclear briefcase" kind could be made for President Yeltsin, creating the illusion of administering division command. Airborne divisions will possibly be combined with military transport aviation divisions (regiments); airborne assault brigades (regiments), with helicopter units; marines, with amphibious ships. All effectively combat-ready motorized infantry divisions (currently one to two in a military district) will be transferred from district operational command, to be subsequently included into the "mobile forces." And of all this will be commanded by a single, independent operational directorate. The entire "mobile force" structure will have uniform command and control signals corresponding to the main troop combat employment orders. In accordance with manuals and combat regulations (i.e., under Russian Federation laws), their execution is compulsory for all units and formations. At any moment, in any region of the country, in any branch of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, the situation will be under the control of the person standing on top of the command and control pyramid.
