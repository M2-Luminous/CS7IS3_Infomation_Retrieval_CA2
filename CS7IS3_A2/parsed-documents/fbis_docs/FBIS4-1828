FBIS4-1828 "drchi064_w_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Missing Cargo Ship Found Moored at PRC Naval Base Missing Cargo Ship Found Moored at PRC Naval Base HK0204061894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 2 Apr 94 p 1 HK0204061894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Greg Torode] [Text] The crew of a ship seized by armed boarders in Hong Kong waters are now trapped aboard while the vessel sits anchored outside a Chinese naval base in Zhuhai. The [Hong Kong] Government and the agents of the Tequila have had no official word on the fate of the Indonesian and Filipino crew members since the Taiwan-bound ship was taken while at anchor in the Tathong Channel a fortnight ago. And China is refusing to say where it is holding another ship seized just as it left Hong Kong waters last week on its way to South Korea. The Post found the Tequila lying in restricted waters off Zhuhai this week, kept about 500 metres off shore from naval, Customs and Coast Guard gunboats. Local craft were prevented from approaching. One armed Customs vessel held on its stern two small unmarked jet boats, similar to descriptions of those used to intercept the Tequila. Zhuhai Port authorities said the 565-tonne vessel was under constant land and radar surveillance. Crew could be seen wandering about the decks of the ship, cleared of its cargo of 46 second-hand cars manifested in Hong Kong for Keelung. Senior government sources said a series of requests by Hong Kong's Political Adviser's Office to counterparts in XINHUA (the New China News Agency) had gone unanswered, but Public Security Bureau officials had unofficially confirmed the ship's detention. They had, however, denied the Honduran-registered vessel was taken in Hong Kong, despite Marine Department radar print-outs proving the opposite. XINHUA has not responded to requests for further clarification, and it is understood a formal protest could be lodged next week. "We are very concerned," one official close to the case said. "China seems uninterested in talking to us yet it does appear that (Chinese) officials were involved in Hong Kong waters, and we are giving them the chance to clarify the matter before lodging a protest." Leung Kam-hung, managing director of agents Fitter Marine, said yesterday he was working with Zhuhai contacts but still had no word on exactly why the ship was taken, or by whom. He said he had no idea what was happening to his 14 crew members and added that no receipts had been issued by the Chinese for the cargo. "We just have no idea what is going on, no information at all," Mr Leung said. Meanwhile, agents for the 3,566-tonne Shun Ping, seized off Waglan Island last Sunday [27 March], were yesterday summoned to Guangzhou with all documents relating to the ship. A spokesman for Dong Woo agencies -- a prominent Hong Kong firm -- said the company did not know with whom it would be dealing, where the ship was or why it was being held. "All that we are being told is that the crew are safe and that it was seized on leaving Hong Kong because it was not flying its flag of registration, Panama," he said. "This is clearly nonsense, but it shows what we are up against."
