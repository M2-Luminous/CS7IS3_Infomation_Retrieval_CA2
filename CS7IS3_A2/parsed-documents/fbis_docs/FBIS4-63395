IF [INTERFAX]: What are the center's priorities in relations with regional governments? FILATOV: One of the main priorities is the signing of power sharing agreements with different parts of the country. The negotiating process is under way with Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria and Russia's western exclave of Kaliningrad. It will take some time to adopt an appropriate federal law. In the meantime, each individual republic or region tries to resolve the power sharing issue with Moscow in its own way. In my view, there are no serious rifts, let alone conflicts, between Russian regions or ethnic groups. The main difficulties are economic ones. IF: Despite recession, Russia appears to have been spared the trouble of major ethnic conflicts, doesn't it? FILATOV: I think it is most important to take advantage of the atmosphere of ethnic harmony to be able to meet the economic targets the government announced early this year. The thing is the government had failed to halt last year's production slump because of bitter political confrontation having, as it were, to start afresh this year.. But there must be a certain sequence in what we do. The government tried to put a firm lid on inflation which has led to a further fall in output. What we need most during this painful stage of redistribution of labor is political stability. The government faces a formidable job of luring new investment and technologies, providing job training programs and arranging redistribution of the workforce. It also has to contemplate the arrangement of public work and decide what is to be done with a would be army of unemployed. Yesterday, I had a meeting with the students of the Moscow Energy Institute only to face a barrage of criticism, most of it quite justified. I told the audience that most of its suggestions could have been put in place in normal conditions but when the government had to do so many things at a time. I am sure we will overcome all hardships on the path of reforms if people realize the need for civic peace. We will manage to achieve the economic targets the president set early this year. More importantly, it must be realized that we have had to live in warlike conditions for the past 80 years. Millions of people have died in various wars. Now is the time to get away from the negative trend and banish the very thought of civil confrontation.
