This was stated to ITAR-TASS today by Yevgeniy Bolshakov, State Duma deputy from the LDPR, who was the first representative of this party to visit Japan at the invitation of the Foreign Ministry as a member of the Russian parliamentary delegation. The delegation has left for Moscow today after its week-long stay here. The deputy said that of all political forces of Japan, the LDPR would like to maintain contacts with the LDPR. The program of the delegation had included a meeting with representatives of that party, which used to be the ruling party in Japan. Yevgeniy Bolshakov believes that in the course of this meeting "certain mutual understanding of the commonality of partisan interests of factions of both parties in their respective parliaments" was achieved. "Of course one cannot say that the two parties are alike, but it appears that the LDPR and the LDP of Japan have common concerns," he believes. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had extended invitations, via Bolshakov, to the leaders of the LDP of Japan to visit the congress of the Russian party which begins on 2 April in Moscow. However, ITAR-TASS was told in the headquarters of the LDP of Japan that no official document inviting party leaders to the LDPR forum in Moscow had been received, and doubt was expressed as to the feasibility of receiving it before the start of the congress. Asked whether the LDPR leader was planning to make a personal appearance in Tokyo, Yevgeniy Bolshakov said that Zhirinovskiy probably intends, in principle, "to take a closer look at Japan;" however, there are too many acute problems at home, and at least "April and May have been fully booked in his political diary."
