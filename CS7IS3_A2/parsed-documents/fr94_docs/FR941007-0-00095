FR941007-0-00095 FR941007-0-00024 The Coast Guard assumes that 1,234 existing non-tank vessels will prepare shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to meet the requirements of Regulation 26. In addition, the Coast Guard assumes that 284 existing tank vessels will prepare and submit combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and OPA 90 vessel response plans. The Coast Guard estimates that 16 ships will be constructed in the United States between April 4, 1993 and April 4, 1995. Therefore, the Coast Guard estimates that a total of 1,534 U.S. flag ships must comply with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. Based on hourly cost data of those required to comply with Regulation 26, it is estimated to cost $4,320.00 to prepare a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan. It is estimated to cost $855.00 to prepare the additional requirements of a VRP that complies with MARPOL Regulation 26. The total cost to respondents for initial plan preparation in the first year (1994) is estimated to be $5,642,820. In following years, the cost to industry will be based upon new vessels that need to prepare an initial plan and vessels already complying that need to make revisions and obtain annual certification. Review and revisions will take an average of 2 hours per vessel per year. Because an increasing number of new vessels will be preparing initial plans each year, the costs will change accordingly. The Coast Guard will review submitted shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to ensure compliance with Regulation 26. Total government costs associated with the review of the plans are estimated to be $423,228 in the first year (1994). Review of revisions and certification is expected to take an average of 0.75 hours per vessel per year. Again, the costs will change each year based on an increasing number of new vessels coming into service. The net present value of the cost for the first 3 years, discounted at 7 percent, is $5,626,297.25 to industry and $484,282.92 to the Coast Guard. The total net present value of the regulation for 1994, 1995, and 1996, is $6,110,580.17. The dollar value of direct societal benefits derived from the rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial. Historical data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, this program should improve response capabilities and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships. If efficiencies in the cleanup of spilled oil go up by only a small percentage, the savings that would accrue to the maritime industry and to the public would exceed the costs.
