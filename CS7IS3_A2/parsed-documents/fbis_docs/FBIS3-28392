The comrade general secretary heard reports from various party cadres on plans to carry out midterm conferences of provincial party organizations which are expected to take place in late February and March this year. Attendees at these conferences will discuss the political reports of the party organizations and elect supplementary members for provincial party committees in accordance with the party by-laws. [passage omitted] On direction for socioeconomic development of the central region provinces, the comrade general secretary pointed out that at present the central region still lags behind others in terms of economic development and living standards of local people. But the region also possesses latent strength and potential within its forest land, sea, minerals, geographical location, and especially the people here who inherit fine traditions of industriousness, intelligence, and brave and persistent determination in fighting against natural disasters and other enemies. These are advantages and conditions for a diversified development of the local economy. The general secretary stressed that the central region has a strategic position in terms of economic, security, and national defense. It is not true to say that the central government only cares about the other two regions and neglects the central one. The major water conservancy projects, the important hydroelectric projects in the central highlands, and the 500-kv electricity project are in the interests of the central region. We have at the same time too many things to be done and we have to do them in sequence aiming to serve the national interest in the principle of equality to all regions. The comrade general secretary urged the provincial authorities to find suitable and effective measures and strategies to develop economic potential, to build more water conservancy projects, to cover all empty lands and bare hills, and to develop other employment branches in order to promote industrialization. The localities also need to intensify their exports, limit and substitute imports, exploit the advantage of sea transport, and consolidate interaction between provinces in business relations with foreign countries. The comrade general secretary pointed out an issue that needs to be tackled urgently which is programs to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty for people in mountain and minority ethnic regions, as well as in former revolutionary bases. The programs need to motivate self-help consciousness among people and avoid a reliant attitude, and only in this way can socioeconomic development can be attained. He said: We are to be seriously blamed if we let the families of wounded soldiers and war dead live in poverty. We have to invest in building and developing the former revolutionary bases. We have to be just and fair in distribution of production materials and supplies as stipulated by the party resolution. The comrade general secretary said: To correctly carry out the two strategic tasks of building and safeguarding our fatherland, we must focus on building our party cleanly and steadfastly, and on heightening the militancy and self-control spirit among the party member contingent. The party members must exercise solidarity and attach utmost importance to mass motivation tasks in order to build up an all-people solidarity block. The party cadres should work for the people, be close to people, and not be revolutionary mandarins. All our work should be devoted to the development and prosperity of our country and the happiness of the people. [passage omitted] During their visit to Quang Nam-Danang, Comrades General Secretary Do Muoi and his entourage paid visits to several localities and families of peasants and fishermen who are among the poorest people in Zone 2, Phuoc Ly Ward in Danang city; and the Que Linh Village in Que Son District, 60-km from Danang, one of the former revolutionary bases which is still very poor. Comrade general secretary entered houses and warmly talked to the poor peasants and presented a number of new year gifts to families of wounded soldiers and war dead. He urged the party committees and local authorities to carry out effective measures to quickly solve socioeconomic problems of people in mountain and remote areas, with the prime attention focused on developing water conservancy projects. He said: I have been working for the revolution all my life and whenever I talk to peasants I always remember three main points: first, peasants must have their land; second, water conservancy is important; and third, capital must be available. In order to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty quickly, we must help peasants in these three areas. [passage omitted]
