Appearing on a televised conference organized by CNN at the network's Atlanta headquarters, Clinton referred to the current areas of tension, specifically in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and the South African elections, among other topics. He said the possibility of military intervention in Haiti must not be ruled out, although, according to him, the United States is doing everything possible to avoid having to resort to that option. Obviously justifying a possible decision of that sort, Clinton said Washington will not meddle in the affairs of other countries, but Haiti is a "case by itself," he explained. He said U.S. policy consists of doing everything possible to stop the killings and to restore democracy in Haiti, noting that that position will be rigorously upheld. Regarding events in Bosnia, the U.S. President said Atlantic Alliance aircraft will intervene if the Serbs resume aggressions against the UN-protected territory, in an action seeking to halt the war and promote negotiations, he said. He came out against lifting the sanctions imposed on Serbia until such time the efforts for a peaceful solution begin. He hailed the negotiation process between Israel and the PLO, which secured an agreement on Palestinian autonomy over Gaza and Jericho. He said that assistance to the tune of $2 million, which he considered a good figure to start off with, will be sent to Jericho. Asked about the results of the South African elections, the number one resident of the White House assessed the possibility of aiding the economic development of that country, which because of its capabilities hold a key role on the African Continent. He formally announced that $5 million will be sent to Rwanda, but did not say if the measures applied to Somalia will be feasible for Rwanda. Regarding the Middle East, today, Clinton said there are more possibilities of peace to guarantee the territorial integrity of Lebanon and to rid it of terrorism. Asked about North Korea, Clinton stressed that "we want to have open and friendly relations with Pyongyang and want it to have a constructive relationship with South Korea." He reiterated that Washington hopes North Korea will respect its commitments in matters of nuclear proliferation and noted that the solution is now "in the hands of Pyongyang." After making a brief analysis of ties between China and the United States over the past two decades, he said that this coming month, Washington will work arduously to smooth out differences between the two nations. In this sense, he mentioned the human rights situation in China, a topic of dispute between the two countries. He hailed the UN Security Council statement on making peacekeeping operations more effective and less costly.
