The completion of these two major interchange systems increased Shanghai's total capacity for long-distance communications interchange by 25 times over a decade ago and upgraded the degree of full automation of its long-distance communication to over 97 percent from 10 percent in 1985. It has been learned that the 10,000-line terminal program-controlled interchange system for international telephone calls, which was operational upon completion, has been put under a test run; while 10,000 long-distance lines of the 30,000-line terminal program-controlled interchange system for domestic calls have been opened to communications, with the remaining 20,000 reserved for future expansion.
