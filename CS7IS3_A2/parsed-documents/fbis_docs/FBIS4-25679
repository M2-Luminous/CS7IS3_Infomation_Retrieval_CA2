Owing to his background and character, some people call him the "commoner mayor," and because of his "rise" and merits, some people call him the "construction worker turned mayor." In any case, no matter how you address him, his unique character and characteristics as a mayor have been recognized unanimously. When people mention Zhang Baifa, their thoughts turn to a series of buildings put up in Beijing after the nation's founding because his name can be linked to many large and small construction projects in Beijing: From the eight major colleges, the Friendship Guest House, the Great Hall of the People, and the Museum of History in the 1950's, to the Asian Games Village, the project of transforming the second and third loops, the capital's airport expressway, the Beijing West Passenger Station, and the Healthy Housing Project in the 1990's. Zhang Baifa, who has been serving as vice mayor of Beijing since 1981 and thus has become an "elder having served four superiors," is in charge of urban construction. Along with the emergence of the magnificent breadth of spirit of the ancient capital -- Beijing -- and the successful organization of the 11th Asian Games in Beijing and Beijing's vigorous bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in the international community, Zhang Baifa's reputation and influence are no longer linked only to buildings in Beijing, but have followed the outward extension and expansion of construction projects to places outside the country, like China's sports undertakings -- flying across the ocean to places outside the mainland. "Think a Little -- In Fact, the Souvenirs Left by Life That Make People Feel Most Solid To See Are the Construction Workers" When the conversation came to Zhang Baifa's most favored old trade -- construction, he could not help being exultant, and his eyes, which have their own characteristics, became narrow lines, as he said happily: "I feel it is very meaningful to have a career in construction, I am really delighted to see the buildings of various styles in Beijing. Think a little -- in fact, the souvenirs left by life that make people feel most solid to see are the construction workers." In the West, people call architecture solidified music. However, whether in the West or in the East, architecture is a sign of human life. In October 1934, Zhang Baifa was born in a peasant household in Hebei's Xianghe County. He was a little kid, but he had to help his family make a living by cutting wood and weaving. He did not go to a primary school until he was 10 years old, and he stayed there for a year. In that time, his hometown was a guerrilla zone, so when he was in school, he and his family had to hide here and there because of the war against the Japanese. Later, Japan surrendered and the northeast was liberated, and they kept celebrating. Indeed, he did received very little education. He said when recalling the events in that period: "When I was in the school, my deepest impression was the liberation of Jinzhou. The first song we sang in school was `Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China.' In this way, we cultivated our plain feeling." In 1948, he was 14 years old, and he walked with his father from his hometown to Beiping [old name of Beijing], where they became individual operators engaged in the weaving business. Every day, day after day, when he opened his eyes, he would begin weaving, until he was very tired, then he would collapse onto the weaving machine and sleep; life became boring. He sighed and said: "In that time, the small business indeed could not earn any money, unlike today's individuals who can get rich very quickly; the phenomenon we see now is abnormal, and it shows that the government has many loopholes for them to get through." However, reflecting on the life which tempered him in that time, he said humorously: "In that time, I learned some technique, and that is, no interference could disrupt my sleep; therefore, now, no matter how noisy, I can sleep." In 1949, he returned to his hometown to see his mother, at a time when the CPC and the Kuomintang were fighting for control of Beiping. When he returned to the capital in 1950, Beijing was already controlled by the CPC. He lived in the Gongyuan area in the eastern part of Beijing. In those years, untidy earth mounds and rubbish heaps could be seen everywhere over there, and it was a neighborhood where poor people lived. Opposite the big complex where he lived, there was a big building under construction, to usher in the three-year period of revitalization and construction in Beijing. He was attracted by the flames and activities in the construction site, and whenever he finished the weaving job, he would try to enter the site to play. By coincidence, the workers specializing in reinforcing bars in the construction site lived in the complex where he lived, so he also learned how to tie up reinforcing bars. In 1951, he left the weaving machine and joined the construction trade, working as a reinforcing bar worker, and the first project he participated in was the three-storey People's Bank of China building. Entering the trade, he felt broad and independent. In those years, he received no wages, and he worked the whole day for eight jin of rice, but he was very content. Afterward, he moved to the huts inside construction sites, and there he lived for 16 years. He said: "In that time, we basically did not work in the winter, during which period we claimed 70 percent of our wages, and every day we were organized for studies -- to learn politics, `On Contradictions,' and so on. Some well-known professors from Beijing University came to give us lectures, and we really learned a lot of things." These studies also theoretically armed his work in the years to come. Thereafter, he joined the Communist Youth League, and became the leader of a small team. Soon after, a banner reading "Zhang Baifa's Young Reinforcing-Bar Commandos" was hoisted, and they fought here and there in the capital, winning great merits. Zhang Baifa and his commandos were commended as model workers for 11 consecutive years. He himself was elected a national advanced producer in 1956; in 1958 he was elected a deputy to the National People's Congress; and in 1959 he was granted a meeting with party and state leaders at a get- together party for national heroes. His name has been well-known since the 1950's. In 1965, Zhang Baifa officially took a leading post, serving as the deputy manager of the No. 3 Construction Company. He moved into his own office. Thereafter, he took the post of deputy party secretary of the company. During the Cultural Revolution, like other model workers, Zhang Baifa was brought down. He was transferred downward to the No. 2 Automobile Company in Hubei Province, where he still took charge of housing construction. In January 1973, he returned to Beijing. Thereafter, he served as the vice minister of the State Construction Commission. In 1981, he took the post of vice mayor of Beijing, and he has been serving in the post until now. At the request of this reporter, Zhang Baifa talked about the extraordinary relations he has with several senior leaders. Zhang Baifa's relations with Wan Li were established when the former was a model worker. He said: "In 1958, Wan Li was minister of the State Commission for Urban Construction, and on a certain occasion, he granted us a meeting, and I sat just next to him. He talked and we took down notes. He turned his head to look at my notes, which were written with untidy strokes, so he asked me what was my educational attainment, and I said I was a boor and illiterate. He criticized me: `Boor, no way! In the past you might say you were a boor and be proud of it; nowadays it is nothing of which to be proud. Lenin once said similar words that boors cannot construct socialism.'" Thereafter, in less than a year, Wan Li took office as vice mayor of Beijing, overseeing urban construction. Every year, he would send for the representatives of model workers like him for conversations. After Zhang Baifa became a cadre, Wan Li said to him: "You now have become an official, but if you have the thinking of an official then you are wrong. Only a bureaucrat will sit in the office, you must act like you did in the past, and go often to the grass-roots levels." During the Cultural Revolution, Wan Li was toppled, and Li Ruihuan, Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang -- the three model workers who were much favored by Wan Li -- also were toppled. On the eve of 1967, the Beijing Workers Stadium was scheduled for a 10,000-person meeting to denounce Wan Li, and Li Ruihuan, Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang were summoned to the meeting. Zhang Baifa disclosed that afterward, Wan Li still "proudly" said: In so many meetings for criticisms and denouncements, I am the most honored, for I am accompanied by three worker friends, and this shows that I still have the mass. During the meeting, Li Ruihuan wrote a couplet to denounce Wan Li: "In the past, scent wafted 10,000 miles; at present, stink is left for 10,000 years." Zhang Baifa added a horizontal scroll: "Starting from zero." After the meeting, Wan Li changed Zhang Baifa's scroll into "Staging a comeback," to explicitly encourage them not to become dejected, but to stage a comeback. Thereafter, they really staged a comeback. Unfortunately, one of their brothers, Shi Chuanxiang, who was a dung-collecter, passed away during the Cultural Revolution. According to information, even now, he and Li Ruihuan will go to see Wan Li together; and every New Year's Day they will jointly visit Shi Chuanxiang's family. "Even the Best National Banquet Cannot Match a Bowl of Hot Noodle Soup. Sometimes, You Must Spend Three Hours at a Banquet, and That Is Not Far From a Slow Suicide." Zhang Baifa, a mayor at the vice minister level, is naturally listed as a senior cadre, though he is different in many ways from a senior cadre as envisaged by the people. You can perceive this clearly from his body language and from his way of talking. The impression he gives people is: Easy-going, humorous, frank, and natural, like a commoner who is sincere and unrestrained. When this reporter entered his small and simple office, he asked his secretary to move a chair to a place in front of his desk, and said: "Do not sit on the sofa, sit here, so we are equal." Then, he asked in a straightforward manner: "What do you want to ask? What do you want to talk about?" Zhang Baifa is capable -- no doubt about it. His energy and hard work can be seen from the rapidly developing urban construction in Beijing during the years. In those eye-catching major projects and the busy construction sites where whole stretches of land are under development, one can see his silhouette here and there. In addition, on many public occasions, one often can see Zhang Baifa playing a special role. Being a vice mayor, he can have only a secretary, but because his work is really busy, he has been given one more secretary to help him. Even so, he is still very busy. During the interview, this reporter saw his secretary busily answer a series of phone calls, and a queue of people who came to the office. Zhang Baifa frankly said that in fact, the job he is doing should be done by a younger person because it requires a lot of energy and strength. Zhang Baifa can "speak with fervor and assurance," and this is known to all. When he starts to speak eloquently, with the Beijing accent, he can change the extremely serious and official "bureaucratic tone" into an extremely relaxed and humorous "people's saying," which can get at things very precisely, and is particularly acceptable to the common flock. Zhang Baifa dares to "talk freely," and always to let the common flock feel as comfortable as if they had spoken the words in their hearts. Speaking ideas frankly already has become a very peculiar characteristic of this charismatic official. Zhang Baifa also admitted that he likes to speak frankly and make jokes with various people. The saying goes: It is difficult to serve as an official in the capital. How would Zhang Baifa, who has already served as a people's official for more than a decade under the watchful eyes of the "court," sum up his way of running the government? He said frankly: I have reached this age, I can understand things, and I do not have any ambitions. In short, I do not struggle for dominance and benefits, I am not scared about being honored or insulted, and I do things for the people regardless of praise or criticism. To put it more straightforward: Accusations, complaints, and praises -- I listen to them all; good things, difficult things, and stupid things -- I do them all. Zhang Baifa has to attend many social functions, and he has had the experience of going to three banquets in one evening. It really is too much for him. He said: "Even the best national banquet cannot match a bowl of hot noodle soup. Sometimes, you must spend three hours at a banquet, and that is not far from a slow suicide. No matter what kind of banquet I eat, when I return home I must eat some rice or a bowl of noodles." Under the current situation, it is not something new for officials to attend banquets and "sacrifice." Zhang Baifa often eats lunch in his office; he has a pan in his office, and a bowl of "Master Fu Quick Noodles" plus some processing can easily become a gourmet's meal. Zhang Baifa, who turns 60 this year, said sentimentally when talking about the future: "I know every tree and blade of grass in Beijing, as well as every nook and cranny; I have feelings for them. I have traveled to almost every major city in the world to learn their architectural features, but eventually I still feel nowhere is better than China. I should have retired by now; I will be 63 when I complete this term of office. My goals during this term are: Thoroughly improve the environment along Changan Avenue, thoroughly improve the environment along the second loop, improve the environment along a section of the third loop, and solve problems for the 200,000 households whose average living space is four square meters. The construction of the Beijing International Airport; the Beijing West Passenger Station, which has an investment of 4.2 billion yuan; and the project of channeling natural gas from the northwest to Beijing have to be completed. Regrettably, the project of diverting water from the south to the north cannot be completed during my term of office, for it can only be completed by 2000, but I still will be able to see it. If all these things can be done, I will die content."
