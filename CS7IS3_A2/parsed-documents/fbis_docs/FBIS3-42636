Russia's role in today's world is the subject of continuous debate abroad. In spite of all the current difficulties, many believe in the democratic aims of Russian foreign policy, Russia's commitment to the principles and standards of international law, and its wish to join the club of civilized states as quickly as possible. Not everyone, however, is pleased with the course of Russian domestic reform. The suggestion that "great-power" tendencies in Russian foreign policy are growing stronger has been instilled in the minds of the world public recently. References to the "Russian threat" seem to be back in vogue. It is interesting that they were given this new lease on life by the same politicians who used them so successfully in the cold war years. They include former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who believes that Russia intends to gain "control over the policies of neighboring countries" and weaken the North Atlantic alliance. Another former U.S. secretary of state, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has advised the creation of a new regional political group, consisting of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, to counteract all types of "encroachments" by Moscow. Sam Nunn, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, has also spoken of Moscow's plans to restore the "empire." One of the foreign political analysts' favorite ploys is the allegation that interethnic conflicts within the geopolitical boundaries of the former USSR are being "instigated" by the Russian leadership. They have said that the results of the December elections might tempt Moscow to "obscure" its weak domestic policy with foreign policy adventurism. Russia's natural wish to defend the rights of the Russian-speaking population in the former Soviet republics is also seen as a sign of its "great-power" ambitions. Moscow's diplomatic moves are interpreted as nothing other than political pressure and economic blackmail. Russia's desire to eliminate discriminatory trade barriers, which we inherited from the cold war and which are preventing the natural integration of the Russian economy into the world market economy, has also been called a "great-power" objective. Statements of this kind are made more frequently just before major international economic conferences, such as the recent Tokyo summit of the "Big Seven." Russia's ideas about peacekeeping efforts have also been described as "neo-imperialism." The use of these terms is certain to undermine Russia's international image during the resolution of conflicts within the territory of the former Union and question its ability to act as a neutral and trustworthy peacemaker. The efforts of Russian diplomats to give Russian troops the status of CSCE "blue helmets" in zones of interethnic conflict are interpreted as unconcealed attempts at new "alterations" of the Eurasian continent. London's INDEPENDENT even suggested that the offer of economic aid to Russia should be conditional upon Western restrictions on the "intervention" by Russian troops in the affairs of nearby foreign countries. It is Russia, however, that has the necessary military, political, and technical resources for this. Officials in Kiev also like to talk about the "imperial claims." When Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council for Foreign Affairs Pavlychko was in Riga recently, for example, he said that Russia's foreign policy theories are once again acquiring "chauvinistic overtones, because Russia wants to turn everyone, especially Ukraine, back into colonies or sections of the Russian empire." Most of the lies about Russia's "imperial inclinations" originate in the Baltic countries. This is far from a complete list of the remarks about Russia's "great-power chauvinism." What is the reason for these unfounded allegations? After the dissolution of the USSR, many Western political scientists were quick to conclude that Russia had lost the status of a great power forever, but their predictions were fated not to come true. Russia is a huge country with the right to its own voice in world politics and in the regions of its immediate concerns. After all, during periods of crisis, the United States can call the Middle East or Latin America a zone of U.S. strategic interests, and this arouses virtually no public objections. Russia's actions in neighboring countries, on the other hand, are invariably seen as "authoritarianism and chauvinism," even though interethnic conflicts along the perimeter of Russia's borders could have a direct effect on Russian security interests. The unfounded criticism of Moscow was noticeably more vehement when centripetal tendencies took the foreground within the Commonwealth. This was due to more than just the need to restore severed economic ties. The unsuccessful attempts of our neighbors to join international structures and alliances have become increasingly apparent. There is not much reason to rely on economic aid from the West, and this is why all eyes are turning back to Russia. The results of the Ashgabat summit corroborated this. When participants elected the president of the Russian Federation to serve as CIS chairman for the next six months, they underscored Russia's leading role, including its leading position in the security sphere. The goal of Russian foreign policy is the preservation of Russia's own national interests and national identity. We must secure strategic stability in the post-Soviet zone within the guidelines of accepted standards and rules of behavior in the democratic world. What does this have to do with "great-power" ambitions?
