The JAERI, in collaboration with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) , will conduct experiments simulating accidents using JAERI' s large-scale test facility (LSTF) . They will continue for one year to collect the basic data necessary to meet AP600 design qualifications. The LSTF can simulate the functions of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) of 1. 1 millionkW output. The height and position of the equipment are almost the same as an actual PWR, but the volume is 1/48 that of an actual PWR. It can examine what occurs in the reactor at the time of the accident by simulating the coolant' s flow rates in the reactor. The UPS. asked the JAERI in 1992 to make safety evaluations of the AP600 using their high performance LSTF, the world' s largest such facility. In response to the request, the JAERI modified the LSTF to conform to the structure of the gravity injection-type emergency core cooling system (ECCS) of the AP600 and finally began experimenting. The first experiment conducted on the 14th confirmed that the ECCS operated properly to cool down the core by simulating conditions under which a 2.5 cm diameter hole would develop in a pipe in the reactor. To collect comprehensive data, one test per month will be conducted hereafter by simulating conditions created by damage of much larger scale.
