Based on the principle of vigorously promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Tibet's economy, financial departments in Tibet will give full play to their role in overall financial regulation and control and in optimizing the allocation of resources.

[Video shows a person speaking into a microphone and a caption saying he is Ouzhu Lanjie (2962 3796 2597 2638), deputy director of the People's Bank of China Tibet Branch] [Begin recording] [Ouzhu Lanjie] As far as the entire nation is concerned, 1994 is a very important year for the reform of the financial system. The general outline for reform of the national financial system has been drawn up and reform measures will be carried out this year. However, because it is different from other regions, Tibet is still at the preparatory stage of financial reform. We must carry out these financial reform measures to follow the general trend. In coordination with reform by financial institutions, we have made some important adjustments in Tibet's financial work this year. These adjustments will be focused on financial work in rural and pastoral areas. Based on the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee's Financial Work Conference and Rural Work Conference, and the National Financial Work Conference, we have increased our investment in farming and animal husbandry sector. Last year, we increased credits for farming and animal husbandry sector by 16.7 percent over the previous year. This year, on the basis of such a high percentage of increase last year, we will increase the investment of credits in farming and animal husbandry sector by 30 percent over last year. The investment of credits in village and town enterprises will be even greater. We will increase the credits for village and town enterprises by 37 percent from last year. Farming and animal husbandry sector is a very important part of Tibet's economy. We should focus our financial work on farming and animal husbandry sector and increase credits for farming and animal husbandry production in rural and pastoral areas. We will extend more loans on easy terms to the farming and animal husbandry sector. Moreover, we have made a careful and complete plan to help poverty- stricken rural and pastoral areas shake off poverty and improve their living standards. We arranged a low-interest loan with far more favorable conditions than other kinds of loans to help poor areas. At the same time, banks and credit cooperatives at all levels will pay special attention to assist-the-poor work and make the best use of the funds for eliminating poverty. [end recording]
