After a weekend of internal consultation, it is clear that the PvdA and D66 now want to press ahead quickly with the formation of a government. But the VVD in particular still has objections on some major points. "Bolkestein cannot go to the party with these proposals," VVD members say. Serious complications have also arisen because the CPB [Central Planning Bureau] has proposed, independently of the negotiators, intervention in the politically sensitive area of the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The CPB proposal is that people must have worked for at least five years before qualifying for any entitlement to disability benefit. Such a proposal is not included in the plans of Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein (VVD), and Van Mierlo (D66). Last week, the three party leaders sent an adapted draft accord to the CPB experts, with the request to test the soundness of the social, economic, and financial plans. The austerity measures totaling some 20 billion guilders [G] were to produce at least 100,000 extra jobs while sharply reducing the tax burden, achieving a modest reduction in the public debt, and, at least for those on low wages, bringing no more than a limited reduction in spending power. On Friday [17 June] came the reply from the CPB. It seems that the CPB rejected a major item of expenditure cuts put forward by the three political leaders. The new WAO law includes a compulsory reexamination of all those registered as disabled. This reexamination is supposed to result in many people, the Social Affairs Ministry expects as many as 130,000, no longer being declared disabled or being classed in a lower category of disablement. This would then save G750 million. The CPB believes that Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo are banking on something that is far from guaranteed. The savings expected by the Social Affairs Ministry are based on no more than 4,000 reexaminations. The CPB considers it irresponsible to count on savings on such a scale on this basis. On its own authority the CPB has issued a proposal which does indeed provide for considerable savings. Under this proposal, anyone who wants to be considered for disability benefit must first have worked for at least five years. Essentially, this means that young people will be unable to qualify for disability benefit. Such a rule has been applied in Germany for almost 10 years now. The measure was also included in the VVD's election program. The CPB's suggestion was rejected out of hand in PvdA circles yesterday. The PvdA has already suffered some traumatic experiences through trying to meddle with the WAO. In the election campaign it always stressed the need to first wait and see how beneficial the new regulation proves to be. Criticism of the CPB is growing within the PvdA and D66 in particular. "Anybody who thinks that Zalm's computer (Zalm is the head of the CPB) can accurately predict the future is simply insane," one D66 member said. The VVD remains very critical of a large part of the planned cuts. It considers G6 billion of these cuts to be very questionable. The VVD finds proposed spending cuts on defense, transport, and communications of G1 million unacceptable. The CPB predicts that it will be 1998 before the public debt is brought down to 3 percent. If the timetable of the Lubbers-Kok government had been maintained, this percentage could have been achieved in 1994. The VVD also objects to this. All three parties consider that reducing the tax burden by G9 billion is going to provide too few extra jobs. The CPB predicts that it will produce no more than 72,000. An additional difficulty is that the CPB computer only comes up with the figure of 72,000 extra jobs if employers are exempted from a premium that they must now pay for employees. The loss of this premium would have major consequences for spending power.
