In an interview with THE NATION, Tharin responded to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggestion urging the Thai government to cautiously deal with possible high inflation. Tharin said that the Bank of Thailand is still able to "fine tune" the economy. Moreover, the Finance Ministry has maintained discipline in government's spending, he said. He said that he got an assurance from the Bank of Thailand that the inflation rate would not exceed 4.5 per cent by the end of this year. Although the inflation rate in the first quarter was 4.8 per cent, Tharin said that the rate increased by only 3.7 per cent over the past 12 months. In the first quarter of 1993, the inflation rate rose by 3.3 percent over the previous year. Tharin attributed the 5 percent inflation rate in January to the rise in farm prices. The central bank has already informed him that farm prices will be soon reduced, he noted. "The IMF suggestion came as result of the brief observation from two or three IMF staffers who visited Thailand only for a few days. At any rate, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand have been particularly aware of the inflation rate," he said. Tharin said that the inflation was largely caused by inadequate good supply, not the government's excessive expenditure. "I still believe Thailand will be able to control the inflation rate at 4.5 per cent, while the real economic growth rate should be 8 per cent on an annual basis," he said. Tharin added that he expects the private sector will participate more in the investment sector in the near future. "My prime concern, instead, is slower growth in domestic savings," Tharin said. He said that he has assigned the Bank of Thailand to find out the cause of the marginal growth in domestic savings; whether money was transferred to other types of investment such as mutual funds and has not been brought back into the system. Tharin stressed that the Finance Ministry will keep the government's expenditure below Bt[baht]715 billion in 1995. Although the government has to spend Bt32 billion on a salary rise for civil servants, Tharin said the pay rise is unlikely to cause inflation problems. [passage omitted]
