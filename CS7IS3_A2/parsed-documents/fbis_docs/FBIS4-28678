Over this period, the United States has not kept, even a little, the principles of the joint statement. Instead, it has been the subject of ridicule and denouncement by the people throughout the world because of their intentional aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Up to date since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was issued, approximately 150 countries throughout the world and a great many international and regional organizations have held rallies and demonstrations to urge the United States to sincerely implement the principles agreed upon by the two sides of the DPRK and the United States. Also, they have severely denounced the treacherous act of the United States by releasing statements, press statements, and articles.
