It has reached a consensus with leaders in units in charge of education and with economic and scientific and technical units, experts, and people doing actual work about major problems in correlating the socialist market economy with reform of the educational system. Change From the Old to the New System: Development Faces Conspicuous Problems The development and reform of education faces numerous new problems in the current process of changing from the old to the new system. Some of these problems are still very prominent. They are manifested in the following three regards: 1. The priority development of education has not truly been accorded a strategic position. The emphasis on inputs of material resources and the slighting of the development of manpower resources that has long existed in China's economic construction has still not been fundamentally reversed. Some comrades in charge regard development of the economy as a mandatory task, but development of education as an optional task. In the process of accelerating economic construction, a mistaken idea has developed that "the economy must be improved rapidly but education need not be looked after," and that "education must yield to the economy." In the zeal to get on with economic projects, build office buildings, auditoriums, guest houses, and hostels, and put up development zones, investment in education is slighted, or money for education is even diverted to other purposes, and a serious situation exists everywhere of teachers not receiving the wages they should receive. 2. Reform of China's present educational system still lags behind the need for economic system reform. On the one hand, schools still do not have the mechanisms they should have to operate as they see fit, to develop themselves, and to restrain themselves. On the other hand, government functions have not been genuinely transformed. No effective macroeconomic control system has begun to be built; new troubles and problems have risen in education; and overall direction, regulation, and control are not vigorous. The subject matter, the precepts, and the teaching methods used in education in China today do not meet needs for building socialism and developing a socialist market economy; the number, the make-up and caliber, and the standards set for human talent being trained do not satisfy requirements for development of the economy and the society; and overall returns from education and returns from the operation of schools are not high. 3. Getting money for education has become harder. The problem of a lack of continuity and an outflow of personnel from the teaching corps is serious. Fiscal outlays for education have long languished around a low 12 percent. The inauguration of some measures of a political nature in recent years has actually put a damper on the raising of funds for education through many channels. Not only does the level of investment in education not meet the ever increasing need for education in the development of a market economy and society, but it can hardly satisfy basic needs for development of existing educational endeavors. During 1992, public expenditures for middle school and primary school education in more than half of the country's provinces showed negative growth. Only 8.4 percent of the experimental equipment needed in primary schools was made available, and in five provinces and cities, it was less than 1 percent. Nationwide 15 million square meters of middle and primary schools are in dangerous buildings, and in some provinces and autonomous regions, the percentage of dangerous middle and primary school buildings has taken varying degrees of upturn. Because of the increase in the population base figure, during the final 7 years of the twentieth century, the number of pupils in middle and primary schools will increase by 34 million. Unless effective measures were taken, the goal of 9 years of compulsory education nationwide will be difficult to attain. Money for institutions of higher education is extremely scarce. For quite a few schools, after deducting for price rises, the actual amount of money for school operation has decreased year after year. The problem of the overly low salaries of professors has remained unsolved for a long time. In 1992, several hundred thousand middle and primary school teachers nationwide left the teaching profession, most of them first-rate teachers having advanced degrees. A survey of 95 institutions of higher education showed the loss of 27 percent of young teachers between 1981 and 1989. In addition to those who went abroad, 48 percent went into high salary corporations and firms. [passage omitted]
