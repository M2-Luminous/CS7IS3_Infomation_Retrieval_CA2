Boucher stressed that the Cypriots, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, "have a common geography, history, and culture," and added that diversity among Cypriots is a unique advantage. He called upon the participants to turn Cyprus into a regional base for businesses in the radically developing markets of Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. The U.S. ambassador mentioned that the separate economies on the island each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and stressed that they would be a lot more effective if they pooled their funds, which could help to improve the lives of all citizens. Boucher was speaking before 250 people from both communities at the fifth annual intercommunal coordinating meeting, organized by the UN High Commission for Refugees at the UN Headquarters in Nicosia International Airport. An unacceptable incident marred the conclusion of the meeting. UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] soldiers refused to allow the Greek Cypriot reporters to return to the free areas from Nicosia International Airport. The UNFICYP cited the force's rules that for security reasons reporters need to leave the area accompanied by UNFICYP men. They also tried to confiscate the television crews' cameras. Nicosia Mayor Lellos Dhimitriadhis resolved the dispute following a heated discussion between the UNFICYP men and the Greek Cypriot reporters. He pointed out to the men of the force that he was representing the Republic of Cyprus, which hosts the United Nations, and assured them that all the Greek Cypriot reporters were present at the meeting.
