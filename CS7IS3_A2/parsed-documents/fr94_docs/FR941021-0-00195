A new §25.213 is added to read as follows: §25.213 Inter-Service coordination requirements for the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service. (a) Protection of the radio astronomy service in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band against interference from 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service systems. (1) Protection zones. All 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile Satellite Service systems shall be capable of determining the position of the user transceivers accessing the space segment through either internal radiodetermination calculations or external sources such as LORAN&hyph;C or the Global Positioning System. During periods of radio astronomy observations, land mobile earth stations shall not operate when located within geographic protection zones defined by the radio observatory coordinates and separation distances as follows: (i) In the band 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz, within a 160 km radius of the following radio astronomy sites: ␣ 1Observatory 1Latitude (DMS) 1Longitude (DMS) Arecibo, PR 18 20 46 66 45 11 Green Bank Telescope, WV 38 25 59 79 50 24 ␣ 38 26 09 79 49 42 Very Large Array, NM 34 04 43 107 37 04 Owens Valley, CA 37 13 54 118 17 36 Ohio State, OH 40 15 06 83 02 54 (ii) In the band 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz, within a 50 km radius of the following sites:
