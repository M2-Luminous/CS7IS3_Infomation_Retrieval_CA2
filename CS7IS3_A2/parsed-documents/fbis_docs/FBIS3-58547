The current discussion about relaxing arms export guidelines should suit you very well. [Schroeder] I am definitely the wrong person to talk to about this matter. I have never called for relaxing arms export guidelines. In my opinion, the current discussion is most superfluous. If statistics are right, Germany ranks third among arms exporters. The existing law says that the Federal Security Council has to examine whether exceptions should be made in individual cases -- and we are only talking about arms exports outside NATO. Changing this procedure would be politically wrong and economically unnecessary. [Hesse] But it sounded quite different before. Or did we misunderstand your interventions? [Schroeder] I am one of the people who occasionally speak out for utilizing the full resources of the existing arms industry. However, I am opposed to misunderstanding arms production as a means of economic control. You can see the results of this approach in Bavaria: I get the impression that Franz Josef Strauss' successors would rather not have inherited the military-industrial structures with which the late minister-president attempted his Bavarian economic miracle. [Hesse] And yet, in connection with closing down the Daimler-Benz daughter company Dasa, you demanded that the Eurofighter project be reassessed, a project that had been rejected by the Social Democratic Party of Germany for years. [Schroeder] I said that one must understand the Bavarian minister-president demanding that production be set out and predictable. I never said that this should mean establishing new resources. This would be very problematic. Just how problematic this would be, can be seen in the United States at the moment: They have even more excess resources in the arms industry, and thus greater problems. [Hesse] Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz Chief Edzard Reuter has threatened that he would close down more resources at the Lemwerder Dasa works, or even transfer the entire production abroad, unless the export guidelines are relaxed. Could you be blackmailed into something there? [Schroeder] Leaving the fuss aside, what Reuter demands are clear conditions. But these can only be had in Bonn. [Hesse] Those advocating a more offensive arms export policy argue that Germany would not be sufficiently able to act in foreign policy matters otherwise. [Schroeder] I cannot follow this line. On the contrary: It would make sense to apply the obviously right, peace-oriented German regulations to all of Europe. Following the experience of two World Wars instigated by Germany, it would be appropriate for Germany to lead a movement for arms export control. [Hesse] Have you -- for the sake of jobs in our country -- completely abandoned the idea of converting arms production into civilian production? [Schroeder] Nonsense. Of course, I am in favor of conversion. But this is a medium- to long-term objective. It is of no use in the short term, if existing resources are not utilized, as is the case in Lemwerder. [Hesse] Does this mean: Schroeder is against arms exports, but in favor of armament if it secures jobs? [Schroeder] No. Schroeder is in favor of facts that can be kept, that one can rely on. Lemwerder has nothing to do with exports. Helmut Kohl recently told the minister presidents of the laender that he is opposed to arms exports as an instrument of economic policy. If this now becomes a topic in the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], I wonder whether there are people within the CDU who are out to get Kohl. [Hesse] But your submarines for Taiwan would not have been compatible with German export guidelines, either. [Schroeder] That is wrong. Such a contract would have been in line with the guidelines. The Federal Security Council made a different decision in this matter because it thought it had to make concessions to the government of the People's Republic of China. Shortly afterwards, supplying warships to Indonesia did not pose any problem. This means, it is a question of specific political decisions. It does not require any legal changes.
