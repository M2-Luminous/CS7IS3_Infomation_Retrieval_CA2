Zhigalin: "Hopes of Regional Independence Melt in Greater Kiev"] [Text] As an example, one fact revealing the industrial infrastructure of our region. Despite its powerful production potential, Donetsk Oblast works for itself only 9 percent, the rest--production of the means of production. In today's economic chaos, when relations with other regions of the former Union have been severed, we are colossally vulnerable. It is now essential to move away from single-commodity works, introduce the latest technology, and switch to the region's self-support. But how is this to be done? The idea for the development of a model of regional government, namely, economic independence, which would make it possible to extricate the oblast's national economic sectors from the crisis, was born in the latter half of 1992. Approximately 200 of the best minds, not just of our region, embarked on this work. About 40 academic higher educational institutions and research and planning institutes were plugged into this effort. A comprehensive program of social and economic development for the Donbass was prepared in a very short space of time. It passed expert evaluation at all levels and gained high marks. It seemed that the life of our region would now be running in a different channel, in which, thanks to the region's independence, industrial potential and agricultural and, what is most important, social potential would begin to operate anew. "But today our program is 'spinning its wheels,'" V.L. Nakonechnyy, first deputy chief of the oblast administration and president of the Foundation for the Support of Progressive Reforms, said at a news conference. "Kiev is still reluctant to give the regions even a piece of independence, which would enable us to resolve our problems ourselves. All our hopes are 'drowning' in offices of the capital, where people are keeping a firm hold on power. We, however, want just one thing--give each region its rights, and each region should live on its own earnings. These are normal living conditions in world practice...." For the comprehensive program to start to work it is essential that today the Supreme Council adopt a whole number of legislative documents. Its old composition is not that ready to agree to this. For this reason the Foundation for the Support of Progressive Reforms has resolved to form in the course of the present parliamentary elections its own team which undertakes to finish what has been started. The developers of the program have nominated candidates for deputy.... In the course of the news conference V.L. Nakonechnyy and I.P. Navka, executive director of the Foundation, told journalists how introduction of the program is being promoted, for all that. There are already potential investors, who will invest money in a restructuring of the economy of the Donbass. And nothing would be holding them back were there a law both protecting the investors' money and determining regional independence. But Kiev does not have the time for this. It does not want to understand that only strong regions will benefit Ukraine.
