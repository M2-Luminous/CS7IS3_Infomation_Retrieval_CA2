Robaina also stressed the importance of the summit and contacts with other Ibero-American delegations: [Robaina] We have highly diverse views, as President Fidel clearly explained last night. We have no problem with discussing democracy and human rights. Cuba has much to say about democracy and human rights. There are many points of view. If this is discussed at a closed door meeting, we will make our point at a closed door meeting no matter the subject. Cuba has its own opinions and views. [Correspondent] Yet, that discussion has wasted time that could have been spent on the summit's main issues. [Robaina] It is not a matter of wasting time that could have been spent on other issues. Actually, an overloaded agenda could be wasting the time that could be spent on other issues. In that sense, the summit has a broader agenda. No other summit matches this one. Just as we make an effort to [word indistinct] Fidel's contacts with different presidents -- such as the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, and Bolivia -- as well as the other presidents who are also in the process of bilateral discussions. The foreign ministries' technical teams, as well as the foreign ministers, are working hard. The first two sections of the final draft of the final document were completed recently. This request, which it now seems will not be necessary to include, is currently the only component of this draft. The document is expected to be approved this afternoon. When so many presidents gather for such an important meeting, it is often the case that we do not have enough time to get to everything. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you think the paragraph on the U.S. blockade against Cuba that was included in the final document will be altered during the afternoon session? [Robaina] I do not want to get ahead of myself. That paragraph has already gone through many processes. I can say that it is one paragraph that was approved with the least resistance. That paragraph already exceeds what was accomplished in Cartagena...[pauses] in Salvador-Bahia. Participants were asked if they objected to any of the document's points before it was presented to the Colombian Foreign Ministry for completion. Not one country objected to that particular paragraph. That paragraph...[pauses] The meeting, regardless of yesterday's [words indistinct], is to improve. Some may even be astonished that we approved the paragraph and that [word indistinct] the word blockade does not appear because there seemed to be a problem with its definition. Some of the people who spoke yesterday have as strong an opinion on this matter as we do. The great majority of those present voted in favor of Cuba at the UN General Assembly on something that is much more significant than this paragraph. Therefore, I do not think this will mean anything to us. The rest of the proposals are all included in the document. The most important thing was for us to have the opportunity to express our views during the time allotted to us and to have opinions and points of view on issues that would make way for a debate and take advantage of the Colombian Government's proposal of turning this meeting into a real debate rather than the reading of speeches brought from outside. [Correspondent] We have heard many opinions by foreign ministers on yesterday's [word indistinct] by the commander. [Robaina] Yes, and I believe that you were more surprised than we were. There are many opinions. Undoubtedly, when one explains positions...[pauses] For example, I have found many people who say that issues were brought to the table once and for all, as they should be. I believe there are those who do not share his views because they may not feel at liberty, perhaps, to express the things that our president has expressed. Undoubtedly, they might be concerned. Nevertheless, Cuba did not come for the other 22 participants to share its views unanimously. Cuba has come so that its point of view is included in the analysis. We have all the authority, morale, history -- especially our president -- to express our points of view clearly and plainly. That is very important to me. Many people congratulated the Cuban delegation and Fidel last night for having brought the issues to the table. We will have to get used to the fact that some will like what we say while others will not. We do not say things just to get others to agree. We express our positions and principles. That is why they have been expressed with strength. Several people have approached Fidel to congratulate him on his actions and to say...[pauses] The best indicator was the room filling up so quickly, unlike anything else that had happened during the day. There was a special silence when our president expressed his views. It is important that you realize that harsh, strong, and firm statements such as those will not have unanimous backing from those who do not want to commit to what we are discussing. We should not doubt this because the absence of opinions does not necessarily mean that they disagree. It could also mean that they prefer not to be publicly sympathetic in light of other types of pressure. Many public statements have been made on Cuba's participation in the summit despite all of this. [Correspondent] Does the final document include the economic and trade agreements reached at the summit? [Robaina] The final document includes an important part of our recommendations. It still does not constitute a true platform for the integration that should follow. It is unrealistic to think that the potential for economic integration that we see in America can be met during just one summit. Today, the Cuban delegation will be able to present its views on Cuban reality, how investments are progressing, and how we are less united and less integrated than ever today. That is the phenomenon that we face. We will not achieve this kind of integration with one strong document. We can achieve a stronger integration if all the presidents and delegations leave here willing to put these things into action. [Correspondent] Speaking of these small meetings, perhaps Cuba can enter the Group of Three easier than any of the other groups? [Robaina] Cuba did not come -- people have constantly been asking me this in the halls -- to seek membership in the OAS or any other specific regional or subregional group. The fact that we did not come for that purpose, however, does not mean that we are excluded. We have not closed the door on any possibility. Because we do not talk as much about [words indistinct]. We wish Latin America had a true [word indistinct]. That is what we want to accomplish. Cuba has not closed the door on any type of bilateral review with any country, even though at this moment and in midst of such a complex program you can understand that we have other priorities. Economic advancement will allow us to enter into any group based on the principles that we respect, love, and defend. Cuba wanted...[pauses] That's why we were dissatisfied last night. How is it possible for such a meeting to be called and for Latin America not to have a common position with or without Cuba? Once again, this demonstrates how, before this meeting, which we salute and respect, we put aside our participation and our particular interests as a country. Many have called to express their satisfaction with Fidel saying that he salutes the summit with very good intentions and that he respects the rights of others to have their own opinions, as some do. This is all that is needed to discuss true dialogue, unlike what the press, which has been following us around the hallways, has said, namely that we come here to express our views and do not accept contradicting views. That is not true. We accept and listen to anything they want to say. They, however, must listen to us as well. That is the phenomenon. Some began talking and thought that no one would refute those views. Of course not. We spoke yesterday, and we may have to speak today. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, I just want to point out that everyone praised Fidel at yesterday's news conference. My question is: Has anyone said anything about the U.S. observers at the summit? [Robaina] The matter has not been discussed. We should not have to address [deshacer] an issue that torments us. U.S. observers have been mentioned basically because they are preparing the famous summit. The observers will take with them what we think of the summit. In other words, why make an issue of this? In this way, no one has to bring them Cuba's message on this summit being unnecessary. Cuba is not afraid. They are here primarily to learn about how to organize a summit. It seems that this is motivating their presence. I am sure they have a positive impression of what has taken place here. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, the media has been making a great deal about the commander's attire. [Robaina] He was asked about this in public yesterday. I do not believe...[pauses] This generates all the speculation on whether it is a new style or if it is the beginning of something new. Let there be no doubt: He will continue wearing his olive green attire. The fact of the matter is that we are honoring the summit organizers' request despite response to the uniform being positive everywhere, including Cuba. We received a written request for the presidents to dress informally, in a guayavera or shirt. Our president honored the request, proving even more that he is not an obstinate man when it comes to history, a promise, or the olive green uniform. The host country requested informal dress, and Fidel came informal. It was big news. Rest assured that he did not do it to make news and that [words indistinct] in olive green. Although this left a magnificent impression on Havana, let us not get carried away. Some have said that it marks the beginning of the end. If changing Cuba were as easy as changing into a guayavera, we would have sewn many guayaveras a long time ago. [Correspondent] The guayavera is a symbol of Cubanism. [Robaina] Yes, but it is superficial. To those who say that Fidel is incapable of this or that, there you have it. This also demonstrates Fidel's ability to adapt to the place, the moment, and the conditions. Some said this was impossible. The people in Havana with whom I was talking say they are traumatized by the guayavera. They cannot wait to see if he will wear the guayavera in Havana. That is a phenomenon. He is wearing a guayavera and blue slacks today. Let us not start describing his socks, etc...[laughs] [Correspondent] How did Cuba receive Bolivia's statements following the commander's address? [Robaina] Many expressed satisfaction with Fidel's address. Brazilian President Itamar Franco and many others expressed satisfaction. Fidel's statements were obviously not in agreement with some of the addresses presented there. If you review past summits, you can see that many others begin to publicly express themselves in favor of Cuba, in addition to those who are concerned and sympathetic toward Cuba. Even though we are not where we would like to be at the moment, the number of people who dare speak out is much higher than in past years. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. [Robaina] Regarding diplomatic relations with Honduras, I must point out that we do not have diplomatic relations with three or four of the countries that are present. Nevertheless, the absence of formal diplomatic relations does not keep us from having contacts that allow us to talk about our relations even if they are not diplomatic. I wish to stress that Cuba is neither preoccupied nor obsessed nor [words indistinct] steps that have been taken. We express this to everyone. President Castro himself expressed that to President Reina today. We do not want the Honduran people to feel any pressure from Cuba to establish diplomatic relations because we already communicate with them. Honduras must determine when conditions are appropriate because on our side there are no conditions.
