FBIS4-65189 "drweu093aa_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IAEA Inspectors To Travel to DPRK on 14 May IAEA Inspectors To Travel to DPRK on 14 May AU1205113394 Paris AFP in English 1109 GMT 12 May 94 AU1205113394 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Vienna, May 12 (AFP) -- A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will head to North Korea Saturday [14 May] to inspect nuclear sites, the Agency's spokesman David Kyd said Thursday. Kyd said the inspectors would travel as planned Saturday unless the Agency learned by then that Pyongyang had gone ahead with the replacement of fuel rods in a disputed reactor at Yongbyon. According to the South Korean [as received] news agency YONHAP, Pyongyang agreed to an IAEA request to postpone the replacement of the fuel rods until the arrival of the inspectors but added that it could not delay the replacement any longer than that date. "We can't delay the replacement of the spent fuel rods forever for security reasons," Kim Chong-su, the assistant to the North Korean ambassador to the UN, told YONHAP. "We have to replace the rods because we have reached the red mark which if you're driving in a car means you're out of oil." An IAEA team was denied access to the five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in March in order to collect samples of some of the spent fuel to determine whether any of it was diverted for military purposes. Kyd said that the upcoming trip would last eight days although it could be extended if deemed necessary. He said that although the inspectors would not be allowed to accomplish their full mission "they will be able to do most of their work, which is satisfactory for us." He added that there were no plans for the inspectors to do any work on the five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which the United States suspects of being used to produce nuclear weapons. The IAEA has invited experts from North Korea to Vienna for talks on narrowing differences over the controversial replacement of the rods, but so far Pyongyang has not responded to the offer, Kyd said.
