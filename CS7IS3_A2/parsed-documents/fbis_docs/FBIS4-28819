The plan is contained in a draft of the subcommittee's interim report, which will be officially finalized on June 20, the sources said. Under a current oil products import law, only oil refiners can import such oil products. The report, however, will propose the law be scrapped in March 1996, they said. Instead, the report will call for the government to introduce a new law to liberalize imports of petroleum products with some limitations. The import liberalization will allow trading firms having no oil refining facilities to import petroleum products to help the government promote deregulation of the petroleum industry. When the interim report is officially adopted, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy will begin drafting a new law with the aim of it being enacted at an ordinary Diet session next year, they said.
