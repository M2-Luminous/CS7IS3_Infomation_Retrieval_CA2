Fondo yesterday. In reply to Afonso Dhlakama's accusation that the general is linked to deals involving arms smuggling to South Africa, Gen. Fondo said -- without too much conviction -- that he denied Dhlakama's charges and that the Renamo leader should present his complaints to the right authorities. In appearance at least, Gen. Domingos Fondo was very much at ease during his meeting with the press. The allegation that he was involved in smuggling weapons to neighboring South Africa fell like a bomb in this country and in southern Africa, but his answer was that he was not disturbed by it. He failed to categorically deny the Renamo leader's accusation, thereby doing little more than raising more doubts. "I do not understand whether he (Dhlakama) is accusing me as a citizen, a general, a public servant in the National Defense Ministry, a Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, official, or as a member of Parliament", he said, adding, by way of clarification, that our country has "an institution that deals with matters such as this one" and that, should Dhlakama "be in possession of concrete evidence, he should bring the matter before the court." It was quite clear that the general was talking with some anxiety. He was repeatedly asked whether he accepted the Renamo leader's accusation, to which he replied that "I deny it as an individual, but I say that he must take the case before the competent authorities" instead of "making such claims in public." After much rhetoric, the general was invited to comment on what he would do about Dhlakama's remarks now, seeing that his "good name" may well be tarnished. "Nothing", the general replied, causing some surprise among the reporters who had flocked to his modest office. We asked him whether he did not feel offended or aggrieved, to which he answered: No, "I do not feel offended yet", adding rather tersely that if the Renamo leader does not take his complaint to court "then he is a liar." Gen. Domingos Fondo's name regularly crops up in international media reports as being linked to arms and drugs smugglers. He was asked to comment on this matter, but he refused to do it, saying: "No one has ever talked to me about arms smuggling. This is the first time I hear anything about it." Gen. Fondo added that no Mozambican State organ has approached him in connection with that matter yet. "Neither the Attorney General's Office, nor the Interior Ministry, nor anybody else", he stressed. Gen. Fondo surprised the reporters with the contempt he showed for Dhlakama's accusations, saying "I am not afraid of anything, I am at peace with myself, and I am not worried. I am free and that is why I go where I please." At one point in the course of the news conference, Gen. Fondo was asked whether he would be willing some day to serve in the Mozambique Armed Forces under Afonso Dhlakama's command. His reply was typical: "As long as I am an active serviceman, I shall obey whoever wins, whether that be Dhlakama, Arouca, or anybody else. I shall obey as long as I am in active service." To the general surprise of his audience, Gen. Fondo added, pointing out one of the journalists: "Even if it is you..." We asked him whether, as a businessman, he had business interests in South Africa, to which he replied that "if you have come to talk to me as a businessman, then I must take off my uniform and talk as a businessman." Major General Domingos Fondo heads the forces responsible for the protection of projects. During the war, those forces were involved in the defense of economic targets. Gen. Fondo explained that his forces are being disbanded because they are irregular and must be scrapped in terms of the Rome Accord, adding that "almost half of the soldiers have already been demobilized and their weapons are being collected by the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, and taken to the general storehouse." In any event, there are complaints that many weapons have been disappearing from that army unit. Answering the question, Maj. Gen. Fondo said that "there are institutions responsible for controlling the weapons. There has been widespread disappearance of weapons from the National Defense Ministry [words indistinct] a meeting. Gen. Fondo said that the problem of alleged arms trafficking to South Africa had not been raised during his meeting with Army General Alberto Chipande. "We always talk about work when we meet", Gen. Fondo explained. During the news conference, Domingos Fondo distributed calling cards which carried the name of `Spanos da Beira' company and he said, by way of explanation: "That is my company." Yesterday, MEDIAFAX learned from an official in the Criminal Investigation Police, PIC, Arms Smuggling Investigation Branch that Gen. Fondo's name had never featured on any list of suspects. "Our leads have never mentioned his name. We have never received any complaint concerning the general. We know nothing about it in this branch, but perhaps other institutions know something", that source said. When we asked whether there might be other important Mozambican Army names on the list, our source said no, admitting only that he knew about "persons who have been arrested at the border while in possession of a weapon or two, which they intended to use for armed robberies in South Africa", he noted. Our source went so far as to question the correctness of the words, arms trafficking to South Africa. Faced with our own doubts, he wound up the conversation by saying that he could only answer other questions upon permission by senior Interior Ministry officials. We were not any more successful at the local Interpol [International Police] directorate. Other Interpol sources whom we tried discreetly to contact assured us that they had never received anything concerning that matter and that Gen. Domingos Fondo's name had never been discussed by Interpol agents. Despite our insistent efforts, we were not able to get in touch with any senior officials in the Interior Ministry or the Attorney General's Office by the time this edition went to print.
