FR940727-2-00089 FR940727-2-00047 5. Between 1988 and 1990, thirteen physicians (the Physicians), upon the advice of counsel, sold their individual shares of the Stock for cash to their individually-directed accounts in the Plan indirectly through the Building Corporation. Three of the Physicians were officers of the Clinic. The Clinic states that, as an indirect result of these sales, some of the accounts of the Physicians held shares of the Stock in excess of twenty-five percent of the balance of their account at some point. Because of the party in interest/ disqualified person relationships and the past purchases by the accounts from the Physicians, the Clinic is aware of the fact that prohibited transactions have occurred in violation of the Act. Accordingly, the Clinic represents that within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions. 4 4 Because of the administrative difficulties involved in locating certain Physicians who were involved in these prohibited purchases by their accounts, the Clinic has represented that it will be responsible for the filing of the Forms 5330 and the payment of all applicable excise taxes resulting from these prohibited purchases. 6. Upon discovering that certain accounts in the Plan had engaged in prohibited transactions, the board of directors, acting as trustee, froze the assets in Fund F pending resolution of the prohibited transaction issues. As a result, retiring participants are limited to receiving only a partial distribution. In order to allow participants to receive full distributions, the trustee proposes to sell the Shares to the Clinic. Accordingly, the Clinic requests an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Sale under the terms and conditions described herein. The Sale will be a one time cash transaction, and the Accounts will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the Sale. Prior to the Sale, First Union will become trustee with respect to the Plan assets in Fund F. At this time, First Union will have the sole investment discretion over the entire assets of the Plan. Although the initial decision to sell the Shares was made by the board of directors acting as trustee, First Union will have the ultimate authority to approve or disapprove the terms and conditions of the Sale. 7. The Clinic obtained an appraisal of the Stock dated May 13, 1994, from Dianne D. Cobb, CFA, ASA. Ms. Cobb is the Senior Vice President of Investment Managements Services of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina which provides analysis with regard to non-publicly traded securities and securities of closely held businesses. Ms. Cobb represents that both she and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina are unrelated to and independent of the Clinic and its affiliates. Relying upon the discounted future cash flow and recent trades of the Stock, Ms. Cobb placed the fair market value of the Stock at $764 per share. Based on this valuation, the value of the Shares, which represent Fund F's eighty-two percent interest in the Building Corporation, total $12,539,532. 8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (c) the Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the Sale; and (d) the Sales price for the Shares will be based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (e) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions.
