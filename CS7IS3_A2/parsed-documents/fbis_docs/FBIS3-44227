Some traders even hoarded some goods such as soap, cooking oil, rice, and milk in order to cause a shortage and to increase prices on the markets, the radio said, but did not give figures as examples of the price increase. Equatorial Guinea, the last country to join the franc zone in 1985, was until now free from all price increases brought about in the zone by the announcement of the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 percent. "The situation is unbearable in Malabo where traders have increased the prices of all their goods. People are now waiting in lines to buy a kilo of rice whose price has doubled," a Malabo inhabitant commented over the phone from Libreville. This situation "is all the more serious because the devaluation occurs at a time when the purchasing power of the Equatorial Guineans is very low and the government has not yet even planned to increase salaries," he added. The average salaries in Equatorial Guinea range from about CFA 25,000 to CFA 30,000.
