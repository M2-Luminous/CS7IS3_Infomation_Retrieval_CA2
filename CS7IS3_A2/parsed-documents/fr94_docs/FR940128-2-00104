FR940128-2-00104 FR940128-2-00067 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirement Approved by the Office of Management and Budget January 24, 1994. The following information collection requirement has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, (44 U.S.C. 3507). For further information, contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. OMB No.: 3060&hyph;0586. Title: Immplentation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, First Report and Order. OMB Expiration Date: 02/28/94. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6002(b), 107 Stat 312, 395 (1993), amended Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees will be treated as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of Section 310(b) of the Communications Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, permits the Commission to grant waivers of Section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline. Federal Communications Commission William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1827 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
