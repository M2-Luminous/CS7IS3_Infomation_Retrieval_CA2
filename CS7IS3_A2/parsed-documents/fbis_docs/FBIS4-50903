He added that some Taiwan officials in charge of decision-making on the Mainland policy showed differences with Mr Li Teng-hui on his idea of the Mainland policy. The SEF chairman said that the level which was responsible for such decision-making should be upgraded to a higher level. Mr Koo pointed out that the cross-strait relations was considered the most important in Taiwan's external relations. He added that he expected tense state in relations between the two sides of the strait in coming August and September when Taiwan would raise the issue of participation in the United Nations. With this in mind he said that it was necessary for the two sides to hold negotiation and that policy-oriented dialogue should be made based on the framework of one China. The SEF chief added that should no talk between the two sides take place, it would lead to an impasse which was not beneficial for the two sides of the strait. The officials in the Mainland in charge of decision-making on the Taiwan policy were the officials at the top, according to Mr Koo. In Taiwan it was another case. The Mainland policy held by some Taiwan officials was different from that of Mr Li Teng-hui while some officials just guessed at what kind of idea the higher level held in regard to the Mainland policy or even based on speculations. Mr Koo, therefore, has long since advocated that the level responsible for decision-making on the Mainland policy should be raised to a higher level. The SEF chairman was convinced that the routine consultation across the strait did not go conflict with dialogue between the high levels of the two sides. He said it did not matter even though no favorable outcome was made from such dialogue. Mr Koo believed that mutual trust would be built up mainly by means of frequent face-to-face communications. He suggested that the routine talks between the two sides should cover economic topics in addition to the current agenda.
