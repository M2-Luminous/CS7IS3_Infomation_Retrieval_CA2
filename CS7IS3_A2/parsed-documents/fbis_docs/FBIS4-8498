Mate Basic uncovers one of the most strictly guarded Yugoslav secrets. Illustrations by Zdenko Svircic. The withdrawal of Serb artillery to a distance of 20 km around Sarajevo will not prevent the destruction of the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina! The majority of the Serb artillery can launch destructive projectiles at two or even three times the distance established in the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serb heavy arms. But the greatest danger is a hitherto unknown weapon, guarded as one of the biggest state secrets--a Serb 203-mm howitzer! This weapon was developed under the code name KOLOS! The investment program to develop a Serb 203-mm supercannon ended back in 1985, but the medium-term plan for the period from 1985 to 1990 included a program for additional production of 90,000 155-mm and 203-mm shells, a completely new type with a significantly greater range! The financing plan for the all-Yugoslav "Kolos" project was concluded in 1987: Investments were approved for the Slovene steel works in Store and Ravne na Koroskem (new furnaces and new presses for forging barrels), for the "Bratstvo" factory in Novi Travnik (forging and deep drilling of barrels), for the factory in Vogosca, near Sarajevo (forging and machining of 120-kg shells), for the "Ivo Lola Ribar" factory in Zeleznik, near Belgrade (computer control systems for processing gun breeches and for robots).... Besides these major plants, more than 500 factories all over the former Yugoslavia were involved in the overall project. "Kolos" was only the main beneficiary of the investment, since the machines were also used to produce other weapons or parts of them. The total value of the investment at the time was more than $2 billion! Reliable information indicates that even after 1987 the Serbs were working on realizing the "Kolos" project! In early 1993, "14 October" in Krusevac presented a finished transporter tank whose chassis was intended as a carrier for the Serb supercannon! Then, at the newly opened weapons testing range across the border from Prevlaka on the Montenegrin coast, tests were conducted in the fall of 1993 on a long-range system to record on radar screens the movements of ships from the Western European Union (WEU) and NATO that were enforcing the blockade on Montenegrin harbors! Thus, the threats previously expressed by General Zivota Panic, the former chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia, and chetnik duke Vojislav Seselj concerning attacks against targets in Europe with long-range missiles must in fact be regarded as extremely dangerous. Specifically, these threats were expressed only as sheer disinformation, because the attention of the world public was supposed to be directed toward the development of Serb missile systems (which they cannot do, just as they cannot start up production of the "Orkan"), while in reality intensive work was being done on developing a long-range artillery gun! Shells for Only $800 Qualified missile experts who are well-acquainted with the technological scope of the Serb military industry responsibly assert that the "Orkan" missile with a range of 50 km constitutes their maximum capability in developing surface-to-surface missile projectiles. Any increase in the range of missile projectiles requires the development of completely new, high-energy rocket fuels (which they do not have!) as well as the development of projectile-guidance systems if they want to achieve firing accuracy. Serbia lacks both the material and the personnel for such essentially new technological ranges, especially under sanction conditions. Moreover, the cost of firing missile projectiles is much greater than the cost of firing artillery shells. Specifically, according to the price list of the Commission for JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Property Succession, one launcher-vehicle for a 262-mm M-87 "Orkan" multibarrel rocket launcher costs $540,000 and one launcher-vehicle for a FROG-7 "Luna" also costs $540,000, while one launcher-vehicle for a 128-mm M-77 "Oganj" multibarrel rocket launcher costs $360,000. Right now, a 130-mm M-46 cannon costs $228,000, while a 152-mm M-84 "Nora" howitzer costs $280,000. There are also large differences in the price (which Serb military-equipment experts too are certainly keeping in mind) of missile projectiles and artillery shells: While the price of one missile is $2,600 for the "Oganj," $6,000 for the "Orkan," and $15,500 for the "Luna," a shell for the 130-mm cannon costs (only) $180, with $260 for the "Nora," while it would cost only around $800 for the long-range 203-mm cannon ("Kolos")! The final argument on behalf of the development of a Serb supercannon is the complete technological independence from foreign partners! With the production capacity and machinery of special-purpose industry at its disposal, the former Yugoslavia was able to produce all the elements necessary for the production of artillery guns and ammunition of calibers 130 to 203 mm. After the disintegration of Yugoslavia, some parts of special-purpose industry also disintegrated, and the Serbs lost control over certain important factories. For example, the "Bratstvo" heavy artillery factory in Novi Travnik, which had an annual capacity of around 300 heavy artillery guns. But although they lost this factory, the Serbs retained enough capacity to regenerate almost the entire previous production of artillery guns: At the "Prva Petoletka" factory in Trstenik, there is machinery for deep drilling of barrels and for superfinishing (honing) them to a depth of 16 meters and a diameter of 400 mm; at the "Cer" factory in Cacak furnaces are produced for heat treatment of barrels; and several other large and small Serbian or Montenegrin factories can also be included in the overall system ("I.L. Ribar" in Zeleznik, "Zeljezara" and "Aluminijski Kombinat" in Niksic, and so forth). Steel to produce Serb supercannons can be easily procured on the market. This commercial type of steel is called "maraging" (an abbreviation for "martensite generation"), and its only drawback is that it is expensive. Specifically, one kilogram costs $100! Moreover, all the equipment for producing ammunition has remained in Serb hands. This equipment was previously tested at the firing range in Prevlaka, one of the most modern ranges in the world: It is known that the Germans have conducted target practice there while testing the 30-mm "Gepard" antiair gun. Today, a similar firing range has been set up on the Montenegrin part of the coast, across the border from Prevlaka. There is also a testing range in Syrmia, near Nikinci. It was created by seizing farmland from Croats and expelling them after World War II, and is also exceptionally well-equipped. This is confirmed by the fact that the Swedes used it to test their antitank missiles.... Secret Cooperation With Iraq The crucial role in launching the "Kolos" project was played by Dr. Gerald Bull, a Canadian known throughout the world as the designer of Saddam Husayn's never-completed "Babylon cannon" (the powder for which was produced in Vitez), with barrels measuring one meter in diameter and 52 meters in length. The range of this gun was supposed to be around 600 km. Bull began official cooperation with the Military Technology Institute (VTI) in Belgrade in 1984, by way of the Federal Directorate for Trade and Commodity Reserves (SDPR) and SRC (Space Research Corporation) in Brussels, of which he was the founder and owner. At the same time, Bull was cooperating with Iraq (which was a scrupulously guarded secret), but also with South Africa, Canada, and even China. He was engrossed with the idea of creating a cannon that could shoot down satellites, and he called the project HARP (High Altitude Research Program). After he was assassinated in Brussels by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, his associates published a book entitled From the Paris Cannon to HARP, in which they described exhaustively the genesis and development of the new cannon project. Specifically, Bull began by studying the 210-mm "Paris cannon," with a range of 130 km, with which the Germans shelled Paris in 1918. He then proposed an improved version to the Americans, and after they turned him down the Canadians sent him a million dollars for his annual expenses, as part of the long-range "Barbados cannon" project. When that contract expired, he became an honored guest of VTI in Belgrade, but also of other institutions and factories involved in the production of artillery. With his team of experts, he offered everything that he had--his know-how--but in return he gained the opportunity to use one of the world's most modern artillery testing ranges, the one in Prevlaka. Still, his work in Iraq continued to be classified top secret, although people knew about the 210-mm "Iraqi cannon" (the same caliber as the "Paris cannon" with barrels of 52 caliber (210 mm x 52), and thus a length of 10 meters. This was only the transitional phase preceding the construction of the planned "Babylon cannon".... Besides gaining use of modern testing equipment for all calibers between 130 and 203 mm, Gerald Bull, through the SDPR, also sold his highly modern shells, produced according to his plans. Thus, the government of the former Yugoslavia, through the SDPR, was one of the biggest suppliers of Bull's products. For each sold shell produced under his license, the military industries who used his services paid Bull 10 percent of the value. Logically, part of the debt-servicing costs were settled through barter transactions.... What did Bull work on in Yugoslavia? Yugoslav military researchers managed, independently of Bull's license, to increase the range of the "Nora," using the TF152 projectile, from 23,932.9 meters to 28,893.1 meters, and through later, additional testing they increased the range of that gun to a total of 39.5. Bull also participated in the startup of production of the ERFE-BB long-range projectile, with calibers of 130 mm, 155 mm, and 203 mm. Besides increasing the range of the projectile, Bull also helped solve certain design problems in the cannon itself. Based on his ideas, conversion of the famous 130-mm Russian M-46 cannon was carried out. A completely new 155-mm barrel was placed on the old pedestal, which made the shells significantly more deadly, and their range was increased to 39 km. The cannon bears a new name: M-46/84. But a special shell with a greater range was also developed for the old caliber (130), so that now it launches projectiles at a distance of 38,000 meters instead of 27,490 meters. The development of the M-87 "Nora" (an abbreviation of New Artillery Weapon) project lasted two years, until the advent of Bull and his associates. It was only after their expert intervention that the project was completed under the name M-84.... Gerald Bull's main associate, to whom he passed on his knowledge, was a full professor at the School of Engineering in Belgrade with the rank of general, Dr. Anastas Paligoric, the director of the artillery section at the VTI, and also the designer of the 152-mm howitzer, better known as the "Nora." Based on the knowledge transferred from SRC, the entire team of military scientists conducted further research into increasing the range and improving the design of artillery ammunition, and on the design of the gun itself, with a barrel length of 52 caliber. Zorica Subotic and Slobodan Jarmaz published work on the Projection of Gas Generators to Increase Artillery Range, Milojko Ignjac and Slobodan Jarmaz analyzed The Selection of Fuel Characteristics for Gas Generators to Increase the Range of Artillery Projectiles, and Dragoslav Negoicic and Toni Arsic published the results of the study Gas Generator Lighter to Increase the Range of the TH 152-mm NORA Artillery Projectile. What is remarkable about the Bull projects? This ingenious designer devised a way to enormously increase the range of artillery pieces by reducing the resistance of the artillery projectile. Indeed, the biggest problem was how to reduce the resistance created by the projectile itself, as a result of the turbulent air current caused by the motion of the projectile itself (so-called background resistance, which accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total resistance). This problem was solved through the revolutionary introduction of the "Base Bleed" natural gas generator. The innovation here is that during the flight of the projectile the gas generator released gas at the rear of the projectile, the volume of which filled the vacuum behind the projectile, thus almost completely eliminating the biggest share of resistance. Just as the introduction of the jet engine revolutionized aviation, the introduction of the gas generator revolutionized artillery. Indeed, it involves an extremely complicated chemical process, which Serbia was unable to achieve alone. That is why the Croatian chemicals industry was involved, especially research teams at Ina [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise]. This was the biggest military secret at that enterprise. The technology for producing high-level polymer materials was studied--hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Today, based on the results of that research, Serbs at "Miloje Zakic" in Krusevac can product HTPB, the key raw material for the gas generator. By applying additional improvements (higher-quality steel for the barrels, use of better powder, greater barrel length), the range of artillery weapons was increased almost twice over. In this way, the Serbs have produced much cheaper and more deadly artillery pieces, with much greater accuracy! According to some data, this product would pay for itself if 18 units were sold abroad.... Menacing Shell Weighing 100 Kg According to the final plans, the "Kolos" itself was supposed to be a self-propelled 203-mm howitzer modeled after a similar Russian weapon known as the "Piton." Two variants were developed: the towed version with the option of independent movement on the battlefield, and the self-propelled version on the chassis of the known tracked vehicle. Initial testing was conducted on a sample of the U.S. "M 110" howitzer, but the concrete results are not known. All that is known is that in the joint project between SRC, Yugoslavia, and Iraq, Saddam Husayn's howitzer achieved a range of 57 km with its caliber of 210 mm! At that range, the cannon known as "Al Fao" launched a projectile weighing 109.4 kg, the kind produced at the factory in Vogosca.... What is bewildering, however, is the fact that top officials at NATO are uninformed of the real possibilities of the Serb cannon's range. Or is this once again a game of compromise with the Serbs, whereby Sarajevo is removed from mortar range but left within range of heavy artillery? For now, we can expect that shells weighing 100 kg will be arriving from a distance of 60 km away from Sarajevo, or from any other target in Bosnia-Herzegovina or Croatia. However, if the production of artillery pieces with a range greater than 100 km (like the "Babylon") is allowed, territory outside the former Yugoslavia will also come under Serb attack! For now, it is known reliably that the Serbs have the original powder for producing a supercannon like the "Babylon"--made for that purpose in Vitez--together with enough know-how to begin implementing a new and deadly project.
