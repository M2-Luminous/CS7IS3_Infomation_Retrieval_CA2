And quite understandably, it is the aim of China's car manufacturers to make this dream come true. The dream seems to have advanced a step closer to the truth, as a minicar, named "Haishen", or Poseidon, was developed just before the traditional Chinese New Year in early February, in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, where China's first automobile was produced. The four-seat minicar, with a maximum speed of 80 kph, was developed by the Haishen household car institute. To put the minicar into mass production, the North Haishen Automobile Stock Company will be established later this year. Li Weidong, the chief initiator, said the company plans to produce 1,000 Haishen minicars in 1994 and 10,000 in 1995. The prototype of Haishen was produced here last August by senior researchers and engineers with the Changchun Automobile Research Institute. Though it is designed to be China's first car for common people, and meanfully named as "Sankoule", or "a happy three-member family", an appropriate name with regard of China's one-child policy, some people refuse to admit it to be a car, saying that it is merely a motorcycle with a top. In fact, Haishen is not the first, nor the only attempt by the Chinese automobile industry to produce a car for the ordinary Chinese residents. The idea was first put forward by the Xiali Automobile Company in Tianjin. However, its 90,000-yuan price militated against its promotion strategy. Meanwhile, a plant under the No. 1 Automobile Factory of Jilin has developed a four-seat minibus and has put it into small-scale production. The Nanjing Automobile Plant of Jiangsu Province, east China, developed a three-seat minicar named "little squirrel". And in southwest China's Sichuan Province a minicar is to be produced by a former defense factory. Besides being small, all these minicars share the same traits in that they consume less gasoline, and unlike their more sophisticated counterparts, all their parts are China-made. Their biggest common point, however, is that they all strive to be as cheap as possible, so that they can be acceptable to the ordinary people. At present, the Jilin minibus sells at 40,000 yuan, the Haishen at 30,000 yuan, and the "little squirrel", the cheapest, at 5,000 yuan. But doubts and worries continue about whether they are genuine cars, how to improve their quality and how they can be put into mass production. However, some experts hold that the minicar is probably a must if the Chinese automobile industry, the sector with the deepest impact on the centrally-planned economy, is to step into the market economy. They even hint that minicar will possibly bring the prosperity that the automobile industry has waited for so long. The minicar -- is it a dream coming true?
