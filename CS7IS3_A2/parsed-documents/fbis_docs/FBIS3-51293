In interviews published by local media today, "Major Mario" of the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) announced that he will reply to the official dialogue proposal and will respect the unilateral truce decreed by the government. "We are respecting the cease fire. We will not attack the government, but we will respond if they come to harass us," Major Mario asserted. Mario is a 21- year-old Tzeital Indian who spoke to a group of reporters "somewhere in the Lacandona jungle" in Chiapas state. The rebel chieftain asserted that "very soon the EZLN Indian Clandestine Committee will answer the government," although "we will not stop the war" until the 10 conditions presented by the guerrillas have been met, including a total cease-fire, a halt to the bombing, and official recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force.
