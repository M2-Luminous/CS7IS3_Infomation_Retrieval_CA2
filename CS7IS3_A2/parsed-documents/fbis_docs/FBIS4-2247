They are the first set of "youth civilization models" set up in the country, said an official from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL). These models are expected to cause other youth groups to improve their services and produce more youth civilization models across the country, said the official. The campaign, launched by the CCYL Central Committee, is aimed to promote professional ethics among Chinese youth and help them improve their devotion to work and serving the people. The official said each enterprise from all trades in the country has been called on to set up its youth civilization models in the next year or two.
