FR940412-2-00160 FR940412-2-00113 The Commission believes good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Amendment No. 1 9 requires that the Commission grant PTC permanent approval of its pilot program for intraday P&I payments. 10 Because PTC's proposal incorporates into its rules the requirement that intraday disbursement of P&I be limited to the amount of P&I collected and available, PTC has fulfilled the Commission's requirement for permanent approval of the pilot program. In addition, the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors'') has stated that it believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the safeguarding of securities and funds in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, and therefore agrees with the accelerated approval. 11 9 Supra note 3. 10 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33132, supra note 4. 11 Telephone conversation between William R.

Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act.
