In 1893 the three great sons of Mother India--Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yogi Arvind--started this pious beginning. Swami Vivekananda dazzled the world by exposing it to the real glory of Sanatana Dharam at the Chicago World Religions Conference. Mahatma Gandhi sounded the conch shell to announce agitation against Western conceit by starting satyagraha [non-violent movement] against racial discrimination in South Africa. Swami Arvind received the first inspiration from Goddess Shakti when he touched land in Bombay and published a series of articles in INDUPRAKASH. He gave a new definition to nationalism and politics. Swami Vivekananda and Gandhi rejuvenated the feeling for duty of the sleeping kshatariyas [warrior caste]. Yogi Arvind helped raise new awareness of the ancient Indian wisdom and presented the original Vedas, the Upanishdas, and Bhagavad Gita to the world in a modern form. The world is ready to change for the new era as desired by the Goddess Durga. We have to think and theorize as to which powers will be defeated and trodden under feet, and which powers will become great powers. The three great sons of India will be the trail blazers of this new era, and will be Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh of this age. It is surprising and sad to see that nothing has been done according to the requirements of this historic century in India. At times, it looks like the century of the giants has passed and we are living in the century of dwarfs who cannot think big, who think that independence means just staying in power, whose blood stream cannot bear the heat of glory of freedom, and who have made it a habit to accept intellectual-cutlural-economic-political slavery. The dwarfs can gain power using muscle, betrayal, and deception; can hold on to power; but cannot change the society. Thus, the flow of time and duty throws them out on the banks. India is burning in the fires of communalism and prejudice. Is just sending its representatives to South Africa and Chicago at the time of the beginning of this new era enough for India? Cannot we use this historic century to start a national or international campaign to stop religious and communal malice? Cannot we unite the people belonging to all political parties, religions, and castes for participation in this national campaign and start the powerful flow of national devotion? But who will do it? Can a blind person lead another blind person? How can those who cannot even see the nation be able to perceive the whole world? There is a great fear that the clutch of economic and cultural slavery will become tighter in the name of economic liberalization and modernization, and India will be forced to see with the eyes of others instead of using its own eyes. It appears that India will have to ignore its own intelligence and will have to walk the way others tell her to. However, can we call it walking? That would be just crawling! The government must be helpless and incapable of doing anything. The Congress (I) at the Center has its own incapability. Who interferes in the states run by other parties? Why are they supporting an organization that spreads communal prejudice while patting their backs for being modern? Do they think that Gandhi is not worth being honored by spreading his message in every village at this time when the policy of apartheid has ended in South Africa? It appears that this is not the Congress Party that Gandhi had raised with his blood and sweat and enabled it to beget independence for India. Perhaps, the Congress is not in the hands of his successors; it is being controlled by slavery-loving opportunists. Powers that are dreaming of controlling the whole world naturally will take advantage of India's timely weakness. What have the independent organizations associated with the Gandhian philosophy been doing? Why are organizations like the Sarvaseva Sangh, the Gandhi Samarak Nidhi, and the Gandhi Shakti Parishthan silent now? Why are not they following Gandhi's legacy? In South Africa, 100 years after the satyagraha was started, they did finally succeed in ending apartheid. Do not these organizations see the victory of Gandhi's policies in it? Why has the Shri Ramakrishna Mission, the organization associated with Swami Vivekananda, also limited itself to a ceremonial participation? Why is this mighty organization hesitating in presenting the form of Sanatana Dharam or Hindu Dharama that Swami Vivekananda had presented at the Chicago World Religions Conference to the people in the world now? Shri Arvind Ashram is an organization in itself, and an able disciple of Arvind is its head. Is it not amazing that during the centenary year, a selection of Arvind's writing and thinking under the title of India's Reincarnation was published not by Arvind Ashram but by an organization in Paris! The title of this book published in Paris expresses the future truth that Arvind has dedicated his life to. Now this image of "India's reincarnation" is viewed by the world as formed by the West. But no proper government can be formed, be successful or be stable in India until the triumvirate of these three great men stops being neglected. How long can a country depend on a borrowed crutch? This centennial has also acknowledged another great truth: All political parties and organizations are petty, they have no interest in actual resolution of India's problems, their disagreement is not based on basic issues but on establishing monopoly of specific persons, and they do not look within themselves for answers but depend on others. The Western slavery in the form of modernization has encompassed their mind and body so much that they cannot even think of walking with their head high on the stage of world. The warrior-like glory of Swami Vivekananda and Gandhi and intellectual glory of Arvind are being neglected now. Who can stop India from being weak and narrow-minded now? If everyone is busy trying to fill up their own coffers, who will fill Mother India's bowl? Who will create the new awakening of the man in the world? The West's established supremacy over the whole world has reached its apex, and the time for its downward slide has arrived. The 'churning of the ocean' of the West has begun, and the West is suffering pain, defeat, and laziness because of the heat generated by it. It does not understand why this is happening because this is beyond the sphere of physical science. The West, drowned in the ocean of worldly luxuries can deceive itself for a while by calling the two civil wars in Europe two major World Wars. It should not forget that these civil wars ended the monopoly of Europe on the whole world. Now the United States may laugh in the United Nations while standing on the ashes of former Soviet Union, but this will not help it create the new world order. The bad results of this cultural policy are emerging gradually. The communist powers fell right in front of our eyes because of the "centralized public policy" of the Marxists, and those communist nations also appear to be effected by this fall. However, communism is not the weakness of the Marxists; it was their strong desire for despotism. How can despotism under the guise of democracy have a different outcome? Swami Vivekanand, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yogi Arvind are the saviors of the world suffering from the desire of total control, and have been the best representatives of world culture. The prosperous and powerful nations should not be under the illusion that no hub of power can flourish outside the sphere of their influence nor should the poor nations have the delusion that no strong leadership, except for the blind worshipper of the West, can emerge there. Who knows who Fate will pick and from where and give him which responsibility? How can the Western culture based on physical science can understand the secret of the longevity, repeated rise, and preservation of the ancient spiritual cultures? What can we say about the rest of the world when even India itself is neglecting the triumvirate of the new age who knew the secret of this wisdom? These three great men fearlessly took revolutionary projects while living under the slavery of the world's most powerful imperialist. They also awakened the nation and challenged the West. India's soul was free even in slavery at that time, and India was fearless. Today, we cannot hear this free and fearless voice even in independent India. The 'reincarnation of India in the ashes of the West' that Yogi Arvind had mentioned has two aspects. The fall of the West and India's reemergence. The fall of the West and India's reemergence are yogic prophecies and are two interdependent facets. If there is destruction in one place; there will be building in another, if there is building in one place; there will be destruction in another. At one time, the Western empires were built on the destruction of Eastern nations. Now the time is coming when the East will be rebuilt on the rubble of the West. Not only the government and the political parties, but most of India's intellectuals, writers, and journalists are apathetic about the rebuilding of India in the new world for which Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Yogi Arvind had done their historic work. it appears that most of them are interested only in copying and enjoying doing what the West has done. Perhaps, they do not know that the western intellectuals are destined to look at the world through the eyes of the triumvirate that India had produced. The reemergence of India will be the greatest event of the 21st Century. This will herald the new era of universal man, universal culture, universal policy, and a universal economic system that was founded by the Indian triumvirate during this century.
