Luis Fernando Ramirez, the current labor minister, was the secret ace Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana held up his sleeve as his candidate for the vice presidency. Pastrana, who said he did not feel pressured by the Liberal Party's Samper-de la Calle ticket, said Ramirez' appointment did not show sectarianism but was a true key to the furtherance of social and labor programs. [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I have no doubt whatsoever about such a noble and loyal traveling companion. We perceive even more clearly our future victory. [end recording] Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna, who was born in Santander and is 35 years old, was selected as the star minister in the Gaviria cabinet last year. He stood out for his struggle to get Congress to approve the Social Security Law. He has been the tax revenue director twice, and he soberly accepted the vice presidential postulation today. [Begin recording] [Ramirez] I am honored to be the running mate of Andres Pastrana, the man Colombians are awaiting to manage the country's future. I hope with your and all Colombians' cooperation this country will continue on the path to growth, progress, and optimism, the path offered by our ticket. Today, I have the great honor of accepting to accompany Andres Pastrana, and I do so with great pride. Thank you. [end recording]
