He wants his fellow-fighter Bagrat Asatryan, one of the active doers of the leading Armenian National Movement [Armenian Pannational Movement] party, [to] hold a post instead of the existing Chairman of the Central Bank Isahak Isahakyan. Armen Darbinyan, a representative of the Armenian National Movement, deputy Head of the Economic Department, is expected for the position of the deputy head of the Central Bank of Armenia. Experts are of the opinion that in many respects the political reasons caused changes in the Central Bank directors. Isahak Isahakyan holds the position for a period of 10 years and is the only representative of the old, the so-called communist nomenclature within the new leadership. His experience -- the experience of professional and often an obstinate banker -- was necessary till the Republic was in direct dependence on Russia. The national currency introduction brought to no necessity of such a dependence. Besides, the last-week debates on the Central Bank's submission to the Armenian Government showed that the Armenian Government wants to control over the Central Bank's activity.
