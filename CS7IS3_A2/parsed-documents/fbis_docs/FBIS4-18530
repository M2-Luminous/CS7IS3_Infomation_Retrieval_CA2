We are here before you with Mr. Karayalcin, leader of our coalition partner, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP], and deputy prime minister, to announce a series of important decisions we have made. For a long time now, we have noticed that the economic problems in our country are growing. The prosperity of the Turkish people is what is important. What is important is not only the immediate prosperity of all the people in this country -- the workers, civil servants, farmers, the big masses, and the shopkeepers -- but their prosperity in the coming months and years as well. We found that this prosperity was being mortgaged. Consequently, very difficult and daring decisions were needed to take measures that would increase this prosperity. We could have allowed the heap of economic problems to grow or we could have set aside certain political interests and be guided by the country's interests in making a series of decisions together. We opted for the second alternative. Together, we made a series of decisions that not even one-party governments dared make. Together, we are determined to overcome the problems facing the country, to bring prosperity to the Turkish people, and to clear the way for them in the best possible manner. I would like to approach the issue in the following way: First, to state what these economic problems are, and then to point out what would have happened had we not reached these decisions, what the decisions are, and what we can expect from these decisions. Let me state clearly that the most important problem facing the country is the growing public deficit. I think that there is a consensus on this point in all sectors of our society. Let us look at the important factors that caused the growth of the deficit and at certain data. It can be observed that since 1985, a growing share of the revenues -- today, it is more than all the revenues put together -- goes toward paying debts, in the form of the debt itself and interest. This share used to be half of all tax revenues. Every year, the share grew at a higher rate than the previous year, and has reached the current level of 104 percent. In other words, even if you take all the tax revenues, you cannot pay all the debts and interest today. The interest we pay alone is close to 50 percent of our tax revenues. What is left of the tax revenues is also not enough to pay the civil servants and workers. Naturally, such a big public debt means that new loans must be taken to pay the interest on the old loans. This process has been going on in Turkey for quite some time. Another development that contributed to this process was the fact that the foreign exchange rate was kept at very low levels after 1987. Interest rates naturally rise under conditions in which there is such a public deficit if the foreign exchange rate is to be kept low. When interest rates are high, public deficits grow in a vicious circle. That is what indeed happened. After 1988, the growing public deficit contributed to creating a higher interest rate on the one hand, while the foreign exchange rate, which was being kept unnecessarily low, created another short-term capital transfer on the other. These vicious circles which fed on each other caused the country to become trapped in a clamp of interest and debts. They prevented investments and the creation of jobs and also caused a mounting inflation rate. Given the fact that the increasing public deficit is at the core of the problem, I want to briefly talk about what would have happened had we not taken these measures. Had we not taken these measures, we would have had to live through the Latin American example. The inflation rate would have exceeded 100 percent and might have eventually reached 2,000-3,000 percent, as in Latin America. Furthermore, the growth rate would first have dropped and then have fallen to negative levels. In other words, we would have been headed toward a narrowing economy. Under such conditions, unemployment rates would have grown very fast and would have been impossible to stop. Unemployment would have grown not only in the short term but would have continued to mount. The government would have been unable to pay civil servants and workers. All these considerations made it essential to take these measures. Indeed, the radical and brave measures we have taken can stop all these things from happening. Let me briefly discuss their essence. The measures can be grouped into two. The first involves stability. The second involves measures that will lead to structural changes. What is important for stability is to reduce the public deficit. We will show the public how we will reduce the public deficit by means of three-month balances and budget figures. In the first stage, we plan to save 38.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL] [approximately $1.4 billion]. In other words, we aim at reducing the TL47.6 trillion deficit to TL9 trillion during the first three months. We will stand behind these figures. These are the figures that should be examined when our government policies are assessed. We thought it would be appropriate to announce the figures publicly. These figures will be announced at the end of every three-month period, so that we can assess the figures together before the public. This is as much a requisite of openness as it is a requisite of credibility and trust. If we cannot hit the target and reach these figures, then we will look for the reasons together and tackle the issue together again. We have determined how to tackle the different elements of the deficit in order to reduce it: The revenues will be increased by TL16.3 trillion, while expenditures will be reduced by TL22 trillion. Along with that, we had to introduce a price and salary policy. In the first stage, we have had to make price readjustments. I want to declare here and now that after these price readjustments, there will be no further readjustments for six months in some cases, until the end of the year in others, except for reasons stemming from conditions outside Turkey. We are aware that increased salaries play an important role in this vicious circle -- that is, in increasing the public debt. We are determined to increase salaries as much as possible within the budget expenditures. The complementary third leg of the trivet had to involve the Central Bank. In the coming days, the Central Bank will announce its monetary program in connection with the budget and financing deficit for the next three-month period. However, more important than that, two laws concerning the Central Bank were submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today. They involve granting autonomy to the Central Bank and reducing, gradually every year, the current 15 percent share of the budget expenditures which go toward short-term advance payments. Other than that, besides the monetary program and the measures to be taken by the Central Bank, the Capital Market Council will issue a statement tomorrow restricting certain procedures. Meanwhile, I think it is necessary to clearly state the following: We considered it necessary to tackle the issue of the just distribution of the burden while the stability program is being implemented; that is, while taking measures to restrict the budget deficit and financing needs, while being very careful about raising salaries and readjusting prices -- the second leg of the trivet -- and while, in turn, the Central Bank declares its laws and statements. I want to say that all these measures will be implemented within the following framework: Everything will be carried out in line with the market economy. No foreign exchange accounts will be confiscated. Exchange bureaus will not be closed. An internal debt consolidation will not be made. In other words, all the rules of the market economy will continue to function. Nor are we compromising the big projects of our country. That is, the projects that are under way within the framework of the build-operate-transfer principle, and the projects that are to be financed by foreign capital such as the State Water Works' Urfa tunnel, Deriner Dam, and Kralkizi Dam, will all continue. In other words, we will not make any reductions in the country's technological development, in its important investments, or in foreign investments. Within this framework, the market economy will work on the one hand, and the big investments from foreign sources, mainly energy, will continue. We have tried to make everyone share the burden equally. Accordingly, if you look at page 17, there will be a one-time tax. This additional tax will be collected from those who pay income and corporation tax and will be levied on the assets they declare in 1994. Salaried workers will be exempt from this tax. An additional low one-time tax will be collected on net income or assets. An additional one-time tax will be levied on motorized vehicles for the ground, sea, and air that exceed a certain insurance value. Those who own more than one residence will pay an additional low one-time tax. These are measures necessary for justice and for the just distribution of the burden. The stability dimension of the measures is reflected in the narrowing of the public deficit, in our price and salary policy, and in the measures the Central Bank will take such as autonomy and the exchange regime. However, the third leg of this trivet involves structural reorganization, a restructuring. In restructing, we will speed up the privatization of public economic enterprises. In a way, the public sector will be consolidated and made to function more efficiently and productively. Every measure will be taken to ensure this. Our law for privatization was submitted to the assembly today. Privatization will be carried out at great speed. We believe that we can reach a target of $3.5 billion in privatization by the end of the year. If you consider that during the past 10 years, less that $0.5 billion, some $300 million, was received in privatization, you will see how large our target is. [figures in dollars as heard] Within this framework, by the end of 1994, the following will be fully or partly privatized: Erdemir TUPRAS, the Petrochemical Holding Company [PETKIM], Turkish Airlines, TURBAN, HAVAS, the Maritime Transportation Company, and DITAS. Furthermore, the Turkish Electricity Authority and the Post, Telephone, and Telegraph Administration [PTT] will be privatized in 1995. The preliminary preparations for that will be completed in 1994. The PTT license for cellular phones and cable television will also be sold. The social security institutions will be reformed. We are working on that with great speed. Within this framework, private health insurance and private pension funds will be encouraged. We all know that the public economic enterprises stopped being productive and incurred great losses a long time ago. We will try to make the public economic enterprises fruitful. We will give this first priority. The work regarding this issue will be conducted by the concerned ministry and the concerned institutions at great speed. We will speed up the sale of the fixed assets, rest homes, hotels, and lodgings of the public economic enterprises. We will review the fixed assets of the state pension fund. Hotels belonging to the fund will be rented or sold. We will close down installations that are impossible to sell due to large debts, overemployment, high-cost production, or technological backwardness. Their capital assets will be sold. Accordingly, we have decided to close down seven factories belonging to Sumer Holding Company, the PETKIM installation in Yarimca, the PETLAS corporation, five hotels being run by TURBA, the Turkish Electronic Production and Marketing Corporation installation in Aydin, the Halic, Camialti,and Alaybey dockyards, and some combines of the Meat and Fish Corporation. The decision will be implemented within a certain period of time, given the orders placed with the installations and the time needed to liquidate their stocks. Furthermore, unless it can be privatized by the end of the year, the Turkish Agricultural Equipment Corporation will be closed down. The State Material Office will be liquidated. The State Monopolies' Ankara and Bomonti beer factories, and the Cibali cigarette factory will be closed down until the end of the year. The workers laid off during privatization will be compensated. We are aware that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works has had problems for quite some time. The Iron and Steel Works, which made great contributions to the development of Karabuk District, has fulfilled its mission, completed its economic and technological life, and can no longer compete due to outdated technology. We expect the installations's losses in 1994 to be around TL5 trillion. With interest, this places a burden much higher than TL10 trillion on the public. Unless it is privatized, production at the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works will stop at the end of the year. The necessary preparations will be made. The workers, if they want, can take over the installations until the end of the year. All legal rights of and compensation for personnel -- the retired or those whose service has ended -- will be met in time. In addition, the workers will benefit from the unemployment indemnities within the framework of the privatization power law. The limitations and improvements necessary to increase production in the Turkish Stone Quarry Organization will be perpetuated. Within this framework, if no requests are submitted from the private sector, certain mines will be closed by the end of the year. The works of the miners in the active mines will be guaranteed. The legal rights of the miners whose services will no longer be needed will be taken care of and they will receive due compensation in time. In addition, they will benefit from loss of employment indemnities as stipulated in the privatization law. Maintenance work will be done in the coal mines where mining is stopped to preserve them in their present conditions thus enabling them to be reopened in case a bid is submitted from the private sector. We have it on our agenda to take every measure possible to minimize the damage to the Zonguldak Province and Karabuk. Investment and employment possibilities will be accelerated in Zonguldak Province and we are continuing to make a series of decisions to that end. The TL7.6 trillion [approximately $271 million] employment infrastructure project for Zonguldak Province will be continued. Organized industrial regions will be established in Caycuma, Karabuk, and Eregli. This means that three organized industrial centers will have been established in Turkey during our government's tenure. Karabuk will become a province and will have priority status regarding development. In addition, a university will be established in Karabuk. Preparatory research having been completed, work will be started on the Kilyos port project. Kilyos will be declared a free zone. Training courses will be started, enabling workers laid off from the TKK [Agricultural Credit Cooperative Association] and Karabuk Iron and Steel Works to acquire professional skills. These projects, to be completed within three years, will create employment possibilities for approximately 21,000 persons. We are envisaging new stages in our agricultural endowment policy. Within the framework of this project, we plan on expanding the same system applied to cotton, tobacco, and tea. Our principles from now on will be the same as in the cotton produce -- supporting the payment of state subsidies directly the farmer. Free price policy will be applied to fertilizer. Government subsidies will not go to the firms but to the farmer directly. This means that state support will go directly to the farmer. The elimination of intermediary bodies will prevent losses which in turn will prevent great damage due to the above losses. As you can see, a new reconstruction process which encompasses a large area and different issues will be perpetuated. We are going to continue acting swiftly regarding the local and administrative arrangements of local administrations. Honorable guests, as you can see, a new phase is starting. The most important issue in this phase is the trust issue, that is, the issue of trusting the program. The program has two footholds. The first one concerns measures regarding stability and the second one measures concerning reconstruction. We are announcing the first three-month balance sheet of the measures on stability. We will have the opportunity to follow and inspect these measures every three months. However, the most important issue is to free ourselves from former developments and draw a line between the past and the future. The coming three months will be a period of change, a period of transition. The changes that will take place during this transition period should not form the basis of our expectations nor form the framework for our future expectations. The first three months should be considered a transition period. We must have expectations only after this first three-month period is completed. Henceforth, this transition period will be the basis of all the collective wage agreements, price adjustments, and other social conciliations. That is, we are going to severe our ties with the past, the past issues, and the wrongs. Our new expectations should be crystallized for the period following the three-month transition period. This is the most important factor in the success of this program. We started work with great determination and aspiration in order to implement this program. Within this framework, all levels of the society should take part in this privatization and consensus. We have to accomplish this consensus within all parts of the society. We have already established a consensus of this kind in our fight against terrorism. All parts of the community supported the fight against terrorism. What we have here is terrorism with regard to economy. The economic issue is the accumulation of years. We approach this issue with measures that governments singly did not dare use. However, this program can not succeed with only one part of the sector supporting it. This program is based on conciliations and sacrifices by the entire public. We, as the government, are going to do everything in our power to render these sacrifices just. We are going to do this all together. We are going to do this together and with thought. We are going to conduct a clear-cut inspection as well as an essential examination after the completion of each three-month period. We have to succeed. We have to succeed regarding this issue. If we fail, what is at stake is not the issue of our government's success but the issue of our country's economy. We have to break out of this point reached to this day. To achieve this break out, we ask for the support of all parts of our country just as we did in our fight against terrorism. We want consensus and trust. This trust will be the trust we will have for each other. I wish all the best for our country.
