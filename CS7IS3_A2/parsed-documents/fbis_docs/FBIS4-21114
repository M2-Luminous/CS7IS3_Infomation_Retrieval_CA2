There are 18 suspects in all and the judicial examination of the activity has been divided into several trials. Three people have already been sentenced, nine more were indicted a few days ago. Another five people are awaiting indictment in a couple of weeks and District Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobson hopes that the ringleader, a Peruvian who was arrested in Chile at Sweden's request, will be turned over to Sweden a month from now. "It is quite unusual to get hold of the entire pyramid, in a manner of speaking. This is the result of a combination of confessions and surveillance observations on the part of the police," Jacobson said. Police Intervention in November The police stepped in for the first time last November. They zeroed in on a pizzeria. The police suspected that cocaine was being sold there and had therefore kept track of traffic to that location. The pizza baker, who handled local sales, got the drugs from a regional salesman, who in turn got them directly from a man to whom a female courier delivered her smuggled goods. The volume of drugs the man in custody in Chile sent to Sweden in this way is not yet clear. A total of 5 kg of cocaine, worth about 5 million kronor in abuser circles, has been confiscated in the course of the investigation. 11 Years for Drug Dealing Svea Appellate Court has sentenced a Swede who has lived in South America for several years to 11 years in prison for exporting substantial quantities of cocaine to Sweden. Swedish drug agents have long regarded the Swede, 29-year-old Stefan Orning, as one of the worst suppliers of cocaine to the Swedish market. He was arrested in Colombia about a year ago and as he did not oppose extradition it was possible to send him back to Sweden relatively quickly. The appellate court sentence of 11 years in prison means that Stockholm City Court's earlier sentence in the case has been upheld. The appellate court also upheld the sentence of nine years in prison for 28-year-old Anders Bennback. In addition, three young men received prison sentences of one, three, and four years respectively. Large Amount The appellate court described Orning's acts as especially serious with reference to the substantial amounts of cocaine he has handled and the fact that he carried out the activity on a commercial scale for a long period of time. Back in 1988 when two young Swedes on their way home from South America were caught with 4 kg of cocaine when they arrived at Arlanda, the investigation indicated that it was their friend Orning who had supplied them with the drugs. That smuggling attempt is one of the shipments for which Orning has now been sentenced. The charges against him involved a total of around 20 kg of cocaine. Despite the fact that Orning's activity has stopped, there is no sign that the flow of cocaine from South America has diminished, according to Superintendent Nils Jornsten of the Stockholm Police Department's drug division.
