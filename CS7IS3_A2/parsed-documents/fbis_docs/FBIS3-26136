Prices of grain, edible oil, and such major foodstuffs as meat and vegetable have already declined from the upward trend. Prices of household electric appliances and other manufactured goods for daily use have been basically stabilized. Supply of goods on markets before Spring Festival have been ample, and both purchases and sales have been brisk. In November and December 1993, large-scale price hikes emerged on the province's markets, drawing the concern of the provincial and local governments. Since then, various localities have given full play to the role of the price regulation fund to help lower commodity prices. Dandong and 12 other cities have allocated 17.27 million yuan to subsidize price differences. Shenyang city that has not yet set up the price regulation fund has also released 6 million yuan from the city revenues to subsidize price differences. Many cities have also adopted such administrative measures as restricting prices and reducing the rate of profits to ensure the stability of commodity prices on markets. To this report, this station has added a commentary entitled: "Decontrol Does Not Mean Washing One's Hands." In the preceding period, prices of some major daily necessities in the province hiked to some extent. In addition to such objective reasons as the commencement of new tax system in the near future, the price hikes emerged first in southern China, and weather changes, people's vague understanding of the price reform was the essential reason for this situation. Some people maintained: Price reform means decontrolling prices; and decontrolling prices means having enterprises and managers decide prices freely and having markets themselves decide prices without any degree of state interference. The managers with such an understanding frequently raised prices accordingly whenever there was a sign of price hikes. Some others drove up prices in defiance of laws and discipline and spoke plausibly: When you increase wages, I increase prices; and when you collect tax, I shift it to price hikes. This is called "when the river rises the boat goes up." If we act like that, a considerably great portion of the material benefits brought by China's economic reform to the people will go to the pockets of such persons, and it is difficult for us to achieve success in price reform. In fact, decontrolling prices does not mean that the government should no longer manage prices; and making markets themselves decide prices does not mean no longer requiring state interference. Keeping the general level of prices stable and preventing galloping inflation is a goal pursued by almost all countries in the world, as well as an important means of our country to carry out macroeconomic control and ensure social stability. How to successfully stabilize prices and make prices flexible, but not chaotic, is a new task facing all levels of governments at present. Were not the price hikes at the preceding period rapidly checked and turned down through the positive and effective interferences of governments at all levels? This shows that the government's interference on prices is necessary. This also proves that the government is able to use legal, economic, and administrative means to manage prices well in the course of carrying out price reform and to make price reform satisfy all fields.
