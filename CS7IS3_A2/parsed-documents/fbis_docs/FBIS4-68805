He explained his refusal by a mistrust of the document's initiators and, specifically, of the government which, in his words, is wallowing in corruption. Aman Tuleyev is one of the more talented opposition politicians. A Kazakh by nationality, he has succeeded in becoming a public leader of his oblast. A communist by conviction, he has succeeded in persuading the local miners to change over from being firm Yeltsin supporters to being confirmed oppositionists. Aman Tuleyev began as an "oblast politician." In 1990 he became a people's deputy of Russia, and then headed up the Kemerovo oblsovet [oblast soviet] and ispolkom [executive committee]. But already after a year he announced his candidacy for the office of president of Russia and finished in fourth place (after Yeltsin, Ryzhkov and Zhirinovskiy), receiving around seven percent of the vote. Of course, in the course of the pre-electoral campaign he showed himself to be a talented orator who knows how to speak vividly and at length about the misfortunes of the people. But a significant role was played also by a group of talented image makers, who molded Tuleyev into a great politician (we might add, the people who conducted his pre-electoral campaign were later invited to work in the president's administration). In the days of the August events of 1991, Tuleyev met with Gennadiy Yanayev. The content of their conversation is unknown, but the mere fact that the talk occurred was reason enough for President Yeltsin to dismiss the obstinate politician from his duties as chairman of the Kemerovo ispolkom. The documents confirming Tuleyev's contacts with the GKChP [State Committee for Extraordinary Situation] were forwarded to the investigative committee, and he himself was forced to file an application to leave the position of chairman of the oblast soviet. At this critical moment it became clear that Tuleyev was not alone in Kemerovo. Well-established ties between the local trade unions and the directorate became apparent. Tuleyev was also supported by the industrialists in the Supreme Soviet (his membership in the "Industrial Union" faction helped). The oblast soviet did not accept the resignation of its chairman, and Tuleyev withdrew his application. Tuleyev's active contacts with the "irreconcilable opposition" began in 1992. Moreover, it would be more precise to say that the "irreconcilables" strived to establish contacts with the chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet. However, sharply criticizing the authorities and expressing his complete solidarity with the demands of the opposition, Tuleyev himself crossed out his signature under the constituent announcement of the Front for National Salvation. In September-October of 1992, Tuleyev, being a realist, understood that the Supreme Soviet had little chance of withstanding the struggle with the president. He proposed that the participants of the 10th Congress move to Kemerovo. However, this advice was not taken, and shortly before the tragic dissolution Tuleyev himself left for Kemerovo to "work locally." Obviously, Tuleyev has not been able to institute the "Kemerovo Soviet Republic." The oblast soviet was disbanded, and a secret attempt was made on Tuleyev's life: The attacker fired two shots into the closed door of his apartment. The politician got off with a mild scare, the guilty parties were never found, but these events marked the beginning of new growth of Tuleyev's popularity. In December he was elected to the Federation Council, in March--to the oblast legislative assembly, and both times he was victorious by an impressive margin. Today Tuleyev feels confident in Kemerovo. Many members of his command have been elected to the oblast parliament, while his differences with Governor Mikhail Kislyuk have completely faded into the past (it was Kislyuk who nominated Tuleyev to the position of speaker). And since the old contacts with the directorate and the trade unions have been retained, and the miners have long ago stopped supporting Yeltsin, we may say for sure: The Kemerovo "president" is not frightened by the President of Russia.
