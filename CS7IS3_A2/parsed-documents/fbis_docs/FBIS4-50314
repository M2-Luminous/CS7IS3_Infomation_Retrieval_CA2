This high-level international economic forum, co-sponsored by the Chinese State Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems [SCRES] and THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, has won support from many leading world famous enterprises. Here, on behalf of the Chinese Government, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our friends from political, economic, and academic circles of various countries, and express our heartfelt thanks to the entrepreneurs who have supported this forum! The Chinese Government attaches great importance to this forum. The persons in charge of some departments of the State Council will come and apprise you of relevant information. China's economists, scholars, and entrepreneurs are also highly interested in this meeting. We hope that it will help the international community understand more about China's reform and opening process, especially the theory and practice of a socialist market economy, and contribute to smooth operation of China's reform and opening up; and also help China to acquire a further understanding of the world and absorb and draw on the experience of success of other countries. This is the first time that such a high-level international economic forum has ever been held in Beijing. I hope such international economic forums can be held regularly in the future. Now, I would like to brief you on the progress and achievements of reform and opening up in China and the process of establishing a system of socialist market economy. 1. Process and Achievements of Reform and Opening Up in China 1.1 Process of reform in China. In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of its work to economic construction and pursue the policy of reform and opening up. Over the past 15 years, following the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has, roughly speaking, gone through three phases in its extensive and profound economic structural reforms. 1.1.1 The first phase (December 1978 -- September 1984). The focus of the reform was on rural areas, mobilizing peasant enthusiasm in promoting the production of commodities by developing various forms of the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. In urban areas, the main operation was experimentation on enterprise reforms, expanding the independent decisionmaking powers of enterprises. In the meantime, the development of special economic zones [SEZs] began and 14 port cities on the coast were opened. 1.1.2 The second phase (October 1984 -- December 1991). The focus of the reform shifted to urban areas. Centering around the task of strengthening the vitality of enterprises, market building, price reform, and reform of the macro management system were pushed forward in a coordinated way. Urban and rural reforms, as well as reforms of the scientific and technological, educational, and political systems unfolded across the board. Opening up was further expanded. Hainan SEZ was established. The Zhu Jiang delta, Chang Jiang delta, and South Fujian triangle were opened. 1.1.3 The third phase (January 1992 -- 2000). China's reform entered the new stage of building a socialist market economic system. As far as reforms are concerned, the focus is switching from breaking the old systems to establishing new systems and from policy adjustments to structural innovations, single reforms are being replaced by comprehensive and integrated reforms, and the endeavor to achieve breakthroughs at important points is moving toward the integration of both overall advancement and key breakthroughs. Opening up is heading into unprecedented scope and depth. One may well say that the coming few years are a crucial period for the final replacement of the system of planned economy with the system of a socialist market economy in China. 1.2 The 15-year reform and opening up have brought about profound changes to economic structural patterns and operational mechanisms in China. --A new pattern has taken shape in which public ownership reigns and a variety of economic sectors, including state, collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded economies coexist, compete on equal footing, and seek common development. At present, state industry accounts for 48.3 percent of the total industrial output value, collective industry accounts for 38.2 percent, and individual, private, and foreign-funded industries 13.5 percent. Of the total retail volume of commodities, state commerce accounts for 41.3 percent, collective commerce 27.9 percent, and joint-venture, individual, and private commerce 30.8 percent. The rapid development of non-state-owned economies has injected life force and vitality into China's economy. --Efforts have been made to deepen the reform of state enterprises continuously and to explore specific ways to establish a modern enterprise system. State enterprises are changing their identity to become independent legal entities and subjects of market competition. State enterprises' operational decisionmaking powers have expanded. Various forms of a contract operational responsibility system have been introduced. A large number of enterprise groups have been developed. The merger, leasing, and auctioning off of enterprises have been promoted. Deep-level reforms aimed at changing operational mechanisms have been conducted. To find effective forms into which public ownership can be realized, various types of experiments on the joint-stock system in selected organizations have been conducted. At present, the number of enterprises under various types of experimentation with joint-stock systems in China has reached 11,500. A batch of state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises are being organized to accommodate experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. --Efforts have been made to cultivate the market system and push ahead with price reform, bringing enormous changes to the formative mechanism of prices and continuously strengthening the role of market mechanisms. Energetic efforts have been made to develop various kinds of retail and wholesale markets and cultivate production element markets, including capital, real estate, labor, and technical and information markets. As a result of the 15-year evolutionary price reform, today the prices of over 80 percent of production means, over 85 percent of agricultural products, and over 95 percent of industrial consumer goods have been decontrolled. The prices of production elements are in the process of marketization and the market mechanism is playing an ever expanding role in the disposition of resources. --Macroregulation and control by the state are changing from direct control exercised with administrative mandates to indirect regulation and control which mainly employ economic and legal means. Before 1978, mandatory plans accounted for over 95 percent of the total industrial output value, but now this has dropped to 5 percent. The amount of means of production under unified distribution by the state and the amount of commodities purchased under state plans have also greatly decreased. With the on-going reforms in the planning, investment, financial, and banking systems, taxs, interest, and exchange rates and the money supply have gradually come to serve as chief means of macroregulation and control. --A distribution pattern has taken shape in which distribution according to work dominates and is combined with a variety of other modes of distribution. The establishment of a new social security system has also made a start. The method of linking total payroll to economic efficiency and linking employee remunerations to personal contributions at work has been extensively adopted among state-owned enterprises. Some progress has also been made in the reform of employee pension, unemployment, medical, and industrial injury insurance, and housing systems. --Responsibility systems, primarily the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, and the two-tier management system combining unification and division have been implemented extensively in China's rural areas. The adjustment of the prices of agricultural products and adjustments in the purchasing and marketing systems have aroused peasant enthusiasm. China's grain output increased from 300 million metric tons in 1978 to 456 million metric tons in 1993. China has been feeding 22 percent of the world population with 7 percent of the world's arable land. By the end of 1993, 23.21 million township and town enterprises had been set up in rural areas, absorbing 110 million members of rural surplus labor, which has greatly contributed to the development of rural economy and increased peasant income. 1.3 The reform and opening up have pushed China's economy into a fast growth phase. The 15-year reform and opening up have greatly emancipated and developed productive forces, mobilized people's initiative and creativity, and pushed China's economy up a big step. --Economic growth has accelerated and overall national strength has increased. The average annual growth rate between 1978 and 1993 was 9 percent. In 1992 and 1993 in particular, the GDP [as published] increased over the previous years by 12.8 percent and 13.4 percent respectively. The rankings of the output of some of China's major industrial and agricultural products in the world have been significantly upgraded, and China's overall national strength has gone up to 10th position. --The industrial structure has undergone some change and the importance of tertiary industry has incresed. Comparing the year 1993 to 1978 when the reform began, the proportions of three industries in the GNP went through the following changes: The proportion of primary industry dropped from 28.4 percent to 21.2 percent, that of secondary industry rose from 48.6 percent to 51.8 percent, and that of tertiary industry rose from 23 percent to 27 percent, in which communications and posts and telecommunications saw significant development. --Brisk markets and an active internal trade have satisfied the growing material and cultural needs of urban and rural residents. The average annual growth rate of the total retail volume of commodities nationwide rose from 8 percent before the reform and opening up to 14.5 percent after the reform and opening up began. In 1993, the growth was 26.1 percent over the previous year. 1.4 A new pattern has formed in opening up and outstanding achievements have been made in foreign economic relations and trade. --A new multilevel, all-dimensional, and multimodal pattern of opening up has been preliminarily formed. So far, five SEZs, 32 economic and technological development zones, and 52 state-level high and new-technology development zones have been set up. There are over 900 cities and counties in China that are open to the outside world. The opening up has started to spread from primary and secondary industries to tertiary industry. Improvements have been made in both the soft and the hard environments for investment. The service systems oriented to foreign-funded enterprises and laws and ordinances for transactions with other countries have been constantly improving. --Gratifying results have been made in foreign trade. China's total import and export volume rose from $20.64 billion in 1978 to $195.8 billion in 1993, representing an increase of 8.5 times, and the average annual growth rate was 16.2 percent. In 1993, China's total foreign trade volume ranked 11th in the world. The import and export volume of China now takes up 35 percent of the country's GNP, making China one of the most open countries in the world. --China has been showing a strong momentum of absorption and utilization of foreign capital. From 1979 to 1993, China approved a total of 174,000 foreign-invested projects and the actual input made by foreign investors totaled $63.9 billion. In 1993 alone, 83,000 projects of foreign investment were approved with the amount of foreign capital utilized being $25.76 billion. --China's opening up has shifted from the previous practice of one-way introduction to two-way exchange. China encourages enterprises with adequate strength to make investments and set up enterprises abroad. By 1993, 4,497 Chinese enterprises had been set up in over 120 countries and regions, with $5.16 billion of investment made by Chinese investors. 1.5 People's living standards have been improving by the year and so has their quality of life. Since the reform and opening up began 15 years ago, the living standards of urban and rural residents have greatly improved. Peasant per-capita income per annum rose from 134 yuan in 1978 to 921 yuan in 1993; the per-capita wage of workers in cities and towns rose from 615 yuan in 1978 to 3,236 yuan in 1993. Price hikes factored in, these two increases represent an average annual growth of 7 percent and 5 percent respectively. Housing conditions of urban and rural residents have improved. The per-capita living space in urban areas increased from 3.6 square meters in 1978 to 8 square meters in 1993; and that in rural areas from 8.1 square meters to 19 square meters. The balance of saving deposits of urban and rural residents increased from 21.06 billion yuan in 1978 to 1.4764 trillion yuan in 1993. The number of students on campus in institutions of higher learning rose from 856,000 in 1978 to 4.4 million in 1993. These enormous changes indicate that the road of expanding market regulation and reinforcing the role of market mechanisms that China has followed in its reform and opening up in the past 15 years is correct and China's economic structural reform has stood on a new starting point. 2. The Basic Experience of China's Economic Restructuring 2.1 The theoretical development of China's economic restructuring. China's economic restructuring is the self-development and perfection of the socialist system and is an unprecedented theoretical exploration and bold practice. The breakthrough in reform theories and progress in practice run through the whole process of reform and opening up. Prior to reform and opening up, China implemented a highly centralized planned economy marked by mandatory planning. To begin with, we proposed the principle of "taking the planned economy as the mainstay and supplementing it with market regulation" in 1979 and then set the goal of socialist planned commodity economy in 1984. We went further in 1992 by explicitly saying that the goal of China's economic restructuring was to establish a socialist market economic system. This is the most important breakthrough in the theory of China's economic restructuring and an innovative advance in Marxist political economics, and has set the goal and direction for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking has played a key role in the significant breakthrough in the theory and practices of China's economic restructuring. 2.2 Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking greatly contributes to China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and opening up and modernization, founded the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and laid out a grand blueprint for China's reform and opening up. A series of expositions by him on reform and opening up and the establishment of a socialist market economy occupy an extremely important position. He pointed out that China is still at the initial stage of socialism. The nature of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces and the way to do so is reform and opening up. He laid stress on emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, taking our own path without mechanically copying foreign examples, respecting the innovative spirit of the masses, and proceeding in everything from China's actual situation. He pointed out that both planning and the market are economic means and that a socialist country can also develop a market economy. He advocated that in the practice of reform, we "need not argue with one another but should make experiments and blaze new trails in a bold manner" and that we verify the truth by practice. He has also stressed time and again that we should boldly absorb and draw on all achievements created in human civilizations, including all advanced forms of management and operation of developed capitalist countries which reflect the laws of modern socialized production. Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, which clearly shows the direction of China's reform and opening up, is a huge impetus for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping has made historic contributions to China's reform and opening up. 2.3 The basic experience of China's economic restructuring. --Sticking to economic development as the central task and taking as the fundamental socialist task the liberation and development of productive forces through reform and opening up. The practice of China's reform proves that only by changing once and for all the economic structure that restricts the development of productive forces and by establishing a socialist market economic structure which is full of vitality and vigor can we promote the development of productive forces. --In the course of reform and opening up, we should absorb and use the successful experiences of other countries and, more importantly, seek truth from facts and find a new path with Chinese characteristics in the course of practice. In reform and opening up, we stick to the viewpoint that practice comes first and judge the success or failure of everything mainly by adhering to the criterion of whether it is beneficial to promoting productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of our socialist country, and beneficial to enhancing the living standards of the people. --Using planning and the market as the means to regulate the economy, fostering and developing a socialist market system, and bringing into full play the fundamental role of market mechanisms in the allocation of resources. In the practice over the past 15 years, we have always stuck to market-oriented reforms, removed price controls, fostered and established a market system, made sound the market order and laws and regulations for fair competition, brought into play the role of market mechanisms, thus promoting the smooth reform of the entire economic structure. --Correctly handling the relationships between reform, development, and stability, and seizing the opportunity to quicken the change from the old structure to the new structure so that the national economy can be further enhanced at intervals of several years. Reform and opening up are the drive for development and development is the foundation for social stability and long-term national peace, and maintaining social stability is an indispensable condition for developing the economy and smoothly proceeding with reform. --Sticking to the integration of reform at home and opening to the outside world so that they promote each other and benefit each other. Opening to the outside world is China's basic national policy which will remain unchanged for a long time to come. Opening to the outside world, attracting capital and advanced technology from abroad, learning foreign advanced management experiences, and spurring China's enterprises to participate in competition in the international market have effectively promoted the deepening of reform at home and economic development. 3. The Goal of China's Economic Development and the Basic Framework of a Socialist Market Economic Structure 3.1 The goal of economic development. In 1980, China set the three-step strategic goal for socialist modernization. The first step is that China will double its GNP in approximately a decade, thus basically resolving the problem of food and clothing for the people. The second step is that it will double its GNP again by the end of this century so that the people will be able to lead a comparatively comfortable life. The third step is that by the middle of the next century, China will be able to catch up with or overtake the level of medium-developed countries so that the people will be better off. The first step was already achieved in 1988. In light of China's current development, the second step can be achieved ahead of time. In order to achieve the second-step and third-step strategic goal, it is necessary to quicken the establishment of a new socialist market economic structure so that China's economy can develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way. 3.2 The basic framework of a socialist market economic structure. The economic structure we are now establishing is an economic structure in which public ownership and a market economy are inherently united, which is under the active and effective macroeconomic control of the State, the market mechanisms of which play an essential role in allocating resources, and which can combine efficiency and equality to high standards. The goal of establishing a new structure through reform is to liberate and develop productive forces to the greatest extent, reinforce comprehensive national strength, and enhance the people's living standards. The basic framework is: 3.2.1 Transforming the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. It is necessary to stick to the principle of taking the publicly owned sector as the mainstay while striving for a simultaneous development of all economic sectors, further transform the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and establish a modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in which property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated, and scientific management is established. Establishing a modern enterprise system is a necessary requirement for developing large-scale socialized production and the market economy. It is the direction for the reform of China's state-owned enterprises as well as an effective form of achieving the integration of public ownership and the market economy. 3.2.2 Fostering and developing a market system and establishing a mechanism by which prices are mainly formed by the market. It is necessary to establish a nationwide integrated and open market system to closely combine the urban market with the rural market, link the domestic market with the international market, and create a fair environment for competition to optimize the allocation of resources. On the precondition of maintaining the relative stability of the general level of prices, we should remove price controls from competitive commodities and services, cancel the two-tier pricing system for the means of production, quicken the process of subjecting the prices of production elements to the market, and establish a mechanism by which prices are mainly set by the market. 3.2.3 Transforming the government's functions and establishing a sound macroeconomic control system. It is necessary to further transform government organizations, transform government functions in economic management, and establish a macroeconomic control system in which the national economy is managed mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative means. We should quicken the reform of the fiscal and tax, banking, and planned investment systems, and ensure the healthy operation of the national economy through effective macroeconomic control. 3.2.4 Establishing a rational income distribution system and a social security system. It is necessary to stick to a system that takes the principle of "to each according to his work" as its mainstay and allows the coexistence of many forms of distribution and to embody the principle of giving priority to efficiency and taking fairness into account. We should introduce competitive mechanisms, smash egalitarianism, and stick to encouraging some localities and people to become prosperous first, and then gradually attaining common prosperity. We should establish a multilayer and multiform social security system which embraces social insurance, social relief, social welfare, solace and settlement, social mutual help, and personal savings and accumulation security. The level of social security must be in keeping with China's national conditions. 3.2.5 Stabilizing the basic productive relationships in rural areas and establishing a rural economic structure suited to the socialist market economy. We should stick to contract responsibility systems, mainly the one on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, and the two-tier management system combining unification and division. We should develop the rural socialized service system and promote the specialization, commercialization, and socialization of agriculture. On the precondition of maintaining the steady growth of such basic agricultural products as grain and cotton, we will readjust the rural industrial structure and quicken the development of township and town enterprises and other nonagricultural sectors, offering more employment opportunities for the surplus rural work force. 3.2.6 Deepening the reform of the foreign trade structure and opening wider to the outside world. We should establish an open system of foreign trade and economic relations, actively participate in international economic competition and cooperation, and bring into play the comparative advantages of China's economy so that the domestic economy and the international economy will be linked with each other and supplement each other. We should standardize foreign economic activities and correctly handle foreign economic relations in keeping with China's national conditions and the general norms for international economic activities, and continuously enhance competitiveness in the world. 3.2.7 Further reform the system of science and technology, as well as the system of education. Responding to the needs of a socialist market economy, we will build a new system which conforms to the laws of development of science and technology itself, and which closely integrates science and technology with economy to promote scientific and technological progress and to realize a comprehensive and coordinated development of the economy, science, technology, and society. We need to actively develop the scientific and technological enterprises which belong to various ownership systems and operate in various styles. The organs specializing in applied and development research, and the organs providing scientific and technological consultation and information services, should face the market and promote integration of science and technology into economy. We must change the situation in which the government takes charge of everything in providing education and form a new system in which the government is the main player in providing education while various quarters of the society also take part. We will strengthen compulsory education, vigorously develop vocational and adult education, optimize the educational structure, and train various types of professionals for the society. 3.2.8 Strengthen the building of legal system. The essence of a market economy is an economy under a legal system. In the building and perfecting process, the socialist market economy system requires a sound legal system as its norm and to protect it. Before the end of this century, China must build a legal system which meets the needs of a socialist market economy, expedite the process of legislation for economic law, reform and improve judicial, law enforcing, and supervisory mechanisms, and perfect the organs providing legal services. The above-mentioned eight areas constitute the basic framework of the system of a socialist market economy in China, in other words, they are the eight pillars supporting the new system in China. At this moment, our concept is to initially build a new economic system in the 1990's. On this basis, we must work hard for about 20 years to form a set of systems which are more mature and stable in various aspects. At present, on the basis of continuously summing up experiences in practice, we are moving toward this goal in a planned manner. We are full of confidence in the future of China's reform. 4. The Main Duties of Reform of Economic System in China in 1994 4.1 The year 1994 is a crucial year of realizing overall advancement of, and major breakthroughs in, reform of the economic system. This year's basic principle of work is: Grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. The main duties are: Change operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises, find an effective way to establish a modern enterprise system and expedite the reform of macroeconomic management system, then, with these as key points, carry out other reforms in a coordinated manner. This year, amid the rapid operation of the national economy, we must thoroughly promote reform, and in the overall changing of the old system into the new one, we must ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. At present, we must earnestly strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, check inflation, properly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability, and ensure a smooth process of reform. 4.2 Enterprise reform. This year, the State Council will select about 100 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to try out the building of a modern enterprises system and explore an effective way to establish a modern enterprise system. Regarding state-owned small enterprises, they will be transformed through forms such as leasing, contracting, and selling. Concerning enterprises which have been making losses for a long time, and which have debts larger than capital, they will go bankrupt according to law. A majority of state-owned enterprises must continue to change operational mechanisms, tackle the historical burdens on enterprises step by step, and create conditions for establishing a modern enterprise system. Urban collective enterprises, township and town enterprises, and nongovernmental high-tech enterprises may change their system to a joint-stock system, and those with better conditions may transform into joint-stock companies. Private enterprises will be encouraged to change into standardized companies. 4.3 Properly carry out reforms of the systems of taxation, finance, planning, and investment, and make a substantive step in the building of a new macro regulation and control system. --The main content of revenue reform is to change the current system in which localities are solely responsible for their own finances, to a revenue-sharing system on the basis of a reasonable division of administrative power between the central and local authorities, establish a central and a local taxation system, and practice a system in which the central authorities give tax reimbursements to localities. We must step up the effort to carry out research on a standardized system in which the central authorities transfer revenues to and from local authorities and make preparations for further perfection of the taxation system in the future. --We wil promote the circulating-tax system which is mainly based on value-added tax and, on the basis of lowering the income tax rate for state-owned enterprises, straighten out relations of distribution between the state and state-owned enterprises. We will standardize income tax for domestically funded enterprises, levy a standardized individual income tax, expand the scope for collecting resource taxes, and build and perfect the system of land taxes (fee) and property taxes. --The reform of the financial system is mainly to build a macro regulation and control system to be enforced by the central bank, which independently implements currency policy under the leadership of the State Council; to improve and strengthen the central bank's functions; to maintain stability of the value of currency; to organize policy banks; to gradually separate the business of policy nature from the business of commercial nature; and to turn specialized state banks into state-owned commercial banks. --To further deepen the reforms of planning and investment systems, we will change the function of planned management; strengthen the macro-nature, strategic nature, and policy nature of the contents of planning; and simplify annual planning, stressing medium- and long-term planning, and reduce mandatory planning goals. We will build a mechanism for restraining investment, strengthen the risk responsibility for main investment bodies and bank loans, perfect the macro-regulation and control over investment scale and structure, and standardize decisionmaking behavior regarding investment. 4.4 With development of markets of production factors as the key point, we must perfect the market system and continue to promote price reform. We must continue to develop commodities markets, make special efforts to develop the markets of production factors such as capital, land, and labor markets, step up efforts to establish market regulations, standardize the behavior of the main market body, perfect market order, and form a market system which is unified, open, competitive, and orderly as soon as possible. We will further promote price reform and combine as soon as possible the two systems of prices of means of production. 4.5 Expedite the reforms of social insurance system and housing system. The key point is to further reform and perfect the systems of old-age provision and medical insurance for staff and workers in cities, and the direction is to let units and individuals shoulder together old-age and medical insurance funds and to link overall planning by the society to individual accounts. We must expedite housing reform, thoroughly promote provident funds for housing purposes, and vigorously develop houses which suits our economy. 4.6 Promote reform of the foreign trade system, further expand opening up to the outside world. We must really delegate self-determining power to foreign trade enterprises for them to do business, and develop export-oriented enterprise groups according to the requirement of modern enterprises system. We will further reform the system of import management, strengthen the role of chambers of commerce in coordination, and gradually establish a system of public tender and auction for quotas and permits. Step by step, we will allow large and medium-sized enterprises which have better conditions, scientific and technological enterprises, and circulation enterprises to have the right to engage in foreign trade. 4.7 Expedite legal system building for economy. We will announce, one by one, laws such as securities, labor, foreign trade, central bank, commercial bank, bill and receipt, insurance, futures exchange, and social security laws. For the areas which do not have the conditions for legislation at this moment, we will still formulate corresponding administrative rules or regulations. At present, the above-mentioned reform plans have already been announced, progress has been relatively smooth, and this indicates that China has taken an important step toward the building of a socialist market economy system. In the first quarter of this year, China's GDP increased 12.7 percent, industrial production increased 18.6 percent, revenue increased 21.4 percent, the national economy maintained a good operational trend, and the overall economy drew closer to the goal of macro-regulation and control. The main problems at this time are: Inflation is too high, some state-owned industrial enterprises have difficulties, and agricultural production lacks staying power. These problems have to be solved through deepening reform. According to the demand raised by the 1994 government work report, which was adopted at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, the Chinese Government plans to have a 9 percent GDP growth this year. In light of the fact that the GDP increased 13 percent for two consecutive years, it is suitable to arrange such a growth rate. By so doing we can maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 5. China Will Continue To Advance Along the Road of Reform and Opening Up The building of socialist market economy system is a complicated and arduous historic mission. The reform over the past 15 years has scored great results, but there are also dissatisfying areas, and on the road ahead, we will still run into new twists and turns and difficulties. But we believe that this undertaking is in accordance with the basic interest of the Chinese people, and is conducive to peace, stability, and development in the world. China is still a developing country, and its people are still not well-off, and efforts still have to be made in the last seven years of this century to solve the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in the rural areas, to help them cast off poverty and achieve affluence. China has to work very hard for several decades in order to achieve the living standard characteristic of a moderately developed country. China's construction not only requires a lasting stable environment at home, but also requires a lasting stable and peaceful environment in the international community, in particular, China needs a good neighboring environment. We will continue to seriously learn from the successful and beneficial experiences acquired by the economic systems of various countries. The Chinese Government's application for restoring its status as a signatory to GATT, is an important strategic decision on further expanding opening up to the outside world. When China participates in international the division of labor and international exchange according to the common international economic rules, it will be good for China's development and for the countries which have economic interactions with China. After 15 years of reform and opening up, China's investment environment has continuously improved, its economy has maintained a rapid growth trend, and its huge market potential is being unleashed, greatly attracting foreign investors. We are truly thankful to the persons who have offered assistance to China's economic development, we welcome the experts and scholars from various countries to China to carry out cooperation and offer valuable opinions on China's reform and opening up, and we sincerely hope more entrepreneurs from various countries and regions can come to China to make investments and to strengthen economic and trade interactions. Undoubtedly, the establishment of a new economic system will provide the best environment, in terms of system, to the foreign businessmen who come to invest in China. Human beings are marching toward a new century. In order to have a bright future for China and for the world, China will work hard to handle its own affairs well, resolutely follow the independent and self-determining foreign policy of peace, and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries in the world-- especially with our neighboring countries--on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China, amid reform and opening up, and rising amid development, will always be a reliable force safeguarding regional and world peace. Let us work hard together to build a new international political and economic order that is just and bring human beings to a peaceful, developing, and prosperous 21st century. Thank you!
