The talks demonstrated that the French partners have been very well informed about the political situation in Slovakia. They have expressed sincere interest in cooperating with us in numerous spheres. Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik granted an interview to our editor Magda Pospisilova last night, after his arrival by air from Paris. [Begin recording] [Pospisilova] When you were received by French President Francois Mitterrand, it took almost an hour instead of the planned 35 minutes. This attests to the success of your trip. Can you tell us something specific? [Moravcik] I was very pleased by the president's interest in the events in Slovakia and our foreign policy, especially Slovakia's endeavors to integrate with the European Union. I had enough time to explain our policies to the president. I stressed that the presence of France in the center of Europe, and Slovakia as well, was very important from the point of view of stability in Central Europe and that of the stability of all Europe. The president was also intensely interested in our relations with our neighbors--he was, above all, interested in relations with Hungary. I explained our policy aims in this sphere in great detail, and I can say that my explanation met with great understanding on the part of the president. [Pospisilova] The result of all this is also the fact that Mr. Mitterrand accepted an invitation to visit Slovakia. [Moravcik] Yes, I conveyed an invitation from our president, and I can say that the president accepted this invitation with genuine and real interest. [Pospisilova] When will this official visit take place? [Moravcik] We assume that it will take place in September. It is now a technical question--we must agree on a suitable date for both sides. [Pospisilova] You said during all of your meetings in Paris that we ourselves were capable of agreeing about bilateral questions with Hungary and that we did not need the mediating role of the European Union. How did the French side accept your words? [Moravcik] With great respect, above all, when we explained our approach toward the solution of the open questions that remain between the two countries. There are no problems in this respect. [Pospisilova] You had talks with former French President Giscard d'Estaing about the significance of political parties in creating stability in Central Europe. What should our political entities do for this? [Moravcik] The basic idea is very simple. I think it is being implemented in practice in our political life. A political party structure similar to that in Western Europe should be created. It is very important because the significance of direct cooperation between the political parties is growing. [Pospisilova] How many of the big economic projects that you discussed in Paris will be started by the end of September--that is, by the beginning of the elections? [Moravcik] It would be good if there were as many as possible. [Pospisilova] Which ones specifically? [Moravcik] We would be very glad if we could make progress in completing the building of Mochovce [nuclear power station]; there is also a chance that cooperation in the sphere of the gas industry will become more dynamic. We are interested also in cooperation in the automobile industry and in the participation of French firms. [Pospisilova] So far, you have talked only about what you agreed with the French representatives. What are the open questions? [Moravcik] [passage omitted] As for the Bratislava metro, I expressed our view--that we considered this project very interesting because it was of a high technical standard, but, in view of our current economic situation, we had to consider in greater detail whether the economic possibilies existed for it. [Pospisilova] You also had talks with Minister of Defense Leotard. Did you discuss possible cooperation in the arms industry? [Moravcik] Such cooperation is being considered. I think it would be for the benefit of our industry. [end recording]
