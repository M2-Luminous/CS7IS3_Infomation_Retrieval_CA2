Cambodian officials are checking the number of these logs. Trat Provincial Forestry Officer Chaikon Sapkit said the National Security Council will make the first recommendation on opening the border. The issue will then be forwarded to the Foreign Ministry, which will submit it to the cabinet for approval. The entire process is time-consuming and could be too late to meet the Cambodian Government deadline. The five temporary crossing points in Trat that are expected to be opened are: - a) Ban Pong Chi, Tambon Dan Chumphon, Bo Rai District for the Phiphat Pamai Company; - b) Ban Khlong Pun Piak, Tambon Dan Chumphon for the Chao Phraya Chai Company; - c) Ban Kraduk Chang, Tambon Dan Chumphon for the Wooden Supply Import and Export Company; - d) Ban Mamuang, Village Group 3, Tambon Nonsi, Bo Rai District for the Nit Yothakan Company; and - e) Ban Tha Sen, Village Group 3, Tambon Laem Klat, Muang District for the Thung Din Dam Company. The log transportation ban resulted in 25.21 million cubic meters of logs worth 15 billion baht being left in Cambodia and the loss of 1.2 million baht daily in use of transportation equipment and 150 million baht in skilled and unskilled labor.
