Korean police said that Yi will be arrested on charges of fraud and violation of the bad check control law upon his arrival at Kimpo International Airport at 4:35 PM Thursday [6 January] aboard Korean Air flight 025. In June 1991, Yi fled to the United States after he came under suspicion of swindling 870 million won (1.08 million U.S. dollars) out of several people by dishonoring checks. He was arrested by the U.S. Immigration Service in June last year after the Korean Government nullified his passport and was sentenced to deportation by a U.S. court. Last year, police persuaded 12 fugitives overseas to return to the country.
