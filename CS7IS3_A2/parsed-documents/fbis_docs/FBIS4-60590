Narasimha Rao, have come to acquire an undefinable and ethereal air of unreality. Some months ago, he visited the UK ostensibly to witness the signing of an agreement guaranteeing to British investors certain safeguards against expropriation and the like which were nothing new and had been Government pollcy for years. No doubt, he met the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, and addressed businessmen and NRIs, but these are akin to the perks of a dignitary on official visit. Now, his U.S. visit leaves us wondering, much as little Peterkin was in Robert Southey's gem of a poem `Blenheim', `What good came of it at last?' Even those who supported Mr. Rao in his decision, taken braving the preponderant opinion in the country against the U.S. visit, must be asking the same que@tion. At least the old raconteur in the poem had the gumption to say, `That I cannot tell... But it was a famous victory.' Mr. Rao's vlsit was no famous victory; it fits no description other than being betwixt and between. True to type, Mr. Rao's to-ing and fro-ing from Houston to Boston to Washington falls into a nebulous category, devoid of any sharp focus or sense of concrete achievement. He need not have gone half the way round the world to tell manufacturers and captains of industry what most of them must have, in any case, heard many times before. They must have been told, sometimes by the Prime Minister himself, during their probing mlsslons to Indla, that the reforms are irreversible, that India is the largest emerging market, that it is a good country to do business wlth and that any obstacles brought to notice would be swiftly attended to. Mr. Rao's address to the Harvard University audience cannot exactly be hailed as earth-shaking. The Memoranda of Understanding signed are of no such significance as to require the Prime Minister to lend the weight of his presence. The members of the delegation of Indian businessmen were all persons who knew their way about in the world and whether any particular bonanzas came their way by synchronising thelr travels wlth those of Mr. Rao is for them to declde. Of course, when a Prime Minister officially visits a country, he gets his meed of courtesies and ceremonies. Mr. Rao made good use of the invitation coaxed out of the U.S. Congress to address it by buttressing his reiteratlon of India's known position on contentious issues wlth quotations and parallels in American hlstory. The reference to the U.S. Supreme Court judgement of Texas was particularly relishable and apposite. However, the US Congressmen and Senators are hard nuts to crack, and while graciously punctuating the speeches of distinguished visitors in their midst with applause and according them standing ovations, they still manage to keep their own counsel and go their own way. And that leaves Mr. Rao's encounter with the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton. For all the advance bllling it received as the grand climacteric of the visit, the outcome of the meeting seems to have turned out to be a let-down for both parties. That much was obvious from the body language of both of them at the joint press conference following their talks. And with Mr. Clinton's clear indication that there was no narrowing of differences between the two countries on issues on which the IJS had chosen to wield the big stick, the one event by which much store was set could only be said to have misfired. Indeed, it must have been painfully embarrassing both for the Prime Minister and those who watched the live telecast of the press conference that he stood forlorn at the lectern for a full half-an-hour, whlle the U.S. President was having a fun time answering questions on subjects that had nothing to do with the occasion. So, what is there to show for the visit? Mr. Clinton's agreeing to keep an open mind on India's claims for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council? His promise of visits by the U.S. Defense and Commerce Secretaries to India in July and November? His accepting Mr. Rao's invitation to visit India himself? The indeterminate continuance of the dialogue for as long as it takes to arrive at a convergence? Judged with hard-headed horse sense, the cost-benefit ratio of Mr. Rao's visit looks like nothing to write home about.
