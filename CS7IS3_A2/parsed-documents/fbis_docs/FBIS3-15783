Immediately after Ilie Ilascu was elected as a deputy, I officially intervened with Sergey Leontiev, chief of the Grigoriopol executive, where the prison is located, Mr. Postovan told the BASAPRESS agency. According to the same source, the prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova specified that, although in his intervention he mentioned the responsibility for violating Ilascu's status as a deputy, one cannot count on a serious answer, because only on the basis of special authority granted by parliament can one conduct negotiations with the anti-constitutional bodies in Tiraspol. BASAPRESS points out that the president of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic, Igor Smirnov, said a few days before the 27 February elections that the Tiraspol authorities will not recognize Ilie Ilascu's parliamentary immunity. The Central Electoral Commission is working on the last specifications regarding the final results of the 27 February elections, a commission spokesman told BASAPRESS today. According to legal provisions, within 24 hours the final results will be submitted to the Constitutional Court, which, in turn, will confirm the legality of the elections within 10 days. The duties of the Central Electoral Commission will expire after the validation of deputies' mandates and the setting up of the new parliament. Also in connection with the 27 February elections, the electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity Movement declared that it has a lot of information regarding numerous violations of the law during the elections. According to the (?INFOTAG) news agency, this electoral bloc submitted a notification to the Supreme Justice Court, which stresses that all these violations have essentially distorted the ballot results to the detriment of the Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity Movement. Notifications to this effect were also submitted to the Central Electoral Commission, as well as to the justice bodies in all the districts of Chisinau, the INFOTAG news agency specifies. By the middle of the current month, a representative invested with the full power of the president of the Russian Federation is expected to arrive in Chisinau to coordinate the measures of settling the conflict in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova, the INFOTAG news agency reports. According to the same source, the ambassador in charge of special missions, Vladimir Vasev, will be President Yeltsin's representative in the Republic of Moldova. Political observers view Vladimir Vasev's arrival as a positive reaction to the results of the recent parliamentary elections in the Republic of Moldova, INFOTAG emphasizes.
