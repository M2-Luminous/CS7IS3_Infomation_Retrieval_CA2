But they would have to wait even longer before they got some of the more substantial powers listed in the interim constitution, commission deputy director-general Johan Grabe said. "The first batch of provincial powers will comprise all the powers and functions contained in the ordinances and statutes of the four old provinces, plus those of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing territories," he said. Specific powers listed in the constitution, but excluded at this stage, included housing, agriculture, trade and industry, financial borrowing, land affairs, education, and provincial service commissions. Grabe said the enormous workload encountered in preparing the first batch of legislation, particularly the need to get the technical details correct, had been the main reason for the delay. Government departments, assisted by state law advisers, had begun work on the second batch. Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned at the weekend that the success of the government of national unity could be in jeopardy if the constitutional deadlock with the Inkatha Freedom Party over provincial powers, particularly in KwaZulu/Natal, was not resolved soon. He said Inkatha's qualified support for the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] was contingent on the autonomous implementation by provinces of RDP chapters in their jurisdiction. After meeting provincial leaders last week, Deputy Provincial Affairs Minister Valli Moosa said a proclamation returning about half the provincial powers to the regions would be published in last Friday's GOVERNMENT GAZETTE. He said provincial powers would be phased in, but there would be provincial differences as each province had its own peculiarities. Grabe said the desire to proceed in an "orderly manner" had also slowed down proceedings. "It has been a hell of a process." However, the first batch of "quite substantial" legislation would be ready for signing by President Nelson Mandela on his return from the OAU summit in Tunis. It would then take a few days to prepare for publication in the GAZETTE. Grabe said a "realistic" publication date was Friday next week. If government wanted it published earlier, a special GAZETTE would have to be prepared. Nearly two weeks ago provincial powers were temporarily transferred to central government, which said they would be passed back once provinces demonstrated their ability to administer them.
