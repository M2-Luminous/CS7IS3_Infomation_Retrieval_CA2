DPA learned this from judicial circles today. Sharitah, who is being accused of aiding and abetting murder, arrived in Germany under mysterious circumstances at the beginning of January and was arrested and temporarily held. At the same time, charges were brought against a Stasi official from the department dealing with the fight against terrorism. One person was killed and 23 injured in the attack, which took place 11 years ago on 25 August 1983. [See 8 April Terrorism Report] A Berlin justice spokeswoman, Uta Filster, confirmed that two defendants will be charged with aiding and abetting murder, but she refused to go into detail. As recently as in mid-April, a former Stasi lieutenant, Helmut Voigt (51), was sentenced to four years imprisonment by the Berlin court for aiding and abetting the attack. The court considered it proven that Voigt at least passed on the order to hand over the explosives for the attack to a suspected German terrorist, Johannes Weinrich. The Stasi official who is now facing charges is believed to have passed on the explosives to Weinrich, as ordered by Voigt. According to the public prosecutor, at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin Weinrich deposited the explosives with Sharitah, who is now being indicted. Weinrich, who is believed to belong to the international terrorist group "Carlos," picked up the explosives again on the day when the attack was carried out. It has become known that Sharitah was allegedly lured to Budapest by the German authorities. Security officials reportedly made it clear to him that he cannot return to his home country because of his participation in the attack. In the trial against Voigt, Sharitah testified amid tight security measures -- he was protected by a screen. He stressed that Syria is fighting terrorists. However, according to findings by German security authorities, Weinrich and "Carlos" lived in the Syrian capital Damascus at least until the middle of last year. The Federal Government has asked Syria several times to extradite the two suspected terrorists against whom an arrest warrant because of murder was issued by the court in Berlin-Tiergarten 10 years ago.
