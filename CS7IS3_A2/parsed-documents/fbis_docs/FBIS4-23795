Until now the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] was hostile to the principle of a truce: it considered that the fighting and the massacres had to be stopped at the same time. [passage omitted] Dominique de Courcelles met with Theodore Sindikubwabo, the interim president of Rwanda. She asked him how this cease-fire will be implemented: [Begin recording] [Sindikubwabo] The peace agreement was proposed by a facilitator and a mediator assisted by the OAU secretary general. So it is for them to announce it -- the OAU or the United Nations. [De Courcelles] Today? [Sindikubwabo] Today or perhaps tomorrow. They must announce that there is a cease-fire that has been agreed on. So they are to show the instruments of the cease-fire, in other words the documents, countersigned by both sides. Then we, as the government, will give orders to our troops and orders to the members of the government to ensure that this peace agreement is respected. [end recording]
