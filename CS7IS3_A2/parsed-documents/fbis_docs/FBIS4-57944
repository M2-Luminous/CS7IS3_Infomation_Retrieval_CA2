Six U.S. Coast Guard ships have also been crisscrossing off Haiti in an effort to intercept Haitian boat people. The eight U.S. warships in charge of enforcing respect for the embargo are supported by frigates from the Canadian and Argentine navies. Last Saturday and Sunday, according to the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy fired warning shots twice at ships that were ignoring the orders of the ships that are enforcing the embargo. One of the ships succeeded, however, in reaching the Haitian coast.
