Background on the Indiana Program On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in the July 26, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16. II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated January 4, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1193), Indiana submitted a proposed amendment ( # 93&hyph;1) intended to address the required program amendments concerning revegetation at 30 CFR 914.16 (i), (j), (k), (l), and (m). See 57 FR 41869 (September 14, 1982), and 57 FR 22653 (May 29, 1992) for background on these required amendments. The amendments submitted on January 4, 1993, were reviewed and approved by the Director on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). By letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1392), Indiana submitted formal program amendment # 94&hyph;3. The proposed program amendment concerns the performance standards for restoring soil productivity for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana stated all of the rules, except 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16, were submitted in a previous package (amendment # 93&hyph;1) and their amended language was approved by OSM at 58 FR 41039 (August 2, 1993). In addition, 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, which was part of amendment # 93&hyph;1 has been excluded from this submittal. Indiana stated that as a result of ongoing Federal litigation over the language of the previously-submitted subsection (c) of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, the Indiana Division of Reclamation feels that this rule, as printed at 15 Indiana Register (IR) 2167, is adequate and effective, and that 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145 will not be resubmitted. Only those provisions which differ from those amendments approved by OSM in the August 2, 1992, Federal Register notice are considered by OSM to be amendments subject to public review and comment under this announcement. The proposed amendments are summarized below. 1. 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16␣Performance Bond Release; Requirements Subdivision 16(c)(3)(A) is amended by deleting the work ``or'' and replacing that word with ``and.'' As amended, subdivision 16(c)(3)(A) provides that Phase III bond may be released only after: (A) the operator has successfully completed all surface coal mining and reclamation activities required in IC 13&hyph;4.1, 310 IAC 12, ``and'' the permit. 2. 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145␣Prime Farmland; Special Performance Standards
