Speakers at the symposium were unanimous in saying the crackdown cases were by no means accidental and they were absolutely deliberate and premeditated human rights abuses committed against the background of their malicious anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign, and illegal acts of political suppression, and a typical national chauvinistic crime. They said there is no change in the Korea policy of the Japanese government authorities resorting to anti-DPRK moves to isolate and stifle it on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" and that the Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon organizations was completely illegal from the legal point of view.
