This decision is strictly applied and those who return to Kosova are fined, punished with 30 days imprisonment or are taken their passports for three years. In conformity with the decision, passports were taken from thousands of Albanians who travelled to Albania through Macedonia or Greece. It is difficult for the Albanians of Kosova to get visas for Albania. Those who ask for visas have been maltreated and asked to collaborate with police. That is why there are very few requests for visas. The Serbian authorities hinder all kinds of communication between the Albanians in Kosova and the Albanians in Albania. In many areas of Kosova, Serbian authorities have put jamming devices in order to impend the transmission of the Albanian radio-television programs. The devices are under the control of the Serbian police and army. The exchange of artistic, scientific and cultural values is also prohibited. The University and National Library of Kosova, the Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Albanological Institution and other institutions in Kosova can not receive any publications from Albania. The Serbian police punishes the persons who keep a book or a newspaper from Albania. The wall between Albania and Kosova is so impassable that there are no telephone links with Albania. Although the Albanians in Kosova live in an ethnic compact territory, their mother-land Albania is very far away.
