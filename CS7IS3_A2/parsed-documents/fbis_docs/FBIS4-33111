FBIS4-33111 "drlat106_m_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Brazil Economists: Economy Growing Despite Inflation Economists: Economy Growing Despite Inflation PY0106202794 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 30 May 94 p B1 PY0106202794 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Fabio Pahim Jr.] [Text] The Brazilian economy is achieving an breakthrough: It has recovered over the past seven quarters despite ever-increasing inflation which has doubled its monthly rate over the past 2 years. Through alternating short-term low periods and strong high periods, the economic activity has come out of the hole it dug in the third quarter of 1992, although it has not grown evenly and does not have a guaranteed future. Economist from the most diverse backgrounds have stressed that this year the GDP will grow between 3 and 5 percent compared to 4.96 percent in 1993. The next president, who will inherit fiscal and monetary stability, will have to determine in 1995 whether the process continues. The drop in production and sales that began last month is seen only as a "recessive splutter" by Antonio Barros de Castro of the Industrial Economy Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Claudio Considera, director of the Applied Economic Research Institute (Apea), stressed that "the first quarter's figures surprised us." During the January-March period the GDP grew by 4.3 percent compared to the same period in 1993 and could close the first half of the year at 3.6 percent. Some $25 billion was added to the economy in 1993, in other words, growth in Brazil is half as much as in Venezuela or Peru. The start of a long-term growth cycle has not been confirmed by economists like former Central Bank President Alfonso Celso Pastore or Mappin Company President Carlos Antonio Rocca. Pastore said: "We do not see an overall warming: Some sectors have high growth while others have low growth; some sectors have strong demand while others have less demand." Rocca believes negative factors like low exports and high interest rates force the market down, thus counterbalancing positive factors like increases in investment. During the first quarter, the Ipea noted a rise last year in the Gross Development of Fixed Capital from 15.2 percent of the GDP to 16.2 percent. "Growth is sustainable when there is investment," stressed Considera, a specialist economist in national accounts. Rocca added: "Foreign capital assets are growing at more than 20 percent while private investment, like civil construction, is also growing." Paulo Rabello de Castro, chief editor of the magazine CONJUNTURA ECONOMICA of the Getulio Vargas Foundation [FGV], said: "Recovery is a fact." Rabello de Castro has said that this recovery is due to the strength of the private productive system. Investment must be attracted if this recovery is to be sustained. Today Brazil is investing some $74 billion, but to grow at 3.7 percent per annum another $30 billion per year is needed, and we must even try to surpass this sum of $104 billion per year, according to Economist Geraldo Gardenali, professor of the FGV-Sao Paul. He said: "These resources must come from the public sector in the form of increased efficiency and from the external sector." Increased productivity was decisive for recovery. Maria Helena Zockhun, a researcher at the Economic Research Institute Foundation-University of Sao Paulo (Fiepe-USP), has said: "Industrial prices dropped by a real average of 3.2 percent in 1993 when compared with 1992." Production per hour in Sao Paulo in 1993 increased by 11 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projects for 1994. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |How the economy must grow: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |GDP growth |3 to 5 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry |2 to 5 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agricultural sector |6 to 7 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Public deficit (operational) |0 to 3 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Monthly inflation rate (as of July) |0 to 8 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exports |$39 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Imports |$26 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sources: Issue No. 13 of INDICADORES ANTECEDENTES; Paulo Rabello de Castro, | |Antonio Barros de Castro; Claudio Considera (Ipea), and Geraldo Gardenali. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Recovery. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |How industry is recovering: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |Growth 1st Quarter 94/1st Quarter 93 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average salary |+5.2 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Unemployment Brazil-IBGE (1) |5.46 percent of the PEA [economically | | |active population] (5.88 in 1993) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial production per hour-FIESP [|+2.5 percent | |Sao Paulo State Federation of Industr-| | |ies] | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial prices |-4.6 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Physical production-IBGE |+8.1 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Physical production-FIESP (INA) [Indu-|+2.7 percent | |strial Activity Index] | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Export of manufactured goods |-3.8 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commercial sales (2) |+12.0 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(1) First 2-month period; (2) First 4-month period. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sources: IBGE [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]; FIESP; FCES-| |P [Sao Paulo State Trade Federation]; Seade Foundation; Macrometrica; and Ma-| |ria Helena Zockun. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
