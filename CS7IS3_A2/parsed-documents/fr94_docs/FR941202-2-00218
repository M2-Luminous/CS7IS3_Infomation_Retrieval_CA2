FR941202-2-00218 FR941202-2-00099 In the application notice, we will inform potential applicants how much funding we estimate will come from each program for fiscal year 1995. As noted above, we anticipate that the source and amount of funding will change in future years and will notify the grantee. If other sources of funding are added that would result in additional requirements in a future year, the Secretary will notify the grantee concerning those requirements. Proposed Priority: Accessing School-to-Work and Postsecondary Environments_A Technical Assistance Effort Purpose The purpose of this technical assistance project is to improve the skills and knowledge-base of (1) staff delivering transitional services and (2) School-to-Work Opportunities grantees to assist individuals with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, to become integrated into appropriate transition programs and School-to-Work Opportunities systems established at State and local levels. The proposed project must provide technical assistance to all Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) transition and postsecondary education projects as well as to States funded under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act to ensure that they provide personnel with the necessary training to accommodate and support students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, in the transition to a variety of postsecondary settings. The project must also disseminate information to other interested parties. Project activities must include the development of effective practice information on: (1) Promoting compliance with transition requirements mandated by Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act; (2) Helping students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, access transition programs including those supported by developing School-to-Work Opportunities systems; (3) Overcoming administrative, attitudinal, and programmatic barriers that limit the planning and implementation of effective practices for students with disabilities in transitional programs, such as those that school personnel can use to encourage and facilitate extensive student/parent involvement; (4) Working with statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems, in collaboration with activities initiated by the State Systems for Transition Services projects, to help students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, acquire the academic and occupational skills, abilities, and labor market information they need to make a smooth and effective transition from school to career-oriented work or to further education or training; (5) Building on and enriching current promising programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, school-to-apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, cooperative education, adult education, adult services, and business-education compacts; (6) Facilitating the representation of disability interests in the formation of partnerships among secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, private and public employers, labor organizations, government, community groups, parents, and other key groups; and (7) Ensuring that students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, are provided an integrated array of learning experiences in the classroom and at the worksite, including appropriate modification of curriculum, instructional techniques, equipment, and the work environment. The Secretary anticipates funding one cooperative agreement with a project period of up to 60 months subject to the requirements of 34 CFR 75.253(a) for continuation awards. In making the initial award, the Secretary will consider the extent to which applicants provide evidence that States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities grants are likely to participate in the training and other technical assistance activities provided by the Technical Assistance Project. The Technical Assistance Project must demonstrate collaborative relationships among other established and relevant school-to-work and transitional efforts, including entities that will be involved with the broader technical assistance efforts of the school-to-work opportunities initiative and entities which have assisted in the development of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Procedures to promote the involvement of students, parents, relevant employment training agencies and other providers of adult services, and members of underrepresented populations, such as minorities, women, and disadvantaged persons, in the proposed project must be clearly delineated. In determining whether to continue this technical assistance project for the third, fourth, and fifth years, the Secretary, in addition to applying the requirements of 34 CFR 75.253(a), will consider the recommendation of a review team consisting of three experts selected by the Secretary. The review, including a two-day visit to the project, is to be performed during the third quarter of the second year and must be included in the year's evaluation required under 34 CFR 75.590. Funds to cover costs associated with the services to be performed by the review team are estimated to be approximately $4,000. Priority The Technical Assistance Project considered for funding under this priority must_ (1) Identify proven models, components of models, or exemplary practices and approaches that can successfully support and accommodate students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, in transition from school to employment and other postsecondary environments, including information from model demonstration transition projects supported by all programs in OSERS and those projects supported with funds received under the School-to-Work Opportunities grants;
