FBIS4-9974 "drlat066_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Brazil Brizola Rules Out Coalition With PT Brizola Rules Out Coalition With PT PY0504234694 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 5 Apr 94 p A4 PY0504234694 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Former Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] has ruled out any possibility of an alliance with the PT [Workers Party] during the first or second round of the presidential elections. "An agreement with the current PT leadership is not viable," said Brizola, adding that he believes Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy is being artificially inflated by the surveys. "No one believes in the 39 percent he is allegedly getting because that is what he obtained in the 1989 runoff election." Regarding the possibility of an alliance with other parties, Brizola -- who yesterday lunched with Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia (PTB) [Brazilian Labor Party] at the Commercial Association of Rio de Janeiro -- said the only alliance already signed by the PDT is with the small National Mobilization Party (PMN). The former governor said a coalition with the PTB is a "natural" possibility. Regarding speculation that he would meet with PPR leaders, Brizola said: "Traditional politicians do not like me because they know I favor change and if I win the race I would end political chicanery." Brizola resigned on 2 April to run in this year's elections. He said he was satisfied with what he did during his term, adding that no other governor did more. "They may have equaled me, at best," Brizola said. At the time the PDT governor left the government, he had the lowest popularity rate for any governor in the country. He was undecided whether to run for president or for the Senate. He said: "I am attracted to participate in the national campaign," adding: "This will be my last and greatest campaign. I will use all my accumulated experience."
