Whereas in February there had been some slowing down in the pace of the recession, in March the decline in production accelerated again. This information comes from the Russian Federation Ministry of the Economy. In the first quarter of 1994 the depth of the recession in industrial production was over 20 percent compared with the corresponding period last year. Whereas at the beginning of last year the dynamics of the recession were beginning to ease off, this year the movement is heading upward (January -- 23.1 percent, February -- 24.1 percent, March -- 27.4 percent). In the opinion of Economy Ministry experts, the greatest reduction has occurred in the processing sectors. At 26.8 percent the fall in the production of consumer goods was greater than the fall in industry as a whole. As the chief of a ministry department said in conversation with your BIZNES-TASS correspondent, the greatest cause for concern today is the fact that the reforms have not touched the technological structure of production. The majority of enterprises cannot reduce production costs and thus cannot cope with the reduced demand, especially at a time of substantially increased competition in the domestic market from foreign producers.
