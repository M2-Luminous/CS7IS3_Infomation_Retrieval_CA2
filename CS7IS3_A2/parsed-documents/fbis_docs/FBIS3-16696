The "budget sitting" was still not over by the time this article was being prepared for publication. The only thing that was clear was that ratification of the estimate of state revenue and expenditure was making slow headway. One of the key questions is what the revenue figure will be. The Finance Ministry insists that a figure of 120.7 trillion rubles [R] is perfectly realistic. Chernomyrdin, however, is demanding detailed validation. The point is that numerous critics have repeatedly questioned the figure. The sum of R120.7 trillion is 16.6 percent of GDP. Last year's revenue of R17.2 trillion represented only 10.6 percent of GDP. If you bear in mind that financial discipline has not become much stricter, it should be recognized that the difference is substantial. However, the Finance Ministry argues that such a straight comparison is inappropriate, as the procedure for calculating revenue and expenditure has been somewhat modified this year (in particular tied credit, investment-related credit, will now go through the budget -- which was not formerly the case). Thus, under comparable conditions R120.7 trillion now represents, according to the Finance Ministry's calculations, not 16.6 percent of GDP but only 11.1 percent. So you can argue about the figure, but there is nevertheless a proposed growth in revenue in the 1994 draft budget compared with last year's budget. How will this be achieved? The Finance Ministry cites the following additional sources: revenue from foreign economic activity, the procedure for calculating which will now be changed; an increase in the federal tax on profits; the introduction of a federal income tax on the population (previously all 12 percent of it went into local budgets, whereas 1 percent will now be paid into the federal treasury); and -- the final additional source of revenue -- new kinds of excise duty. They will be enumerated in a special government decree. However, it is not just revenue which generates questions. A serious polemic is also developing over expenditure items. There is very intensive discussion under way on the financing of the military-industrial complex. After two days of discussion defense industry spokesmen failed to find a common language with the Finance Ministry. No final decision has been made on investment expenditure either. The Finance Ministry considers that 53 trillion is the maximum that the budget can bear. The Economy Ministry, however, steadfastly insists that this is not enough to support production. The financing of the mass media is another painful problem. The Finance Ministry has agreed in general terms to provide subsidies; however, they are far more modest than those the mass media were counting on. As is well known, payments for communications services devour the lion's share of these subsidies, and communications charges went up by a factor of 2.5 in January. The communications workers put this leap down to the twofold increase in charges for electricity. It appears that the government is inclined to think that the power workers "have gone too far." At least the Commission for Operational Management, headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, insists that is the case. And now the issue of subsidies to the mass media is linked with the problems of the power workers. So after two days of discussion in government a large question mark still hangs over the revenue and expenditure figures and the size of the budget deficit.
