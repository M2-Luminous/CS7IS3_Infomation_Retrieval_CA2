Lebanese and Syrian security services had contacted the group late Wednesday in a bid to secure their release, they said. The seven were not identified. Witnesses said that three people were beaten and seized from their homes by Hizballah members, while the four others were taken in public places in Ba'labakk and its surroundings. Security services said the seven could have been taken in a Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos. Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in 1986.
