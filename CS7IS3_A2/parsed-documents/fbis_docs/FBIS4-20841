It will help Russian enterprises to survive. On his return from Washington, where he signed an appropriate document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992 whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the deputy minister emphasized. Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S. markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises to improve their position. A special feature of the new agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is sold to consumers. "The next two years will be especially difficult for Russia," Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely convertible currency will come in very handy." Russian Industry To Stop Production [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7). But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost completed. District power plants will be built instead. Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium. However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds, without giving guarantees of money, he said. Pessimistic Outlook for Global Missile Defenses [Article by political scientist Aleksandr Savelyev: "Joint Ballistic Missile Defense: It Is Essential To Shed Illusions"] [Text] More than two years have elapsed since the president of Russia proposed the creation of a global system of protection against ballistic missiles based on international cooperation. It was a question of partnership primarily with the United States in this sphere. In the summer of 1992 the idea came up to acquire new precise forms and was reflected in the documents on the results of the top-level meeting of the leaders of Russia and the United States. The creation of working groups, which were to have formulated recommendations for the implementation of this program, was announced, after which the parties could switch to specific action to strengthen both their own and international security. But the enthusiasm of the supporters of this idea, of those who believed that the main purpose of a GDS [global defense system] should be to combat ballistic missiles directly by way of the creation and deployment of an efficient ABM system, was dampened. As ascertained shortly afterward, neither Russia nor the United States intended going beyond the framework of the Soviet-American treaty limiting ABM systems concluded in 1972 -- the ABM Treaty. And this meant that the sphere of a defense system was from the outset narrowed down to combating only nonstrategic ballistic missiles: After all, the ABM Treaty prohibits the creation, testing, and deployment of ABM systems and componentry intended for combating strategic ballistic missiles, except for those of a fixed-ground basing mode. They may only be deployed in a specified area in a strictly limited quantity. True, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs attempted to portray matters such that the ABM Treaty does not prevent the joint creation and deployment even of strategic antimissile defenses inasmuch as it limits, allegedly, only national, not international, programs in this sphere. But in connection with the Clinton administration's manifest lack of interest in systems of combating strategic ballistic missiles and the shift in American policy toward tactical ABM systems, such statements had no in any way serious effect. And discussions are under way in Geneva within the framework of the meetings of the SCC [Standing Consultative Commission] as to what specifications of tactical antimissile systems could permit a judgment to the effect that they do not conflict with the ABM Treaty. Last year saw the elimination of the SDI program, which by that time had been transformed into a global system of protection against limited strikes and could have been the basis for a GDS, and the organization handling its implementation. The "tactical" part of this program, which was preserved, was transferred to the category of conventional departmental efforts and is now under the control of the U.S. Army. Thus the United States and Russia are as yet concentrating their attention on questions of the ABM Treaty, and the idea of a GDS has gone no further than talk and general discussion, although the sphere of tactical ABM defense remains open for cooperation. Neither the United States nor West European countries and states of the Asia-Pacific region have by any means lost interest here in highly efficient ABM systems capable of combating ballistic missiles, the threat of whose proliferation long since became a reality. But not everything is going that smoothly here either. Thus the United States is making persistent attempts to push onto foreign markets its upgraded PAC-3 Patriot system and also the THAAD [theater high-altitude area defense] tactical ABM system which is being developed. A serious competitive struggle, which is being conducted according to all the rules of the market, has developed here between Russia, which is offering on foreign markets its S-300, and the United States. Specifically, representatives of the United States are attempting to discredit the S-300, voicing doubts as to its effectiveness. Statements are being made, for example, to the effect that inasmuch as the S-300 has not undergone testing according to the standards accepted in the United States, the declared efficiency of this system is dubious. For its part, Russia could put pressure on the THAAD program at the discussion in the Standing Consultative Commission, championing stricter limits on tactical ABM systems. This, incidentally, is what the American side greatly fears inasmuch as, in the opinion of a number of Western experts, the United States' main mission at these discussions is the removal of the THAAD system from the ABM Treaty limitations. At the same time, on the other hand, trends toward a broadening of cooperation in this sphere are intensifying in the West. Thus, according to press reports, NATO could in the very near future approve a plan of the creation and deployment of new tactical ABM defenses, which are to be an integral part of an expanded NATO ABM system. A European ABM would be developed on a joint basis. The West European countries are making no secret of their fears here that the United States will attempt to a greater extent to sell NATO its THAAD system than perform joint work on an equal basis. The United States, on the other hand, reluctant to remain aloof from so important a program, believes that a THAAD system could be merely the basis for the development of European ABM defenses. The start of an entirely new program on a joint basis cannot be ruled out here. As far as Russia is concerned, the United States and NATO are hardly prepared to accept it as a partner in the creation of tactical ABM systems. And it is not only a question of Russia being a potential competitor for these countries on the antimissile technology market and not even of the political instability in our country still forcing the West to treat the prospects of closer rapprochement with Russia, in the military sphere included, with a certain wariness. What is most important, rather, is the fact that all these programs are being implemented and will be implemented within the framework of the competitive military preparations of the United States and NATO. They are closely linked with the existing structure of the armed forces, of which they are to become an organic part. In other words, the tactical ABM systems are being made primarily "for themselves" -- for the fulfillment of definite and specific assignments which are an integral part of more general military plans of the said countries, which, incidentally, are very far removed from the idea of the creation of a "global" defense. From this viewpoint the programs of tactical ABM defenses are not in the least distinguished from other military programs of NATO being implemented both independently and within the framework of the military-industrial integration of the bloc. It would seem unlikely under these conditions that the United States would begin in parallel one further program in this sphere, but in conjunction with Russia this time. Not to mention the additional costs. It is a question here of the priorities of policy in the sphere of military-technical cooperation, which are unequivocally both considerably more to the west and more to the east of Russia's borders. But what will become of the idea of the creation of a GDS put forward at the top level of the leadership of Russia and the United States? No global system of defense of the world community in the direct meaning of this word will be created in the foreseeable future. It could at best be a question only of the creation of some new international structures of the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center type which are united by the common name of GDS and which are no more than a system of the exchange on a permanent basis of the corresponding information connected with the proliferation of ballistic missiles and the world operational situation. But even this program of pseudo-defense has enjoyed practically no development in the past two years. In the face of the growing danger of the ever-increasing proliferation of missile and nuclear weapons the two leading states, which could counterpose to it not only a diplomatic but also a defensive, protective mechanism, are deliberately shunning this. Tactical ABM defenses, even if things get this far, could hardly in the long term be a guarantee of security. In addition, having confirmed the restrictions on the creation, testing, and deployment of strategic ABM systems and attempting to draw a line between strategic and tactical ballistic missiles, in terms of warhead reentry velocity, in particular, Russia and the United States are providing a good reference point for the states endeavoring to possess missile weapons. It will now be perfectly clear what missiles an ABM system could not combat. There is just one conclusion: It is such missiles that need to be acquired.
