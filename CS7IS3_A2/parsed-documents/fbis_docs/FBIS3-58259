Andreatta gave this analysis of the Russian election results: "Inertia, indifference, the fact that so many Russians failed to take part in the first democratic elections in their history could prompt a comparison with Weimar (pre-Nazi Germany -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note). Questions also arise concerning the national character, the legacy of communism, apathy, nostalgia for equality within poverty. Zhirinovskiy's violence and the mourning for the loss of empire, the anti-Semitism, and the spirit of self-pity and revenge are reminiscent of men who hide in cellars, a reminder of Russia's constant oscillation between humiliation and a sense of mission -- the Third Rome, the New Constantinople. All this creates a sense of danger, the impression of the possible collapse of the institutions, of the political mechanism." [Valli] In other words, something in a precarious state of balance, from which we must protect ourselves but that at the same time must not be angered, offended, provoked, to avoid causing or hastening a possible disaster? [Andreatta] On the one hand, there is our objective anxiety about Russia, and, on the other, the realization that the way in which the West manages its security policy could prompt reactions in Russia, could determine events at an unsteady time when the country has an identity problem. [Andreatta ends] Hence the existence of two schools of thought. One, strict and unyielding, that would extend NATO to the countries of Central Europe or even the Baltics, that have become emancipated since the collapse of the Soviet empire, both to protect them and to "contain" possible future Russian impulses. The other is concerned with not prompting the old sense of insecurity that has often been behind these expansionist impulses on Russia's part. [Andreatta continues] Henry Kissinger represents the former school of thought, ruthlessly, albeit lucidly, as always. He says that to leave a security vacuum on Russia's borders means causing history to repeat itself. The other school of thought would help Russia's reformist leaders in the security field, as has been done in the economic field, with a view to facilitating democratic development. [Valli] But the prevailing line is the middle path proposed by the Americans under the name Partnership for Peace. [Andreatta] Yes -- with all the ambiguities concealed beneath the concept of flexibility that lies at the root of the project. It provides no proper guarantees. Indeed, the first school of thought says that they are weak guarantees, similar to those that characterized relations between the Western countries and those of Central and East Europe in the 1930's. The difficulty is how to deal with two problems using the same instrument. On the one hand, it is necessary to reassure Russia and on the other it is necessary to protect the neighboring countries that feel threatened. In both instances anxiety about security could block the democratic process, which -- except in Czechoslovakia's case -- is new everywhere and has no foundation in the past. [Valli] Do you have a solution? [Andreatta] It seems to me that there is a division of tasks. The United States and NATO have the task of creating security conditions, and therefore also of reassuring the Russian federation. The other task perhaps lies with the European Union, and it is to strengthen bonds, ties, connections, relations with the countries of Central and East Europe so that it is clear to even the most impetuous of Russians that beyond their country's historical confines lie European territories. [Valli] Are you referring to the recent Italian-British initiative? [Andreatta] Yes, and it proposes that the European Union extend the second and third pillars of the Maastricht Treaty -- which concern foreign and security policy and internal and judicial policy -- to the countries of Central and East Europe. [Valli] Basically, a gradual association with the European Union with regard to the various fields of policy -- leaving aside the Economic Community, with which it is definitely too early to proceed. [Andreatta] The rationale is to have several instruments for resolving a number of problems. [Valli] So you regard the security architecture proposed by the Americans under the name of Partnership for Peace as fragile or incomplete. [Andreatta] We will say in Brussels that any wrong moves or intimidations on Russia's part would call the philosophy of that plan into question. Indeed, it is a plan that envisages an orderly evolution of life in Russia. Clearly, if imperialist options were to emerge again, this project -- being flexible by nature, and not a treaty of alliance -- would undergo some profound changes. [Andreatta ends] The partnership -- in which Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic should participate -- does not envisage NATO's automatic intervention in the event of an outside threat, as is the case with the 16 members of the Atlantic alliance, but it does envisage the possibility of asking the NATO Council to examine the consequences of the crisis or conflict and perhaps to secure help. It also envisages the possibility of participating in peacekeeping military operations, without integrated commands. This is rather like an apprenticeship with a view to future membership. [Valli] So the plan entails a certain dynamic and leaves matters unresolved. This is why you talk about flexibility and ambiguity. Is it a transitional plan? Until the situation in Moscow becomes clearer? [Andreatta] NATO must not lose its role with respect to its 16 member countries; it must not dilute its task of guaranteeing their security. However, if a normal reform were to become firmly established in Russia; if, of the two tendencies in Russian history, the European one were to prevail; then the possibility of its joining NATO could be reappraised, and NATO itself would have to be reappraised. This cannot be ruled out. For that matter, the Partnership for Peace does not rule out a gradual accession. [Valli] For the present the prospect of Russia's accession to the alliance is regarded as the entry of the wolf into the European sheepfold -- especially in view of the emergence of the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. [Andreatta] That seems to me an image suited to the rationale that Kissinger represents. [Andreatta ends] Another important topic at the Brussels summit is the now recognized possibility for the Europeans to use NATO's technical infrastructures for strictly European operations under European command. That is, operations without American participation. [Valli] At one time the Bush administration opposed it, because it feared that the United States would lose authority over the Old Continent. And some Europeans, and especially the French, did not consider it a positive prospect, because they thought that it would delay the establishment of a European army. What has changed in the meantime? [Andreatta] Some of the tensions between Europe and the United States have been alleviated. While the dispute between the French and Americans over GATT (the updating of which led to a confrontation between Paris and Washington over agricultural products and cultural products including television programs -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) was in progress, Edouard Balladur's government in Paris was resolving other problems with the United States. [Valli] Minor trade conflicts often arise within NATO, sometimes harming relations between the two sides of the Atlantic. Could they in time constitute a threat to the alliance? [Andreatta] It is important that the use of unilateral decisions be abolished in trade policies when minor conflicts of interest arise between the two sides of the Atlantic -- minor compared to those between America and Japan. We must prevent the newspapers from being full of headlines about steel and tomato wars. Those were minor events as long as the imperatives of security were predominant, but the relaxation of tension brought about by the end of the Cold War could make them much more troublesome and damaging, partly because they cause a stiffening on the part of public opinion. [Andreatta ends] Minister Andreatta's early references to George Kennan are significant. He no longer cites that name, and neither did I, but as our conversation approached its conclusion it drifted toward the Mediterranean (to which Andreatta would like to extend the partnership for peace) and I was reminded of Kennan. I tried to remember what he wrote in the winter of 1946 when, rather isolated in the victorious and suspicious Moscow, he pondered what stance to adopt toward that former ally, now an adversary. By proposing to President Truman a strategy of containment, Kennan perhaps believed that Russia's "irresistible" expansionist impulses were due more to defensive reasons, to the fear of isolation, rather than to an impetus to rule the world. Be that as it may, he had to ponder this dilemma and concluded that the right thing to do was both to prevent and at the same time to reassure. There ensued the inevitable Cold War, won by NATO without recourse to guns. In very different terms, it is true, and within a very different international context, Russia now poses a less dramatic, but not so dissimilar, dilemma. One school of thought says that we must wait so as not to cause a provocation, while the other argues that if in the future East Europe absolutely must join NATO to protect itself from a situation that has grown worse in Moscow, it would certainly be more dangerous to do it then than now. That is what Kissinger says. Perhaps he is not mistaken.
