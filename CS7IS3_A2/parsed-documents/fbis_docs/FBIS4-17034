Thirty Georgians, mainly old people, were evicted from Sukhumi on 15 April. Those people who do not obey the separatists' demands to leave their own homes invariably disappear. Confrontation between the so-called pure-blooded Abkhazians and the Abkhazians of Georgian descent, grows day by day. According to the separatists, Georgian Abkhazians must not be trusted. In their opinion they [Georgian Abkhazians] are fickle and if the situation should change, they will side with the Georgians. Therefore, the so-called pure Abkhazians are creating specialized armed formations for liquidating Georgian Abkhazians. These formations do not spare other nationalities either. A clear example of the above-mentioned is the mass carnage of the Greek population in the village of Odishi by the separatists. [passage omitted]
