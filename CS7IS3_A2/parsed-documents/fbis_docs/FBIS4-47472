Shananin, Moscow Institute of Engineering Physics; UDC 621.373.826.038.825.3] [Abstract] The performance of a two-frequency YAG:Nd+++ laser with beat (frequency separation) modulation for communication systems and rangefinders is analyzed theoretically, assuming equal quality factors in both modes and a uniformly broadened amplification band when the gain excess over the the sum of cavity and exit mirror losses remains small. For specificity is considered a laser with the following parameters: half-width of upper level _g_= 3 kHz, unilateral half-width of amplification band &Ggr;= 200 GHz, normalized pumping rate _ee_= 1.0225, absolute frequency deviation D= 1 GHz. The system of equations of kinetics has been solved numerically for the population inversion in each mode, the intensity of each mode, and the beat frequency as explicit functions of time in the case of linear sawtooth frequency modulation of one mode. With the aid of these data is now calculated the form of a compressed pulse and thus also its nonlinearity, whereupon the results are used for the design of a matching filter or correlational signal processor. The resolving power of a rangefinder operating with one such two-frequency laser is found to be theoretically the same as that of a rangefinder operating with two single-frequency lasers. Practically, however, it is much higher owing to the fact that here technical fluctuations are correlated and especially so at a 10[.sup]6[/] GHz/s or higher scanning rate with a pulse signal shortened to an approximately 5 ns duration.
