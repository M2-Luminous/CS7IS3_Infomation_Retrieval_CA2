FBIS4-35659 "drnes106_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 27 May 1994 Libya General People's Committee Condemns Israeli Actions General People's Committee Condemns Israeli Actions LD2705173094 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 27 May 94 LD2705173094 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity made the following statement: The Zionist enemy continues its ongoing aggression against the Arab nation, thus violating its sovereignty and territories, using to this end its arsenal and weapons of destruction that are supplied to it by Western states, at their forefront the U.S. Government. This represents a blatant defiance against all international resolutions. What is more, they intensify this plot whenever they wish to impose more hegemony against Arab regimes and against the will of the masses that reject defeat and submission. The violations and aggression taking place these days against the sovereignty of Lebanon and its Arab people should be used as a means to resist all attempts of submission and the imposition of the fait accompli. This should be faced up to with a responsibility as stipulated by Arab charters, foremost of which the Arab joint defense accord; there should be an end to the aggression and barbaric attacks of the Israelis that target civilians as well as undermining the spirit of the fierce resistance against the Zionist presence and occupation. The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great Jamahiriyah, stemming from the pillars of the revolution of the Great al-Fatih, and in implementation of the resolutions of the Basic People's Congresses that stressed the need to confront the continuing imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the Arab nation, denounces the Israeli terrorism that is represented in the continuing occupation of Arab territories stretching from Southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and the region of Um al-Rafrash. It also denounces the practice of hostilities and kidnap of civilians; yet nobody dares to restrain the Israelis from carrying out such practices. We call for the implementation of Arab charters and accords to face up to this aggression.
