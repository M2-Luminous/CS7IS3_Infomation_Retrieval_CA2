The source who asked not to be named said the clashes had left "probably more than 600 dead," most of them members of the Kurdistan Patriotic Union (KPU) [PUK] of Jalal Talabani. The KPU said however that it had suffered few casualties. Clashes erupted at the beginning of May in various parts of Kurdistan mainly between the KPU and its biggest rival the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud al-Barzani. After a rash of ceasefires, hostilities died down at the end of May except in Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah near the border with Iran where the KPU is fighting a pro-Iranian group, the Kurdistan Islamic League (KIL). The KIL led by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Uthman has allied itself with the KDP. According to sources from all sides, the KPU has lost control of Halabjah after taking the village at the beginning of May. A delegation including members of the INC and leaders of the warring factions is due to visit Halabjah to try to arrange a new ceasefire. The Iranian news agency IRNA said Tuesday that since May about 4,000 people had been killed and hundreds injured in the fighting between Kurds. The KDP and the KPU accused each other of executing prisoners taken during the fighting. The KDP gave the INC a list of 51 names, saying they had been captured by the KPU and killed, INC sources said. Amnesty International said in a recent report that the KPU had submitted 49 names of prisoners it said the KDP had executed.
