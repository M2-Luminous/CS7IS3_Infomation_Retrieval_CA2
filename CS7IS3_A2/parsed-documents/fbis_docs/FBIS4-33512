The president was speaking at a press conference this morning with the participation of over 100 local and foreign reporters and cameramen. "It seems that situation in the oil market would further improve this year," the president replied to a question. On the impact of the recent visit to Iran of a group of American editors on Tehran-Washington relations, the president said: "Such a visit could have no impact on the relations but could shed further light on some of the realities for the American people." As for Iran's view over the policy the British Government has adopted in former Yugoslavia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani told the reporters that there were evidences proving that Britain did not cooperate well to repel the Serbs aggressions. Commenting on [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader] Zhirinovskiy's statement that Russia should dominate its southern neighboring countries including Iran, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers such statements as the viewpoints of an irresponsible individual and attaches no value to such words." In reply to a question on situation in Iraq the president noted: "We had repeatedly condemned Iraqi aggressions in the past and believe that the Ba'th Party has treated the Iraqi people improperly. On the other hand, we believe that Saudi Arabia's measures claimed to be for the salvation of Iraqi people is not proper." On the export of the Islamic revolution, the president said that the issue of the export of revolution has never been raised. "We have said that we would elucidate our ideology and those inhezed [as received] could accept it. We will employ all our potentials for the developmenf our country." As for the future of Tehran-London ties, given the British bugging of the Iranian embassy, the president said that the outcome of Britain's illegal measure is mistrust in bilateral relations and we do not want to see such an atmosphere of mistrust prvail on our reations with other countries. On fluctuations in foreign currency rates, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said measures were underway to adjust supply and demand in order to approach the single parity rate. He predicted that the actual foreign currency rate will appear in the coming months which he said would be lower than the current rates. In reply to a question on the probable amendment of the Constitution to facilitate his re-election at the end of the presidential tenure, the president said he would rather prefer no change in the Constitution. "If I perform my duties properly within these eight years, I think there will be no need for re-electing me," he added. On foreign investment in Iran President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no restriction on the investment of foreign countries within the framework of the Islamic Republic Constitution. As for foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's participation in the Cairo Non-aligned Movement ministerial session, the president said that the visit did not imply a change in Iran's Middle East policy and Velayati's presence in Egypt was only for attending the meeting. On Iran's cooperation with Central Asian republics despite U.S. hindrances, he said the areas of cooperation were so natural and vast that no one could stop it. However, he added, dimensions of cooperation might shrink due to foreign pressures, but, it should be noted that Iran and Central Asian region were complementary to each other and none could deny it. He also noted that Iran was determined to boost its cooperation with Asian countries. Cooperation within the framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) as well as bilateral cooperation with India and Malaysia were expanding, he said. The president added that tripartite cooperation among Iran, Pakistan and India could lead to the formation of a great economic grouping in the region and in order to achieve this objective, the Indo-Pak differences should be settled. On assassination of Iranian dissidents in some European countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the alleged involvement of Iranian officials in the killing of Iranian dissidents abroad is an unfounded allegation, adding that "we think that the killings are the result of inter-group rivalries". He underlined that Iran's policy is not to eliminate the dissidents but to encourage them to embrace Islam and return to their own country. Commenting on the prospect of Iran-Egypt relations, the president said: "We believe that by signing the Camp David Accord, Egypt created a gulf among the anti-Zionist Muslim and Arab countries. Nevertheless we consider Egypt as a great Islamic country and welcome conditions enabling us to resume relations with that country." In response to a question on Tehran-London relations, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no need to cut off relations, the two countries once witnessed the break-off of the relations and found out that it could not change anything. The relations, even though at a low level, should exist, we only react to any inappropriate action on their part, he added. On Iran-U.S. trade relations, the president said that Iran has never broken off its trade relations with the U.S. "As for diplomatic relations with the U.S., we believe that the U.S. lacks goodwill and it has not taken a proper position during the post revolution era. The Americans are for dialogue but we think it will not be in our interest to start negotiations," he said. "If U.S. officials have good intentions, they should first release Iran's frozen assets," the president said. The two countries have a broad trade cooperation, he reiterated, adding "a great deal of our military equipment is made in the U.S. and therefore we cannot throw away such a great national asset." "We showed our goodwill by helping secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon but the Washington government did not keep its promise of releasing our frozen assets. This caused us to lose our trust in them," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. In reply to a question as to reasons for inviting American editors to Iran, the president said that not all writers should be considered agents of the global arrogance. There are freedom-loving people working in foreign mass media who write the truth, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. He added that considering anti-Iranian propaganda in the U.S., the invitation of American journalists was a positive measure. On claims of human rights abuses in Iran raised by the global arrogance, the president said that human rights were routinely violated in the West but "they (Western countries) are making hue and cry over the issue because their propaganda machine is stronger than ours." "I openly declare that human rights are observed in the Islamic Republic better than in any other parts of the world and we are ready to debate with anybody who claims otherwise," he said. Commenting on planned negotiations in tehran between belligerent parties in Tajikistan, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the war was not in the interest of either Tajik government or people. He added that Iran would try to restore peace to that country in cooperation with the parties involved. On Iran's mediation efforts in Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute, he stressed that "although the mediation efforts have not been successful yet, we have not been disappointed." The continuation of conflict will not benefit either Armenia, Azerbaijan or Karabakh, the president said, adding that Iran intended to launch new efforts to establish peace in the region. In response to a question as to whether or not an Israeli pilot was held in Iran, he said for sure no Israeli pilot was in Iran. By raising such allegations, the Zionist regime is trying to cover up the kidnapping of four Iranians in Lebanon, the president said. The Westerners should not view the issue from their own self-interested perspective but should also be sensitive to the abduction of the four Iranians. On the claim of the United Arab Emirates on the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, the president warned "the United Arab Emirates will gain nothing from such claims and they have to cross a sea of blood in order to reach these islands." However, Hashemi-Rafsanjani voiced Iran's readiness to negotiate with UAE officials on the issue. On Iran's stance on the current crisis in Yemen, the president said Iran was against the partition of Yemen, believing that Yemen should remain united. He stressed that Iran was not after nuclear weapons, saying that this has been confirmed by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who regularly visited Iran. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added that "Iran is not for proliferation of nuclear arms but is for the nuclear disarmament of all countries. Every and each country should try to eliminate atomic weapons." On the Middle East peace talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said "what is going on now is not peace because during the negotiations the rights of the Palestinian nation are denied." He reiterated that Iran was not going to interfere in the ongoing negotiations between Arabs and the Zionist regime.
