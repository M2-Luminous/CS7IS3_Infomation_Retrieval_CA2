The Cedro [Information and Education Center To Prevent Drug Abuse] has conducted a poll among 200 peasants from various settlements of San Martin and Huanuco Departments. Only 12 percent of them said they would not replace coca with poppy. Another 28 percent said that they would and the remaining 60 percent were undecided. They said that, depending on the circumstances, they might. Considering that the price of coca is extremely low and that very few people are purchasing coca leaves, these "undecided" peasants could easily begin to plant poppies. A Matter of Survival Our correspondent in Tarapoto talked to Jesus Rivera, leader of the Selva Maestra Agrarian Federation (Fasma). Rivera asserted that a large number of peasants were willing to plant poppy if they had someone to sell it to. "It is a matter of survival. The peasants must survive and to be able to do so they are willing to plant poppy. They have no other option because they have no access to loans that would enable them to replace their coca plantations with subsistance crops or any other authorized crop," he said. Rivera, who participated in the crop replacement program negotiations, said that a large numnber of peasants have threatened to begin sowing poppy seeds next month, unless the government grants them credit or some other sort of assistance, as the regional officials have promised.
