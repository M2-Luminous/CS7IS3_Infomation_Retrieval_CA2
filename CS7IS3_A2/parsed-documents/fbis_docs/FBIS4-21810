It is said that two so far unidentified persons -- a man and a woman -- whom police filmed in Bad Kleinen on 24 June, are two suspected terrorists. Police meanwhile assume that the couple was involved in the assassination of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. The magazine points to an internal paper of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], according to which the man might be the unknown person who was seen during the attack on Rohwedder. A few hours before the operation on 27 June, police filmed another couple with a hidden camera in Bad Kleinen. BKA experts realized only later that these two people were suspected RAF members Daniela Klette and Ernst-Volker Staub.
