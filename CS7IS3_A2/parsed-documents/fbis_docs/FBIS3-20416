When a mayor cheats on taxes, not only are the nation's interests not protected, its very foundation is undermined. On 16 November 1992, Jin Xin [6855 9515], director of the State Administration of Taxation, received an anonymous letter from Xianning City, Hubei Province, reporting that several enterprises and a number of tax revenue bureau individuals in Xianning, acting in collusion with a group of tax cheaters, had defrauded the government of large sums in export tax rebates. Responsible leading cadres in the State Council individually wrote comments and instructions onto the report, demanding that thorough and organized investigation be carried out as soon as possible. One leading cadre expressed his outrage by writing an eight-word phrase: "Under the nation's law, such audacity will not stand!" On the 24th, a joint investigation team organized by the State Administration of Taxation and the provincial tax bureau was quickly sent to Xianning City. After more than three months of investigation, details of the case have gradually become clear. On 10 August 1992, responsible personnel of four enterprises in Hubei Province's Xianning City -- including the Wujin Electric Wire Factory, Wenquan Electric Cable Factory and Shuangqi Township Electrical Machinery Factory -- in collusion with certain Municipal Tax Bureau offices and criminal elements who cheat on taxes, submitted bogus export goods invoices and fake certificates showing taxes had been paid, collecting from the government export tax rebates totalling 9.74 million yuan, from which amount they themselves made illegal gains of 695,000 yuan. In November of the same year, seeing what could be gained by the above maneuver, a Xianning City factory specializing in sewing uniforms negotiated an agreement with the office Xianning City maintains in Shenzhen, and using the pretext of exporting the uniforms through Shenzhen, requested the Xianning Municipal Tax Bureau issue bogus export tax payment certificates with which to claim export tax rebates. Municipal Tax Bureau Chief Yin Chuansheng [1438 0278 0581], knowing full well that the State Administration of Taxation had explicitly forbidden local tax bureaus to issue export tax payment certificates, not only did not turn down the request, but instead submitted it to Mayor Chen Huiyou [7115 1863 0645]. Chen Huiyou, knowing the action to be illegal but wanting the local enterprises to benefit, actually insisted that the tax bureau "support" the request. Chen even used a sleight of hand by back-dating his instructions to the tax bureau to before the regulations were issued by the State Administration of Taxation, and this enabled the criminal elements cheating taxes to cheat the government of 2,248,900 yuan in fraudulent export tax rebates, of which 335,000 yuan of illegal gains went to Xianning's Shenzhen office, the Xianning Tax Bureau and the Uniform Sewing Factory. Case 2: Tax Revenue Bureau Director Personally Intervenes On 27 April 1993, in Jiangxi Province, Ruichang City Municipal Tax Bureau Vice Director Xu Zengchan [1776 1073 3934], accompanied by deputy section chief Zhou Jiangfu [0719 3068 4395] and others, traveling in a tax bureau inspection office vehicle, drove miles and miles to Shenzhen to "conduct business in the field" for the convenience of those elements cheating on taxes. Since there were no export goods or invoices for inspection, Vice Director Xu performed on the spot a series of six procedural steps for the tax cheaters: even the dates, descriptions and values of the goods shown on the tax payment certificates and sales invoices were copied from drafts prepared ahead of time by the tax cheaters. To further ensure against detection, the officials followed the cheaters' request not only to certify the tax payment certificates as the original copies, but also to sign the letter requesting export tax rebate in the name of the Ruichang Municipal Tax Bureau; in addition to further authenticating tax payment certificates and invoices, the action served to witness successful tax cheating by illegal elements. The amounts cheated in the two categories amounted to 1,028,700 million yuan and 2.09 million yuan. According to information from the "Joint Office for Attacking Export Tax Rebate Fraud" organized by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the State Administration of Taxation, a total of 151 enterprises were investigated in 1992 for cheating the government out of as much as 749 million yuan, and 204 million in tax rebates. In January-August 1993, investigations revealed that fraudulent use of fake invoices amounted to a total of 3.5 billion yuan, and frauds involving export tax rebates totalled 100 million yuan. The cases implicated some 150 export enterprises in all 20 provinces, autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities, over 50 factories and manufacturing concerns and over 40 tax revenue bureaus. Cheating on Taxes, Cheating on Whom? The so-called export tax rebate refers to taxes already paid on products before they were exported from the country, and involves the Government Treasury refunding the amounts of product tax, value-added tax and special consumption tax paid back to the exporting enterprises. Because of the increasingly fierce international market competition, and the fact that such taxes increase the cost basis of export products, the Chinese Government has therefore instituted an export tax rebate system, a practice generally in keeping with international customs, which enables China's exports to gain entry in the world market at tax-free prices and which serves the basic objective of enhancing the competitiveness of China's exports. Export tax rebate frauds involve using bogus invoices for export products, including fake tax payment certificates and customs declarations, to obtain rebates from the government. This "malignant tumor" of tax cheating appears to be a twin of the export tax rebate policy; it was born at about the same time, and during the eight years when China had made considerable progress in opening up to the outside world, tax cheating also become increasingly widespread and audacious. Cheating on taxes is in fact cheating on the country. That being the case, people would ask, who benefits from tax cheating? What do these people do with the tax money they have cheated? The Xianning tax cheating case, which created a furor, cheated the government of 11,988,900 yuan in export tax rebates, but the enterprises and tax bureau offices involved in the scheme got only 1,025,000 million yuan for themselves, the rest went to bosses in Hong Kong and illegal criminal elements in the society. The Jiangxi Province Ruichang City tax cheating case resulted in an export tax rebate loss to the government of 3,118,700 yuan, and the parties involved got only 280,700 yuan for themselves. Behind tax cheating cases are massive corruptions involving the offering, seeking and demanding of bribes. Illegal elements in society utilize money to pave their way, and many party and government cadres and officials have fallen under "sugar coated bullets." Wang Tianpeng [3769 1131 7720], vice director of the Gansu Provincial Tax Revenue Bureau, was arrested because he used his position to facilitate tax cheating; he accepted bribes from a certain export company in Gansu, and when caught accepting the tax rebate, he still approved that company's request for tax rebates amounting to more than 810,000 yuan. As for Jiangxi's Ruichang Municipal Tax Bureau Vice Chief Xu Zhengchan and others, when they would sign off on a tax rebate application, criminal element Zhang Chaobin [1728 2600 1755] would call them in turn into a room and pay each 5, or 3, percent of service fees based on the size of his "contribution"; the several persons in the scheme illegally collected a total of 139,00 yuan. In the major "12.17" [17 December] tax cheating case, 13 persons in Xianning City suspected to have received bribes were investigated by the Xianning Prefectural Inspectorate; they were found to have each received over 10,000 yuan. Why Is Tax Cheating So Rampant? The fact that tax cheating crimes have spread quickly and become rampant shows there are causes not only in terms of ideology but also in terms of problems in the system and organization. 1. Tax cheaters use as an excuse that they do it for the local benefit. One important reason to cheat on taxes is to derive benefits for the local area and for local organizations. Since tax revenue collected is allocated among several entities who use the revenue for their purposes, some localities have no qualm about sacrificing the country's benefits to gain a little advantage for themselves; they know they are breaking the law but they do it willingly. Xianning City Mayor Chen Huiyou put it plainly, we did this mainly to earn some money for our city and to develop our local economy. In Henan Province's Zhengyang County, the "four big leading cadre groups," after collective study, unanimously endorsed a move by the county tax bureau to make up bogus certificates for 883,000 yuan, arguing that this amount will be utilized for "local benefits." 2. There is the misunderstanding that "in a market economy, one is entitled to speculate." The road toward establishing a socialist market economy is one on which China must travel. There are however comrades who misinterpret the market economy and actually use the market economy theory as the basis for cheating on taxes. On 17 April, 1993, Jiangxi Province's Ruichang City Mayor Chen Dingrong [7115 1353 2837] sponsored a government coordination meeting keyed to tax cheating. At the meeting he said: "To help factories and tax bureau offices deal with certain procedural tasks...in order to gain some income for Ruichang City, is a good thing. Now, we have a market economy, and we can speculate to make gains." A former Yunnan Province Kaiyuan City Tax Bureau Chief actually and boastfully said: Are we not encouraging people to "jump into business" nowadays? The fact that we issued bogus tax payment certificates is proof that we are "doing business," and in order to serve economic construction, we have to dare to "run the red light." Listen to high-minded rationales, and how good they sound! 3. When the system is not yet perfected, there is room for exploitation. In the early period when the export tax rebate system was first set up, the rebate was based on the export enterprise's budget and inventory projections. Beginning in 1988, to generate enthusiasm in various regions to export to earn foreign exchange, and to reduce the regions' financial burdens, the handling of the entire export tax rebate system was turned over to the Central Government, but this step actually destroyed the unity of responsibility and authority for revenue collection and expenditure between the Central and regional governments, and gave illegal elements an opening to cheat on taxes. When the tax revenue collection system is overly complicated, efficiency of the tax rebate system is low. The product tax and value-added tax constitute the two major tax categories in export tax rebate. Because product taxes are collected at different stages, calculation of the value-added tax is complicated and not uniform, the numbers of tax categories, taxable items and tax rates involved are excessive, plus there are tax preferential policies set up by the localities, all these result in quantitatively low and inefficient turnover between the export product tax collected and the export tax rebated, which provides more opportunities for tax cheating elements to cheat on taxes. The collection of product tax and the rebate of taxes paid are not well coordinated. This can be seen in the inadequate feedback between relevant information concerning export product tax and tax rebate and the information need of export enterprises and enterprises which produce goods for export. Furthermore, between the processes of tax collection and tax rebate, the collection process still has numerous problems such as collecting taxes on export products for which local taxes have been reduced or waived, and on export products which undergo further processing before export; in processing rebate applications, therefore, the tax rebate offices have great difficulty dealing with them in a comprehensive or correct way, to say nothing of arriving at accurate results from the complicated calculations. In addition, in the tax collection cycle there are situations where the turnover tax collection is contracted out, and where such taxes are reduced or waived by persons in charge without the proper authority or who exceed their authority in doing so. Such situations lead to loopholes in management of tax collection and rebate and consequently create opportunities for tax cheating elements to commit fraud. We Should Dare To Ask What the Future Course Will Be Export tax rebate fraud is a dangerous criminal activity with very bad consequences; the fact it is rampant does not mean there is no law to control it, but does indicate that serious attention has not been sufficiently aroused to deal with the problem. Ever since the occurrance of the major "12.17" tax cheating case, government authorities have launched a major anti-tax cheating drive within China's borders. The facts demonstrate that when jolted by the above incident, party members and cadres now have a full understanding of the seriousness of the tax cheating problem, and criminal elements in society have become more restrained, so notable results have been achieved. Therefore, in order to effectively control cheating on taxes, we must carry out a sustained counterattack. It is encouraging to note that the "Office To Attack Export Tax Rebate Frauds," jointly established by the State General Taxation Bureau and Supreme People's Procuratorate, was formally opened for business in Shenzhen on 12 July, 1993. We have reasons to hope that with conscientious enforcement of law and regulations, it will be impossible for tax cheating schemes to succeed.
