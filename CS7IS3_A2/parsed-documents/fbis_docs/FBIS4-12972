Rabah Kebir, the FIS representative in exile, believes that the replacement of Mr. Redha Malek by Mr. Mokdad Sifi -- a relatively unknown technocrat -- is a positive act in the framework of the search for a negotiated solution. Rabah Kebir also claimed that contacts were continuing between Lamine Zeroual, the head of state, and the imprisoned FIS leaders. Is this dialogue not likely to be held at the expense of the traditional parties? That will mean forgetting the large proportion of the people who reject the choice between the Army and the fundamentalists, and who also reject civil war. That is the opinion of Hocine Ait-Ahmed, the chairman of the Socialist Forces Front [FFS], who held a news conference in Paris yesterday. Mr. Ait-Ahmed also believes that France is not condemning the repression in Algeria strongly enough. His words were recorded by Farida Ayari: [Begin Ait-Ahmed recording] I think France has adopted an attitude of the least possible criticism with regard to what is happening in our country, in particular, as far as repression is concerned. We would like it to raise its voice about violations of human rights. Then, since Algeria is the keystone of the Maghreb as a whole, I do not think anyone will fail to see that the only highway the fundamentalists can use to achieve power is to continue down the path of repression, and that if Algeria falls into the hands of armed groups, the whole of the Maghreb will be destabilized, and the security of the Mediterranean as a whole will be threatened.
