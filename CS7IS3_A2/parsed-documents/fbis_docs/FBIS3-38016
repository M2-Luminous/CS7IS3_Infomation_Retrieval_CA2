At the talks, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov and Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Fukuda exchanged wide-ranging views on international issues and the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, and discussed bilateral issues. At the talks they also discussed future steps the two countries should take to conclude a peace treaty, and ways to resolve bilateral issues. Moscow Radio commentator Yuriy Afonin comments on the outcome of the talks: [Begin recording] The talks drew a great deal of attention in both Russia and Japan because they were held to exchange views between the two countries for the first time since President Yeltsin visited Japan. The world is now faced with many important issues. One of the issues is the Russian parliamentary elections that resulted in concerns over Russia's future foreign policy. At the talks, both sides affirmed the validity of an agreement that was signed by the leaders of Russia and Japan when President Yeltsin visited Japan last October. In other words, both sides affirmed a genuine partnership between the two countries. With the Moscow talks, Russia-Japan political dialogue has now entered a new stage and set the future direction of Russia-Japan relations. At the talks both sides agreed in principle that Foreign Minister Hata will visit Russia in March this year to hold talks with his Russian counterpart in accordance with a Tokyo Declaration provision on the revitalization of political dialogue between the two countries. The schedule for Foreign Minister Hata's visit to Russia is to be decided through diplomatic channels. It can be said that preparations have now begun for improving Russia-Japan relations. At the talks, both sides agreed to hold a meeting of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee on Economy, Science and Technology in April, at the earliest. The talks focused on discussion of ways to conclude a peace treaty. The two countries should consistently take steps toward resolving bilateral issues in order to normalize their relations. The two countries also should cooperate closely in deepening mutual understanding between their people, and in creating a good environment in the two countries. The two countries will prepare proposals aimed at reaching agreement on certain issues when Foreign Minister Hata visits Russia. The closeness and similarity of the two countries' positions on international matters and issues in the Asia-Pacific region are of great significance to the future of relations between Russia and Japan. This will serve to expand their cooperation in the United Nations and the international community, just as they cooperated in Cambodia. There are many common positions between Russia and Japan on the issue of the Korean peninsula. The two countries will also attend a conference on ASEAN security in Bangkok in July this year. At the Moscow talks, both sides agreed on a common approach to the issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region. It can be said that the Russia-Japan vice foreign ministerial talks took a concrete step toward strengthening the relations of trust between the two countries. These are my comments on the on-going Russia-Japan dialogue. [end recording]
