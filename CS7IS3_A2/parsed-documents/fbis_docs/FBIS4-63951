In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [25 May], Meshkov said that the road to a compromise lies between the search for mutual understanding through bilateral negotiations and destructive policy pursued by Kiev. Attempts by certain Ukrainian circles to provoke confrontation in the Crimea have failed. The negotiation process has been set in motion in order to bring together the positions of the two sides and find solutions to the existing problems and conflicts, Meshkov said. He noted that Kiev continues its policy aimed at undermining executive power in the Crimea and destabilising the situation in the Republic. Speaking about the decision to set up a working commission of Ukrainian and Crimean deputies to iron out disagreements, Meshkov expressed hope that the reached "elementary understanding" will be preserved. "We have outlined an array of measures which both sides are ready to carry out. This is a step forward towards solving the existing problems," he added. Asked about the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimean leader stressed that it would be "somewhat premature" to make assessments because there have been no official reports about the results of the talks.
