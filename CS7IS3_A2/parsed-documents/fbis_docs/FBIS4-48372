Dieudonne Djonabaye reports: [Begin Djonabaye recording] Nine ministers have left Kassire Coumakoye's new government, the most important of which is General Kamougue Wadal Abdelkader, who held the civil service portfolio and represented the government side in talks with the civil servants who have been on strike for three weeks. He has been replaced in this post by Mr. Salibou Garba, who is also the leader of an opposition party [National Alliance for Democracy and Progress], but who certainly will have his hands tied in the negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact. The other departure is that of Mr. Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh, of the department of planning and cooperation. Mr. Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh's chair goes to Mrs. Mariam Mamadnou, who was secretary of state in the same department in 1990. The make-up of this new government is inauspicious as far as the negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact are concerned. The departure of Kamougue and of Ibni Oumar Mamahat Saleh, regarded by the unions as moderates, will be a heavy blow to the negotiations which have been held up for five days over the thorny question of the application of the decree regulating strikes. This is Dieudonne Djonabaye in Ndjamena for RFI [end recording] It should also be noted that the son of Chad's first president, President Tombalbaye, has entered the cabinet.
