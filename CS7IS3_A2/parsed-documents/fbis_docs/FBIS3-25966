General Principles Article 1. Warehouses of economic and trade departments (including cold storage, the same below) are the warehousing and transportation bases for the circulation of foreign trade commodities and part and parcel of China's capacity to earn foreign exchange through exports. The present methods are specially worked out with a view to urging enterprises engaged in storage under economic and trade departments to strengthen economic accounting, improve warehousing and storage management, continuously offer better services, accelerate commodity circulation, prevent stockpiling and waste, and safeguard the rights and interests of the depositor and the depositary so that warehousing and storage work will better serve the development of foreign trade. Article 2. Enterprises engaged in storage under economic and trade departments shall earnestly implement the principles of "working hard" and "building the country with industry and frugality," practice strict economy, combat waste, perfect the financial system, and strictly observe financial and economic discipline. When conditions exist, all warehouses shall establish an expense collection system to calculate profits and losses and assess business results. They must have budgets and final accounting of revenue and expenditure, do an earnest job of financial planning management and financial analysis, and strive to improve management. Article 3. Warehouses of economic and trade departments with independent accounting, be they managed by warehousing and transportation departments in a unified way or managed by specialized companies independently, shall collect charges in accordance with the provisions of the present methods. (For details of expenses standards, see Annexes I, II, III) Article 4. The expenses collection standards for warehousing and storage activities of economic and trade departments are worked out by adhering to the principle of helping promote commodity circulation and improve enterprise operation and management. Charges shall be collected on inventories. Losses caused by warehouses shall be compensated. All warehouses engaged in storage under economic and trade departments shall establish and improve various rules and regulations with the job responsibility system as the center, strive to improve warehousing and storage management, do a good job of the maintenance of commodities and the safety of warehouses, increase the utilization rate of warehouse capacity and the soundness rate of equipment, and on the basis of the already set cost rates, strive to cut down expenses, reduce storage costs, and increase profitability. Article 5. As the guides for the state, localities are encouraged to flexibly use the warehouse rent standards of economic and trade departments in light of their own actual conditions and make appropriate adjustments with no ceilings set on the downward adjustment and with the upward adjustment not exceeding the expenses collection standards set by local pricing departments for the same items on the same conditions. Chapter II. Expense Computing Units Article 6. Charges are collected on inventories in warehouses by the tonne. Charges for the commodities listed in every warehouse entry or withdrawing form which weigh less than a tonne shall be computed to three decimal places. When charges for such commodities are computed accumulatively at the end of a month, decimals following the tonne shall be rounded to two decimals. Article 7. Computing expenses by the tonne will take the three following forms: 1. The weight metric ton: Charges for a commodity or a lot of commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and whose gross weight is over 1,000 kgs are computed by the weight metric ton (gross weight). 2. The volume tonne: Charges for a commodity or a lot of commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and gross weight is under 1,000 kg by the volume tonne, that is, every two cubic meters amounts to an expenses computing tonne. 3. The area tonne: For commodities which are shipped into warehouses and cannot be piled up because of peculiarities or because they are small and complex in size, or if the owners of the commodities, upon the approval of the warehousing authorities, process, select, repackage, and sort out their commodities, the charges are collected according to the area the commodities actually occupy and the designed load capacity of per square meter of ground (or floor), which are converted into expenses computing metric tons. Charges for hiring a whole warehouse are computed according to the amount of the expenses computing metric tons into which 80 percent of the actual area of the warehouse and the designed load capacity of per square meter of ground (or floor) are converted and also according to the quota storage tonnage of the warehouse. Article 8. As far as the commodities warehouses regularly store are concerned, to collect charges rationally, warehouses shall seriously calculate the gross weight and volume of each commodity and make a package list as the grounds with which to compute and collect charges. When commodities are repackaged, they shall be recalculated. Chapter III. Commodities Classification Article 9. Valuable commodities include computers, refrigerators, television sets, cameras, video cassette recorders, precise instruments and meters, special handicrafts, historical relics, priceless scrolls of calligraphy and painting, rare and expensive crude drugs and ready-made medicines, high-quality tonics, and other valuables. Article 10. Commodities needing careful maintenance include silk cocoons, filature silk, wool pieces, knitting wool, velvet, woolen textiles, silks, and satins and their products (including silk, wool, chemical fibers, rayon, blend yarns, and thread and its products), leather and leather products, fur and fur products, drawnworks, carpets, cigarettes, wines, food, canned food, luxurious perfumes and cosmetics, musical instruments, and other commodities needing careful maintenance. Article 11. With the exception of live fish and fresh meat, cold stored commodities include commodities which need to be stored in freezers and cold wind or air-conditioned storehouses. Chapter IV. Warehouse Charges and Addition Article 12. Warehouses shall collect rents from owners for the use of their storerooms, sheds, and goods yards. Warehouse charges are collected according to the number of tonnes per day. If commodities listed in a warehouse entry form are shipped into warehouses in batches, charges shall be collected from the entry date of the first batch of commodities, and if commodities listed in a warehouse withdrawing form are shipped out in batches, charges shall be settled on the withdrawing date of the last batch of commodities. Article 13. Warehouses of economic and trade departments fall into four categories. They are port-yard revolving warehouse, port warehouse, hinterland transshipment warehouse, and other warehouses. To avoid the hinterland regions from blindly shipping their export commodities to ports or harbors, warehouses of the four categories mentioned above shall have their own expenses collection standards, with the standards of port areas higher than those of hinterland regions (for warehouse charges, see the Table of Warehouse Charges). Article 14. Charges for the commodities that can be stored in the open air, with straw mats above and pads below, are collected at the charge rate of ordinary commodities. Charges for commodities kept in the open air, with pads but no straw mats provided or with straw mats but no pads provided, are collected according to 80 percent of the charge rate of ordinary commodities and those for commodities kept in the open air without any straw mats or pads provided are collected according to 50 percent of the charge rate of ordinary commodities. Article 15. Charges for hiring a warehouse as a whole are computed according to 80 percent of the actual area of the warehouse. Article 16. To accelerate the circulation of commodities kept in the port-yard warehouses and the port warehouses, a rational storage circulating period is stipulated and additional charges shall be collected for commodities kept in excess of the rational storage circulating period. The rational circulating period of the port- yard warehouses is three months. Charges for the commodities kept in such warehouses longer than three months but shorter than six months are collected according to 200 percent of the related expenses standards and those longer than six months are collected according to 300 percent of the related expenses standards. The rational circulating period of the port warehouses is one year. Charges for the commodities kept in such warehouses longer than one year but shorter than two years are collected according to 200 percent of the related expenses standards and those longer than two years are collected according to 300 percent of the related expenses standards. Chapter V. Charges for Use of Manpower and Mechanical Power Article 17. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses or shipping out, regardless of operational links and the use of manpower or mechanical power, are collected by the tonne (gross weight metric ton or volume metric ton) without exception on a quota basis. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses or shipping out are collected each time (attached the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges). Article 18. Warehouses shall collect charges for loading and unloading, at the request of the owner, the commodities which are shipped into the warehouses or shipped out according to the standards listed in the loading and unloading operation section of the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. Loading and unloading charges for the operations done by social loading and unloading teams hired by a warehouse shall be paid by the warehouse for owners first, and then it shall square accounts for the actual expenses with the latter. Article 19. Charges for the commodities kept under normal storage conditions, which owners request to be re-piled or which have exceeded the rational circulating storage period or have to be re-piled to ensure their quality, shall be borne by owners, and they shall be computed according to 100 percent of the related prescribed charges listed in the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. If owners request their commodities to be stored in the other warehouse, warehouse entry and withdrawing charges shall be collected. During the circulating storage period of commodities, if the warehouses re-pile or remove the commodities to other places and storerooms so as to better upkeep the commodities or expand warehouse capacity, whether they use manpower or mechanical power, they shall not collect charges owners. Article 20. Charges for weighing commodities when they are shipped into warehouses or shipped out shall be collected according to the relevant prescribed expenses standards listed the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. If owners request their commodities kept in warehouses to be checked and sorted out and singly weighed, re-piling charges shall be collected from them in addition to standard charges. Chapter VI. Container Charges Article 21. The container operation expenses standards are worked out in line with the principle of helping develop container transportation. For details, see the Table of Container Operation Charges. The various expenses standards prescribed in the table are applicable exclusively to collection of charges from domestic owners by warehousing and transportation departments. As for expenses standards for foreign owners, they shall be set by the China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation through a bilateral agreement with foreign shipowners. Chapter VII. Other Charges Article 22. Charges for warehouse labor and procedural services in such areas as processing, selection, sorting out, packaging, repackaging, patching up of packages in damaged condition, pallet-assemblage, mark chopping, mark brushing, steaming, drying, laboratory testing, and acting on owners' behalf to receive, deliver, transport, submit goods for commercial inspection and testing, and make customs declarations, and for the use of special railway lines and wharfs shall be determined by various warehouses according to the standards set by local pricing departments or relevant departments. If there are no local standards, the charges shall be determined by warehouses and owners through consultations. Chapter VIII. Settlement of Expenses Accounts Article 23. Warehouses shall settle expenses accounts with owners once a month, with the settlement period ranging from the 26th of the previous month to the 25th of a specific month. Article 24. After receiving warehouses' expenses account settlement notices, owners shall promptly check them and complete payment procedures, and pay in full within three days. Warehouses are entitled to collect interests on those who fail to do so within the dateline. Owners have three months to raise objections to excessive or short payments, if any, and undergo additional payment or refunding procedures without interests paid within three months after payments, and objections raised after the dateline shall not be accepted for handling. Chapter IX. Supplementary Provisions Article 25. Charges for the warehousing and storage activities, which are outside the jurisdiction of, but carried out by economic and trade departments and the outside operations they undertake using their mechanical power facilities are computed in according to the expenses methods worked out by local pricing departments or relevant departments. Article 26. The expenses standards for warehouses under supervision and management of the customhouses and bonded warehouses are set in the light of local actual conditions and after consultations with owners. Article 27.

Article 28. Owners' burdens of warehouse charges, their settlement methods, and responsibility for breaking contracts shall be clearly defined in the warehousing and storage maintenance contracts signed by owners and warehouses. When the contracts are signed, the present methods shall be regarded as an important basis for the related sections of the contracts. Article 29. The power of interpretation of the present methods shall be vested in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the State Administration of Commodity Prices. Article 30. The present methods come into force on the date of promulgation.
