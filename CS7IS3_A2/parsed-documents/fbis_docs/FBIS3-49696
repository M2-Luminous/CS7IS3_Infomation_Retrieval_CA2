The operation will not continue any longer, Ruzena Misonova, a member of the working group, told CTK today. Misonova said that the operation, which had been first initiated by the Czechoslovak Government and later continued by the Czech one, enabled 1,812 Volhynian Czechs to move to the Czech Republic, of whom 889 were repatriated in 1991, 505 in 1992, and 418 in 1993. Three hundred applications for repatriation remain to be settled. As no law exists on conditions of repatriation of ethnic Czechs living abroad, these and other possible applicants will be treated in the same way as any foreigners who ask for permission to stay permanently in the Czech Republic and for Czech citizenship, Misonova explained. The Association of Volhynian Czechs and Their Friends insists that at least one official from the Interior Ministry should be charged to settle the problems of Czechs from Volhynia. Vaclav Landa, the association's representative in charge of the repatriation, told CTK that the association was likely to ask the Economics Ministry to solve the present situation. Volhynia is a historical region situated in Ukraine where many Czechs moved in the course of the 19th century, creating a significant, economically, and culturally active ethnic minority. Their total before World War Two was about 40,000. In 1946-47, a large number of Volhynian Czechs were repatriated under an inter-governmental agreement.
