Today we have the opportunity to assess France's external audiovisual action and the activities of Sofirad [Broadcasting Holding Company] with its new president Jean-Louis Dutaret, who was appointed in January. The issue of France's foreign audiovisual policy is a complicated one even if it is not a new one for you, since you were an international lawyer before becoming adviser to Communications Minister Alain Carignon. Sofirad is a holding company managing the government's shares in some 20 companies, among them radio and television stations. To name a few, for instance: Canal France International [CFI], a program data bank broadcast throughout the world by satellite; TV-5 Europe, a French-language television channel; Canal Horizons, a network of pay TV channels; Afrique No. 1; Radio Monte Carlo Middle East; and Radio Monte Carlo for radios [as heard]. [passage omitted] We will now turn our attention toward external audiovisual policy. As we said earlier, you are managing the state's interests in several television channels, and you are talking of CFI as the spearhead. Will the strengthening of CFI run against the interests of others such as the French-language channel TV-5? [Dutaret] I can only express my personal feeling. I am not here to represent the government. [Brucy] However, you are representing Sofirad. You are the president of Sofirad. [Dutaret] Sofirad is an extraordinary tool not known to the public. Thanks to Sofirad there is worldwide coverage -- I will answer your question concerning CFI very soon -- I would like to recall that 33 million people throughout the world listen to three Sofirad radio stations, 33 million -- as against 11 million for RFI [Radio France International]. I will not compare costs since I do not want to be nasty. However, it must be said, we hear a great deal about RFI and we never hear anything about Sofirad, with 33 million listeners. Thanks to Sofirad France is behind the BBC and the Voice of America and ahead of the Voice of Germany [as heard]. This must be said. CFI is a great tool enabling all African national television channels to exist. If CFI did not offer programs -- I say offer -- to most African television channels and to many other television channels, these countries would not have television channels worthy of the name, and if there are television channels worthy of the name it is thanks to French products which are distributed by CFI. TV-5 too... [Brucy, interrupting] It is very similar. [Dutaret] Not at all. TV-5 is a French-language channel with 60 percent French programs, but with Canadian, Belgian, and Swiss programs too. It is a genuine French-language channel. I believe France must have what is called in our jargon sovereign action. It is normal for France to broadcast the image of France. This image of France is best broadcast through CFI. [Mihail] The image or the voice of France? Or, even possibly, the voice of the French Government? [Dutaret] No, but why not the voice of France? We are the only ones to be ashamed of that. There is the Voice of America, the Voice of Germany [as heard]. Why can't we speak of the Voice of France? We are neither living in a Cold War situation nor in a colonial situation. There is no shame in wanting to broadcast the voice and the image of France. [Brucy] Speaking of voice, you mentioned RFI earlier. It must be said that this station does not belong to the Sofirad network. Do you believe that there is a situation of wasteful competition and that RFI and the radio activities of Sofirad should be better coordinated? [Dutaret] Yes, yes. The mission of Sofirad is not to broadcast worldwide. It mainly broadcasts to Maghreb countries, to West Africa, and to the Middle East in local languages. [Mihail] Precisely, what is the best choice? To target the whole world to reach, for instance, farmers in Malaysia or shepherds in Afghanistan who might not even possess a radio set, or to concentrate on mainly French-speaking zones such as Africa, the Maghreb, or Latin America? [Dutaret] The mission of Sofirad is to expand and to target traditional zones of French influence. I never believed that a Thai farmer would suddenly tune in to RFI at 1500 to listen to a program in Thai while he can receive 50 Thai stations. [Brucy] So what should be done? [Dutaret] RFI should broadcast in French. People listen to RFI to hear French. [Brucy] Therefore no more RFI programs in foreign languages? [Dutaret] If you want, but mostly in French. Listeners tune in to hear French. [Mihail] How should this issue be coordinated? Do you see a role for France Television, together with Sofirad, to play an additional role so as to rationalize the activities of all existing bodies on this issue? There are six ministries concerned. [Dutaret] France Television is already playing a role in Sofirad since one of its main announcers has been a member of the Sofirad board since last Monday. [Brucy] He is Jean-Marie Cavada, he should be named. [Dutaret] Therefore France Television is represented on the board. I do not believe anything more is necessary. If you consider the case of CFI, it must sell French programs, all of them, programs from public and private channels. One channel cannot be given preferential treatment. [Mihail] A last question: don't you think it rather unhealthy to be both president of Sofirad and at the same time personal adviser to Communications Minister Carignon? Don't you believe that this represents the voice of France too? [Dutaret] Do I look unhealthy? No, I am simply Alain Carignon's friendly adviser. This enables me to be very busy, to get up very early, as early as you do yourself, Roland. [Brucy] Jean-Louis Dutaret, thank you.
