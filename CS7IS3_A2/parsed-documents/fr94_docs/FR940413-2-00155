FR940413-2-00155 FR940413-2-00070 The Commission believes that it is not necessary to extend the proposal to include contributions to candidates for federal office. The proposal addresses abusive political contributions to officials of issuers who may influence the selection of municipal securities underwriters. Because federal office holders do not influence the underwriter selection process, the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate to include federal candidates under the rule's requirements. By the same token, the Commission also believes that any resulting hardship to candidates for federal office who are currently local officials is not a reason for eliminating these requirements. The MSRB cannot overlook potential conflicts of interest solely because there are candidates for the same federal office who do not face the same conflicts. In any event, the resulting burden to current local officials does not appear to be significant. Generally, municipal underwriters play a less significant role as contributors in federal elections. Moreover, under federal law there exist general contribution restrictions that limit the amount of contributions that other candidates are able to obtain from municipal securities dealers and municipal finance professionals. 77 77 See supra note 68. F. Municipal Securities Dealer Affiliates Several commentators believe that the proposal should apply to contributions from all employees affiliated with the underwriter and from affiliated financial institutions and their employees. 78 Several commentators specifically express concern that the proposal excludes contributions by chief executive officers of banks, 79 or by PACs controlled by banks or bank holding companies, which have a municipal securities dealer department or subsidiary. 80 These commentators believe that by exempting affiliated banks and bank holding companies, the proposal provides a ``loophole'' for continued abuse of political contributions by municipal securities dealers and their affiliates. 81 78 One commentator, for example, believes that the ``rule is ineffective because it does not cover all related personnel who can continue to contribute to officials of issuers thereby creating the actual or apparent conflict of interest which the MSRB rule seeks to prevent.'' Letter from Raymond J. McClendon, Vice-Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co., Inc., to Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary, Commission (March 9, 1994). 79 Once commentator, for example, states that ``[w]e strenuously object to a narrowly-based requirement that diminishes the ability of our Chief Executive and members of our executive committees to participate as community leaders, to engage in political dialogue and to develop our firm's profile in the communities in which we do business to the same extent as local bank chief executives.'' Letter from William H. Ellis, President and Chief Operating Officer, Piper Jaffray Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). 80 One commentator, for example, states that ``[c]ommercial banks would be free to continue making PAC contributions to local and state level political candidates and in the process gain a significant competitive advantage in the selection process for public finance undertakings. Those candidates receiving bank PAC contributions would certainly remember such support when bank dealer personnel are introduced or accompanied by commercial bankers in the selection process. It is a typical procedure for the local bank officer to lobby and/or speak in behalf of the hiring of his public finance entity.'' Letter from Clifford A. Lanier, Jr., The Frazer Lanier Company, to David C. Clapp, Chairman, MSRB (March 1, 1994). Another commentator states that ``[i]t is unreasonable to believe that political candidates, including `issuer officials,' will be able or need to, discern between contributions from a bank-controlled PAC and a bank's municipal securities `dealer-controlled' PAC. This appears to us to represent `business as usual' for bank-controlled municipal dealers while we are both stigmatized and potentially disadvantaged competitively.'' Letter from William H. Ellis, President and Chief Operating Officer, Piper Jaffray, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). 81 ``Unfortunately, the proposed rule as written is so severely deficient in ignoring the sophisticated realities of political fundraising undertaken by securities firms, that the loopholes and fine distinctions posed promise to provide a road map for more sinister activities, possibly making the situation worse.'' Letter from Mark D. Schwartz, to Arthur Levitt, Chairman, Commission (January 31, 1994). Several commentators question the ability of the MSRB or the NASD to enforce Rule G&hyph;37. For example, one commentator believes that ``[p]olitical favors will to those investment banks that flaunt or circumvent the rule while those firms who live by the rules will suffer accordingly.'' Letter from Carolie R. Smith, President, Smith Mitchell Investment Group, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 9, 1994).
