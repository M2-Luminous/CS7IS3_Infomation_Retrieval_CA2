This task was assigned to the Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate. The audit, which was carried out in a number of districts and at central supply and purchasing bases and industrial enterprises in the military trading system, exposed a number of blatant violations of existing legislation on entrepreneurial activity, of financial and executive discipline, and of regulations governing the conduct of trade. The wide-ranging economic rights granted in recent years to military trade organs in the center and provinces have not been properly exercised to improve the quality of trade and consumer services to servicemen and their families. The necessary radical measures to reform the military trading system have simply not been taken. Despite the fact that, following the Union's disintegration, the number of enterprises has sharply decreased and the number of personnel in the military trading system has been halved, an unjustifiably cumbersome and ramified structure for administering it has been preserved to this day. With the organization of direct ties between military trade enterprises and suppliers, many supply and purchasing bases have been left with practically no work. But the chronic shortage of circulating capital and the poor stocking of stores with essential goods have not prompted the Ministry of Defense Main Trade Directorate to cut superfluous levels or identify ways to economize. On the contrary, administration organs' establishments are inordinately inflated, while their staffers -- officers and civilian personnel -- have received premiums exceeding their basic pay in addition to their wages. It has become the practice to hold back at bases the most popular goods in order to sell them for less than their market value in inflationary conditions through the trade network to a narrow circle of people, which has caused indignation and complaints among servicemen. Considerable sums of money have been diverted into nontrading activities. A total of around 20 billion rubles was deposited in bank savings accounts, which adversely affected the procurement of industrial and food goods for sale in stores. In all military districts and fleets instances of giving consumers short measure and overcharging them, concealing scarce goods, and deliberate inflation of prices have been discovered. Overcharging occurred in one-half of the control purchases made. These outrages were most prevalent in the Pacific Fleet, the Siberian Military District, and the Western Group of Forces. Work to bring down the cost of food is not being conducted actively enough. Even when, under the defense minister's directive No. D-34, military units and institutions are providing the military trading system with transport, premises, and free electricity, fuel, water, and other utilities, the cost of food in military trade cafeterias remains very high, and in a number of cases higher than in the open public catering network. For example, in Volgograd Garrison (North Caucasus Military District) prices in military trade cafeterias were 1.2-1.6 times higher than prices in the city's cafeterias. It is no accident that lately the number of officers and staffers using military trade cafeterias has decreased by between one-third and one-half. The Russian defense minister has issued an order based on the results of the audit of the military trading system's financial and economic work. It notes the aforementioned and other serious shortcomings, punishes the culprits, and outlines radical organizational and economic measures to improve the military trading system's activity forthwith. This question will be discussed in the near future at a Defense Ministry Collegium session.
