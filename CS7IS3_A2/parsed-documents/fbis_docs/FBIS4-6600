Bigornia: "Two Ways of Looking at Military Rebellion"] [Text] Whom to believe: President Ramos or Gringo [Gregorio] Honasan on the rebellious mood of the military? The poser came up when the president praised former Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia for supposedly having unified the military, in effect making the RAM or Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] of Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan irrelevant. The commendation was given by Mr. Ramos when Abadia turned over the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] command to his successor, Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, former Philippine Army commander, at rites in Camp Aguinaldo last Tuesday. The president said the AFP "has already put behind it the ravages of dissent and adventurism... The armed forces managed (during the three-year stint of Abadia as chief of staff) a remarkable turnaround and now we see a more united and professional corps of officers, enlisted personnel and civilian employees." The day following, last Wednesday, Gringo belied the president's claims. The leader of the two failed military coups during the preceding administration dismissed the presidential claim as a hollow praise given willy-nilly during traditional retirement parades. The conflicting views deserve some consideration. The government is holding simultaneous but separate peace negotiations, although currently stalled, with the military rebels and two other insurgent groups, the Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army, and the secessionist Moro National Liberation Front. The problem posed by the mutinous military must have been serious when the group was included in the peace process initiated by Mr. Ramos immediately after his taking office almost two years ago. However, things must have happened, either within the rebellious military or in the entire military establishment itself between then and now to justify the president's claim of unity in the Armed Forces. General Abadia had several informal talks with the mutinous military leaders, separate from the talks between them and a government panel. On the other hand, General Abadia, only last February, accused the rebel leadership of allegedly using the liberty they enjoy during the negotiations to muster support in various military camps for their movement. Gringo naturally denied this, claiming it was but natural for them to go around the military camps to talk shop with comrades-in-arms, specially old friends, after their long stay in the underground. But Gringo did not deny that his group was still active. In fact, he reportedly claimed that they still had in their possession considerable arms and ammunition, presumably enough to mount another coup attempt. At a recent social gathering, Gringo told this writer that the rebellious temper of the troops was spreading down to the enlisted men's level at a faster pace than imagined. "You'd be surprised how deep down the movement has gone," he said. What was more astounding, he added with evident pride and satisfaction, was the growing support his group was getting from the civilian population. This, to us, was ominous. For at the same gathering, other rebel leaders admitted, although not as a strategic mistake, that in the two real coup attempts against the Aquino administration, they did not make any effort to gain popular support before they staged their failed putsches. If they staged a coup, would they have the support this time of the civilian population, which was the crucial element of the successful EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolt in 1986? Their current activities do not seem geared towards generating active popular support -- or they could again be committing a miscalculation. They have lately been attending press conferences, television talk shows and other information fora so often, their motives have elicited what might be wrong impressions. Already, Gringo is suspected of wanting to be a senator, a position he could easily win. Asked if his group was fielding candidates in next year's elections, he said, "If the playing fields are level, we will consider it." By this he might be entertaining ideas of shifting from a military to the parliamentary struggle to gain the reforms his group is fighting for. How effective that could be is open to question. But he might be forgetting that his being seen, read and heard too often in person, in newspapers and on television could erode the glamour that surrounds his persona as well as the mystique his group has acquired not only by their failed adventures but also by their unknown, mysterious movements for many years. Honasan, of course, is masculinely handsome and charismatic. But he is playing against the adage that no man is a hero to his valet, or the more popular saying that familiarity breeds contempt. At any rate, by next year, according to law, the Philippine National Police (PNP) will take over from the Armed Forces the mission of solving the insurgency problem. With the anti-insurgency campaign taken away from it, the AFP would be nothing more than a reserve and training command, not an ideal source of mutiny. It is unlikely that Gringo's group has or can make inroads into the PNP. For the most part, the mutinous officers are army, air force and navy officers, and their former comrades in the AFP who have joined the PNP are getting fat in the belly and therefore not keen on reform. Mr. Ramos may have solved the RAM problem, but without the reforms in the military and civilian establishments that the rebels demand, the national recovery he hopes to achieve will be slow in coming.
