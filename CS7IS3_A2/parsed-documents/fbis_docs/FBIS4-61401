The Russian Press Committee Is Fully Aware of This"] [Excerpt] It has been decided to allocate an additional 64 billion rubles in subsidies to the Russian press before the end of 1994. This was announced at a press conference in the Russian Press Committee. Asked where this money will go, Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said that this will be decided by a subsidy distribution commission that will include journalists, politicians, and government officials. A priority right "to survive" will be given to publications which, by the committee's recognition, have "a worldwide reputation." It was stated unequivocally that the issue today is precisely survival. The press is in such a condition that it needs a trillion rubles only in subsidies! Such funds, it was said, are unavailable. Yet the Press Committee does not see the fact that newspapers are dying as anything tragic: After all, factories and mines are also dying! The only thing that really bothers it is the authorities' cynical attitude to books and the press. They, in Mr. Gryzunov's expression, have been put next to vodka and tobacco. [passage omitted]
