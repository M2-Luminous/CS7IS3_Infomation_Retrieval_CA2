At the beginning of the meeting Istvan Pasztor, Komarno mayor and chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO), which convened the meeting, assured the audience that the event was not directed against the territorial sovereignty of Slovakia. "As citizens we want to help the functioning of the republic," said Pasztor, the main organizer of the meeting. Further speeches sharply criticized the methods used by Slovak authorities towards the ethnic Hungarian minority and the local government. Sandor Rozsa, mayor of Kajal, south Slovakia, called the rights of the local government in Slovakia insufficient. The relevant articles of the Slovak Constitution are too general, making it possible to pass "harmful decisions" contradicting the European Charter of Local Government which, in fact, had not been accepted by Slovakia, Rozsa said. Stefan Pasztor, mayor of Kralovsky Chlmec, east Slovakia, recapitulated the history of the administrative set-up of the country since 1918 and suggested that the set-up had always disadvantaged the minority. Istvan Zacharias, mayor of Moldava nad Bodvou, east Slovakia, rejected the government concept of the new administrative set-up of Slovakia and called for extended power for the local and regional governments. According to Alzbeta Poganyova, a spokeswoman for Egyutteles, an ethnic Hungarian party, more than 3,000 persons are attending the meeting, out of an expected 5,000 deputies, mayors, and representatives of local government. 400 journalists are present, she reported. Representatives of the Presidential Office and the Government Office as well as diplomats from ten embassies were also there, she added. Miklos Duray, chairman of Egyutteles which has, along with the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, 14 deputies in the 150- member Slovak Parliament, rules out the possibility that ethnic tension in south Slovakia could develop into a Yugoslav-type conflict. "This does not threaten at all," Duray told CTK today. "In Slovakia, no different cultures are opposing one another," he said. "In Slovakia, it is more a case of political conflict and, basically, an incomplete political structure," he added. Duray believes, however, that the Hungarians are discriminated against in Slovakia: For example the law on names stipulates that a change of a Slovak name into Hungarian requires a complicated procedure, while the change of a Hungarian name to the Slovak requires a fee of 40 Slovak crowns ($1.2). According to Duray, peaceful coexistence between Slovaks and Hungarians in south Slovakia does not require the direct territorial autonomy of the minority, but a self-rule system which would take the ethnic character of the population into account. "The Hungarians live in Slovakia in a continuous territory," he said. Duray stated that while no ethnically homogeneous regions exist in Slovakia, Hungarians constitute a 70-percent majority in the south Slovak region. The Komarno meeting should formulate a demand that the new Slovak administrative set-up be suitable for the Hungarian minority. This would then be discussed further, Duray said. Duray does not reckon with the election of a 100-member body of Hungarian representatives at the meeting, as there is no legal substance for this. The conclusions of the Komarno meeting should be pushed through in the parliament, in the political talks as well as through foreign activities, including at the Council of Europe and the European Union, Duray said. According to Duray, the timing of the meeting before the upcoming meeting of the Visegrad Four with U.S. President Bill Clinton is "pure coincidence," and there is no connection between the two events. He considers, nevertheless, the solution to the issue of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Slovakia to be a precondition for Visegrad cooperation.
