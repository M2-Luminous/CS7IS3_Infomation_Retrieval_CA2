All those who thought that this was more than just coincidence were wrong, because despite the fact that UDMR did send a message encouraging the Komarno conference, UDMR still considers, according to its executive chairman, Csaba Takacs, that it has to follow its own way, that the steps taken by the Hungarian minorities living in other regions are not identical to those taken here, and that neither the success nor the failure of the Komarno conference can influence in any way the policy adopted by UDMR. Right now UDMR believes that the most pressing issue to be dealt with is the Hungarian minority [of Romania] economic situation. As a matter of fact, one of the angles of that issue was also debated during the Miercurea Ciuc meeting. According to Bela Zsolt Gyorgy, deputy chairman of UDMR, that angle refers to the implementation of Bill No.32 of 1991 passed by the parliament in Budapest, that also concerning -- as strange as some might find this -- a number of 36,000 Romanian citizens. The aforementioned bill stipulates that the Hungarian state should pay damages (in the form of compensation notes) to its former citizens, who during World War II were captured by the Soviets. The maximum amount to be paid is 11,000 forints (about $120) for each month spent by each person after 1 August 1945 in Soviet prisoner camps. The lawmakers decided to distinguish among persons who are currently Hungarian citizens and those who today are citizens of other states. The latter may sell their compensation notes on the free market or on the stock exchange market; they may buy goods in certain shops; they may invest them or turn them into stocks of various companies. However, all this may be done solely in Hungary. The Miercurea Ciuc meeting was intended to inform the participants in detail about the stipulations of the aforementioned bill and to minimize the risks that could occur while using the said compensation notes. Considering that about 20 percent of the persons eligible to receive such damages are ethnic Romanians (about 8-10,000 persons), UDMR intends to translate into Romanian the booklet that it will publish containing information on the bill. Deputy chairman Gyorgy also told us that the deadline for registering as a former prisoner of war has already expired, but between 15 February and 15 March of this year people can still hand in the necessary documentation to be included among those who are eligible to receive compensation. In Transylvania certain people are still speculating about the possible political, propaganda, or other kind of purposes of that bill. And it is quite likely that some of their suspicions might turn out to be true. However, until then there is nothing we can do except highlight (and he who has ears will hear) UDMR's sustained efforts to continuously keep its entire electorate.
