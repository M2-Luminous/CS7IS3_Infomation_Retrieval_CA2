In the course of this visit, the first by a Vietnamese president to Tehran, bilateral relations, regional and international issues are to be discussed. Vietnam is one of the southeastern countries and it has a population of 70 million and rich, abundant resources. This country has endured two major crises; that is, a war with the United States and its 19-year-long embargo, as well as intense differences with the PRC on Cambodia. Hanoi has now entered a new phase of reconstruction since the Cold War has ended and the nature of its international relations has metamorphosed from military to economic one. Vietnam's basic strategy is to strengthen its reconstruction process by favoring regional cooperation. That is why the Hanoi government's declared program is to base its foreign policy on broadening and expanding international relations. Regional and neighboring countries are given special preference in this regard. The Islamic Republic of Iran has certain similar characteristics, as Iran inherited a prolonged period of backwardness, which is a remnant of the previous regime. The Iranian nation also initiated extensive struggles against U.S. intervention in Iran's internal affairs and continues to do so. Similarly, Iran fought an eight-year-long war with an aggressor, Iraq, which resulted in immense loss of life and property for Iran. Now that Iran has put these crises behind it, effective steps have been taken for the country's reconstruction and the basic strategy is to carry out this reconstruction successfully with the assistance and cooperation of friendly countries. Thus, tasting the bitterness of foreign intervention, enduring an unjust war, being in the orbit of the developing countries of the south, embarking on basic reconstruction, and favoring regional closeness, are the common denominators which motivate these two countries to adopt a joint strategy. Most important of all, Iran and Vietnam are at that juncture of their development when their cooperation can address most of their respective needs. Vietnam has a developing economy and in the opinion of political and economic analysts, this country needs a foreign investment of $12 to $15 billion to boost its economic and industrial structure in order to reach an eight-percent level of growth by the year 2000. Iran can have effective cooperation with Vietnam in the field of investment, and in particular, in gas and oil. In addition, in view of its proximity to the Central Asian countries, Iran can play an important role in the transit of Vietnamese products to those republics. Reciprocally, Vietnam can prove of benefit to Iran by the transfer of its technological experience in various fields, especially in agriculture and industry. However, it appears that despite the actual and potential capability of the two countries and the broadening of their political relations, the volume of their exchanges is not very satisfactory. Therefore, Iran and Vietnam should expand their joint economic commissions and sign trade accords especially on a quid pro quo basis, and thus take effective steps to improve their relations.
