As reporters covering his visits, we keenly realized the importance of and had to deal with the tight schedule of the visits. A special plane took us to various countries, and meetings, talks, delivering speeches, and signing agreements comprised a major part of Premier Li's daily life during the visits. Let us examine the agenda of one day of the visit -- from this agenda we can see how busy Premier Li was during the trip.

After that, Premier Li held talks for three hours with Kazakh President Nazarbayev, signed the historic Sino- Kazakh Border Agreement, and granted an interview to reporters. In the afternoon, Premier Li met with figures of Kazakhstan's enterprise circles, during which he set forth six principles for developing economic and trade cooperation between China and Central Asian nations. Following that, Premier Li called on Chinese embassy personnel in Almaty. In the evening, Premier Li attended a welcoming banquet hosted by President Nazarbayev and delivered a speech at the banquet.

More than 20 meetings and talks during the trip have enhanced mutual understanding between China and the countries we visited and deepened the friendship between us, and two important speeches delivered during the tour have clearly set forth the principle for developing political and economic relations between China and Central Asian nations. The signing of several important agreements has laid a solid foundation for developing relations between China and the four Central Asian countries and Mongolia.

[video shows Li Peng in plane, singing through a loudspeaker as other passengers clap hands] Dear viewers, Premier Li Peng's visits have ended and his special plane is on the way home. But, the principle for developing relations between China and Central Asian nations is clearly set forth and our policy on developing economic and trade relations with these countries has won popular support. We hope that the flower of economic and trade relations will blossom perpetually and the tree of friendship will remain green forever.
