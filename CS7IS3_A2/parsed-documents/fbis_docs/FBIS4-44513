But in everyday life, this is not understood in dialectical terms, and incorrect attitudes toward the issue still prevail. Some people think that a strong emphasis on independence and self-reliance would amount to weakening or even rejecting the opening up policy, so in implementing the policy they often forget or refrain from talking about independence and self-reliance; this one-sided thinking has undoubtedly caused harm to our country's opening up policy and socialist modernization and development. Independence and self-reliance are totally different from isolating ourselves and rejecting things foreign. During the revolutionary period as well as the era of construction, comrade Mao Zedong made clear that in striving for independence and self-reliance, we also needed foreign assistance. He always advocated broadening our horizon and, on the basis of the principles of independence and self-reliance, proceeding to develop peaceful and friendly relations and exchanges in political, economic, cultural and other fields with all countries, while keeping up a relentless struggle to break up any attempts by the West to isolate or boycott China. Even during the "Great Cultural Revolution," he proposed that we analyze the world from three perspectives, namely to break the deadlocks in the Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese relations and to regain China's seat in the United Nations. Of course, constrained by historical conditions, comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on opening up to the outside did not develop to the extent as it has today, but he paved the way for the opening up policy. The Third Plenum of the 11th CPC National Congress established the basic line of "one center and two basic points." Opening up to the outside has become a basic national policy to be firmly supported over the long term and it represents an important step toward establishing socialism with special Chinese characteristics. In over a decade, achievements of this policy are clearly notable and have contributed greatly toward China's modernization and development. Implementation has demonstrated that the policy is entirely correct. The opening up policy is a prerequisite condition of independence and self-reliance; they complement and mutually reinforce each other. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "Independence and self-reliance represent our basic points of reference, whether in terms of the past, the present or the future." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III, page 3). "In developing a country as large as China, we cannot help but rely on ourselves, and primarily on ourselves, and that is the essence of self-reliance" (Ibid., Volume III, page 78). The opening up policy is necessary and important because it helps develop socialism, strengthen our country as a whole and raise the people's standard of living; as a result, it helps Chinese people maintain their independence and self-reliance and speed up our socialist modernization and development. Independence and self-reliance provide indispensable objective condition and support for the opening up policy; the policy, in turn, is based on the unshakable foundation of independence and self-reliance. Any viewpoint or action which splits these two internally related and unified concepts is wrong and harmful. The relationship of these two concepts is unitary and has a primary and a secondary objectives. The primary objective is to firmly maintain our independence and self-reliance; the secondary but complementary objective is to actively seek foreign assistance. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC National Congress, comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed this [two-fold] objective; he said: "In the end, the objective of our construction is the same as Mao Zedong had formulated in the past, namely with its primary focus on self-reliance and its complementary focus on striving to obtain foreign assistance." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: 1975-1982, page 310) The "primary" and "supporting" elements in the relationship cannot be equal, and certainly cannot be reversed. For example, attracting foreign investment is undoubtedly very much needed, since to a certain degree foreign capital can supplement inadequate Chinese capital for construction, but we absolutely cannot depend entirely on foreign investment or put all our hope on foreign capital; we cannot disregard the consequences of relying on foreign capital and pay the price which hurts China's interest, damages our national policy and debases the morality of our society. Otherwise, it would not be our making use of foreign capital, but the latter making use of us. In the whole process of socialist modernization and development, regardless how far we open up to the outside, the role that foreign assistance plays will proportionately be relatively limited; it can only "play a support role in developing production under socialism" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III, page 181); furthermore, any type of foreign assistance must conform to China's reality and it can only be used effectively in conjunction with efforts by the Chinese people themselves; besides, it is certainly not easy to obtain capital and advanced science and technology from countries of the West. Therefore, only when we set our objective based on our own strength, then seek foreign assistance on the basis of self-reliance and mainly our own conscientious struggle, will we ultimately stand on victorious ground. The thrust of opening up to the outside must be to serve the interests of economic construction. The various aspects of the opening up policy should be based on the realistic need and feasibility of China's modernization and development. We need to attract advanced technology and facilities from abroad, but to do so only after deliberating carefully and avoiding duplicated imports wasteful of China's capital; we need to set up development zones but we must also seek truth from facts and consider the reality of the zones, China's ability to absorb the imports, and the various factors involved in calculating the value of setting up such zones; we must not in a burst of enthusiasm rush into doing things, nor proceed on the basis of narrow interests of certain zones without considering how they relate to or support each other. We need to learn from foreign countries, but we must do so analytically, critically and selectively; we must learn the strong points of other countries, the good things which are truly advanced, and not things which are backward and passe. Our country is a socialist state, and our modernization and development is socialist modernization and development; in our opening up policy, we absolutely cannot bring in corrupt ideas and lifestyle of the capitalist system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has clearly pointed out: "In implementing our policy of opening up, learning foreign technology and utilizing foreign capital, we must do so in the interest of socialist construction, and we cannot depart from the socialist road." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping , Volume III, page 195) In the entire process of carrying out our opening up policy, we must firmly protect and maintain China's independence and sovereignty. For over a hundred years China had endured aggression and oppression by various Western powers, and suffered deeply the bitterness of national humiliation and deprivation of rights. The Chinese people value highly our national independence and sovereignty gained with the blood and lives of countless revolutionary martyrs. Today, despite the great changes in the international scene, big power politics and hegemonism still remain. Internationally, hostile forces are still trying hard to overthrow China's system of socialism through peaceful evolution tactics. We must keep a clear head and carry out resolute struggle. National independence and sovereignty are the basic rights of the Chinese people, and on any issues which interfere with our national independence and sovereignty, the Chinese people's interests and their honor and self-respect, we will never compromise on these principles. Just as the way Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "The Chinese people value the friendship and cooperation with other countries and peoples, but value even more their own independence and sovereignty gained through a long period of struggle. No foreign country should expect China would become their vassal, or to shallow the bitter fruit harmful to our national interests." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III, page 3) In looking forward to the opening up policy achieving important results, we should also be aware that in terms of the relationship between that policy and our independence and self- reliance, certain problems still remain. In particular, some people think that simply by carrying out the opening up policy, capital, facilities and technology, etc., will flow in from abroad, and that there will be no need for self-reliance or struggling to start our own businesses; some people working in the so-called "opening up" and "introducing foreign things into China" areas have no qualm about harming the national or people's interests in the process. Some people, disregarding reality, conditions or needs, think that starting more and more "development zones" means greater political accomplishment, or that attracting more things foreign demonstrates their talent and ability. Particularly obnoxious are people who, in the economic exchanges of the opening up process, have developed various corrupt and evil tendencies. All this goes against the Party's basic line, and Party discipline and the country's laws will not stand for it. At present, China is striving to realize the strategic objective in the second stage of socialist modernization and development, and we need to rectify the relationship between the opening up policy and [our] independence and self-reliance; in carrying out the opening up policy, we must firmly establish the spirit of self-reliance and pioneering struggle. And We must resolutely overcome the negative and corrupt phenomena produced by opening up to the outside.
