Howard Young, Legislative Council representative for the tourism industry, said the ban, imposed by Taipei in response to China's handling of the deaths of 24 Taiwan citizens in a fire aboard a boat in Zhejiang last month, was "bad for Hong Kong". A Taiwan travel agent predicted there could be as much as a 70 percent decrease in Taiwanese arrivals in the territory. A spokesman for the Taiwan Travel Agents Association said cancellations from customers planning to travel to China had been pouring in since the boat tragedy. With 1.8 million Taiwan residents entering Hong Kong last year, many of them en route to China, the impact of the ban on the territory could be formidable. Taiwan is Hong Kong's No 1 tourism market, accounting for almost 20 per cent of all tourist arrivals. Although not all China bound Taiwanese tourists stop in Hong Kong, those who do spend far more than the average tourist. HKTA [Hong Kong Tourist Association] figures show Taiwan tourists spent $13.9bn here last year. The HKTA spokeswoman, Penny Byrne, said that since the ban applied only to group travel, the territory would not be as adversely affected as thought. "Companies that specialise in group tour traffic will be hurt," Byrne said, adding that medium range hotels and retailers would feel the pinch the most. Airlines which carry Taiwanese tourists to China are also expected to feel a significant impact, at least in the short term. These include Cathay Pacific, China Airlines and Dragonair. A Dragonair spokesman said: "There must be some short-term impact." A Taipei official at Cathay Pacific, which has up to 15 flights a day to Taiwan, said the carrier had already begun to notice a drop- off in demand for Hong Kong-bound seats. "We have seen some cancellations, mainly on group travel to China," he said. A Cathay official said that because only 20 per cent of China- bound travellers came in groups, the airline did not expect to be severely affected. Cathay estimates about 60 per cent of passengers boarding its Hong Kong flights go to China. Hunter Eu, deputy director general of the Taiwan Tourism Bureau, said Hong Kong would definitely feel the ban. One Taiwanese airline official said outbound travel to China was on the decline even before the boat tragedy as many tour groups had come back from China complaining about horrendous service.
