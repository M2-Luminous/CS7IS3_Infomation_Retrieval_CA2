A short while ago in Jerusalem, Israeli officials were informed that the U.S. will support a Security Council resolution which expresses regret over the events in Hebron, and calls on Israel to take all measures to restore calm to the area. Israeli officials are said to be pleased with the American position. The PLO has demanded that the Security Council resolution make an announcement to send international forces to the territories to protect Palestinian civilians. The Security Council started discussing the situation last night. Judy Lessing filed this report from New York: [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Lessing] Islamic countries have given the Council a draft resolution. The United States has taken the lead in writing a statement. So the two sides will consult and work out the way the Council will condemn the massacre. The Council president said the resolution was fairly mild, the statement has much stronger wording. He said neither is critical of the Israeli Army, but is of the settlers. Ambassador Gad Ya'aqobi understands something similar. [Ya'aqobi] To the best of my knowledge none of the proposals here is condemning Israel, and we condemned as well the murder, the act of this lunatic murderer, so there is no proposal to condemn Israel on this matter. [Lessing] The PLO has said it was clear settlers should be disarmed, but Ambassador Ya'aqobi wasn't ready to agree to this step. [Ya'aqobi] If you will assure me the total disarming of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, which killed many settlers and many other Jewish people in Israel lately, then I will be able to consider this question. [Lessing] Ambassador Ya'aqobi would prefer to see a statement calling for quick progress in the PLO-Israel negotiations, rather than a resolution, because the massacre was carried out by a single person, and wasn't done by a country or a people.
