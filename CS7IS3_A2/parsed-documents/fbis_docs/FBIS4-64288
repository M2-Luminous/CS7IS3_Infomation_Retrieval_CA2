As a result of the neofascists' entering the Government in Rome, Mitolo sees his opportunity to push through longstanding demands. In an interview with KURIER, he said: - About autonomy: "I do not want to abolish autonomy. However, two years after the conclusion of the `package' the results must be analyzed and improved accordingly. We demand more flexibility in particular regarding the implementation of proportional representation in line with ethnic groups for official functions and in the application of bilingualism." - About the economic advantages of South Tirol's autonomy: "We have all benefited. But the Germans have benefited most. The subsidies for agriculture, trade, and tourism mostly benefited the Germans. A balance must be established here." - About the Treaty of Osimo: "It was concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia. However, Yugoslavia does not exist any longer. From the legal point of view, Slovenia and Croatia did not sign the Treaty. Therefore, the situation must be reexamined and one must insist that the Italian minority there is treated better." - About the border at Brenner: "Here the situation is quite different. The Treaty of Osimo is a product of the Cold War. But the border at Brenner was set down after World War I in the Treaties of Saint Germain. And Austria said in these treaties that it forever renounces territorial claims south of the Brenner [Pass]. No compromise on this matter is possible for us. It has been concluded once and for all." - About a "Europe of regions": "We do not want a European region of Tirol (with the inclusion of North Tirol--KURIER editor's note). The European region of Trentino-South Tirol already exists, and it must be strengthened. But if one desires a common region within a larger framework, that is, with North Tirol, then this is possible only together with Lombardy and Veneto."
