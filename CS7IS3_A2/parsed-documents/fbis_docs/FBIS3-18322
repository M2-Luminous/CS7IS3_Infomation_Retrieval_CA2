According to a spokesman of the Development Ministry, this was made clear by Bonn Development Minister Carl-Dieter Stranger (Christian Social Union) during a meeting with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov in Bonn on Tuesday [1 March]. Spranger called on the government in Baku to embark upon a course of democratic reforms. Hasanov was, however, not able to talk to his host, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. The negotiations about European Union membership in Brussels forced Kinkel to cancel all his foreign policy appointments on Tuesday at short notice. Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, who paid a first visit to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also had to do without the planned meeting in the Foreign Ministry.
