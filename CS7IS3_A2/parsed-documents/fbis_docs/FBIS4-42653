The spokesman clarified that among the alternatives being discussed include convening an international conference and the visit by representatives of the five UN Security Council permanent members. The Cypriot Government welcomed the reference to the Cyprus issue, which is contained in the final resolution of the Nonaligned Movement foreign minister's meeting, held in Cairo. The spokesman said the resolution contains a series of positive points for Cyprus and noted the specific reference to UN Security Council Resolutions 365, 541, and 550 and the request for an international conference. Commenting on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' statement about signing a nonaggression pact between the two communities, the government spokesman said this would be meaningful if a similar treaty would also be signed between Cyprus and Turkey. He added that the fear and danger comes from Turkey, which holds part of Cyprus, not from the Turkish Cypriot community.
