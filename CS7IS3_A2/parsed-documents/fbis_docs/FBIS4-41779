The Tiraspol leader declared that the latest negotiations with the Chisinau authorities proved that the political solution of the conflict is still indefinite; economic relations with Moldova first need to be restored. Smirnov stated that the 14th Russian Army is not willing to contribute to the solution of the conflict, because the soldiers benefit from high incomes for their service in a "conflict zone." According to the Dniester leader, Tiraspol presently has claims to the assets of the military units which are to be evacuated from the Eastern regions; it also intends to inherit the rest of the 14th Army property after the latter leaves the region for good. "[14th Army Commander General Aleksandr] Lebed inherited the military equipment and ammunitions of the entire south-western sector of the Soviet Army. We have been a part of the USSR; we paid taxes and now have full rights to possess the property of the troops on our territory," said Smirnov. Commenting on the latent conflict between the Tiraspol authorities and the commander of the 14th Army, Smirnov stated that "the necessity to search for corrupt persons is a feature of Lebed's character" and, eventually, it will be of great use if he returns to Russia. "I do not think I should argue with or deny Lebed's declarations," [accusing the Dniester leaders of corruption] mentioned the Tiraspol leader, reminding that during the recent celebrations on 19 June dedicated to the second anniversary of the tragic events in Bender, Commander Lebed was booed by the audience.
