FBIS4-48608 "drafr099_c_94014" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Defense Minister Says Integration `Key Priority' Defense Minister Says Integration `Key Priority' MB2105073594 Johannesburg SOWETAN in English 20 May 94 p 1 MB2105073594 Johannesburg SOWETAN English BFN [Article by Tyrone August] [Text] The integration of 30,000 soldiers, including Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; (MK]) and Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] members, into the SA National Defence Force [SANDF] is a key priority of Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise During the next few years. The integration will cost 1 billion rand for one year alone. "In order to integrate them successfully, we've got to train them and bring them up to equal standard," Modise said. "This is another way of affirmative action, giving those who did not have the opportunity to catch up with those who had all the opportunities." In an interview yesterday, Modise said the British army would play a role in overseeing their training and would also participate in adjudicating the integration. The integration of MK, APLA and other former homelands armies would inflate the size of the SANDF initially, but the standing force would finally consist of between 67,000 and 70,000 soldiers. "Naturally people will be very concerned about what happens to those who are going to be rationalised," he said. "We are looking at the creation of a service brigade." Those who will lose their places in the SANDF will be given vocational training to prepare them for civilian life. Modise said the SANDF would no longer play a policing role inside the country once stability was restored. He said the police, assisted by the community, should be able to cope. He also ruled out the possibility of a military role outside the country. "We have our own problems," he said. "I don't think we are ready for that role. "We are still in the process of reorganising our army and building it." Regarding speculation about the SANDF intervening in Rwanda, he said: "We have not been approached and, even if we are approached, we won't accept. "You cannot play a peacekeeping role where there is conflict. "The conflicting parties must first agree and only then can a peace-keeping role be played."
