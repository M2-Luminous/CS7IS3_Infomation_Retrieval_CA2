Is that project still in the cards today, after the Russian election? [Moczulski] Of course it is. I would not overestimate the outcome of the recent Russian election. We will probably react to the results of the forthcoming March elections in Ukraine with similarly mixed feelings. Another election is scheduled to take place in Hungary, and its outcome could also be worrying. Nevertheless, I would not overestimate the significance of these phenomena because they only represent peculiar paroxysms of the historical process. In our part of Europe, historical developments do not occur in a linear progression. To use an expression from the realm of meteorological science, you could say that they develop in a turbulent manner. In addition, accidental factors are often instrumental in bringing about significant effects. However, all of that does not alter the fact that Russia is currently undergoing giant transformations. Immediately after Yeltsin's unfortunate solution of his quarrel with parliament, I voiced the opinion that that was the beginning of the end for Yeltsin. The results of the election seem to confirm this. The latest developments should not be seen as a solution but as an even graver complication of the existing problem. Together with the deteriorating economic situation and the increasingly difficult living conditions of the population, the election results suggest that the revolutionary processes in Russia will continue to intensify.... [Palosz] But that does not apply to Russia alone.... [Moczulski] The entire area of postcommunist East Europe and North Asia is currently the scene of great revolutionary ransformations which, fortunately, have not yet assumed particularly brutal forms, except in former Yugoslavia and parts of Transcaucasia. I trust that the brutalization of the revolution will not spread to the remaining postcommunist countries, but we must be prepared, also in Poland, for the possibility of a spread of popular mass movements that will be largely spontaneous and can lead to a brutalization of the chosen methods of action. Unfortunately, such are is the law of history. There was a chance to carry out the inevitable changes in those countries in a calm and controlled manner. However, the elites that have seized power there are on the whole not mature enough to handle the tasks that face them, and they were unable to muster enough imagination to cope with the intricacies of the situation. Even Hungarians, who were arguably best at managing their situation, could still develop problems as a result of the unforeseen development provided by the death of Premier Antall. In Poland, four successive Solidarity governments lost the nation's support. Regardless of its intentions, the present left-wing government is not likely to be equal to the task, either, if only as a result of the disproportion between election promises and the realities of the situation. [Palosz] From the very moment of the establishment of the Third Republic, our diplomats have consistently endeavored to tie Poland to NATO, have they not? [Moczulski] That goal is set purely as a propaganda move, not as a realistic target. Poland's accession to NATO, if effected in a way guaranteeing us genuine security, would mean that our country would be included in the NATO military system. To date, NATO has not even managed to embrace the former GDR within that system. Even if the West was ultimately to prefer the concept that Russia must be opposed by the application of the strategy of shifting NATO eastward, we would have to wait at least 10 years before such a decision could be put into practice, and its realization would cost at least $100 billion, if not more. On the other hand, if NATO's military structure is not shifted to the east but Poland nevertheless receives political guarantees of security, we could face a truly macabre prospect. If we were indeed to encounter an aggressive attack from the east, we would then find ourselves in the foreground of NATO operations. These would entail the use of missiles and air force units because NATO would then probably apply the tactic of the notorious "200 small thermonuclear strikes." For us, such defense would be a worse calamity than an outright defeat. Today the question of NATO's political guarantees has only political and psychological significance. It can be seen as a test for the West and a test for Russia. On the other hand, viewed as a policy that should actually be capable of ensuring our genuine security, it is entirely devoid of any rationale and has been so from the beginning. [Palosz] So is the threat from the east greater now, after the Russian election? [Moczulski] I do not think so. That threat arises from the constant principle present in the Russian political thought: The interest of the Empire is more important than any domestic problems. Of course, Russia is not doomed to subscribe to that principle forever. However, its ruling elites must come to realize that the goal of creating a better life for the Russian people is more important than the ambition to expand Russia's borders to reach the warm seas. The whole problem is that Russia refuses to understand this, and that is why revolutions have been erupting there roughly every 60-70 years--sometimes initiated at the top of the social scale (Aleksandr II) and sometimes at the bottom (the Bolsheviks). Will Russia eventually move in the direction of resolving its internal problems? There are no reasons whatsoever to believe that it will. Let us remember the illusory hopes that arose after 1918, envisaging an end to Russia's imperial policies with the collapse of the system of czardom. All of that does not mean, however, that we are right now in danger of being invaded. It is true that there is a certain tendency to favor direct invasion, which can be observed in Russia's policy toward Estonia, in the Transcaucasia, and in the Crimea. Nevertheless, it still does not mean that we can expect the Kremlin to issue a decision for the Red Army to march westward. Instead, we should rather expect a tendency to "export" unrest. For example, the military formations in the region of Krolewiec [Kaliningrad], which today are still a regular, orderly army, tomorrow could well disintegrate into disorderly but still superbly armed gangs of brigands. However, there is an even graver danger facing us in the long run: that Russia will rebuild its military power and Russians will still harbor a sense of having been wronged. The sense of having been wronged is subjective; the Russian people will recall that, even in their own living memory, the frontiers of their empire extended as far as the Elbe, whereas now they stop somewhere near Smolensk. Thus, we will have the ground ready for the emergence of a phenomenon similar to the "Hitler syndrome," which could have disastrous consequences also for Russia itself. [Palosz] So what course of action would you suggest? [Moczulski] I suggest the idea of integrating the countries of the proposed "Intersea bloc" along the Warsaw-Kiev axis. This will provide the desirable geopolitical potential situated west of Russia, large enough to be capable of effective self-defense in economic, cultural, and military terms. The best protection against invasion is a defense wall or, to be precise, the awareness of the existence of such a wall. Having built their own Great Wall, the Chinese concluded: The wall is not there to protect us physically against invasion. It is there to remind the potential aggressors that invasion is out of the question.
