In Nuurfanax, around 70 km southeast of Beledweyne, the final task of General Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr general chief of staff, was to hand over the largest German project to date: A dam and a straightened river bed, which after the rains is to hold water for irrigating some 5,000 hectares of land. The highest ranking German soldier thanked the unit for the humanitarian assistance they had provided. In response to the request from indigenous clan leaders and elders that the Germans remain in Beledweyne, Naumann said the political decision had already been made concerning the final return of the over 1,400 German UN soldiers by 31 March. Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, the commander of the Somalia support unit, said the Germans were leaving behind a sign of hope with their aid projects. According to a report drawn up by the unit, the over 3,000 soldiers and officers deployed in Somalia over the past eight months have distributed more than 3.2 million liters of water, drilled seven wells, repaired three bridges, and put three dams in working order. In addition, seven schools and an orphanage for over 120 children were built. The Germans also gave outpatient and hospital treatment to over 15,300 Somalis and operated on 480 victims of the civil war. The costs of the humanitarian operation total around 3.5 million German marks [DM]. According to estimates, which have not been confirmed by the Bundeswehr, total costs for the Somali operation are between DM350 and 500 million.
