FBIS3-49604 "dreeu008__a94015" FBIS-EEU-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Daily Says Authorities Violate Benes Decrees AU1001195894 Prague CTK in English 1055 GMT 10 Jan 94 AU1001195894 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Out of some 2,000 Bohemian and Moravian castles and mansions, 514 were confiscated by the end of 1947 under the Benes Decree No. 12 dealing with "landed property confiscated from Germans, Hungarians, and traitors and enemies of the Czech and Slovak nations." The decree sought to punish those who filed for German or Hungarian nationality in 1939 and 1940, served in the German Army under the Nazis, or otherwise collaborated with the Germans. In today's article entitled "Czech Seats Claimed Even by Descendants of Wehrmacht or SS Servicemen," the left-leaning RUDE PRAVO writes that it was under this decree that many of the 130 castles which have been opened to the public in the following two years were acquired by the state. Since November 1989, over 40 of them have been restituted to the original owners' families, and restitution claims have been made for the whole or parts of the remaining ones. However, twenty-four claimants, or almost a third, fall into the category specified by the Benes Decree. Moreover, the property concerned, the paper writes, is of the highest cultural value -- such as Rozmberk, Hruby Rohozec, Blatna, Kozel, Opocno, Ratiborice, Zleby, and Bouzov Castles -- and there are another 40 claims to less valuable properties acquired by the state under the decree. The most significant claims have been filed by the Waldstein, Collorado, Blucher, and Buquoy families as well as by the Order of the German Knights. It seems that the claimants have agreed on a unified approach, consisting in first filing a claim with the regional land registry for both land and buildings, and then demanding restitution of land only, under the 1993 Land Law, the paper says. Three documents are required by the land registry: A proof of original ownership, the claimants' Czech nationality, and their permanent residence in this country. However, the Interior Ministry has been handing out Czech nationality certificates to persons of "special importance" irrespective of the laws, and as for a permanent residence stamp, it has been shown that this can often be obtained without difficulty. The land registry, then, is unconcerned whether or not the claimed property was confiscated under the Benes Decree -- and a precedent was set when the land registry in Semily, east Bohemia, gave 90 hectares of land to Karl Walderode, who beyond doubt opted for German nationality in 1939 and served in the Wehrmacht. The land registry in Ceske Budejovice, south Bohemia, has started inquiries into the current state of property a claim to which had been filed by Karl Buquoy, the last owner of Rozmberk -- and it has done so irrespective of the fact that he is a former SS and SA member and that after the war he served a jail term for spreading Nazi propaganda. It is clear that the future course of events will be as follows: As soon as the Benes Decree-covered claimants receive the land, they will file for farm buildings and eventually for castles. Under the 1993 Land Law, castles can be considered -- strange as it may seem -- as "dwellings forming part of the original farming property" and, as such, to be restituted. Judging by the silence of Justice and Interior Ministry officials who are aware of all these facts, and by the land registries' approach, it appears that the restitution deadline of February might be broken and the Benes Decrees rendered ineffective. It even seems that by the attitude they have taken, government institutions are giving this development free rein, RUDE PRAVO writes.
