Bureaucracy is terrible. Bureaucracy is essential. It recognizes no state boundaries, has no fear of time, and is absolutely devoid of complexes. We are afraid of it and curse it, we struggle and write pamphlets against it, but we cannot do without it. However, we have come to terms with the fact that the bureaucrat, like any person, has his own interests and that he very naturally directs his energies first and foremost into defending and implementing his own tasks, and not, as we would like, our tasks. It is here precisely that the nub of the problem lies: The state and bureaucracy -- which is an integral part of it -- are created to act on our interests, but the personal and corporate interests of the people constituting the state machine prevent this. It is impossible to eliminate this contradiction. It can only be reduced to a greater or lesser extent and, in as much as it is possible, made to benefit the public. Agreed, this is not simple. But in order to do this it is necessary to first of all to attempt to understand what bureaucracy is, what its interests are, and how it acts on them. Bureaucracy's chief resource is power. In the hands of an official this resource is converted into other forms of capital. But the most important law governing power is the urge of a person or institution possessing power to increase it. Another law may be added to this one, which can be called the "law of conservation of power." According to it, officials acquire power only at the expense of others. In a democratic state -- consequently in Russia also -- the people are the source of power. In any case this is what is written in our Constitution. As a consequence of elections, part of this power is vested in elected politicians -- deputies, presidents, governors etc. The chosen politicians depend on the people directly through the process of the elections, their policies are for the most part public and kept in the sights of the mass media. All this limits their power, restrains in some measure their urge to increase it, and forces them to fit their personal interests in with those of the voters. However, public politicians' power is exercised with the help of the apparatus. Meaning that part of the power is transferred to it. Officials in the apparatus are appointed, which means that they depend on those who appoint them and have to work to promote the interests, in addition to themselves, of those politicians who appoint them. By now we have moved quite a long way away from the public interest. Moreover the apparatus' power is less public and therefore all the greater. It is interesting that from the very first months of the Russian Supreme Soviet's existence the habit developed of appointing deputies to positions in the apparatus. This was particularly widely practised last year. Once a deputy had become an official he defended the corporate interest of his organ of power and forgot about the voters. Public politicians make up other organs of power (the courts, the executive branch of power, etc.) and transfer part of their power to them. The latter, in turn, form their own apparatuses giving rise to an army of state bureaucrats. This is amazing. Every politician and department thinks that by increasing their apparatus, the politician's or department's power will also increase. But the opposite happens. A politician's power is limited by other politicians' power and powers. The power of a department (or branch of power) is limited by other departments' power and powers. Therefore, a politician's or department leader's power passes to his apparatus without a change in the total amount of power. An unjustified increase in the apparatus' size leads to control over it being lost, which increases its power at the expense of public politicians. As a result the power of the people, which has temporally been transferred to public politicians by elections, is concentrated in the hands of the bureaucracy. This process may result in the usurpation of the power of the people. Our Russian bureaucracy has two aspects. Its first aspect is the section of the old nomenklatura bureaucracy, which is regenerating itself. It cannot get enough of adapting, usurping power for itself, hiding its power, and strengthening it. It religiously guards its corporate interests, makes its own "rules," and inculcates them in its new recruits, corrupting them with the advantages gained through keeping to them. This bureaucracy knows how to be effective when defending its own interests or when it has been given no way out and has been forced to work in the interests of others, even those of the public. The second aspect of Russian bureaucracy is represented by the new politicians who appeared at the end of the 1980's as a result of the first open elections. The majority of them are not politicians (in the Soviet meaning of the word) nor are they officials. They are average-grade professionals from other fields of endeavor. Having unexpectedly gotten into politics, they brought with them a conviction that there are areas of human endeavor that anybody can fathom if they add politics to pedagogy and medicine. An absence of professionalism may not be very significant when coordinating public interests, which is usually what takes place in legislative representative bodies. But in any other area of power, especially in area of implementing practical policy -- and the apparatus needs to handle this in particular -- professionalism is essential. For historical reasons, many recently recruited politicians have lately been filling positions as officials in the apparatus. Skipping the professional training essential to climb the professional ladder, they have moved into important positions. They have brought the hullabaloo of political squabbles to the quiet corridors of power, turning the offices of members of the apparatus into party headquarters. To counterbalance this, similar processes have been taking place in other offices where other officials, instead of performing their state duties, have been carrying out political tasks to redress the balance. The apparatus has been politicized right through. It has begun to live for and tear itself apart over political passions and has not only stopped working to carry out its "job description" but also even to promote its corporate interests, and by so doing has weakened the state power. Politicians holding posts as officials have not become officials and have not ceased to be politicians. Meaning that they have used their power as members of the apparatus at every opportunity to resolve their own personal political problems. They have been able to do this all the more effectively because the apparatus' power is for the most part hidden from outsiders and is shameless in its choice of methods. The overall result is that our bureaucracy with its two aspects is extremely ineffective at carrying out socially necessary and state tasks. Reforming it is a necessary condition for survival. It is encouraging that we heard at the Russian president's press conference evidence that these problems are understood. Evidence not only of the intention to reform the administration and government by reducing its staff, but also of the establishment of a lasting dialogue between those holding power and society, of the necessity of pursuing public policies. Both are extremely important as they prevent the bureaucracy from going unchecked and strengthening beyond all bounds. No less important is a reliance on professionalism in appointments which should reduce the proportion of politicized personnel in the bureaucracy and their pernicious effect on it. The only problem, however consistent the Russian president is in putting his intentions into effect, is whether he has sufficient power to reform the apparatus using the apparatus itself when there is opposition from within it.
