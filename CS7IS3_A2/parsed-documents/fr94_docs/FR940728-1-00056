SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . (Magnuson Act) requires that a Regional Fishery Management Council submit any amendment to a fishery management plan it has prepared to the Secretary for review, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider all public comments received during the public comment period in determining whether to approve the amendment for implementation. Amendment 8 would implement largely administrative changes to the FMP to address problems encountered during the first year of a limited entry and quota management program established by Amendment 7. These changes include: 1. Eliminating the landing requirement necessary for obtaining a limited-entry permit for each new fishing season. 2. Implementing a framework procedure to adjust the target catch-per-unit-of-effort so that it reflects the current productivity of the stocks. 3. Implementing a framework procedure to allow some fishing, if necessary, when the quota is zero in an effort to obtain important fisheries data. 4. Reducing the period of time fishermen will have to notify NMFS of their return to port. 5. Implementing a requirement that fishermen notify NMFS of the time of unloading their vessels. 6. Revising the information on the report of sales of lobsters. 7. Providing first level buyers with worksheets to facilitate information reporting. 8. Implementing a framework procedure authorizing the RD to modify reporting requirements and call-in destinations. An environmental assessment and regulatory impact review are incorporated in Amendment 8. All are available for public review (see ADDRESSES ). The receipt date for Amendment 8 was July 19, 1994. Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 8 are scheduled to be published within 15 days of the receipt date. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 22, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
