Referring in detail to the basic contents of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address, he pointed out: Last year, our people won a brilliant victory in socialist construction and demonstrated the might of chuche Korea to the world despite the harsh trials the imperialists and reactionaries viciously subjected them to through their anti-Republic maneuvers. This was a result of the outstanding and tested leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. This year, too, our party and people will unite as one around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and thoroughly implement an independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive revolutionary line. As a result, they will further strengthen the political, economic, and military might of the country and positively struggle to achieve national reunification through a way of a confederal system based on one nation, one state, two systems, and two governments. Pointing out that our party and the Government of the Republic will consistently carry out an independent, peaceful, and goodwill foreign policy in the future, too, he continued: Today our people's struggle is arduous, but the Korean people, who are struggling for the just cause under the wise leadership of the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [chidoja], are ever victorious. The maneuvers of the imperialists and the reactionaries, who want to isolate and crush [apsal] the DPRK under the pretext of the non- existent nuclear development, will not avoid their own destruction. Participants in the meeting congratulated our people on their brilliant achievements made in socialist construction last year and sincerely wished them a greater success in their future works under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.
