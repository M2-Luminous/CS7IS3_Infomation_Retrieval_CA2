This is revealed by the most recent Market opinion poll. A total of 46 percent are currently in favor of entry into the EU, and 36 percent are against it. When those who are undecided or who have not made up their minds were asked whether they would rather vote for or against EU membership, it is clear that three out of four who are undecided would rather vote in favor of entry into the EU. In fact, the April poll revealed a larger number of EU supporters, but those who were undecided were more inclined to vote against the EU. Thus, Market head Werner Beutelmeyer draws the conclusion that the euphoria that prevailed after the announcement of the results of the Brussels negotiations has subsided. "Yet the mood continues to be good, even though the outcome of the referendum is by no means certain," the pollster stated. The result among supporters of the Freedom Party of Austria has changed considerably. A total of 46 percent rejects EU membership for the first time; 31 percent support Austria's entry into the EU.
