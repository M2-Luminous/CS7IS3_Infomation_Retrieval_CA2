This is why there was no early military intervention that would probably have prevented the war; this is why the West has deceived itself believing that it had met its international responsibility with its "humanitarian aid" for those who were threatened by guns and displaced with bayonets; this is also why the UN Security Council has churned out resolutions by the dozen, resolutions that sounded but were hardly meant seriously as far as their potential effect was concerned. Yet, instead of keeping firm ground under its feet, the international organization and the West were more and more drawn into the mire as a result of their half-hearted actions; they were made to pay for earlier mistakes. When, last weekend, the Muslim enclave Gorazde threatened to fall into the hands of its besiegers, the Bosnian Serbs, after 10 days of fighting, NATO for the first time in its history intervened in a ground war with combat aircraft. And the U.S. President, the secretary generals of the United Nations and NATO declared in unison that the Serbs would have to expect further strikes of this kind if they continued their bombings -- not only in Gorazde, but also the other ruined cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina declared as "safe heavens" by the United Nations, which have long since become huge refugee camps. He who has got stuck in the mire no longer has a choice. Therefore, there is no alternative to the air strikes against the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde and, unless they stop, to further such actions. After all, the fall of Gorazde would not only have surrendered 65,000 Muslim refugees to "ethnic cleansing." It would also have led to the collapse of the ingenious structure of negotiations and compromise opportunities that the United Nations, the United States, and Russia as negotiators, in particular, have been trying to put together for two months. Yet -- and this also makes up the tragedy of the belated action -- the military operation necessary for the success of the negotiations, has, at the same time, threatened to thwart these chances. It has instigated the Serbs, although being tired of the war, to act defiantly. It encourages the Bosniaks to continue to pursue the war option. And it has irritated the Russians: Boris Yeltsin was not even informed let alone consulted about the UN punitive action in advance. So what is to be done to prevent the chances for peace, which opened thanks to the NATO ultimatum for Sarajevo in February, to be now spoiled again by the NATO bombing for Gorazde? One thing is that Russia must not only be involved in the strategy of the negotiations, but even into that of military pressure. True, the Russian representative in the UN Security Council almost one year ago agreed to the resolutions on which the United Nations and NATO can base their action. Yet, Russia has now become indispensable for the success of the negotiations in the Balkans. The government in Moscow wants to be taken seriously, which means that it wants to be a partner with equal rights in the UN team. Otherwise, what the supreme war criminal in the Balkans, Serb President Milosevic, is obviously speculating, might really happen: that Moscow becomes a stooge for Serbian interests. The other thing is: Should the negotiations in the Balkans be promoted, then military sanctions would have to be predictable for the addressee, which, for too long, they were not. On the contrary, the actions of Western fighter bombers at Gorazde could have probably been prevented had the UN authorities in Bosnia and the U.S. Government in Washington not initially conveyed the impression to the Bosnian Serbs that the city had virtually been awarded to them. The conditions for the military intervention have now finally been unequivocally defined. Had they been as unambiguous before, the chances for peace would not hang upon a thread today. After all, it remains the only rope by which the West can pull itself out of the mire in the Balkans again.
