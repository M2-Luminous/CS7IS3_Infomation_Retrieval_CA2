This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in his address at the signing of a declaration on cooperation between the Russian Federation and the OECD and an agreement between the Russian Government and the OECD on the granting of privileges and immunities for the organization within the Russian Federation. The ceremony was held today at the Paris headquarters of this international organization. These documents "pave the way for the expansion of effective cooperation between Russia and the OECD in the long term and the mutually complementary interests of both countries," the minister said. "Thanks to its material and natural resources, Russia's involvement with the OECD will help to further enrich trade, economic, scientific, technical, and intellectual exchanges in the extensive Euro-Atlantic and Pacific region," the minister noted. He feels that these documents also provide "further important evidence of the world community's support for economic reforms in Russia."
