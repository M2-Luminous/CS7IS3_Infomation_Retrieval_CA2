It is literally no more than a preliminary estimate of the future outlook of the social welfare burden outlined in the future welfare vision program, but it gives a strong impression of the necessity for substantive tax increases by citing several theoretical cases where tax increases would be required in a range above 7 percent. To begin with, it is odd that the report makes 7 percent the starting point. They should start with a theoretical case wherein there is no tax increase. We have always advocated that the study should be premised on the fundamental concept of "neutrality in tax revenues" in the sense that tax reform in all cases would reflect tax increases which are offset by tax decreases. The reason is that fiscal spending and fiscal revenues are both influenced by many uncertain factors and many issues remain to be discussed in reference to the status of tax burdens. An offsetting consumption tax rate for an income tax reduction of 6 trillion yen would be set at 5 to 6 percent. We cannot help but stress that the case for a real tax increase is very weak, and that it would be difficult to gain approval of the public for such an increase. As a result, we fear that tax reform itself will not be achievable. The recent estimates were premised on 1) continuation of the 6 trillion yen income tax cut; 2) implementation of public funding as visualized in the "21st Century Welfare Vision Program" to cover social welfare-related costs; and 3) redemption of government bonds used to cover tax reductions in 10 years assuming offsetting consumption tax increases will take place in fiscal year 1997. Among these premises, the second one poses special problems. The welfare vision program outlines benefit and cost projections for social security based on four assumed cases, including one case assuming continuation of current systems, but the recent estimate encompasses revision of the annuity system, increased efficiency of the medical system, and improvements in nursing, and is based on a so-called standard model. According to the estimate, it assumes a 5-percent annual average growth rate in individual income and a social security burden in fiscal year 2000 of 21 percent of individual income versus 17.8 percent for fiscal year 1993, of which public funding based on tax revenues will amount to 6.5 percent versus 4.8 percent for fiscal year 1993. The latter ratio of 6.5 percent of individual income poses a problem in that it must be covered by fiscal funding. Neither has an adequate debate taken place nor has public consensus been formed about social security benefit levels, types of benefits, and the breakdown of cost allocations such as social security taxes, other taxes, and self-help efforts. It is even possible that the tax burden can be reduced depending on the options selected. If the public burden portion as a ratio of public income were to be reduced one point to 5.5 percent, the social security-related expenditures cited in the estimate would be reduced by 4 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. The estimate indicates that fiscal requirements for social security will increase by 5.5 to 5.7 trillion yen in fiscal year 1994, but these figures can be reduced to a level just below 2 trillion yen. This means that the fiscal deficit will, of necessity, become a lesser issue. We cannot help but say that the estimate which claims a 4-5 trillion yen shortfall despite a consumption tax rate of 7 percent is poorly grounded. Another point of issue concerning the estimate is that it does not consider spontaneous growth in revenues in its calculations for revenues and expenditures. Tax revenues are very unstable in that they expand significantly during stages such as the bubble economy and drop during recessions like the current one, but as long as there are progressive income tax rates, tax revenue will grow faster than the economic growth rate over the long term. As a matter of fact, the MOF has estimated that if a tax revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and an increase in tax revenue at a multiple of 1.1 over the economic growth rate are assumed based on past experience, the spontaneous increase in revenues will be 2.8-3 trillion yen for fiscal year 1994. If these figures are considered, revenue and expenditures would change substantially. The premise of calling for redemption of emergency government bonds in 10 years in the estimate lacks persuasiveness when one considers that ordinary government bonds are redeemed over 60 years. If the redemption period is set at 60 years, fiscal expenditures which serve as the source of funds for redemption hardly pose a problem. As demonstrated in the foregoing discussion limited to the premise alone, the estimate reveals MOF intentions of attempting to create a fiscal crisis by overestimating the fiscal requirements and underestimating the fiscal revenues. If one were to elaborate, no mention has been made of any of the issues that the government should normally deal with. If reference were made to fiscal revenues, a revision of tax system inequities mentioned in the midterm report of the government's Tax Council should be included in calculations. As a minimum, if action were taken to deprive businesses of benefits accruing from the use of consumption tax revenues prior to deposit with tax agencies, it should lead to considerable revenue increases for the government. The effects of cost reductions based on administrative and fiscal reform should be similar. It would not be an exaggeration to say that acceptance of tax reform by the public depends on actions taken on these issues. The MOF claims that it excluded such factors because the figures were not conclusive. However, in a similar vein, the fiscal requirements used as a premise for the estimate were also inconclusive. What we would like to emphasize here is that we do not wish to deny that fiscal requirements will rise with the aging of society, but that the recent estimate lacks persuasiveness for use as a basis for increasing taxes which have a direct effect on the public's lifestyle. The estimate is presented in a manner which can only be viewed as making a tax increase an unavoidable conclusion. What is of concern is that such a stance could cause a reaction from the public which would lead to a failure in tax reform. As repeatedly stated in the past, the pending aging of society will not sustain the current tax system, which relies excessively on income taxes. There is a need to expedite a restructuring of the tax system which corrects the ratio of direct and indirect taxes. Further delays cannot be tolerated. At any rate, the previously released welfare vision program and the recent estimate have clarified that a major issue remains to be resolved in terms of benefits and burdens. Administrative and fiscal reform is probably an issue whose benefits will be steadily implemented on a long-term basis. We have not reached the stage where we are ready to provide a conclusive outline of the future of fiscal administration. The foregoing discussion covered our thoughts on why we advocate fiscal neutrality. We are convinced that the above approach provides for the most logical one at the present stage. The recent estimate clarified the issues that require resolution. We would ask that the government's Tax Council use the contents of the estimate as a basis for conducting a wide-ranging discussion.
