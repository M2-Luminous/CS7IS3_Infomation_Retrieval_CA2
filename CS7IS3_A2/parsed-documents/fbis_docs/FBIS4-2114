[Wang Dongjin] Hebei will emphasize four aspects of work when facilitating price reform this year. First is to increase the grain and cotton purchasing prices to protect peasants' production enthusiasm. Beginning 1 April, we will lift the control on the grain purchasing price throughout the province, change state fixed-quota purchases into contracted purchases, ensure the quantity but decontrol the price, and implement the protection price system in the purchases of grain. Second is to adjust the prices of crude oil, refined oil, and electricity at an opportune time in line with state arrangements and lift the price control on coal and chemical fertilizer. Third is to further lift the price control on competitive commodities and services and properly adjust the state-controlled prices for some commodities and services. Fourth is to control the benchmark land price well and gradually establish a mechanism for normal real estate prices to take shape. We should carefully organize the implementation of the various price reform measures, strictly forbid unauthorized price increase, adopt effective measures to stabilize the prices of nonstaple food, and keep the general price increase within the scope bearable to all fields of society. [Reporter] Hebei won notable achievements in cultivating and developing commodity markets in the past few years. What measures will it take to accelerate this work this year? [Wang Dongjin] This year's commodity market construction should be focused on four aspects. First, based on local resources advantages, laws governing commodity circulation, and regional demand, we will cultivate on a priority basis a number of wholesale markets for farm and sideline products, such as grain, vegetables, fruits, aquatic products, meat, poultry, eggs, and livestock, that meet local demands and have their own characteristics to clear the channels for the circulation of farm and sideline products and to resolve peasants' "difficulties in purchasing and marketing." We will open a number of specialized wholesale markets for industrial goods in the areas where these goods are produced, marketed, or transferred, and we will open a number of tourist, recreational, and catering markets. Second, we will develop the markets for the means of industrial and agricultural production at various levels and through various channels in line with the principle of letting those who invest gain the ownership and interests and establish, throughout the province as soon as possible, a pattern of the markets of means of production in which the regional wholesale markets in the key energy and raw material producing areas are placed in the lead, the markets of means of production in the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province are the channels, and those in county seats are the mainstay. We will also develop the commodity circulation organizations and production and marketing forms that help stabilize the relations between production and marketing to serve industrial and agricultural production still better. Third, we will build large retail outlets more rapidly. Cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province should particularly develop a number of large, multi-purpose, and fairly well-known shopping centers that provide a good shopping environment, have competitive edges, and create high economic efficiency to satisfy people's ever growing consumption demand. Fourth, in compliance with the State Council requirement for "standardizing the beginning and experimenting with all work," we will work hard to create favorable conditions, train high-level personnel for futures management, and draw up plans for experiments to be submitted to the State Council Securities Commission in order to strive to establish two pilot futures markets. [Reporter] The focus of the current endeavor to cultivate and improve the market system is to develop the markets for essential elements of production. Please give us specific details about it? [Wang Dongjin] We should put the cultivation of the markets for essential elements of production in a prominent position this year and expedite building of the markets for money, labor forces, personnel, technology, real estate, information, and enterprises' property rights. We will develop and improve the money markets with banks' money-lending as the major form, actively develop the standardized inter-bank lending and the markets for discounted bills, improve and define the business scope of the provincial money-lending center, and establish its branches in some cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province. We will further develop the securities markets, prepare for establishing securities trading centers in Shijiazhuang and Tangshan cities, and establish securities trading agencies in the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province and securities transfer agencies in county-level cities. We will actively raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks, create favorable conditions for issuing trust profitable securities and investment fund securities to satisfy the needs of investors and raise more funds for construction projects. We will give full play to the role of the market mechanism in rationally distributing urban and rural labor resources. We will expand and improve the functions of labor markets to enable them to provide integrated multi-purpose services for offering jobs, employment consultation, unemployment insurance, and pre-employment training. We will provide active support for all fields of society to establish employment agencies and gradually establish a service network composed of the labor markets at city, county, and township (neighborhood) levels and those built by all fields of society so that we can provide conditions for enterprises to employ workers and laborers to choose jobs by themselves. Cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province should expedite construction of the facilities for labor markets and connect all the markets in the province into an integrated network. We should strengthen regional labor service cooperation and guide the orderly mobility of rural labor forces. We will accelerate construction of personnel markets and change, as soon as possible, the personnel management methods characterized by departmental ownership and unified and guaranteed job arrangements. All cities and prefectures should build and improve personnel markets, strengthen their services, and realistically develop the role of the markets in regulating the supply and demand of personnel. We will facilitate the reform of the scientific and technological system and greatly develop technology markets. We will promote the restructuring of scientific and technological departments, the transformation of their mechanisms, and the diversion of their personnel in line with the principle of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open." We will transform scientific research institutes engaged in technological development into enterprises more rapidly and encourage scientific and technical personnel to establish nongovernmental enterprises engaged in scientific and technological development. We will establish an open technology market network to encourage the scientific and technical personnel and scientific research achievements of scientific research institutes, colleges, and universities to enter urban and rural technology markets. We will develop the various forms of technology trading activities to transform technological achievements more rapidly into commodities and to industrialize them. In 1994, we will prepare for building the provincial-level economic information market and connect it with the information markets of the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the province so as to establish a provincewide economic information market network. We will build specialized markets for information on medicinal herbs and building materials to service the production and operation of Hebei's medicinal herbs and building materials industries. Hebei will prepare for building an enterprise property rights trading center to meet the needs in the adjustment of the organization of enterprises. All cities and prefectures should also establish property rights trading markets to provide service for enterprises to deal with property rights. [Reporter] Deepening the reform of the foreign economic relations system and opening wider to the outside world are the strategic measure for building an economically strong province. What are the major measures Hebei will take this year for this work? [Wang Dongjin] We will continue to unswervingly implement the policy of opening to the outside world and open still wider. We will exert more efforts to achieve success in the opening up of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou, the development belt along the Beijing-Shenzhen Expressway, and the various regional central cities, link them to the world market as soon as possible, and fully develop their radiating and leading role. We will adhere to the principle of developing foreign economic relations, foreign trade, and foreign capital simultaneously and accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy. We will strive to make foreign-funded enterprises successful; broaden the channels for using foreign capital; coordinate the work to bring in funds and technology from abroad with the adjustment of the industrial structure and the renovation of old enterprises; develop on a priority basis technology-intensive enterprises and the enterprises that produce import substitutes and earn foreign exchange through exports; increase the proportion of foreign investment made in infrastructural facilities, basic industries, and high- and new-tech projects; and attach importance to bringing in funds from abroad through issuance of capital stocks and securities. We will make the best of Hebei's abundant labor resources to undertake construction projects and labor service cooperation abroad through various channels and measures. We will establish a pattern of multi-directional opening up step by step. We will further deepen the reform of the foreign trade system in line with the principle of unified policies, open business, competition on an equal footing, sole responsibility for profits and losses, integrated management of industry and foreign trade, and wide application of the agency system. We will speed up transformation of the operating mechanism of the import and export enterprises of various categories and reorganize the state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to the modern enterprise system. Large and medium-sized enterprises where conditions permit should actively apply for and use well the import and export authority. Those without the necessary conditions for dealing with imports and exports for the time being may "borrow ships to go to sea," actively promote the integrated management of industry, commerce, technology, and agriculture with foreign trade, and develop the internationalized, industrialized, and conglomerate trading companies. In this way, more enterprises will be able to enter the world market. We will encourage establishment of enterprises outside the border and improve the export tax refund system. We will further lift control on import and export commodities and gradually distribute the quotas through bidding and auction the small number of import and export commodities under quota management in a fair and open manner while considering their efficiency. We will make the city, prefectural, and county foreign trade management systems more rational and delegate financial management powers to lower levels to stimulate the enthusiasm of grass-roots enterprises. [Reporter] What is your opinion on accelerating the reform of the social security system and the housing system? [Wang Dongjin] We will follow the principle of "unified management and separation of government administration from functions of institutions" to make the social insurance management system more rational and gradually establish the multi-layered social security system. The focus of this year is to accelerate the reform of the urban social insurance system to strengthen the social service function and reduce the burdens on enterprises; and to encourage various types of social mutual aid and actively develop commercial insurance to satisfy the needs of various levels. We will consolidate and improve the provincial-level unified planning for the old-age insurance premiums of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the unified planning of society for the old-age insurance premiums of the staff members and workers of collective enterprises to make sure that the unified planning will cover more than 85 percent of the staff members and workers this year. We will further expand the coverage of the old-age insurance and gradually include all the temporary workers, Chinese staff members and workers of foreign-funded enterprises, staff members and workers of private enterprises, and self-employed laborers in the insurance. We will actively experiment with the reform of the calculation and issuance of the old-age insurance premiums of staff members and workers and explore the ways to combine unified planning of society with individual accounts to gradually make enterprises and individuals share the insurance premiums together. We will further establish and improve the unified unemployment insurance system that cover all staff members and workers of enterprises of various categories, including the Chinese staff members and workers of foreign-funded enterprises, exercise integrated management, establish the unemployment insurance premium system at the provincial level and city or prefectural level, and coordinate unemployment insurance with employment service to promote social stability. We will continue the experiment with the reform of medical insurance, industrial injury insurance, and maternity insurance of women workers. Based on peasants' voluntary participation, we will institute the old-age insurance derived from accumulation of individual accounts. We will develop and improve rural cooperative medical service. We will strengthen the management and public supervision of various insurance funds. We will conscientiously implement the State Council decision on accelerating urban housing reform; sell, lease, and build houses simultaneously, with the focus on selling houses; actively but prudently promote sales of public houses; and strictly implement the principle for fixing prices defined by the State Council. We will continue to raise public house rent, expedite urban housing construction in coordination with the implementation of the "live-in-peace project," greatly develop economical and practical houses, and promote fund-raising and cooperation in housing construction. We will extensively apply the accumulation fund system to housing construction. We will develop money lending for houses and issue mortgage loans for people to buy houses. [Reporter] Hebei is a large agricultural province, and the issue on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is a basic issue concerning our economic development and modernization drive. How will Hebei further deepen the rural economic reform this year? [Wang Dongjin] To deepen the rural economic reform, we should stabilize the party's basic rural policies and establish more rapidly the systems for the operation and management of the rural economy that meet the needs of the socialist market economy and that aim mainly at cultivating the mainstay of the market, strengthening macroeconomic guidance, intensifying protection of agriculture, and increasing peasants' income. We should stabilize the household-based output-related contract responsibility system and further improve the dual management system that combines unified management with independent management. On the premise that land is owned by the collective, we will conscientiously implement the central stipulation of extending the land contract another 30 years without change. The term of the contracts for reclaiming barren hills, wasteland, sandy land, and beaches for developmental production may be even longer, and inheritance of such contracts and paid transfer of land use rights according to law are permitted. Based on the voluntary participation of the masses, the small number of localities with fairly developed economies may develop the optimal-scale operation through the transfer of contracts or purchases of stocks to improve agricultural labor productivity and land productivity. We should facilitate the development of township enterprises in line with the principle of "providing active support and correct guidance and ensuring their continuous improvement and gradual standardization." We should particularly develop the shareholding cooperation system and innovate their property right system and operating system to further enhance their vigor. After clarifying property rights, we will promote the flow and organization of the essential elements of production between different communities so that a more reasonable enterprise layout will take shape. Meanwhile, we will intensify planning to develop concentrations of township enterprises in certain areas. We will make active efforts to achieve success in the experimental reform to urbanize rural areas to accelerate the progress of the urbanization. We should speed up development of county-level cities, and the counties which possess the scale of a city and the conditions for building themselves into cities should actively apply for abolishment of the counties and establishment of cities. In the meantime, we should make the best use of and renovate the existing small cities and towns and build new ones. We will gradually reform the residence registration management system of small cities and towns and allow peasants to develop industrial work, commercial business, and the tertiary industry in small cities and towns to promote the transfer of surplus rural labor forces. [Reporter] The market economy, in a certain sense, is a legally codified economy. How will Hebei step up establishment of the laws and regulations for the economic reform this year? [Wang Dongjin] We will further establish and improve the laws and regulations compatible with the socialist market economy system, coordinate the policies for reform with those for legislation, and step up establish of the local laws or regulations on standardizing the mainstay of the market, safeguarding the market order, strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, improving social security, and promoting opening to the outside world. We should conscientiously organize the enforcement of relevant laws issued by the state and draw up corresponding methods or detailed principles for their enforcement that are suitable to the provincial conditions. Meanwhile, in view of the continuously deepened reform in Hebei, we will step up establishment of the regulations on the management of private enterprises, shareholding cooperative economies, shareholding enterprises, and property right deals. We will clean up the laws, regulations, and policy documents incompatible with the establishment of the socialist market economy system and do a good job in "abolishing and amending them and formulating new ones." We should strengthen and improve administration of justice, administrative law enforcement, and supervision of law enforcement and resolutely investigate, handle, and correct the failure in abiding by laws, strictly enforcing laws, and investigating law breaches, the abuse of power, and the law breaches committed for benefiting one's own department, locality, and small group. The provincial party committee and government have placed great emphasis on the work to strengthen leadership over reform. Proceeding from the overall interests, all levels and all departments should truly embrace the guiding thought of promoting development through reform and truly concentrate the attention to accelerating development on deepening reform. Governments at all levels should pay close attention to the reform in key areas, carefully organize it, formulate specific plans and implement them meticulously, and study and address in a timely manner the new conditions and new problems emerging in the process of reform.
