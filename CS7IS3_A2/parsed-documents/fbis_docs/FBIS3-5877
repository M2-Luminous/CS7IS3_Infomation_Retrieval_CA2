The two men, confronting each other at an open debate on trade policy, warned that troubled bilateral ties could even get worse before it gets better. "A failure to resolve these issues will result in a U.S.-Japan economic relationship that continues to erode," said Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy. The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, brought Cutter and Kuriyama together for the first public encounter of senior Japanese and U.S. officials since the collapse of bilateral trade talks a month ago. The breakdown of the so-called "framework" trade negotiations, which marred the February 11 summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has prompted Washington to threaten unilateral trade action against Tokyo. Kuriyama said Japan hopes to return to the negotiating table as early as possible but admitted that he has "no idea" on how to resolve the impasse. Cutter offered no fresh initiative either, saying "It is now up to the Government of Japan to begin to indicate a direction." The two men, however, stressed there are no grounds to expect a trade war between the two allies. "There's not a trade war and neither side will intend to have a trade war," Cutter said. Kuriyama readily agreed. "We have too much at stake together. We will both be losers," the envoy said. But the two officials also agreed there is very little trust between two allies when it comes to Japan's commitment to open up its markets and close its huge trade surplus. The Clinton administration, arguing that few of the past 30 or so trade accords have yielded expected results, has demanded that Tokyo set "numerical indicators" by which the U.S. will determine the success or failure of a Japanese commitment. Tokyo has rejected the U.S. demand which, as Kuriyama reiterated Thursday, is likely to turn into a "legally binding commitment and therefore subject to sanctions." Cutter, recalling the predawn session of negotiation that sealed the fate of the trade framework talks in February, quoted Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, the chief Japanese negotiator, as saying, "You don't trust us without numbers. We don't trust you with numbers." The sense of distrust on trade matters between two allies drew demands for tougher U.S. trade actions from U.S. legislators who took part in the two-day trade forum. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who spoke at one session of the trade conference Thursday, said, "A gentle, gradual negotiating process may work with most other countries. But time has taught us that it doesn't work with Japan." Speaking at a later session Thursday, Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate finance subcommittee that handles trade matters, said tougher action -- even sanctions -- is justified because, in his view, Japan resists change without outside pressure. "We will require a policy which understands the unique nature of the Japanese economy. We will need the credibility that only the prospect of sanctions can offer," the Montana Democrat said.
