Only the chief justice would have to be a Chinese national without the right of abode overseas, said senior official Lu Ping. His disclosure drew a mixed response from the legal profession which, along with legislators, rejected the 1991 Sino-British deal on the court which is to replace the Privy Council after 1997. The agreement said the court would consist of five judges in any one sitting the chief justice, three local Judges and one overseas judge. The legal profession believed more than one overseas judge was needed to ensure the court's independence under Chinese rule. Law Society chairman Roderick Woo Bun said last night that he now accepted the "four-to-one" formula. But Simon Ip Sik-on, the lawyers' representative in Legco, said Mr Lu's clarification did not allay his fears. Mr Lu was speaking after meeting the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers formally appointed in Beijing yesterday. Some had raised fears that there might not be enough qualified ethnic Chinese to sit on the court. Mr Lu, the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said: "According to the Basic Law, only the chief justice of the court should be a Chinese citizen without foreign right of abode. "There is no nationality requirement for other judges, not even the requirement of Hong Kong permanent residents." There had been fears that China would propose restrictions on the "local" judges, saying they should be permanent residents of Hong Kong without foreign nationality. But Mr Lu said: "There are (now) no ethnic Chinese sitting on the Court of Appeal. If it is stipulated that only ethnic Chinese can sit on the court, the existing expatriate judges may feel there is no future for them and may take early retirement. This may undermine the retention of talent." He said China had taken into account the shortage of Chinese judges in the territory when drafting the Basic Law provisions. Last night, the Bar Association vice-chairman Gladys Li QC, said although Mr Lu had clarified some uncertainties in the 1991 agreement, the makeup of the court was still unacceptable because it did not allow flexibility. This would deprive the court of the right to choose its own judges, Ms Li said which was inherent in the Joint Declaration. Mr Ip said Mr Lu's comments helped clarify the situation, but would not be enough to win support from legislators. Their concern on the restriction of overseas judges serving each trial had not been addressed, he said. "There is never any doubt in my mind that the three permanent judges need not be Chinese nationals or Hong Kong permanent residents," he said. Senior law lecturer of the University of Hong Kong, Johannes Chan, said the legal sector believed overseas judges should be invited to sit on the court whenever the need arose. "It simply could not work if you had to have all the expatriate judges barred from the court of final appeal. There is not enough expertise among the local legal profession," Mr Chan said. "What we are concerned about is that, when there is a need to bring in overseas judges from other Commonwealth jurisdictions, will we be able to do it flexibly?" Mr Woo said he personally accepted the four-to-one formula after Mr Lu's clarification. Permanent judges from overseas jurisdictions could be appointed and that would enable more expatriate judges to sit in each trial. "It is tantamount to imposing no restrictions on overseas judges," Mr Woo said. The Assistant Director of Administration, Annie Tam Kam-lan, said Mr Lu's remarks were in line with the Government's understanding. A draft bill on setting up the court had been submitted to China, but no response had been received. "As it is a very complex bill, I think it is reasonable to give the Chinese side a considerable amount of time to study it," Ms Tam said. The Government had told China it wanted the court to be set up by mid-1996. A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, said the setting up of the court had been delayed by the lack of initiative from Britain. "The fact is that we have had an agreement ready on the table since 1991 and it is the British side which does not take it seriously."
