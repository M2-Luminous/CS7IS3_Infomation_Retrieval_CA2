Almost with no exception, politicians on the left Sunday [26 Jun] decried the fact that the commission did not blame or penalize the West Bank Jewish settlers. The Meretz Party's Knesset (Israeli Parliament) faction chairman Ran Cohen expressed "deep disappointment in view of the commission's leniency toward the extremist settlers." "The fact that they continue to do as they please in Hebron attests to the failure of this commission," he said. Another Meretz member of Knesset (MK) Dedi Zucker charged that the commission only dealt with the massacre itself and not with the conditions of occupation. It should have reached conclusions about the occupation and the settlers, he said. Mk Abdul Wahab Darawshe from the Democratic Arab Party complained that the commission "was too easy on the settlers, who are the villains here." He said the commission should recommend disarming all the settlers immediately. The commission released its report Sunday, stating that the massacre on February 25 was "premeditated and carried out alone" by Kiryat Arba settler Baruch Goldstein. Goldstein opened fire and killed some 30 Muslim worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque inside the Machpela cave of Hebron. The report criticized the security forces who should have been present inside the cave for failing to be there at the time when the massacre occurred. To upgrade security around the cave, the commission recommended in the report a ban on Jewish settlers and soldiers to enter the site with weapons. It also recommended that security around and in the cave be provided with special guard units. Obviously, the opposition Likud Party and the National Religious Party (NRP), which both advocate expanding settlement in the occupied territories, were pleased Sunday with the report's dealing with the settlers. Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu said he was pleased that the commission cleared the Jewish settlers of the responsibility for the massacre "after they have been so maligned and vilified." The NRP said that the report "totally removes the basis for the unruly incitement against the settlers as a group who were unjustly accused of being guilty collectively for an individual's crime." Jewish settlement leaders Sunday gave a partial sigh of relief over the report. They were satisfied that blame was not placed on the whole settlement community and that the commission did not recommend restricting Jewish worship in the Machpela cave. Zvi Katsover, head of the Kiryat Arba local council, said the report was "much less harsh" than he expected, and said "a weight has been taken off our shoulders." Meanwhile, Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe said he accepted the report's conclusion that Goldstein acted alone, but said he was upset that the report did not mention the atmosphere in which Goldstein committed his crime. "The harassment by settlers continued for months or years before, creating the atmosphere in which Goldstein committed his crime," he said. Peace groups in Israel, which expressed disappointment over the report, have already renewed their calls for the removal of Jewish settlements from Hebron. Among the 80,000 residents in Hebron, 450 are Jewish settlers. Nevertheless, the Israeli cabinet Sunday night accepted the report's conclusions and recommendations. Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has pledged to fully implement the recommendations.
