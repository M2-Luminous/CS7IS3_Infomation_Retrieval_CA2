Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network, News Directorate, Federal District of Mexico, from Insurgent Subcommander Marcos, Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation], mountains of southeastern Chiapas, Mexico. Gentlemen, a few minutes ago I was informed that on Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network's [3 February] evening newscast, a letter from reporter Francisco Rubio, who works for the station, was read. The letter was addressed to the EZLN and explained the events that occurred while he was covering the area under our forces' control. The letter explained the circumstances surrounding the offer to pay members of the EZLN in exchange for their statements. With the approval of the CCRI-CG of the EZLN I hereby state the following: 1. The CCRI of the EZLN is satisfied with the explanation given by reporter Francisco Rubio, hails Mr. Rubio's attitude and that of Azteca's news directorate for broadcasting it, and is pleased that this regrettable misunderstanding has been clarified. 2. The CCRI of the EZLN is lifting its veto on Azteca Television's coverage of the peace and reconciliation talks between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN, with the mediation of Mr. Samuel Ruiz Garcia. 3. The EZLN hereby declares it will grant Azteca Television reporters and envoys, including Mr. Francisco Rubio, accreditation to coverage the event without any problem whatsoever. The EZLN will do all it can to facilitate their journalistic work within the territories under our control. 4. The EZLN hereby declares that if it is possible, it will be glad to meet with reporters from Azteca Television and other news media mentioned in its 29 January 1994 communique. [Signed] Insurgent Subcommander Marcos, 3 February 1994.
