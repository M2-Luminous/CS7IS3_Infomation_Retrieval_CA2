FBIS4-29708 "dreas119_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 North Korea Japan's Bid for UN Council Seat Denounced Japan's Bid for UN Council Seat Denounced SK2006053394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0514 GMT 20 Jun 94 SK2006053394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Sophism of Hypocrite" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign Minister, Koji Kakizawa, claimed that Japan must be a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with veto power and if it got a permanent seat, it would be active to "reflect the view of the Asian region and small nations." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today views his remarks as a sophism of a hypocrite and an obtrusive rigmarole looking down upon Asian countries and small nations. The analyst says: His remarks that Japan will represent the view of the Asian region means that it wants to become "the leader" of Asia. Down through history, Japan has regarded Asia as the target of its aggression and looting. It has considered it to be natural. Such a thinking-pattern has been inherited by the present Japanese Government authorities. In actuality, Japan is seeking the repetition of its past policy of aggression. This is well illustrated by the Japanese Government's position on the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. Japan is watching for a chance of reinvasion, while going ahead with the preparation of "emergency security legislative arrangements" aimed at sending its Armed Forces to the Korean peninsula under the pretext of "countering the fictitious nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Japan's military aggression on Korea will be the first step toward its comeback to Asia for realising its old dream of "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." How can such a country represent the will of the Asian countries? Japan's expression of wish to represent the Asian nations is an insult to the Asian nations and people. The Japanese Government expressed the view that "the use of nuclear weapons is not contrary to the international law," openly favoring the use of nuclear weapons. This indicates that Japan will make no scruple of plunging developing and small nations into a nuclear holocaust to dominate and plunder them. The Japanese reactionaries must give up their impudent ambition and honestly liquidate its past crimes first of all.
