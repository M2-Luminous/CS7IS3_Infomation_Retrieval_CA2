FR941206-0-00157 FR941206-0-00019 D. Generator 90-Day Tanks and Containers Comment: Many commenters disagree with the EPA's decision to apply the proposed air standards to 90-day tanks and containers for the following reasons: (1) The EPA is not authorized under RCRA section 3004(n), or under other provision, to extend the air standards to 90-day tanks and containers; (2) The proposed rule failed to cite authority to extend the requirements to 90-day tanks and containers, in violation of section 553(b)(2) of the Administrative Procedures Act; (3) If the EPA imposes air emission controls on generators, this must be accomplished pursuant to the pre-HSWA authorization process and thus should not become effective in authorized States until enacted and implemented as State law; and (4) Application of air emission control requirements to 90-day tanks and containers impermissibly interferes with manufacturing processes. Response: The EPA disagrees with each of these comments. The provisions of 40 CFR 262.34 (promulgated under the authority of RCRA section 2002, 3001&hyph;3005, and 3007) allow generators to accumulate hazardous waste in tanks and containers for specified time periods without obtaining RCRA permits, provided the generator meets certain conditions. Amending these conditions is a valid exercise of the EPA's authority under RCRA section 3004(n). The intent of including the provisions of 40 CFR 262.34 in the RCRA requirements for hazardous waste generators is to obtain a reasonable balance between the Congress's desire not to interfere with the generator's manufacturing or production processes with the need to provide adequate protection of human health and the environment (45 FR 12730, February 26, 1980). Thus, 40 CFR 262.34 does not provide a hazardous waste generator with a complete exemption from all RCRA requirements. On the contrary, it incorporates most of the relevant tank and container requirements under 40 CFR part 265 and requires compliance with these standards as a condition for maintaining RCRA permit-exempt status [refer to 40 CFR 262.34(a)(1)]. The intent of these provisions is not to exclude 90-day tanks and containers from future technical TSDF requirements. Therefore, it is wholly appropriate for the EPA to update the technical requirements for tanks and containers that serve as the basis for the RCRA permit exemption. The EPA has already done so, for example, when tank standards were amended in 1986. Although 90-day tanks and containers are not required to be permitted under RCRA subtitle C, the EPA rejects the commenters' narrow reading of RCRA section 3004(n) as limiting the EPA's authority to extend the requirements to these units. Section 3004(n) of RCRA requires the EPA to promulgate standards for the control of air emissions from ``hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.'' The EPA does not agree that RCRA section 3004(n) reflects a congressional intend that the EPA regulate air emissions only from permitted and interim-status TSDF and not from 90-day tanks and containers. These tanks and containers are physically identical (i.e., the same types of tanks and containers are used by generators to accumulate and by TSDF owners and operators to store and treat waste). There is no environmental basis for not considering them subject to the section 3004(n) mandate. Such units are, in fact, storing or treating hazardous waste and are subject to numerous standards promulgated under the authority of both RCRA sections 3002 and 3004. The exemption of 90-day tanks and containers from the permitting requirements of RCRA subtitle C is regulatory, not statutory; there is no directive in the RCRA legislation that precludes the EPA from imposing any or all of the TSDF requirements on them. The use of the term ``facility'' in RCRA section 3004(n) can certainly be read to encompass 90-day tanks and containers, given the EPA's flexibility to construe that term (see United Technologies v. EPA, 821 F.2d at 814 (D.C. Cir. 1988) and the fact that 90-day tanks and containers are already subject to the substantive standards for tanks and containers and pose precisely the same potential environmental risks as other tanks and containers holding hazardous waste. In addition, the EPA sees to reason that Congress intended 90-day tanks and containers to be subject to air emission controls at a different time than other tanks and containers (which would be the case if the 90-day units are not regulated pursuant to a HSWA provision).
