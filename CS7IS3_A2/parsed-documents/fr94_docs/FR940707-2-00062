FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann Sibold, Review Manager, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., S.W., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 3rd floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA. 22202 (703) 308&hyph;8033. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces the receipt of a request for cancellation of Atochem's registrations for TBTF products and the Agency's intent to accept these cancellations. In addition, this notice sets forth the Agency's proposal regarding sale, distribution and use of existing stocks of products bearing the affected registration numbers. I. Background TBTF compounds are registered for use in paint formulations as an antifoulant treatment for hulls, outboard motors, and lower drive units of certain types of marine vessels. They are used to inhibit the growth of fouling organisms such as barnacles and algae. Atochem manufactures the technical product, an intermediate formulation, and one end-use product. In October, 1991, under sections 4 and 3(c)2(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, a Data Call-in (DCI) for the data necessary for the reregistration of TBTF was issued to certain registrants of products containing TBTF, including Atochem. Two bridging studies (studies used to justify the use of data developed on one pesticide for another pesticide) and the associated progress reports required by this DCI are now overdue, and Atochem's registrations of TBTF are subject to suspension. II. Receipt of Request and Notice of Intent to Cancel Section 6(f) of FIFRA provides that a pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. FIFRA further provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the Federal Register before acting on the request and provide for a 30&hyph;day comment period. In a letter dated April 21, 1994, Atochem requested voluntary cancellation of its TBTF registrations, EPA registration numbers 5204&hyph;19, 5204&hyph;61, and 5204&hyph;64. EPA proposes to accept these voluntary cancellations, and intends to issue a cancellation order for these product registrations immediately after the close of the comment period. If, during the 30&hyph;day comment period, Atochem chooses to withdraw its request for cancellation, it must submit a request for withdrawal in writing to the address listed above prior to (insert date 30 days after date of publication in the Federal Register ). Should Atochem withdraw its request for cancellation, its affected registrations of TBTF will remain subject to suspension until overdue data requirements are satisfied. The Agency will issue a Notice of Intent to Suspend these registrations as soon as possible after any such withdrawal. III. Existing Stocks Determination In its letter of April 21, 1994, Atochem also requested that EPA allow Atochem a 1&hyph;year timeframe to continue the distribution and sale of existing stocks. The Agency's established policy for determinations concerning existing stocks was published in the Federal Register on June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29362). In that Notice, EPA said that it would permit a registrant to sell and distribute existing stocks for 1 year after the earliest date that the registrant failed to meet an obligation of registration. In addition, persons other than the registrant would generally be permitted to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of the cancelled product until supplies are exhausted. EPA has determined that Atochem has failed to meet an obligation of reregistration of its TBTF products by its failure to meet certain data requirements of the DCI of October, 1991, as follows: ‚ê£ 1Guideline 1Overdue Items 82&hyph;1(a) _ 90&hyph;day rodent feeding study (bridging study) lProgress Report due January, 1993. Final Report due September, 1993 85&hyph;2 _ dermal penetration study (bridging study) lProgress Report due January, 1993. Final Report due September, 1993. EPA has considered the registrant's request for sale and distribution of existing stocks for 1 year. In accordance with EPA's policy on existing stocks, EPA has determined that the 1 year for existing stocks sale, distribution, and use by Atochem or its agents began January 8, 1993, the earliest date that the registrant failed to meet an obligation of reregistration, and expired January 8, 1994. Therefore, Atochem will not be permitted to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks as of the effective date of cancellation. Furthermore, it is Atochem's responsibility as the basic registrant to notifiy any and all supplemental registrants of its product(s) that this Agency action also applies to their supplementally registered products. Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their supplemental registrants. Other dealers and distributors will be permitted to sell and distribute existing stocks of affected Atochem products until stocks are exhausted. End users may use existing stocks until stocks are exhausted. Dated: June 29, 1994. Daniel M. Barolo, Director, Office of Pesticide Programs.
