The analysis made by the PP leadership is that with the results of the European elections, "we are fully justified," and so now "we have greater strength to negotiate with the government, which must listen to us now." As an instance of this, it was made clear at the PP Executive Committee meeting that the government cannot continue the completion of the autonomy map with the transfer of areas of responsibility to various communities "without the PP's taking part in that plan, because the PP's votes are sufficient for it to have to give its opinion on that configuration." Other instances of the matters on which, in the People's Party's opinion, the government will be unable to take decisions without taking it into account are the renewal of the institutions, without changing the majorities necessary for their election, or laws such as those on trade or cable television. In his address to the Executive Committee, Jose Maria Aznar stressed that the PP should be pleased but not euphoric, and that the success achieved "should be used only to be improved on. It is a matter not of resting on our laurels, saying how well we have done to have won, but of seeing where we have failed in order to improve." The PP has therefore set itself the aim of launching an offensive of putting forward specific proposals and drawing up sectorial programs in order to confirm the PP's ability to govern. Aznar set the party to work on this, not allowing it to rest and convening his main colleagues early in the morning, as on every Monday, in the so-called matins. In the afternoon, he convened the Executive Committee, because, as party leadership sources explained, "we have a great deal left to do, and we must be prepared for anything," referring to the possibility that Felipe Gonzalez may soon decide to call an election. Nevertheless, it was not all work at the Executive Committee meeting, which received with loud ovations both the PP chairman and European candidate Abel Matutes and candidate for the Andalusian Junta [autonomous government] Javier Arenas. Heeding the spirit expressed by Aznar, the PP, with the prospect of attaining power in the not too distant future, will begin this very week to put forward specific initiatives on the country's main problems, which in many cases will be a repetition of proposals that have already been put forward but that have not produced a sufficient response among the public or in the political sphere, since the PP has not been viewed as an immediate government alternative. It believes that this will change, "because after what happened Sunday [12 June], they will have to listen to us." Aznar will meet with the parliamentary group Wednesday in order to analyze these initiatives, and Thursday the PP intends to submit a law on government. Next Monday, the PP chairman will convene the Executive Committee, with the intention of presenting an alternative economic blueprint to that of the government, "in order to tackle the economic crisis." The conclusion conveyed by Jose Maria Aznar to the People's Party leaders is that it is the government that "must make a move" with respect to its future, and so a strategy of harassing the government with the possible submission of a censure motion is not being considered for the present; "rather, performing constructive work with respect to society," irrespective of whether or not there are resignations, cabinet reshuffles, or other initiatives that Gonzalez could undertake as a result of the election results. As the same sources explained, the aim is to "to show that we know how to lose and know how to win, and that we are interested not in the country's faring badly but in making the state work," because, they add, "we must not disappoint the Spanish people now."
