FR941219-2-00009 FR941219-2-00004 [A&hyph;122&hyph;050] Racing Plates (Aluminum Horseshoes) From Canada; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration/International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to a request by a respondent, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on racing plates from Canada. The review covers one firm and the period February 1, 1993, through January 31, 1994. We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4195 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 27, 1974 (39 FR 7579), the Department of Treasury published the antidumping finding of racing plates (aluminum horseshoes) from Canada. The Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5390). The respondent, Equine Forgings Limited, requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period February 1, 1993, through January 31, 1994. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11769) for Equine Forgings Limited. The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of racing plates (horseshoes) that are made of aluminum, may have cleats or caulks, and come in a variety of sizes. They are used on race horses, polo, jumping, hunting, and other performing horses, as differentiated from pleasure and work horses. During the review period such merchandise was classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 7616.90.00. This HTS item number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. United States Price In calculating USP, the Department used purchased price, as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, since sales to the first unrelated purchaser were made prior to the date of importation. Purchase price was based on the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, U.S. duty, and brokerage/handling charges. We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in Silicomanganse from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value (59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994). No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. Foreign Market Value In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, since sufficient quantities of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis for comparison. Home market price was based upon the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers in Canada, with appropriate deductions for rebates. We adjusted for Canadian value-added tax in accordance with our decision Silicomanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value (59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994). In accordance with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in The Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Grey Portland Cement v. United States, No. 93&hyph;1239, (January 5, 1994), we no longer deduct home market movement expenses from FMV pursuant to the Department's inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Accordingly, we now adjust for such expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 352.56 and the ESP offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1)(2), as appropriate. As a result, we have not adjusted for Equine Forging's reported home market inland freight as movement expenses. Rather, we have treated Equine Forging's reported post-sale inland freight as a direct selling expense, which we have deducted from FMV.
