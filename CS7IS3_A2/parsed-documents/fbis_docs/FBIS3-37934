In the Opinion of the Member of the State Duma and Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Activity of the Armed Forces, Other Troops and Troop Formations, There Is an Acute Dearth of Professional Military Men Among the Deputies"] [Text] In conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, Yuriy Rodionov stressed that a considerable part of the questions which are examined by the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly require professional knowledge in the sphere of defense. This is particularly true of the Defense Committee. However, in the deputy's words, the State Duma has a shortage of servicemen, that is, of people who know the Army's problems other than by hearsay. It will take time for the defense committee to become really capable of work. Although, according to Yuriy Rodionov, there are "intelligent civilian specialists" on the committee who are seriously intent on getting to grips with the problems of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. Colonel General Rodionov considers the active involvement of servicemen in the campaign for election to the local organs of representative power to be essential. "The situation today is such," he says, "that servicemen themselves are currently the best representatives of their own interests in the organs of power. However, it is essential not to make the wrong choice. The experience of previous election campaigns shows that some candidates based their programs on a conflict with the command and were thus less inclined to get involved in legislative activity, expending their energy on making political statements instead. The experience of service combined with general human qualities is the guarantee that our elected representative will not forget the interests of his voters. As for the legal basis of the serviceman's period as a deputy, Yuriy Rodionov said that a group of deputies have put forward a proposal to introduce amendments to the Law on the Status of the State Duma Deputy. The amendments envisage the secondment of the serviceman deputy for the period of the discharge of his duties as deputy. According to the parliamentarian's proposal, the relevant statute could specify the mechanism for the exercise of that right: the servicemen would be excluded from the roster of a unit (establishment or enterprise) but would remain on the roster of the Armed Forces, in other words they would not be discharged and would retain all their legally enshrined benefits. In that event the rights of servicemen would not be inferior to those of miners, oil workers, and so forth.... At the end of his term as a deputy the serviceman would return to his unit.
