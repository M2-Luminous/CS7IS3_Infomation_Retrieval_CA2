It is to elect the NSF leadership and discuss the organization's immediate tasks. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this today from Ilya Konstantinov, chairman of the NSF Executive Committee. The activities of the organization were suspended following the events of 3-4 October 1993, while Konstantinov himself was arrested. He was released from jail following the amnesty resolution passed by the State Duma. Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent to give his assessment of the Accord for Russia movement, which is being set up with the help of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Konstantinov said it was too early to do this. At this stage the NSF is distancing itself from the movement. Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party, who once actively participated in the activities of the NSF and is now one of the initiators of the creation of the Accord for Russia movement, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that he was still advocating the strengthening of the patriotic movement and the unification of all national-patriotic forces. In his view, this unification is impeded on the one hand, by the policy of the authorities and on the other, by increasing radicalism among nationalist patriots, both left- and right-wing.
