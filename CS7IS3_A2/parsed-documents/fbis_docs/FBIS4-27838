"The United States feels it has been betrayed by North Korea," the official said. Senior officials from the three countries will discuss slapping sanctions on North Korea in talks Friday and Saturday in Washington following Pyongyang's rejection of unimpeded inspections of its nuclear facilities. Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, will attend the meeting. The Japanese Government confirmed Friday that it will firstly call on the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution blaming North Korea and if the United States proposes a resolution seeking economic sanctions against the North, Japan will agree to it, government sources said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a session of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday that without winning China's support the Security Council would not be able to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the international call for inspections. China is one of the five permanent Security Council members and if it exercises its veto power, can knock down any resolution. A U.S. official said one main topic at the meeting will be Washington's request that Tokyo halt remittances to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan, which are believed to be a major source of Foreign Currency for the isolated, economically weak country. If a veto by China prevents a possible U.S.-sponsored resolution from being adopted by the Security Council, the three nations are likely to impose their own sanctions against the North, the sources said. In case the U.N. Security Council cannot reach agreement over the sanctions issue due to anticipated opposition from China, North Korea's traditional ally which favors a soft approach in the nuclear controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation" in multilateral punitive measures, he said. Japan could do its part by halting cash remittances to North Korea from pro-pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan and suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's concern over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands. "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told a news conference. "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert with the countries involved, such as the United States, South Korea and China," he said. Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the nuclear row. On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) informed the U.N. Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to let inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel rods has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. North Korea last month started to exchange without IAEA supervision the 8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, sparking another Security Council statement last week urging compliance with the agency's inspection demands.
