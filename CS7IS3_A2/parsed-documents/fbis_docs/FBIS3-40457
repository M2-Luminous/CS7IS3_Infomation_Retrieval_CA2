FBIS3-40457 "jpjst005__l94007" JPRS-JST-94-005L Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Science & Technology Japan 31 February 1994 Science & Technology Policy/Economic Competitiveness Patent Office Announces New Evaluation Standards 93FE0811F Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jun 93 p 4 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 93FE0811F Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] International Agreement and New Standards for Software and Genetics Targeted On 21 June, the Patent Office announced the revised examination standard for patents which, for the first time, includes guidance on evaluating the novelty of an invention. The objective is to seek international agreement in the application of the patent system. New standards were also set forth concerning ideas on protecting computer software and genetic engineering. The importance of the ``embodiment'' in the interpretation of the claims (scope of the patent) which has been strongly criticized by the United States and European countries, will be revised; patents will be flexibly judged with claims given priority and broad rights will be recognized. This standard will apply to applications dating from 1988. In the guidelines for guaranteeing the fairness and reliability of the examination, the patent examination procedure consists of industry-specific standards and a general standard common to all technical fields. The first standard was developed 30 years ago. The initiation in recent years of trilateral meetings involving Japan, the United States, and Europe had the objective of agreeing on a system, its operation and revision, and accumulating precedents involving patents. This time, this situation is taken into consideration and a full-scale revision was made. The novelty of an invention is decided based on the standard of whether a skilled person having ordinary knowledge of a technical field would easily think of the invention. While in the new standard, the examiner does not reject novelty when the idea of ``easily comes to mind'' based on documents in similar technical fields cannot be demonstrated. As for computer software, the conditions of using natural laws in information processing based on software and the inseparable link with the hardware were clarified. Accordingly, program trading of stocks and game software that simply substitute the brain activity of humans in a computer are not the objects of patents. In addition, an invention of the recording medium that stores a program is not applicable to patents. In contrast, in genetic engineering, the standard prepared concerning the novelty of inventions related to DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that contains specific base sequence that form protein are: (1) When the protein is original and advanced, it is novel. (2) When a protein is known, but the sequence of amino acids is not common knowledge, the sequence of amino acids that forms the protein is not novel if a skilled worker, a person possessing ordinary knowledge of the same technical field, can easily determine the sequence. (3) When the amino acid sequence is common knowledge, if the effect is exceptional for DNA that forms a protein compared to DNA that has another base sequence, the novelty is recognized. Concerning the interpretation of claims, since it is nearly impossible for the applicant to prove the realization of the invention in the section for the detailed explanation of the invention in the specifications by describing every important embodiment, the judgment is not based only on the embodiments, the invention is understood centered on the claims. As a result, even if the embodiment is not described in the section for the detailed explanation of the invention, the completion of the invention by the applicant is recognized from the description of the claims, and rights are granted. In addition to announcing the revised examination standard in a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) report, it has been published by the Invention Society.
