Leonid Makarovych explained his decision as follows: Given that it looks like the elections to the Supreme Council may require a second round [s pervogo zakhoda mogut i ne sostoyatsya], the "handing over of affairs" from the old parliament to the new threatens to drag on until May, and "then all structures would have to switch straight away to the presidential elections." The situation in Ukraine by this time, in Leonid Kravchuk's view, may be severely exacerbated. So is it worth getting bogged down in the presidential elections so soon? A complex situation, Leonid Kravchuk continued, can be rationalized, but to agree to participate in the elections would mean defending "that position -- economic and social -- which exists today." That is, trying to prove that it is normal. And, of course, those who run for the post of president will make every effort to prove that "I failed in my duties. I would then provide them with much room for political maneuver and all kinds of accusations." In answer to a question from "Liberty" journalists on whether it is possible that he is simply afraid of domestic strife, Leonid Kravchuk replied: "I am not afraid...." He added: "In principle, the concept of fear does not concern me as an individual." It is, indeed, possible to agree with Leonid Makarovych's final point. His decision was most probably dictated not by fear, but by calculation. The number of battles he had to withstand last year when the miners were demanding a referendum on confidence in the president are still fresh in the memory. At that time Leonid Makarovych made considerable efforts, and even agreed to early elections -- provided that there was no referendum. The situation now is such that Kravchuk may not receive a vote of confidence at the upcoming elections. And does he really want to suffer "ignominious defeat" -- he who only recently proudly boasted that he had been party to the collapse of the Soviet Union? Especially as one of the "Belovezhskiy old guard" -- Stanislav Shushkevich -- has been ousted from office by the Belarusian Parliament. Nor, as some independent politicians and mass media sources assert, is Boris Yeltsin's position particularly firm. Here again, Leonid Makarovych has obviously weighed things up: It is better to jump from that runaway train by the name of "Ukraine" of one's own volition, than to fail at the presidential elections. However, it is for Leonid Kravchuk to decide his own fate. It is only a pity that after such ardent words about respect for the people of Ukraine, the sovereignty of the people, and love for Ukraine, that the people themselves and Ukraine should have to learn of the president's decision from Radio "Liberty"....
