FR940516-1-00086 FR940516-1-00006 The scope of this rule would encompass a broad range of small SI engine applications, including farm and construction equipment, which individual states are preempted from regulating under section 209(e)(1) of the CAA. Exclusions from the rule are detailed below. Under this proposal, exhaust emissions from new small SI engines could not exceed levels for a given engine class as listed in Table 1. Engine classes would be specified both by engine displacement, as measured in cubic centimeters (cc), and by the type of equipment the engine powered_either handheld or nonhandheld. Five engine classes are being proposed today. Each has a unique set of emission standards. Nonhandheld engine classes would be: Class I_engines less than 225 cc in displacement; and Class II_engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in displacement. Engines powering equipment defined as handheld would be classified as Class III, IV, or V: Class III_engines less than 20 cc in displacement; Class IV_engines equal to or greater than 20 cc and less than 50 cc in displacement; and Class V_engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in displacement. Emission standards being proposed today are considered Phase 1 new small SI engine standards.

A ``vessel'' includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water. 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). (2) Engines used in underground mining or engines used in underground mining equipment and regulated by the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MHSA). See 30 CFR parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. (3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86, subpart E. (4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a). (5) Engines used in recreational vehicles, which are defined as engines which have no installed speed governor and which have a rated speed of greater than or equal to 5,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Engines used in recreational vehicles are not used to propel marine vessels and do not meet the criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine under this rule. This rule proposes the following regulatory scheme: •Designation of product lines into groups of engines with similar emission characteristics (such groups are called engine families), •Manufacturer emission testing of selected engines with a specified test procedure to demonstrate compliance with new engine emission standards, •Labeling of engines, and alternatively, equipment labeling if the engine label becomes obscured when placed in the equipment, •Submission of an application for certification for each engine family, •Inclusion of various certification requirements such as the prohibition of defeat devices, •Issuance of an emission certificate of conformity for each engine family, •Prohibition against offering for sale in the United States engines not certified by EPA, •Requirement that equipment manufacturers use the appropriate handheld or nonhandheld certified engine in their equipment, •Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, •EPA Administrator testing provisions, •Design warranty provisions and prohibition on tampering,
