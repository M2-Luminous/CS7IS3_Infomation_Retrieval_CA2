This was stated by German Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt at a meeting organised by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Indo-German Chamber of Commerce here on Wednesday. The German Minister's statement assumes significance in the wake of US' attempt to bring in human rights issues in GATT negotiations. The German Minister made it clear that his country was committed to free and unrestricted trade. Rexrodt, who is accompanied by a high-level business delegation from Germany to attend the 11th Indo German Joint Commission meeting, said his country will not use non-tariff and noneconomic issues in trade negotiations, he said. "This is the stand we have taken in the Uruguay Round of negotiations," he said. Indian industry is fearing that some developed countries may block exports from India by creating non-tariff hurdles such as human rights. "Germany never boycotts goods from other countries on the pretext of non-economic issues," Rexrodt said in response to a specific query. "Indian goods as well as Indian businessmen are welcome in our country," he said. Referring to the pending bilateral accord between India and Germany on civil aviation, he said the "delay" was because the countries were sending "wrong signals." "I must say the administrative process in India is complicated and takes a long time to finalise," he remarked adding that Germany attached importance to this bilateral accord on air transportation and regretted the delay. Admitting that some countries had raised such non-economic and non-tariff issues in GATT negotiations, he said Germany was of the firm view that such issues should not be brought in trade negotiations. Rexrodt said Germany was also against "social dumping" as different countries had different social standards.
