"No other country received so much high-tech in such a short period of time, and no other country is spending so much on the modernization of its industry and its agricultural sector as China," State Councillor Song Jian, chairman of the Commission for Science and Technology, has said in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. The result of this development is that the PRC will assume an internationally leading position within a few years in important spheres such as biochemistry, the microchip, electronics, and computer industry, but also in the agricultural sector, and that it might become a challenger to Europe, Japan, and even the United States. Song pointed out that China was spending more than $100 billion per year on buying technology. In addition, in 1993 the country was promised almost the same amount in investments from other countries. The process of modernization is speeded up through the reform of the entire sphere of the economy and technology. Song: "The walls in the universities are being brought down just like the Berlin Wall." Chinese institutes and universities have now been advised to operate on commercial principles and to broadly take care of their own funding. "Almost all research institutes in China are now guided by market economy principles. Subsidies have been cut by 70 percent. We are encouraging the institutes and scientists to set up companies of their own. The commercialization and the practical use of research results are fully under way," Song said. This restructuring process should be concluded no later than 1995. The university district in the Beijing suburb of Zhongguan Cun has already become a huge shopping center for electronics. The new entrepreneurs and shop-owners come straight from the universities. The research commission and Beijing University founded numerous risk capital funds to lend financial support to professors and students who "have put out into the sea of the market economy." By the end of the century China will be able to compete with Taiwan and South Korea at international markets with its micro- electronics products. China has made offers to Japan for cooperation in the sector of microchips and electronics but Japanese companies have reacted with "careful modesty." Nevertheless, China does not have any difficulties regarding the transfer of technology. "We can now shop everywhere in the world; there are practically no longer any Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] controls," Song said. Still, the United States rejected China's long shopping list and is hesitating to cooperate particularly in the sphere of space and satellites. "Thus the Americans are harming themselves, because we have turned to the Germans, who would like to do business with us," Song said. This refers in particular to satellite technology. Here, cooperation has been initiated with the Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm company. For its space program, China needs large solar collectors, altitude control systems, and high-tension transistors. China will buy these systems in Germany. Regarding the state of development of China's rocket technology, Song said that, apart from defensive aspects, China was pursuing two objectives with its rocket program. On the one hand, it wants to take into space "several dozens" of communication and data link satellites with Chinese carrier systems. Systems should be launched from other -- geographically more convenient -- places in the world, too. One was seeking cooperation with Brazil in this connection. China is able to carry satellites more cheaply than the Americans and Europeans. The costs for one launching operation are only $50- 60 million. On the other hand, there is also the wish to pursue independent space research and send manned rockets into space. This is why larger rockets were being built with a higher payload. China was not trying to compete with the Americans and Russians but was pursuing this program out of "its own interest." "In the sphere of science we already have a leading international position in the area of biochemistry, even though we are not always able to put our research results to practical use. As far as product marketing is concerned, we are still ineffective," Song said. He predicted that, in no later than three to five years, China will take the lead in the area of biotechnology. Tens of thousands of young scientists are working in this sector without the restrictions western scientists have to struggle with in the sphere of gene technology. In the area of computers and software China also aspired to a leading international role. The state councillor pointed out that a subsidiary of Beijing University had already achieved 1 billion renminbi (DM280 million) [German marks] in sales and took a leading position for the development of the software for China's publishing branch. Publishing houses in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were using the software developed in Beijing, and countries such as Singapore were enticing away Chinese professors and researchers. The state councillor, who used to teach at Harvard, pointed to the large number (more than 100,000) of Chinese students in the United States, Europe, and Japan. "Our students now enjoy full freedom of movement: Those who return can shop at the free labor market and leave the country again any time and without any restrictions, Song said. Legal System Still Inadequate Apart from the positive balance in the sphere of research and science, Song did not hesitate to say what some of the problems were. China's legal system was still inadequate. He complained that "we have so many new laws but they are not applied." Moreover, the sector of state industry was like a millstone around the neck of the country's reforms and slowing them down. For the first time, Song outlined details about the planned management reform in the state concerns. Song announced that one was planning to introduce the German system of boards of managers and supervisors in major state enterprises. These bodies should be able to decide independently of the state and carry out mutual controls. "We have studied the German system and want to introduce it here." The state councillor spoke about progress in the agricultural sector. The introduction of new technologies, such as in the sphere of poultry farming and cattle breeding, but also in the area of fishery have produced spectacular success. "In 1993 the weather was not good for Chinese agriculture. Nevertheless, production went up and we introduced a number of new products." In the next century, China's population would soon rise to 1.5 billion. "We will have no problem in feeding these masses," Song said. China would even become an "important competitor" at international markets for horticultural products, fruits, rice, sugar, fishery products, and even certain kinds of grains.
