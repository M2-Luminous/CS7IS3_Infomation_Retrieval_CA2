PBC Deputy Governor Zhou Zhengqing told the Eighth Session of the NPC Standing Committee, which opened today, that "it is an important law for China's current reform of its monetary system." The PBC is given the legal status in the draft of being the country's central bank. Under the direct leadership of the State Council, it is entitled to issue currency and oversee the nation's monetary organizations. "The PBC, under the leadership of the State Council, formulates and implements monetary policies independently and in accordance with the law, and supervises and manages the national finance industry free from interference from any other administrative department, local government, social organization or individual," the draft law says. The PBC possesses capital and property, and is allowed to operate businesses in accordance with the law. It enjoys civil rights and has to fulfill civil duties, according to the draft. The draft law determines that the PBC monetary policies should aim at stabilizing the value of the national currency, and shore up national industrial policies and development schemes on the basis of the stable value of renminbi. It provides six indirect macro-control measures the PBC can make use of to reach its monetary goals. They include setting the benchmark interest rates for the central bank, loaning to national commercial banks, buying or selling state bonds or foreign currencies, demanding financial institutes to pay in reserves for deposits, and providing re-discount for the financial institutes with accounts in the central bank. Zhou said, "these powers will suffice for the central bank to control and adjust the currency supply and credit volume based on the needs of national economic development, and guarantee the overall balance of supply and demand." The PBC will no longer extend credit to or receive deposits from non-financial organizations or individuals, the draft provides. In addition, the draft law designates renminbi as the only legal currency in the country, and it is issued only by the PBC. The draft prohibits faking or intentionally destroying the currency. The draft law provides in principle that the PBC is empowered to ratify financial organizations, verify and inspect these organizations and their business operations, and punish those who violate financial laws and regulations. "The supervision and control of the financial industry is necessary because financial organizations deal in special goods, i.e. money, and this has a great impact on the country's social and economic development," he said. The draft, containing eight chapters and 46 clauses, also specifies the internal structure of the PBC. According to Zhou, the law has been in preparation for 15 years.
