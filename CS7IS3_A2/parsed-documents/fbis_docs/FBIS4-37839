They indicated that the residents of the al-Dali' District, who have offered convoys of martyrs and heroic strugglers to obtain freedom and achieve independence, are willing to make dear sacrifices to safeguard and strengthen Yemeni unity. They will also, they noted, lend their wholehearted support for unity and legitimacy in continuation of the struggles waged by the residents of the al-Dali' District throughout their national struggle. The al-Dali' District representatives reaffirmed their readiness to make dear sacrifices to safeguard unity and confront its enemies, whoever they may be. They noted that our Yemeni people cannot survive without unity, which is our people's fate and destiny. Similarly, there can be no future for our Yemeni people without unity. They asserted that the traitorous and agent rebels only represent their treacherous psyches. Their objectives will never be achieved, they said. Our people, and their Armed Forces will repulse their schemes, which are hostile to the people and their unity. The al-Dali' District representatives affirmed that unity ended the fragmentation nightmare, as well as the tyrannical party rule. They explained that the attempts to rehabilitate fragmentation, regardless of the form this might take, and of the person who might attempt this, is a betrayal of the people's aspirations and struggles, and also of the sacrifices made by their righteous martyrs. They added that the sons of the 26 September revolution and the 14 October revolution, and the strugglers of the liberation war will be loyal to the principles upheld by our people and their Armed Forces, chief among which are the revolution and unity. They also noted the deceptive propaganda promoted by the rebellious secessionists and the erroneous misrepresentation of facts to citizens to delude the public. They mentioned the torture and oppression being perpetrated by the traitorous rebels against the innocent residents of Aden, who are being used as human shields, who are being forced to bear arms, and who are also being forcibly sent to death. They urged their misled brothers and sons not to allow themselves to be taken in by the propaganda of the rebellious secessionists, and to quickly rejoin the forces of unity and legitimacy, where they normally belong. By so doing, they will take advantage of the general amnesty. Moreover, they will also help end the bloodletting in Yemen and defeat the schemes that aim to end unity and destroy the homeland. The Presidential Council chairman then spoke, welcoming the brother ulema, men of religion, social figures, and party leaders of al-Dali' District. He pointed out that the brotherly meeting came after a tragedy befell the homeland as a result of the conspiracies and after the agents rebelling against legitimacy decided to ignite sedition due to their conspiratorial system, which they have inherited and on which they have been brought up in return for a handful of desecrated money. These sides, he said, worked to escalate the military situation in Abyan, 'Imaran, Dhamar, Aden, and al-Dali' as part of a hellish plan to disrupt the homeland. The brother president said: We talked about that plan, which began after the traitor and secessionist agent, al-Bid, returned from abroad and after he received the price of secession and the blood of the sons of the homeland. Traitor al-Bid, he added, actually began his plan through the resounding speeches he delivered in al-Dali' District to ignite sedition, whose price he had received. The brother president said: Al-Bid and his supporters, like the traitors al-'Attas, Bin-Husaynun, al-Sayli, and al-Jifri, have deposited the money they received at European banks. These people have received the price of the Yemeni's people's blood and ignited sedition in the homeland to disrupt it. He pointed out that these traitors tried exercising a media disinformation campaign to win the feelings of the masses, only for a short time though, because the people discovered their nature and that of the slogans the traitor al-Bid used to repeat, like the civilized project, which means to these traitorous agents destruction, death, secession, and stirring up sectarian differences in the name of Qahtani, 'Adnani, Zaidite, Shafi'ite, southerner, northerner, and other sectarian differences. The brother president said the traitor al-Bid has been lying to the people because he is skilled at lying, he is psychologically ill, he suffers from an inferiority complex, and he is known for his conspiracies against Qahtan al-Sha'bi, Faysal 'Abd-al-Latif al-Sha'bi, the diplomats, 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il, 'Ali 'Antar, 'Ali Hadi Sha'i, Salih Muslih, and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. If he finds no one against whom he can conspire, he conspires against himself. The brother president said: This is not a vilification, but it is the truth. Our Yemeni people are paying the price in blood and in destruction for what the terrorist rebels have spread in the homeland. The brother president also said that during the crisis, he informed several people in the Districts of al-Dali', Radfan, and Yafi' that al-Bid would carry out his secessionist plan, that their sons would become fuel for that plan as they are fighters, and that al-Bid would be the first to escape. We, he added, also advised Haytham when he was still defense minister not to be drawn into the secessionist plan and to support unity, but, regrettably, he was drawn into that plan in return for money. These people did not remember the martyrs' of the revolution and martyr strugglers 'Ali 'Antar, Salih Muslih, Sha'i' Hadi, 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il, and others, who were staunch advocates of unity. The brother president added: The traitorous agent secessionists created sedition in the homeland. We have not sought to see a single drop of blood shed in Yemen, neither by those who are supporting unity and legitimacy, nor by those opposed to them, who, in the final analysis, are our sons. To avert this, we have attempted dialogue. We have gone to Jordan and signed a pledge and accord document there to end the crisis and spare our country all problems. Nonetheless, the rebels were bent on causing a flare-up in the situation in implementation of their secessionist plan, which is eventually targeted against the Hadramaut Governorate. The brother president went on to say: The al-Dali' residents have always been at the forefront of strugglers, who upheld the slogan of unity, because they believe that their pride and honor are ensured when there is unity. The blood being shed right now is meant to safeguard unity and legitimacy. And here our people have lost men and property. Would the result then be fragmentation? Would the result be the division of the country into two Yemens just to gratify the desires of a few people who have received a price for the crisis, infighting, and secession, and who will eventually flee the homeland to use their money after having caused fires in the homeland? The brother president said: We thank the brother residents of the al-Dali' District. We highly appreciate their cooperation with the forces of unity and legitimacy. We also thank the fighters hailing from the al-Dali' District, who are currently waging an honorable battle in defense of unity, and who are making sacrifices to safeguard unity, as they made sacrifices to vindicate the revolution and achieve independence in the past. All, people and parties, are currently melting in the crucible of the homeland and forming a broad front in the face of the traitorous and rebellious secessionists. The brother president added: Today, we reiterate the call for the brothers who have been misled into fighting on the side of falsehood to take advantage of the opportunity granted them by the general amnesty to rid themselves of the coma they are suffering due to media deception and propaganda so that they may rejoin the ranks of the strugglers vindicating unity and legitimacy, where they actually belong. They should not agree to become tools of destruction manipulated by the traitors, agents, and mercenaries, who have sold themselves to the enemies of unity in return for a handful of filthy money. The brother president stressed that the military personnel and civilians who choose to rejoin the ranks of unity and legitimacy will obtain all their rights, on an equal footing with their colleagues at all departments. They will be welcomed and accorded due attention. This would be an honor for them. Additionally, this would halt the bloodletting and vindicate their people's will, which has always been in favor of unity, because it is the epitome of their pride and dignity. The brother president indicated that a government committee has been formed to account for the losses in human lives and property, and to take the necessary measures to rebuild what has been destroyed due to this sedition caused by the rebels. He added: We have instructed that all people be dealt with on an equal footing, regardless of whether they supported the state and legitimacy or were misled. This is because they all are our sons. The brother president affirmed that the traitorous rebels have conspired against the Yemeni Socialist Party to liquidate it and marginalize its role. And here, the picture is unfolding before your very eyes. And now you see the traitor al-Jifri, and the sultans, whose ouster was sought by the 26 September and 14 October armies and strugglers of the liberation war, returning to implement a plan to tear the homeland apart. He added: This will never happen, for the Yemeni people, their Armed Forces, and their security troops will lie in wait for these traitors and mercenaries, regardless of the sacrifices entailed. Concluding his speech, the brother president said: We welcome you once again, and clasp your hands as unity-oriented strugglers. You must do your best to explain the facts and repulse the traitorous secessionists. As for the future, God willing, it will bring prosperity to our Yemeni homeland under the canopy of unity and democracy.
