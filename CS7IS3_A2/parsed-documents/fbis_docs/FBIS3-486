He said that the peninsula, including its eastern part of (?Zabari), had been part of Nigerian territory since 1914 and will remain so. Speaking on a Voice of Nigeria interview, Brig. Gen. Chijuka said the territory which Cameroonians are also claiming, was handed over to Nigeria at independence by the British who themselves had controlled the area since their 1914 agreement with the French. He said that because of its brotherly attitude towards its neighbors, Nigeria has consistently refused to be provoked by the incessant crossborder harassments by Cameroon, some of which had resulted in the loss of Nigerian lives. The defense information director said Cameroon had not reciprocated Nigeria's good neighborliness and so Nigeria now had a prime objective to assert its presence in the peninsula and make all know that the area belongs to it.
