The company has acquired a leading motor distribution and service company, formed a joint venture to promote sales of consumer goods in central China, and established a wholly-owned investment holding company. Paul M.F. Cheng, chairman of Inchcape Pacific, said yesterday at a press conference on the establishment of the three new enterprises that China is the number one development priority for the Inchcape Group worldwide, and these latest moves in Nanjing will help accelerate the growth of the company's business in China over the next few years. He noted that Nanjing is an important market in its own right. It is the capital of Jiangsu Province, which has a population of 69 million people, bigger than Great Britain or France. Together with Shanghai and Hangzhou, Nanjing forms a strategic hub for Inchcape Pacific's further development in the Chang Jiang River basin and deeper into central China. The Inchcape Group operates in over 80 countries. It focuses on three main areas: motors, marketing and services.
