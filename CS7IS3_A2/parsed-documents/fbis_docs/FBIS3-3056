Figures from China's customs office show that so far, the total exports this year have jumped by 13.6 percent to 10.43 billion U.S. dollars while gross imports represented an increase of 20.5 percent to 11.67 billion U.S. dollars. In the first two months, the general export trade reported a rise of 16.3 percent, and exports for the processing industry maintained a steady increase of 15.7 percent, hitting 5.17 billion U.S. dollars, while exports through bartering and border trade were reduced by about 41 percent. The figures also show that exports of primary products tended to go up with an increase of 24.4 percent, despite a sweeping export reduction of petroleum and petroleum products. Exports for industrial end-products continued to rise apace, with electro-mechanical products, textiles, garments and chemical products surging by 10 percent, and steel and non-ferrous metal starting to pick up. The total exports for foreign-funded companies jumped by 44.4 percent to 3.16 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 30 percent of the country's total. The exports of other ventures rose by a modest 4 percent, totaling 7.27 billion U.S. dollars. The main influence on hefty imports came from foreign-financed firms, whose total imports for equipment accounted for one-fifth of the country's total. Another factor was the booming processing industry, whose imports for raw materials and machine parts in the first two months this year accounted for 35.7 percent of the country's total. The main goods imported by a wide margin in this period include machinery, plastics, petroleum and petroleum products, ships, paper and metal products. The imports of steel, autos and other staples including grain and flour, fertilizer, airplanes, copper, aluminum and lumber saw very small increases or were cut slightly.
