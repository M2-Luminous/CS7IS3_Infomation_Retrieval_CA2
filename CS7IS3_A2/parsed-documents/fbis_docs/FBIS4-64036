In his opinion, the Ukrainian delegation "displayed enough flexibility and readiness to compromise." The Ukrainian side, he noted, offered five draft accords to choose from. At the same time, Tarasyuk described the latest round of talks in Moscow as "very useful." "The shaping-up breakthrough justifies the delay with signing a document," he said. In his words, Ukrainian and Russian experts are given ten days to agree on terms to divide the Black Sea Fleet and to set aside bases for the Russian Navy in Ukraine. He reported that the negotiation partners had reaffirmed the outcome of the previous talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division and "agreed approaches to the crucial issues" on Russian naval facilities. At the same, in his words, "one cannot talk of the complete absence of differences, which is natural since the interests of the two states are at stake."
