The high-level talks would have to completely resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute including special inspection of suspected facilities yet to be opened to the IAEA, they agreed. This would entail a "comprehensive" solution to the problem, with full-scale nuclear inspections allowed by Pyongyang in exchange for permanent suspension of the South Korean-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" and improvement in North Korean-U.S. relations. Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. officials confirmed there was no change in requirements for the high-level talks -- satisfactory nuclear inspections by the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) in North Korea and substantial progress in inter-Korean talks such as an exchange of presidential envoys. Han is carrying a personal letter from President Kim Yong-sam which will be delivered when the foreign minister meets President Bill Clinton on Friday, just before his departure for Seoul. While stating that the Seoul-Washington agreement reached at last November's summit calls for a "thorough and broad" approach to solving the North Korean nuclear problem, President Kim is said to have reiterated that the two Koreas must exchange envoys before the North Korea-U.S. meeting. "The two countries concluded that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections has allowed efforts to continue to solve the problem through dialogue," said Director-General for American Affairs Chang Chae-yong, accompanying Han in the United States. "We concluded that our strategy of dialogue pursued under close consultations between South Korea and the United States is leading in the right direction," He said after Han's talks with U.S. Assistant Secretaries Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis. Pyongyang ended a lengthy stalemate Tuesday when it announced it would accept IAEA inspection of all of its seven declared sites. An IAEA inspection team is expected to arrive in North Korea early next week and start two to three weeks of checks on whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear material since the last inspection a year ago. Han meets U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor later in the day to discuss bilateral economic issues and South Korea's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He delivers a keynote speech at the opening of the South Korea-U.S. 21st Century Council on Friday morning before leaving for Seoul.
