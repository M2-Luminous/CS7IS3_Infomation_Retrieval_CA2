These Arab nationals were working with NGO's [non- governmental organizations] involved in the welfare and rehabilitation of the displaced Afghans. Most of these people, stationed in Peshawar and engaged in relief and rehabilitation activities were asked by the government to leave the country by January 31. However, even after the expiry of January 31 deadline the government knows nothing about their whereabouts. Out of these 200 around 150 are Egyptian nationals, 40 Tunisians and 8 from Algeria, says a report prepared by the Federal Government. The Egyptian authorities are convinced that the assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak was sponsored by the Egyptian dissidents residing in Pakistan. President Mubarak had personally conveyed this concern to former Prime Minister, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. The then Pakistani PM had explained that his country had nothing to do with the terrorists and would extradite the Arab nationals from its soil. "It is presumed that these people had left the country, says a high level government official in Islamabad. But to which country they have gone the government is not sure. The Government of Pakistan, the officials said, was very clear on the subject. Since the Afghan Jehad has ended all the foreign nationals involved in the activity must leave the country, the official said. "There will be no visa extension for them and those granted extensions should consider them void," said the officials. The government he said was determined to clear itself of the allegations that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorist activities. The Pakistani soil would not be allowed for any activities against any other state against any other state, he said. Following the cancellation of visas of these Arab nationals, several reminders were sent to the NWFP government asking for report on the implementation of the federal government's directive for the extradition of the Arab nationals. The provincial government, however, had so far failed to reply to any of these directives. The officials were of the view that the government of Pakistan had no desire to keep such people in the country as they could be dangerous for the country's security too." However, the Government of Pakistan cannot hand over the culprits to the Governments of Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. Pakistan is making efforts to hammer out extradition treaties with at least three of the Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The signing of the treaties will facilitate exchange of criminals. Officials, however, could not confirm that Pakistan, during 1993, had extradited 3,000 Arab nationals as stated by Federal Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider.
