However, the second congress of commodity producers of the country, which was held in Krasnoyarsk, did more than just confirm it. Read the article on page 2. It appeared that it would be difficult for delegates to the congress to avoid the temptation of getting embroiled in political battles there. The situation in the country has become too complicated, too "hot." However, the following appeal came in the very first words spoken by Yu. Skokov, chairman of the organizational committee for conducting the congress, which was attended by representatives from 41 regions of Russia and eight federation-wide delegations: Enough of finding out who is "Red" in the audience and in the country, and who is not quite "Red," and of finding out what should be demanded first of all from the powers that be. Russia has come to the point beyond which there may only lie a national catastrophe. The domestic production of commodities is the last stronghold, the last bastion of the state. Before the congress, documents were handed out to the delegates, of which one deserves the closest attention. It is "The State of the Economy of Russia (Analysis and Projection)" prepared by the analysts of the Federation of Public Associations of Commodity Producers of the country. It differed greatly from government assessments which have been voiced recently. For example, the decline in production in the year now ending has exceeded the planned level by more than a factor of two, and has been only slightly smaller than that of last year. Investment in the production assets, which had been weakened to begin with, continued to decline. Millions of people live below the poverty line. Specialist-analysts estimate that this year alone, $12 billion-$15 billion have been taken out of the country both legally and illegally. A paradoxical situation occurs: on the one hand, the stabilization of exports has been registered, with imports falling by a factor of two; the positive balance of foreign trade may reach $23 billion. On the other hand, the foreign debt of Russia continues to grow: Russia is not in a position to discharge even the reduced debt payments (reduced by agreement with Western creditors). Yu. Skokov built on this analysis in his report at the congress: "Against the background of steady cutbacks in production in virtually all sectors, zones have emerged in which the slump has become particularly threatening. For example, the reduction comes to about 50 percent in electrical engineering, instrument making, machine-tool production, and light industry. It is not reforms in the economy that are under way, but rather the destruction of national commodity production. However, the state and society must understand that by destroying the domestic commodity producer, they are destroying themselves." Similar assessments, even more sharply worded than Skokov's, were voiced in presentations "from the field" made by the largest industrialists of the country: managers of the standard-bearing enterprises of the domestic machine building, metallurgy, and the mining industry.... "I have rubbed shoulders with all reformers in Russia, up to the president of the country. I queried everywhere: Are we moving on the course that we want? However, all I heard in response was: There is no alternative to the program of reforms being implemented. To what program, who has seen it? Chubays came to us in Omsk, and also said: Is this not stabilization--credit is not being taken out at banks, there are no lines in stores, the exchange rate of the dollar is not changing.... However, the best stabilization is when everything is at the zero mark--both consumption and production. This only happens at a cemetery." (This is from a presentation by a representative of the Omsk delegation). This is an excerpt from another presentation, that by a representative of commodity producers from Yekaterinburg, the native city of the Russian president: "We are being deliberately and very expertly destroyed. I recently met Gaydar in Cheboksary. He was surprised: How come, are you still in operation? I thought that you had shut down already.... They, the present-day reformers, indeed miscalculated: they did not take into account the survivability of the director community, its ability to resist the deindustrialization of the country. Could it be that the time has really come for us to `help' the government? For example, if the volume of production at an enterprise falls 50 percent, half the people are thrown out into the street. Let them appeal to the reformers then rather than to us, and complain about a drop in the standard of living and delays in the payment of wages...." A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, stressed in his presentation to the congress in particular: "The fact of fragmentation of the industrialists of the country, their splintering based on narrow corporate interests, deserves to be condemned. Here is Gaydar creating his association of private business which, for example, such domestic giants as the Uralmash also joined. Why? Who would not sell out for easy credit, for weighty sops from the boss? There is the notorious Shumeyko, organizing his so-called confederation of entrepreneurs of Russia, which nobody in the Russian `backwaters' has got the foggiest notion about. Apparently, it was also organized so that the branch of this confederation in the United States could be headed by people who are not strangers to Shumeyko--his daughter and son-in-law. Gentlemen reformers, are you not something else? Meanwhile, here we are wondering and wracking our brains over this issue: How come the confused Russian people voted for Zhirinovskiy? As always, we are looking for `scapegoats'--the press, television, the absence of funds.... Who were the people to vote for? One may have his hopes dashed, one may engage in wishful thinking, finally, one may believe in yet another vain dream. Nobody has ever succeeded in deceiving 100 million people all at once--ever!" I sat in the overcrowded auditorium of the Palace of Culture of the metallurgical plant, in which the congress was held, and could not help thinking: Who needed this--the destruction and the virtual bringing to its knees of the domestic economy? Just the way it was seven and a half decades ago. At that time, Russia was also getting on its feet and growing stronger every year--there were Putilov's enterprises, Morozov's textile mills, and Tereshchenko's plants.... The Russian people have built all kinds of things, having received the desired sip of freedom! Was this not the foundation upon which it was possible to move ahead quickly, turning the country into a truly prosperous region? I would be less than truthful if I maintained that the entire two days of the proceedings of the congress in Krasnoyarsk were devoted solely to the assessment and analysis of the situation that has emerged in domestic commodity production. A proposal was made in virtually each presentation at the congress: What should be done in order to save the economy from ultimate destruction, in order to save Russia? Speaking at the congress, Arkadiy Volskiy responded to a question with another question: "What did Roosevelt begin with when he came to power? He immediately closed down all banks that existed in the country. Only one-third of them were reopened as long as two weeks later after auditing. Incidentally, they operate in the United States to this day." In Volskiy's opinion, the industrialists of the country need their own political organization; the last election proved this. Russia should be led by people who have a vested interest in its prosperity. However, there were other "points of view": For example, in the opinion of A. Stepanov, chief of the Teplovodokanal administration of the Vorkutaugol production association, the creation of such a party is an issue for the remote future. Right now they should immediately embark on utilizing the potential of deputies elected to the State Duma. To be sure, this will not be easy to do. There were other opinions, which on certain points even mutually refuted one another. However, the delegates were unanimous on one point: a force capable of uniting all who are interested in the genuine rather than illusory rebirth of the Motherland should finally appear in Russia. The Federation of Public Associations of Commodity Producers of Russia, which was finally legally constituted in Krasnoyarsk, should become such a force. Yu. Skokov was elected its first chairman. Commodity producers have gotten the long-awaited opportunity, just as in all states of the world, not just to assess the processes under way in the country, but to influence the development of an economic policy and the determination of strategy and tactics of domestic commodity production. This will be facilitated by the revised statute of the federation and the Declaration of Rights of Russia's Commodity Producers, adopted at the congress, as well as the mood in which the delegates went home. A telegram addressed to the president and prime minister of the country, in which the delegates demanded the suspension of the effect of the Edict on the Taxation of Legal Entities on 1 January, became the first "harbinger" of collective actions. Otherwise, it will only be possible to refer to industrial production in Russia in the past tense. After the congress, I asked the first chairman of the federation: Is he satisfied with membership in the federation being for now structured on an utterly voluntary basis? If one wants to, one belongs to the federation, and if not, there is no helping it.... For example, in Japan or Germany nobody will engage in business unless he joins the league of entrepreneurs. The law would not let them.... Yuriy Vladimirovich responded: "We are already moving in this direction. We have invited the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation to become one of the founders. In the already mentioned Germany, it is precisely a similar chamber that issues entrepreneur licenses. If we fail to revive the production of goods in the immediate future, nobody from abroad will help us. Who needs us over there? In our country people became rich not at all because they benefited Russia somehow, but rather as a result of redistributing the national, people's wealth in their favor. This is a typical Bolshevik technique: To take everything away and....appropriate it right away. Of course, it is easier to steal than to do something yourself. However, can something significant be created if you keep stealing from someone else shamelessly all the time?" I agreed--of course, it cannot. And I thought that Russia did not get just the Federation of Public Associations of Commodity Producers during the two days of the congress in Krasnoyarsk, but possibly also a new national leader.
