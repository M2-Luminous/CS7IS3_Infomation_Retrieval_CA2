This will be the second U.S.-Belarusian summit within the last six months, which is rather unprecedented in relations between the largest state in the world and a rather small country such as Belarus. In connection with this, how would you describe relations between Minsk and Washington, and what has been achieved in our relations over the last six months? [Martynov] Relations between Belarus and the United States were officially classified as friendly in a joint declaration, which was adopted at the first meeting between Stanislav Shushkevich and Bill Clinton in July of last year. The first July visit by a Belarusian delegation was not held without a reason, but occurred as a result of efforts made over the entire existence of relations between Belarus and the United States. While speaking about achievements of this period, one must emphasize that Belarus has signed with the United States an array of agreements on cooperation in the military-technical sphere. The main ones among them were signed during the visit by Stanislav Shushkevich to the United States. These agreements are still paving the way for relations between the United States and other countries of the former Soviet Union: There have been no similar agreements between the United States and other CIS countries, except with Belarus. We are the only ones with whom the United States has signed agreements on cooperation in military conversion and in ecological restoration of radioactively and chemically polluted strategic nuclear weapons facilities. Such agreements, I would like to emphasize, exist only between Belarus and the United States. Currently, we are receiving $76 million in disarmament aid from the United States, and we would like to receive additional funds for this purpose in 1994. We have received considerable economic assistance in the form of preferential deliveries of grain and bread. Additionally, an array of programs is being introduced -- some of them are currently being reexamined -- regarding technical cooperation between the United States and Belarus in establishing a financial-credit system, a monetary system, development of private farming, etc. [Spas] The January trip to Europe by Bill Clinton will be his first visit to the Old World as U.S. President. Moreover, this is a very short visit -- altogether about one week. This way, Minsk is one of the four European capitals to be visited by President Clinton. Why, in your opinion, did he choose Belarus as one of the points of his brief European tour? [Martynov] Why did the President choose Minsk as one of the points on his first European itinerary? Probably, only Bill Clinton himself could give a more precise answer to this question. From our point of view, the choice was determined by the constructive and weighed course in Belarus' disarmament and foreign policies, as well as by Belarus' position as the most stable post-Soviet republic, which has not shed a drop of blood during the process of deep transformations, and which is conducting democratic and economic reforms. Another factor is that the United States is interested in the development of relations with Belarus, and there are directions which require a more active impulse at a higher level. In particular, this regards the development of economic cooperation between the United States and Belarus. [Spas] What could you say about prospects for the development of economic cooperation between the two countries? So far, the political and, I would say, military-political aspects have been the center of attention of U.S.-Belarusian relations. [Martynov] A goal of the development of our economic relations, and simultaneously, a goal of the preparations for the visit, is, first of all, the establishment of legal grounds, on which trade and credit relations between the United States and Belarus will be later developing. Second, it is possible that certain issues of cooperation in abolishing trade barriers will also be addressed, and Belarus will receive assistance in establishing a market economy infrastructure, speeding the pace of economic reform, privatization, etc. [Spas] Speaking about U.S.-Belarusian relations, one cannot forget the humanitarian aid the United States delivers to Belarus. [Martynov] Yes, our Embassy cooperates with numerous humanitarian organizations. The aid they have already sent to Belarus, first of all to Chernobyl victims, amounts to millions of dollars. I expect that this assistance will continue. We also receive a great deal of humanitarian aid from the U.S. Government. [Spas] Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk will undoubtedly increase Belarus' popularity in the United States, thanks to our foreign and disarmament policies. This will also be reflected in the improvement of economic relations between the United States and Belarus. [Martynov] Belarus' popularity in the United States is not the only goal of our relations. Conditions suitable for investments and prospects for improved business relations also play an important role. As soon as such conditions are created, the message will come very quickly. [Spas] At a briefing held in Washington on 16 December, a top U.S. Administration official stated that Belarus is a very important country. We have already underlined the importance of Bill Clinton's choice, however, what did that official have in mind saying that Belarus is a very important country? [Martynov] Of course, this opinion, voiced by a top White House official, is not accidental. The White House does not voice such statements accidentally. As we believe, the opinion was determined by the geopolitical and strategic position of Belarus in Europe in general, and in Eastern Europe in particular, as well as the uniqueness of Belarus' position among post-Soviet countries. In this sense, Belarus can serve as an example of a post-Soviet country, which develops quite successfully, of course, taking into account certain objective economic hardships.
