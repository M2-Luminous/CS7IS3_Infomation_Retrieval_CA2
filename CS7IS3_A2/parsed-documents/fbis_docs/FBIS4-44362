Mr Major's move, which throws the European Community into temporary disarray, means a frantic search to find alternative candidates has now begun. Germany, which takes over the EC presidency from Greece on July 1, yesterday called for an emergency summit to be held in Brussels on July 15. Many Tory MPs, including some who have been openly critical of Mr Major's leadership over recent months, applauded his stand. One of the Prime Minister's most prominent critics on the backbenches, John Carlisle, said Mr Major was "at last" showing real strength of leadership. "Good for him. At last he has been wielding his predecessor's handbag. It is just exactly what people wanted to see." Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Tory right-wingers, said: "John Major has shown we mean business in the Community." The veto raised the possibility that Britain's EC partners would put up alternative Belgian candidates who would be as unacceptable to Britain as Mr Dehaene, or that Mr Delors could be put forward by German diplomats for a further term. The Prime Minister defended his decision, declaring to fellow leaders at the Corfu summit: "This situation is only a crisis if everyone wants to make it one." He said at the end of the meeting: "I believe it is necessary even at the expense of painful decisions and difficult moments to make sure that we have the best candidate for this vitally important job." The new Commission president will see the Community through the crucial 1996 conference which will revise the Maastricht Treaty and set the shape of the EC into the next century. Although Mr Major yesterday appeared isolated, with all 11 other EC countries voting to accept Mr Dehaene, he drew support from several of his partners for his tough stand against the imposition of Mr Dehaene without proper consultation. Italy, in particular, though reluctantly agreeing with the majority, has been infuriated by the attempt by France and Germany to steamroller Mr Dehaene's appointment through. "It is important that someone has reminded us of the importance of principles," said Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister. The Dutch, too, were forced to withdraw their prime minister, Ruud Lubbers, as a candidate, and have spoken out against the tactics of the Dehaene camp. Sir Leon Brittan, who Mr Major described as the best candidate for the job, failed to win the support of a single other country, and withdrew from the contest yesterday morning at the same time as Mr Lubbers. Explaining why he has continued to oppose Mr Dehaene after everyone else had come round to him, Mr Major said: "What I could not understand is why, when at a very late stage, and since everyone has expressed approval of the qualities of Sir Leon and of Mr Lubbers, we should drop two such well-qualified candidates for one who was in my view less well qualified." Mr Major said he liked Mr Dehaene personally but the Belgian premier came from "a tradition of big government and of intervention. That's not my position; it is a tradition that is not quite in touch with the direction in which Europe is now moving. We need a Commission president whose instincts are for enterprise, openness and subsidiarity." The Prime Minister revealed that, since rumours of Mr Dehaene's candidacy began to circulate earlier this year, he had indicated "on more than one occasion" to the Belgian government, to Mr Dehaene's office and to the Greek presidency that he would not be able to support his appointment. Under the EC's rules, the Commission president must be agreed "by common accord." Unlike Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon, who openly declared themselves well in advance, Mr Dehaene announced his bid just a week before the summit, weeks after a Franco-German summit agreed jointly to back him. Mr Major said he also objected to the way Mr Dehaene had emerged as the leading candidate despite the fact that a majority of member states had not been consulted. But his attack on Mr Dehaene's fitness for the job brought a stinging rebuke from German officials, foreshadowing a period of cool relations with Britain. One said: "You cannot call the prime minister of a neighbouring EC country badly qualified. Politically this is very damaging." Last night neither President Mitterrand nor Chancellor Kohl was prepared to commit himself to continuing their support for Mr Dehaene. Diplomats speculated that the search for other candidates has begun. Peter Sutherland the Irish director-general of GATT, is now the most prominent name. A former EC commissioner, he is well qualified. But the Reynolds government is reluctant to nominate a member of the opposition Fine Gael. The decision by the Greek hosts to abandon the attempt to decide on his successor followed intense discussions and some sharp words. At times the arrangements degenerated into near-farce, including an emergency U-turn on narrow, winding Corfu roads by the Irish motorcade after Mr Reynolds was summoned back to a late-night meeting which he thought had broken up.
