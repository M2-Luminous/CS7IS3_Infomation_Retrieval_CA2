The multimillionaire Yoruba Muslim from southwest Nigeria maintained that "the only way to halt the present backsliding of the country into complete economic catastrophe, chaos, and collapse" is to concretize the mandate which, according to him, the people conferred on him on 12 June. He said he has therefore "decided to form a government of national unity whose legitimacy stems from the 12 June mandate. Further details on the concretization of this program will be announced in due course." Mr. Abiola also called on "Gen. Abacha and his unelected team...to immediately vacate all the government functions which they have illegally filled and are performing." The immediate task of the "government of national unity" will be to put the country's economy back on its feet, to fight poverty, and to restore the democratic rights of all Nigerians, he said.
