FR940720-1-00018 FR940720-1-00006 Radar Transponders (§87.1) In order to maintain consistency with the 72 COLREGS, this rulemaking proposes to add the use of survival craft radar transponders to the list of distress signals included in 33 CFR 87.1. The 1988 amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS), in Regulation III/26.1.4, require that cargo and passenger ships subject to SOLAS carry Search and Rescue Transponders (SARTS) for use in survival craft. A SART is a radar transponder that responds automatically to most surface navigation radars allowing rescuers to quickly locate a vessel or survival craft. Carriage requirements and specifications for SARTS are codified in Federal Communication Commission regulations at 47 CFR 80.1095, which are referenced in the proposed revision. Discussion of Other Proposed Regulations Lights on Moored Barges (§82.5, 88.13, 90.5) These proposed amendments to the Pilot Rules, the interpretive rules of the 72 COLREGS and the interpretive rules of the Inland Rules, will clarify the responsibilities of vessels moored to mooring buoys or other similar devices. Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS and Rule 30 of the Inland Navigation Rules provide lighting requirements for vessels at anchor, without specifically mentioning vessels moored to mooring buoys. The Coast Guard proposes interpretive rules to clarify that the term ``vessels at anchor'' in Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS and the Inland Rules rules is to be interpreted to include vessels moored to a mooring buoy. Recognizing the need to specify safe lighting procedures for vessels moored to a mooring buoys, the Coast Guard presented this issue first to the Navigation Safety Advisory Council (NAVSAC), and then, at their request, to the Towing Safety Advisory Council (TSAC) and the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (BSAC). Although reaching different formulations, all three advisory groups agreed that a vessel moored to a mooring buoy or other similar device should be lighted as a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30. The groups also agreed however, that barges should be lighted on the corners in a scheme to that provided in 33 CFR 88.13 for barges moored to a bank or dock. Information indicates that most barge operators already light barges on the corners. Not only does this lighting scheme provide better definition of the size and dimensions of the barge(s) than a single anchor light, but by placing the lights near the sides, it allows a better vertical visibility of small boats. Additionally, the Coast Guard has determined that it would be appropriate to require such lights on barges to be visible for one nautical mile, and to otherwise meet the technical standards for marine lights as provided in 33 CFR 84.15 (Annex I to the Inland Navigation Rules). Currently, barges moored along banks or docks are required to carry two unobstructed white lights of an intensity to be visible for at least one mile on a clear dark night (33 CFR 88.13(b)). This requirement has led to confusion in the maritime community. In a recent allision between a tug and tow and moored barges, the limited visibility of the lights on the moored barges was a contributing factor in the allision. Barge operators can easily meet the proposed requirement. Marine light fixtures meeting this standard are required for recreational vessels operating at night. Therefore, these fixtures are readily available and inexpensive. In consideration of the foregoing, the proposed interpretive rules of §90.5 (Inland) and §82.5 (COLREGS) provide that a vessel moored to a mooring buoy be lighted as a vessel at anchor, in accordance with Rule 30, except that barges, unless otherwise authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), shall be lighted in accordance with §88.13. However, the exception provided in Inland and COLREGS Rule 30(e) for vessels less than 7 meters in length, and Inland Rule 30(g) for vessels less than 20 meters in length in special anchorage areas would also apply to vessels moored to mooring buoys. The proposed additions to the Pilot Rules at §88.13 will prescribe, unless otherwise authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), a different lighting scheme for barges (generally, a white light on each corner). This scheme is already customary practice in many parts of the country. However, in particular circumstances the COTP could authorize that a barge be lighted in another manner. For example, the COTP could authorize a barge to be lighted as a vessel at anchor. This could arise where it would be safer for a barge moored in relatively open water to light with fore and aft anchor lights with a visibility of three miles in lieu of four lights with a visibility of only one mile. The Coast Guard, through proposed §82.5, intends to require these lighting schemes for barges on all U.S. navigable waters including COLREGS waters, specifically, Alaskan waters, Puget Sound and other heavily trafficked U.S. waters which are COLREGS waters for the purposes of the Rules. This type of special regulation for U.S. navigable waters is within the special rules exception of COLREGS Rule 1(b).
