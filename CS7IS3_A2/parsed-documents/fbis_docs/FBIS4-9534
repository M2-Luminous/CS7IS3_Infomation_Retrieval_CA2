To the comment that Solidarity had called a general strike for 28 April and was demanding the withdrawal of the so-called neopopiwek [wage control tax], the president said: "Let's not allow ourselves to be driven mad; I think common sense will win in the end. After all, there is no popiwek for the time being. I have not made a statement on this matter, and I think that everything will turn out well." [passage omitted] Asked what he would say to the miners, Walesa replied: "I would say that the reforms are very difficult, that in the center of Europe we must change the representatives of the law, but we must respect the law. Imagine that somebody in Poland starts driving on the left-hand side, not obeying the law. Imagine what would happen in Warsaw. It is the same with other rules." If you were a worker now, would you go on strike? the president was asked. "It would depend on what factory I was in: in one yes, in another no. But I would not overturn the entire law. That would be going a bit too far," he replied. Would you be able to create a minority government with the Polish Peasant Party, based on the Belweder? "Based on the Belweder, it depends. If somebody said that only people from the Belweder (were to go) into the government, then no. But if it were a question of being based on the Belweder, which appoints (a government), then I am ablebecause I have a good understanding of circles. Of course, I do not have a spare set of ministers at the Belweder. We are not talking about a political government; we are talking about a government of experts," Walesa replied. Asked if he would support Grzegorz Kolodko, the Left's candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister, the president said that he had no reservations up to now, and the candidacy would probably go through. He added that he had no formal proposal on this matter. [passage omitted]
