The last thing we needed was this upsurge of ethnic hatred and violence. I can fully understand the painful experiences of the past week, but Belgium must not abandon its responsibilities. In our country, Belgium certainly has a contribution to make in creating the political dialogue that is so necessary in order to achieve a lasting peace." These are the words of former Burundian President Pierre Buyoya in an interview with DE STANDAARD. Shortly before, he had met with State Secretary for Development Erik Derycke. "Ethnic extremism is like a drug," Buyoya stated. "It causes people to do things which they no longer control and which, in the long run, are against their own interests. There are many examples of this. Both in Burundi and Rwanda, the killers of Presidents Melchior Ndadaye and Juvenal Habyarimana believed they could strengthen or secure their position. They achieved the exact opposite. In both countries, the attacks resulted in complete disintegration." The former Burundian president believes it is of the utmost importance for the warring factions to quickly achieve a cease-fire and that, above all, the country needs a balanced government. "The plan is there: The protocol for power sharing as included in the Arusha peace agreement. If, on the other hand, Rwanda gets an extremist government of any kind, the whole region will quickly go up in flames." The same calls for power sharing apply just as much to Burundi. With his policy of reconciliation and national unity during his period in power (1987-1993), Pierre Buyoya drew much applause from friend and foe, at home and abroad. Some people would like to see him return to playing a more active political role. Elections "Last June, Ndadaye won a convincing election victory," Buyoya openly states. "I would find it dishonest to now take back through the back door that which I then lost in an open contest. When Ndadaye succeeded me, I decided to withdraw from political life for the time being. I am still a member of the UPRONA [Unity for National Progress] party, but have no leading role. I did not want to be tainted with the image as opposition leader. I can do much more good through discreet contacts. I was proved right by events, although I could not avoid certain mishaps. Psychological elements are also involved. Our country needs a period of, let us say, 10 years with a Hutu president in order to do away with all ethnic taboos once and for all." Pierre Buyoya discussed with State Secretary Derycke on Wednesday the question of possible Belgian aid in further supporting the rebuilding of democracy in his country. "Belgium can play an important role," Buyoya believes. "The Belgians know our countries and people very well, and there is still a considerable Belgian presence in Burundi. In addition to sustained opposition in principle to any form of ethnic cleansing and violence, I hope that Belgium will continue to help to bring about and maintain political dialogue between all elements in our society. There is no other way for us." Training Former Burundian Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi was also in Brussels on Wednesday. To everyone's surprise the first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, chose this economist to head his government in July last year. She feels that she must continue to play a part in the political life of her country. "The fact that I am still alive is probably because I am a woman," she says. "A male prime minister would never have survived last October's coup d'etat. Women politicians have a very particular contribution to make to a country's development, because by their very nature they look to the future and the well-being of their children." The assistance she expects from foreign partners is principally in the field of training and development. "The problems facing our country are not so much rooted in ethnic questions as in poverty, underdevelopment and, above all, a disturbed or absence of balance in the structures. The latter is most seriously evident in the Army. But if you do not believe that things can change, then things will never change." "Our Western partners and Belgium above all, can be of tremendous assistance to us in training political leaders who are able to make objective analyses and manage the mechanisms of democracy and who are primarily concerned by the real needs of their people. I see support for this training as a priority form of development aid," Sylvie Kinigi concluded.
