'Abd-Rabbuh, speaking after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, said an observer presence "would have a very strong symbolic meaning to restore confidence among the Palestinians of the occupied territories." Juppe confirmed that France was prepared to send observers under United Nations authority, adding that Israel's security measures needed to be observed by "international representatives mandated by the UN." On Thursday [3 March] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd backed the idea of an international force to protect Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and said Britain was ready to take part. Juppe said he hoped a UN Security Council resolution on the observers would be passed "as soon as possible." The resolution has been held up for almost a week because of differences with the United States. 'Abd-Rabbuh visited Paris as part of a Palestine Liberation Organisation effort in world capitals to explain its conditions for resuming autonomy negotiations with Israel. The negotiations were broken off after the massacre, in which 52 Palestinians were slaughtered in a mosque by an Israeli gunman. Resuming the peace process and putting the autonomy accord into effect would be "unthinkable" at a time when "armed settlers are walking freely among the Palestinians," 'Abd-Rabbuh said. 'Abd-Rabbuh will next visit Brussels for a meeting with European Commission President Jacques Delors. Nabil Sha'th, PLO chairman Yasir Arafat's advisor, met with Hurd in London on Thursday before heading for Washington where he was set to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Friday.
