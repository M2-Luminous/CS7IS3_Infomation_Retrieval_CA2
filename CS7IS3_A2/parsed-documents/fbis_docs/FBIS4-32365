State institutions in charge of privatization marketed nearly a quarter of the firms in full, and about one third in part. Furthermore, many firms had to be converted to meet market standards, and several had to be closed. Privatization began in Hungary in 1989. It is directly implemented by two state institutions, the State Property Agency (AVU), which sees to the sale of state firms, and the State Holding Co., which has, since 1992, overseen the assets remaining in state ownership. In 1990, the AVU was authorized to privatize a total of 1,844 companies and business associations. Over the last four years, nearly 500 firms were fully privatized, and more than 700 in part. An additional 477 are under liquidation. The management of another 250 firms has to be handed over to other organizations and state institutions. The State Holding Co., for instance, received 1,500. The remaining, nearly 40, firms are currently under reorganization. Privatization revenues of the State Property Agency totalled 210.3 billion forints [HUF] (approx. $2 billion) over the last four years, until May 1994. Foreign capital valued at HUF93.9 billion was invested in the course of privatization, which is nearly 45 percent of the total revenue. A quarter of firms managed by the AVU now have foreign stakes. The highest foreign proportion is found in mines (67 percent) and in energy industry firms (72 percent), and foreign ownership in processing also totals one third. However, a large part of the assets sold outright by the State Property Agency are now owned by Hungarian private ventures. In order to boost internal demand, the government helped Hungarian customers involved in privatization with several preferential loans: The Privatization Loan, the Start Loan, and the most frequently used E-Loan (Existence Loan). Hungarian firms purchased assets both for cash and preferential loans, in equal parts, and citizens purchased nearly 12 percent of the privatized state assets (to a value of approx. HUF25 billion) with compensation coupons. The AVU spent more than 30 percent of revenues from privatization on state debt repayment, 10 percent on maintaining the level of businesses, and the finanicng of reorganization. Asset transfers, state obligations (for instance, allocations for the World Expo), and the liquidation of unsalable companies (severance pay for workers) accounted for about 50 percent of spending. Other incidental expenses, and the running of the AVU also accounted for expenditures. When founded in 1992, the State Holding Co. began the business management of 163 large companies in which the state intended to remain the owner, either fully or in part. The total capital of these firms, received from the AVU, was nearly HUF1,500-1,600 billion in 1992, of which nearly HUF600 billion was the share planned for privatization. Since its founding, the State Holding Co. has concluded 10 privatization contracts, the most important of which were the privatization of nearly one-third of the Hungarian Telecommunications Co. ($850 million), the agreement between the Hungarian and the Italian airlines MALEV-ALITALIA ($70 million), and the sale of Chinoin Pharmaceuticals ($75 million).
