Has it ever happened to you that you received a suspicious order? [Hanak] This is not something that happens every day, but it does happen. When trading in this kind of product, the principles fixed by the law and international treaties must be respected. We respect them. We are not interested in damaging the reputation of our firm and the Czech Republic. We cooperate with state bodies and the licensing department of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This ministry verifies the authenticity of the documents and the customer. This is how we try to prevent a possible misuse of our products. [Hoffmann] So, you have not encountered problems like those in the French film "Three Men to Kill"? [Hanak] We have had instances where firms and also individuals wanted to purchase ammunition for strange purposes. Such cases are reaching an increasingly professional level of deception. They are transparent attempts at making a deal. They also include lobbying and attempts to influence the management of the company. We even have information that we are at the center of professional intelligence games. We also have reports that pressure is exerted on members of the management of the company, but they have to resist it because they want to stick strictly to the law. [Hoffmann] Most dirty deals in the world are about military weapons and ammunition. How much of your production enters them? [Hanak] We export ammunition to about 60 countries. Some 98 percent of the ammunition that we manufacture is designated for hunting and target shooting; the rest is military. However, it is difficult to tell how many of the bullets--for example, pistol bullets--are really used for target shooting and how many for training security firms or for other purposes. The bullets are usually the same. [Hoffmann] Recently, there was a report in the press that, at the IWA, the international exposition in Germany, you concluded a deal for ammunition sales amounting to half a billion korunas. Is such a deal usual in your business? [Hanak] No, it is not. We held business talks at the fair, during which previously placed orders were discussed. We had anticipated these deliveries. Nevertheless, I believe this is a great business success. [Hoffmann] You are engaged in a lucrative business with ammunition. Is your conscience clear when you read in papers about murders or about cases where someone has lost his life? [Hanak] If the Czech firms stop delivering weapons and ammunition, others will deliver them. Foreign competition would like to enter the Czech market and take over our positions abroad. I cannot imagine that hunters would go back to using bows and arrows or that police could do without firearms when chasing criminals. [Hoffmann] In the West, they use rubber bullets that do not kill. Can you, too, produce them? [Hanak] We have developed cartridges with rubber bullets and lead shot. We can supply them to the Czech police, if they show an interest. Apart from that, we manufacture cartridges with steel shot, which are used not to kill but to get quickly into a building through a closed door. [Hoffmann] For three years, you have not delivered anything to our Army. The Army was responsible for almost half of your production. Your economic results show that you have managed this. [Hanak] The establishment of the shareholders' company in May 1992 was followed by the arrival of new management. This management adjusted very quickly to the market conditions, and, within several months, Sellier and Bellot went from a loss to a profit. Our first goal was to secure the economic stability of the company and to keep the employees on. We have succeeded in both. [Hoffmann] The stock quoted on the stock market is a sure reflection of the company's prosperity. Sellier and Bellot shares are priced at 2,000 korunas. Does this correspond to the economic situation in the company? [Hanak] We are very happy with the stock market's objective appreciation of our work. I believe that the price could be even higher. [Hoffmann] Where have you found the competent people? [Hanak] We found them among our own people and in other enterprises. For our foreign trade activity, we have used the experience of former employees in foreign trade organizations. It paid off to stick to the principle that we should select our people in a way beneficial to our society and to the reputation of the Czech industry. We rejected certain tendentious criteria, which did not have anything in common with real qualifications. The economic results of the company testify that we made a good selection. Apart from that, several domestic and foreign organizations have shown interest in our experience. Representatives of investment funds come here asking us for advice on how to organize foreign trade, the management of the company, and the company's internal bank. I have received two invitations to lecture abroad. They are interested in our experience with the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. The first invitation is from a consortium of banks in Great Britain; the second is from Sweden. [Hoffmann] Do you believe that your experience can be generalized? Enterprises are complaining that it is impossible to do business in the Czech Republic. [Hanak] This is the excuse of incompetent management. The conditions for running a business in the Czech Republic are not ideal, but, to good management, they allow the securing of the prosperity of the enterprise. [Hoffmann] You have begun to produce projectiles with the same caliber as NATO's. Are you counting on selling them to the Czech Army and increasing your arms production? [Hanak] We are following the trend whereby our Army's weapons will be replaced and the Army will join NATO in the future. This is our small contribution to supporting our government, which made this decision. Moreover, we will prove that Czech industry is capable of manufacturing the same products as Western industry. [Hoffmann] You have launched a new line of production, but the decision on the replacement of the weapons of our Army will be made in the summer, and it will take years before individual steps are implemented. Does that mean that the production of the ammunition with NATO calibers will be suspended until then? [Hanak] We are negotiating several orders for abroad. [Hoffmann] Are you not afraid that, when the decision on replacing the weapons of our Army is made, your company will be forgotten and ammunition will be imported from abroad? [Hanak] Such considerations are premature. Even if there is no direct decision that we are to supply the Czech Army with projectiles, we are going to win the competition because our offer is more advantageous than that of our foreign competitors. [Hoffmann] In other countries, do they prefer domestic firms to foreign ones when supplying their armies? [Hanak] In some countries, they buy weapons and ammunition exclusively from domestic companies. There are countries in which there are tenders for part of the deliveries. In 95 percent of cases, they are won by domestic companies. [Hoffmann] You would certainly welcome it if Czech companies participated in the replacement of the weapons of our Army in the future. Are you as great a patriot as you are a hunter? [Hanak] I use Sellier and Bellot bullets, a shotgun from the Brno Arms Factory, and a hunting gun and rifle from the Cesky Brod Arms Factory.
