Reports from media circles say that at least 2,000 journalists, reporters and other workers involved in the media have lost their jobs in the course of the last two weeks, as a result of attempts by leading media companies to reduce the size of their workforce. The reason for this "shrinking campaign" is reported to be the increasing price of paper, higher production costs and the dramatic decrease in advertising, caused by the economic turmoil in Turkey. Most leading newspapers are now published with fewer pages than before. Also, the new Radio-TV Bill, which strictly limits the number of commercials and obliges the media to respect copyright, has provoked a feeling of concern about the future among media moguls. Chain of Sackings TGRT-TV and TURKIYE daily, owned by the IHLAS group, have so far sacked at least 700 journalists. Some of them were reportedly asked to provide technical and economic services, a proposal which they rejected. ATV and SABAH daily have by now dismissed at least 500 people. Sources within SABAH say the newspaper is facing the worst crisis ever, and that a new wave of redundancies seem inevitable. "Almost half of the 3,000 people employed risk losing their jobs at the moment," one source said. Among the journalists who lost their jobs recently are Refik Durbas, coordinator of the arts page, and Sebnem Senyener, New York correspondent. The other two newspaper giants, HURRIYET and MILLIYET, have also sacked a proportion of their staff. It is reported that a total of 700 people have been forced to go. Kanal D, a private TV channel owned jointly by MILLIYET-owner Aydin Dogan and the DOGUS group, is confronted with a crisis as well. It is reported that workers' wages have been frozen and recruitments suspended. Kanal 6, a private TV channel owned by Ahmet Ozal, sacked last week 241 of its personnel in the Programming, Advertising, and Technical Departments. Kanal 6 is reported to have huge debts, and CUMHURIYET daily reported last Sunday that it was on sale. There seems to be a great deal of turbulence within the semi-official ANATOLIA news agency as well. They are reported to have sacked between 57 and 300 journalists. Political Interference With the increasing anxiety in the ANATOLIA news agency, two journalists are said to have been sacked by "order of the prime minister," following their articles on the economic austerity package, reported CUMHURIYET newspaper on Tuesday. Emine Cal and Fatma Orhan Coskunoglu are reported to have been pressured by Mehmet Bican, a member of ANATOLIA's administrative board and the prime minister's press adviser, to disclose their sources of information. When the reporters refused to do so, Bican asked the board to dismiss them, saying, "It is the wish of the prime minister." ANATOLIA fired them on the grounds that "their articles were causing trouble for the agency." High Fines for InterStar TV Cem Uzan, owner of the private TV channel InterStar,--together with two TV presenters and five high-ranking executives of InterStar--was fined a total of TL 2 billion, on the grounds that the party propaganda and insults broadcast on the television channel had been a breach of the Election Law.
