He is accused of sheltering drug trafficker Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, who headed the Arellano Felix band in the 3 March assassination of Alejandro Castaneda, commander of the Federal Judicial Police. [Begin Valadez recording] The incidents we have pointed out have taken place within a context of violence ranging from the confrontation between drug traffickers at Cristine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta to the recent murder of the Tijuana public security director, Federico Benitez Lopez. [end recording] Diego Valadez said that in this context, in the preliminary investigations initiated on 3 March, the authorities must determine if the late Benitez Lopez had information that could lead to the arrest of Ortiz Lara and other officials in other crimes such as possible participation in issuing credentials to well-known drug traffickers. As for reports on a possible link in this case to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the attorney general of the republic said there is no evidence of that.
