In an article today, the paper, which is issued here, stresses the need for a specific mechanism for the commission's work and activities. It says matters should not be left undecided and unspecific, something that would exclude any possible action to swiftly implement Paragraph 22 of Part C of Resolution 687. The paper says that throughout the past period, it was clear from the way the commission conducted its business that the commission was procrastinating despite Iraq's sincere cooperation, and although its various subcommittees visited Iraq dozens of times and submitted authenticated and detailed reports testifying to Iraq's cooperation. The paper explains that under U.S. pressures, the commission was involved in gimmicks and sharp contradictions between what has actually been achieved on the ground and Commission Chairman Ekeus' unsubstantiated statements. The paper adds: Iraq is aware of the causes of U.S. pressures on the commission and the attempts to force it not to acknowledge facts. Iraq is also aware of the way nations' issues are run and discussed inside the halls of the UN Security Council and how plots are concocted and facts falsified to control other peoples' and their wealth, preventing them from exercising their independent free will. The paper notes that all this takes place under slogans of "international legitimacy and international law." The paper says experience has proved the practices of United States and its satellites inside and outside the UN Security Council are a very long way from true legitimacy, law, and justice. These nations are ready to ignore all ethical and human standards for the sake of their colonialist interests and global policies. The paper stresses that after the recent UN Security Council's decision, the Special Commission should be freed of U.S. influence and hostile polices against Iraq. The commission should deal with facts impartially, objectively, and fairly, and it should not be dragged to unjust stands that further increase the suffering of the Iraqi people. Concluding its article, AL-'IRAQ says fair people in this world have become absolutely convinced that any delay in lifting the blockade can be classified as a major crime whose responsibility rests with the sides that obstruct the adoption of the only resolution that reflects responsibility, justice, and law--a resolution lifting the blockade.
