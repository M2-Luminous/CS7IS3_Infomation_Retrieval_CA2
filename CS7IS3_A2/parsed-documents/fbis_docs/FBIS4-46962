Kasatyy: "Attack on Debtors"] [Text] The slump in traffic volume is continuing in the region serviced by the Volga Railroad. In April for example it was 36.7 percent of the level of the corresponding period of last year. Noticeably less petroleum products, chemical fertilizers, cement and ferrous metals are being presented for shipment. Unfortunately a tendency for passenger traffic to decrease was noted in January as well. However, as railroad chief Yu. Tsittel noted at a recent sorters' conference, there are still considerable unutilized reserves in the Volga Railroad. The freight shipment and dispatch system leaves something to be desired. Adequate attention is not being devoted to freight and passenger train schedules. Yuriy Ivanovich also cited the figures for losses from failure to meet qualitative indicators. Because of reduced locomotive productivity 210 million rubles were lost, almost R180 million were lost because the average freight train weight target was not met, and R83 million were lost because of too high a percentage of empty runs. As for the total, R1.3 million were lost. Even today, clients owe the railroad over R75 billion for shipments, while it owes R80 billion. Two out of four divisions--Yershov and Saratov--are already operating at a loss. Here are two examples of irresponsibility. It took 10 days for car No 63782270 to get from Duplyatka Station to the freight recipient in Yelshanka. The railroad received R1.235 million from the client in accordance with the rate schedule, but it then returned 720,000 to him for late delivery--over half of what it earned. And there were no reasons for the delays--just the usual laxity. A second example. Passenger cars have been set up at large terminals as hotels on wheels. There are some at Astrakhan-1 Station. An inspection of just one car by financial auditors revealed that only 11 of the 19 people spending the night there were accounted for. Conductor Koteva pocketed the R28,000 she received from the others. And you can imagine how much slips by the railroad's cash registers because of hitchhikers in passenger and commuter trains! All of this needs to be fought decisively, since otherwise the railroad's income will fall no matter what the situation. Special attention is now being devoted on the Volga Railroad to reducing operating expenses. Fulfillment of the corresponding order of the railroad chief made it possible to save as much as over R8 billion since the beginning of the year. But there still are even more reserves. The position of division deputy chief for economics was introduced in the Volgograd Division, as being the largest and most important, in order to concentrate the efforts of financial experts and economists. Several months have gone by, but to what end? The results are almost invisible. Obviously the railroaders are simply waiting for the clients themselves to pay what they owe for shipping, out of the goodness of their hearts. And these debts are sizeable--64 percent of what the enterprises owe the railroad. In a critique at the railroad administration, it was revealed that the Volgograd Division received from its clients only 40 percent of what they owe for shipping. This indicator is lower than that of the railroad as a whole. In the meantime the Yershov Division received over 90 percent in April. How they were able to do this will be explained below. Volgograd Division deputy chief for economics V. Sabina and financial division chief V. Plyushch were severely rebuked at the critique. After this, the owed money began flowing better into the division's account. But let's return to the Yershov Division. The aggressive position taken by its chief, S. Khlobystov, had the result that the most delinquent debtor--the Irgiz Joint-Stock Company in Balakovo--finally dipped into its wallet and paid its debt of over a billion rubles for transportation services. It should be noted that the experience that has been accumulated in settling mutual accounts with clients is also proving to be useful. Together with chief economist A. Yelashova and financial service chief A. Korolkov, the railroad's specialists developed and are successfully using a system under which the Volga Railroad pays what it owes for diesel fuel and electric power to keep the trains moving with fuel oil obtained in turn from its debtors. The Saratovenergo Joint-Stock Company recently paid off its entire debt in this way. The railroad's contract relations with clients are also growing noticeably stronger. They can now influence them with the ruble, by demanding and collecting prepayments for shipments. While it owes no debts to the railroad, the Saratov Oil Refinery has taken it upon itself to prepay the State Committee for Petroleum Products for fuel received by the railroad. "We found a way to demand payment of debts through State Arbitration," said chief economist L. Yelashova. "As you know, the presidential edict on collection of payments without acceptance has been invalid for a long time. Now arbitration is providing good assistance. Things have only just started moving, but our legal service has already joined the effort, and I think that the changes accountants and lawyers of the Yershov and Saratov divisions have accomplished will very soon become possible in all of the railroad's divisions. "For a small fee we use the services of the Saratov Kapital Firm, which takes promissory notes from debtors and transfers them to us." Debts are also being paid off with commercial products. The railroad has received fuel, electric power and construction materials worth R31.7 billion from debtors. The way in which these acquired industrial products are being sold off will be discussed in a separate article.
