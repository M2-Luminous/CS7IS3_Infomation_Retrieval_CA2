They appealed to the Rwandan parties to show a spirit of compromise and to overcome outstanding obstacles. They stressed the urgent need for a solution in view of the political and economic timetable. After studying the agreements on power sharing, all political parties which were legal on the date of the signing of the protocol and the Rwandan Patriotic Front must be represented in the Transitional National Assembly, once formed, on condition that they respect the peace agreement. It will be up to the commission on unity and national reconciliation to that each political force respects the code of political ethics. Violations are punishable by exclusion from the institutions, as decided by the supreme court. They recommended that the commission be set up without delay after the establishment of the institutions and that it be charged with evaluating the behavior of parties represented within the institutions. They stressed that if this principle is respected by all parties, there should be no further cause for delay in the establishment of the institutions. Each political force should restrain itself from trying to create new problems among or within political parties. A constructive attitude is indispensable for the satisfactory conclusion of the ceremonies to establish the two broad-based institutions and for their efficient operation.
