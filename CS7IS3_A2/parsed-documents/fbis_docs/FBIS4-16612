Chinese diplomats in the Uzbek capital told ITAR-TASS that the talks also deal with regional and international problems. On Tuesday morning the Chinese premier laid flowers at the monument to great poet and thinker Alisher Navoy. Both countries now have more ground for further deepening friendly relations, Islam Karimov said at the state dinner in honour of the Chinese leader on Monday. He called on the numerous entrepreneurs, who accompanied the Chinese premier to establish direct ties with enterprises in Uzbekistan. Islam Karimov pointed to "great successes of the great Chinese people" in reforming their economy and said that "the people of Uzbekistan have a great interest in everything that is taking place in China". According to Karimov, Li Peng's visit contributes to the beginning of a new era in relations between the two countries. Li Peng recalled that the two countries are "close neighbours and countries with ancient civilisations" and said a new period of relations between them began after Uzbekistan proclaimed independence. China, he stressed, needs "a good international situation to accomplish its own modernisation. For this reason China pays great attention to the development of relations with the neighbouring countries. The Chinese premier supported the proposal to restore the silk way as a means of developing trade, economic and cultural ties between the two countries. "China intends to make efforts to achieve this end," he said. China, a considerable part of whose territory, particularly the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is populated by Muslims, is seriously concerned about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in the Asian republics of the former USSR. Xinjiang has long been known as harbouring strong separatist tendencies under Islamic slogans. Li Peng, whose foreign trip will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, is being accompanied on the tour by chairman of the State Committee for Nationalities Ismail Aimat, an ethnic Uygur, who stands for the country's Muslim population in the Chinese leadership. The head of the Chinese Government arrived for a three-day official visit to the capital of Uzbekistan on Monday.
