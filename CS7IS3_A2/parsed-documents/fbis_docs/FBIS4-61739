Rutskoy told journalists that the 55th [as received] anniversary of the victory would be celebrated in a quite different environment; the present police regime would no longer exist following a popular victory. He was certain that the victory would be bloodless. According to Rutskoy, all Russia's residents had to work for making the country a great power and for unity if order was to be instilled in the country. He expressed the hope that neither in this nor in the next century the people would tolerate adventurers in power. Rutskoy was confident that the Soviet Union would be restored. Following the sanctification Rutskoy laid a wreath to it. No more than 50 people attended the ceremony.
