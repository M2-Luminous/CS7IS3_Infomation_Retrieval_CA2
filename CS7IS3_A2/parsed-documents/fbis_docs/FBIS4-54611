FBIS4-54611 "dreeu085__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-085-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Cited on Screening Issue, Coalition Cited on Screening Issue, Coalition AU0205174594 Prague CTK in English 1606 GMT 2 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0205174594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- In an interview with CTK today, Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss avoided answering directly the question concerning the screening of SDL ministers. "The screening requires a certain procedure. We suppose that President (Michal Kovac) had checked the question before appointing new government members," Weiss said. The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak Parliament in 1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret police, high Communist Party officials and members of the People's Militia from high government and economic posts until 1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person was among those listed by the law. According to the legislative department of the Presidential Office, the president is legally bound to have all govenrment nominees screened. This was also done in the case of the government of Jozef Moravcik, but it is not president's duty to announce the result, department officials told CTK. In connection with emerging speculations about "possible problems of one of the cabinet members with the screening law," Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed in today's issue of the daily NARODNA OBRODA that in line with the law he had asked for the screening of all members of his government. A representative of Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) assured CTK today that none of the ministers who are DEUS members had problems with the screening law. "Not a single DEUS candidate for a ministerial post was screened positively," DEUS spokeswoman Gabriela Nemkyova said. Weiss also told CTK that "there was no connection between the SDL's unwillingness to support the original proposal to appoint Roman Kovac Slovak Prime Minister and the proposal for his dismissal sumbitted to the parliament last week by Deputy Dusan Masiar from the (opposition) Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)." (Considering the suitable candidate for the post of prime minister in mid-March), "we thought that the prime minister should be an internationally known and accepted politician. We reached the conclusion that Jozef Moravcik would be capable of better integrating the heterogenous coalition," Weiss said. At a press conference today, Weiss announced that at the next meeting of the coalition council he wanted to take up again the question of breaching the coalition agreement by DEUS. In April, Moravcik was elected DEUS chairman. Under the agreement he cannot be simultaneously party chairman and prime minister. "In view of the forthcoming election campaign, DEUS has been put into advantage," Weiss stressed, adding he had twice discussed the issue with Moravcik by phone. The elections are to be held on September 30-October 1.
