[Yonezawa] Actually, we have yet to feel that steering the political situation is a very difficult task. Indeed, the opposition and ruling parties are opposed to each other. However, both sides share the common sense of value over policy matters, including tax system reform, administrative reform, and political reform. Therefore, we will do our best to reach a mutual agreement. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is planning to call for a no-confidence motion in the cabinet immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved. [Yonezawa] It will pursue the party's interest at the nation's expense if the LDP tries to call for a no-confidence motion by saying unreasonable things. Dissolution of the Diet and holding a general election under the current medium-sized constituency system may kill political reform. We need to enact the redistricting bills to introduce the single-seat system during the current Diet session. After that, we can dissolve the Diet and hold a fair and square election under the new system, if necessary. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think the cabinet will be dissolved or will the cabinet resign en masse if a no-confidence motion is submitted? [Yonezawa] Many members of the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] also hold the view that an election should not be held under the medium-sized constituency system. I am sure that a gap will be created within the LDP and the SDPJ if the executive departments of both parties try to forcefully approve a no-confidence motion. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think a freeze has been imposed on the activities of the "Kaishin" parliamentary group? [Yonezawa] Party members and the Yuaikai, a supporting group, had no objection to the idea of strengthening unity among the ruling parties by forming the Kaishin. It may be easy to dissolve the group. However, there is a possibility that a dissolution may create discord among the ruling parties. We would like to carefully study the possibility. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Some people pointed out the executive department's responsibility. [Yonezawa] We have to clarify our responsibility for the consequence. There are many ways of assuming responsibility. However, we will follow the general trend within the party. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is a movement within the DSP to cooperate with the Japan New Party [JNP]. [Yonezawa] We are trying to cooperate with the JNP because the JNP and DSP are close in terms of policy matters. Our cooperation may serve as a means to calm down the confusion and restlessness created over the "Kaishin" issue. We are scheduled to have a policy meeting next week to give shape to our cooperation. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It seems that the issue of extending the current Diet session will emerge over the issue of enacting the redistricting bills and other matters. [Yonezawa] The issue of extending the Diet session may develop into a major controversy depending on when the redistricting bills will be submitted. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How do you think the tax system reform will be concluded? [Yonezawa] At each important stage, we need to explain the contents of discussions among the ruling parties to the LDP and the SDPJ. We should maintain our stance of listening to their opinions. We can listen to their opinions while we are still discussing the issue or after we map out our plans. Another method we can adopt to enact tax system reform bills is to form a joint council composed of members of the opposition and ruling parties. [SANKEI SHIBMUN] Do you think actual figures, including tax rates, should be clarified in the bills? [Yonezawa] I think we should clarify figures as much as possible. The best way is to include actual numbers in the bills. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Over the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, some people are talking about the possibility of introducing new laws to deal with emergency situations and about the right of collective self-defense. [Yonezawa] They are obsessed with words without considering the gap with reality. It is a matter of course for the government to be prepared for an emergency no matter what the case may be. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties form a new new party [shin shinto] to help each other in an election under a new system? [Yonezawa] The best way for us is to agree on policy matters and to put up joint candidates rather than trying to eliminate each other. Many SDPJ members think the party has to change. We should attach more importance to forbearance than to cleanliness. We need to unite together.
