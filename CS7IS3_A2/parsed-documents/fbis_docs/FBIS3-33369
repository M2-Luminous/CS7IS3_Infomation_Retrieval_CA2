Asuncion HOY in Spanish, in its 21 February issue, carries on page 3 an unattributed 200-word article quoting Christian Democratic Party President Miguel Angel Montaner denying the breaking of the governability pact. He says: "`To the contrary, the pact has been greatly strengthened; on 19 February, for example, the multiparty negotiating board met in San Bernardino to discuss how to face the social problems.'" The same newspaper, on pages 22 and 23, carries another 300-word unattributed article quoting Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero saying: "The possible breaking of the governability pact announced by PLRA leader Domingo Laino was not the result of an argument in the multiparty negotiating board," whose members met on 19 February in his house in San Bernardino and "where the issue was not mentioned at all." Sanabria Cantero, who learned of Laino's statements through the newspapers, said the multiparty negotiating board will meet again on 21 February to discuss the subject. Also on 21 February, Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish publishes on page 6 a 500-word unattributed article quoting several politicians. Enrique Gonzalez Quintana, second president of the Colorado Party, says: "With or without a pact, the Colorado Party will solve the social crisis." PLRA Deputy Francisco Jose de Vargas states: "The real opposition members will not change their policy because they always fought corruption." PLRA Deputy Blas Llano says the "governability pact may have broken because it did not accomplish anything." PLRA Deputy Luis Delorme states that Laino "changed his attitude regarding the governability pact because he realized that it is not working." Presidential social adviser Oscar Paciello said he does not believe the pact should have been broken "because some of the opposition members are very optimistic about it."
