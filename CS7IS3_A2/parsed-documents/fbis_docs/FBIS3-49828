On that occasion, views were exchanged on the current situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the region and also on the development of friendly relations between the two countries. The American congressmen expressed particular pleasure over the successful cooperation with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the Macedonian Government. The American side reiterated its interest in the preservation of peace and stability in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In the course of the talks yesterday, President Gligorov informed his American guests about a Macedonian request to join NATO, particularly to join the Partnership for Peace initiative. This would be, Gligorov said, an important step forward in the prevention of the spread of war to the south of the Balkans and in securing a higher level of stability and security in the region. In his statement for the local state television, Congressman Murphy [title as received] expressed readiness to deploy fresh additional U.S. Army forces in the UN peace mission, but according to UNPROFOR, there is no reason for such a move.
