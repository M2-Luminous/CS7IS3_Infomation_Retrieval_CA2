ASA President Eldar Salayev and Chairman of the Republic's State Environmental Committee Arif Mansurov, who signed a petition to this effect to the U.N.O., all international organizations, ecologists of contiguous states and foreign embassies in Azerbaijan, said that a request to protect the region from the danger of radioactivity is also contained in resolutions adopted at more than 30 meetings held in Azerbaijan. Participants in the meetings also regard this step as a method of exerting political pressure on Azerbaijan. According to Eldar Salayev, Armenia's location in a seismologically dangerous zone and the lack of conditions for burying radioactive waste within its territory will be conducive to accidents at the plant, which has been constructed according to an out-of-date design. Contamination of such unique reservoires as the Caspian Sea by waters of rivers flowing through Armenia can also prove fatal for human beings, he said. The ASA president recalled that representatives of Turkey and Georgia had also expressed their negative views at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held last year, when the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was openly prepared to finance the repair of the nuclear power plant. At that time scientists of Armenia, who also spoke of the impossibility of restarting the nuclear power plant, had put forward similar arguments after the earthquake in Spitak in 1988, he said.
