There is a chance for a peaceful solution of problems, but swift actions and brave decisions are needed. The United States has the greatest responsibility for the future, President Lech Walesa said today, when greeting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott at the Belweder Palace. According to the president, a chance exists for building unity in Europe, and, "acting together with the United States, we might achieve splendid victories." "It is the United States that is the most important in the battleground at present," Lech Walesa said. Poland is concerned with the remnants of communism and the Warsaw Pact, although, according to the president, there are no major threats. Lech Walesa underscored that West Europe maintains its position and NATO is not expanding. "We have been struggling for 50 years with millions of victims and great financial costs," he said. Poland has devoted the past four years to the search. No great structural changes have been made, and life cannot stand a vacuum, Lech Walesa argued.
