Dialogue is the only reasonable prospect for resolving all the pending issues, otherwise the crisis will worsen and we risk following the tendency toward chaos that has emerged in the Balkans. I believe that we will be able to find a good solution to all the issues dividing us, either by resolving them one by one, or with a package of comprehensive measures." To do this "it is necessary to have a different attitude, as well as the awareness that propaganda and emotionalism harm both parties." Gligorov, along with Bosnian [President] Izetbegovic, was behind the last attempt to save some sort of Yugoslavia (June 1991), which was sabotaged by Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia. Home to a minuscule Serb minority, Macedonia has so far escaped the fate of Bosnia. Nevertheless, we asked him what would happen to a multiethnic (Slav and Albanian) Macedonia if Bosnia too were divided along ethnic lines. He was keen to confirm that Macedonia was different, in that it had a secular tradition of Slav-Albanian cohabitation. So what about the paramilitary network of Albanian separatists discovered in December, along with weapons and a list of 20,000 names? "An isolated incident." Gligorov also thinks that it is "impossible" that Serbia and Albanians from Tirana or Kosovo would settle their territorial quarrels in the same way that Belgrade and Zagreb tried to resolve the Krajina question: i.e., by devouring a third state (in that case Bosnia, in this case Macedonia). Indeed, he is convinced that, despite certain unfavorable prognoses that have appeared in the press (some of which are attributed to the CIA), "there is a prevailing awareness that stability in Macedonia is a condition for peace in the Balkans." For this reason, the United States will also recognize Macedonia.
