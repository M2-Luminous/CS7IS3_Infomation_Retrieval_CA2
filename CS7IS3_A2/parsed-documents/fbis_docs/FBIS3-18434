Tilman Zuelch, the head of the society, said today that although Kinkel had been fully aware of the Croatian human rights violations and war crimes, he had not made any serious efforts to put pressure of the Croatian Government. Zuelch was speaking in connection with a GfbV report submitted to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on Croatian human rights violations against the civilian population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The report accuses Croatian troops in particular of confining and starving 55,000 Muslim deportees and displaced persons in the town of Mostar for months, of razing towns through large-scale bombardment, and of killing hundreds of civilians.
