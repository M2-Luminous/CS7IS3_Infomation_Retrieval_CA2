Jiang Zemin had a 40-minute meeting with a delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. The two sides exchanged views on Sino-Cambodian relations and other issues. On behalf of the Cambodian Government, Ranariddh thanked China for its aid to Cambodia during its transitional period and for its reconstruction. Jiang Zemin said: The visit by the two prime ministers soon after its inauguration shows that the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia attaches great importance to its friendly and cooperative relations with China. The visit, a great event in bilateral relations, will promote mutual understanding and friendship and further advance friendship and cooperation between the two countries in various fields. Ranariddh said that his delegation held fruitful talks with Premier Li Peng yesterday, and that he believed the visit would further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations. Jiang said: In 1993, Cambodia underwent an enormous change of historical significance: After more than 20 years of war, the country has now entered a new period of peaceful reconstruction. This change not only reflected the Cambodian people's common will but also was in line with the major trend of peace and development in the region. The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the Cambodian Government will cherish the hard-won peace, further advance the process of national reconciliation, and mobilize all the Cambodian people to build their country. Ranariddh said: Cambodia has now entered a new period of national unity. Although facing difficulties, Cambodians are optimistic about their future. Under the leadership of King Sihanouk, they will build Cambodia into a country of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and prosperity. Jiang Zemin asked the two prime ministers to relay his best wishes and heartfelt regards to King Sihanouk and the queen. He said: King Sihanouk is the beloved leader of the Cambodian people and respected friend of the Chinese people, and he has made indelible contributions to Cambodia's independence.

Earlier today the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the remains of Chairman Mao Zedong.
