FR940428-1-00051 FR940428-1-00009 (b) Credit for Administrative Costs. Where a grazing association carries out administrative duties as defined in a grazing permit, credits for specified reasonable administrative costs borne by the grazing association may be applied toward the grazing fee. Allowable costs are limited to those costs which the Forest Service would otherwise incur if the grazing association did not perform these tasks. Qualifying costs and activities must be identified in each grazing permit terms and conditions. 3. In §222.53, revise paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(ii) to read as follows: §222.53 Grazing fees in the East_non-competitive procedures. (a) Scope. Except as provided in §222.54, on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States, the fee charged for livestock grazing shall be determined through non-competitive, fair market value procedures. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (ii) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credit for such improvements to be applied toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee, through the terms and conditions of the grazing permit, to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan. Improvements eligible for fee credits involve only costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, are of tangible public benefit, and enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. The cost of maintaining range improvements specified in the terms and conditions of the grazing permit and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits. * * * * * 4. In §222.54, revise paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(3), and (g)(2) to read as follows: §222.54 Grazing fees in the East_competitive bidding. (a) *␣*␣* (1) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on, or after, February 26, 1990, on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments of such lands that have already been established under competitive procedures as of [the effective date of the final rule]. The rules of this section do not apply to temporary grazing permits or permits with on-and-off grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, terms and conditions, and the latest annual operating instructions shall be made available to all prospective bidders upon request. * * * * * (g) *␣*␣* (2) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan through the terms and conditions of the grazing permit. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habit, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in the terms and conditions of the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits. * * * * * Dated: April 20, 1994.
