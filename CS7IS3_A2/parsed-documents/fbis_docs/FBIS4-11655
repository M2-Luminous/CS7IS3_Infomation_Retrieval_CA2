A Palestinian source has told MENA that the two sides will discuss how to reach an agreement on the security arrangements and international protection in Hebron in accordance with Security Council Resolution 904. They will also discuss the possibility of extending these arrangements to the Gaza Strip in view of the deteriorating situation there after the killing of six Palestinians in Gaza two days ago. In its statement to MENA, the Palestinian source noted that the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on the security arrangements, adding that the negotiations are still going on in this regard. A Palestinian-Israeli subcommittee met all night last night to discuss the volatile situation in the occupied territories. The negotiators referred the outcome of their discussion concerning these arrangements and international protection in Hebron and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian leadership in Tunis and the Israeli Government as part of the continued consultations. MENA has learned from sources close to the negotiations that the two delegations have met only when the green light has been received from Tunis. Israeli sources said that Israel has approved of the presence of 100 members of the Palestinian police force and 70 international observers armed with light weapons in Hebron. However, Palestinian sources say the Palestinian delegation has rejected the Israeli proposal.
