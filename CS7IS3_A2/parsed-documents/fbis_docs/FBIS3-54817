Previously, in pre-perestroyka times, any news of another price increase was seen as almost a nationwide tragedy. But now we even make jokes about it: If they assure us that prices will not rise that is the first sign that another leap is imminent. Is that not evidence of mounting optimism? Therefore the news of the New Year "gifts" from the subway workers (a subway trip will cost 50 rubles as of 1 January) and from the municipal employees and communications workers (telephone payments have increased threefold) was received as a stable sign of a market economy making itself felt. Moreover, the statisticians see a positive sign in this response. For instance, a poll of 1,000 Russians held on New Year's Eve by the institute of comparative social studies showed that for the first time in the past three years the majority of those polled believe that the quality of their food intake has not deteriorated, that life last year, although it did not improve, did, in their opinion, stabilize somewhat. The number of "pessimists" believing that the situation has become worse declined to a record level -- 57 percent (71 percent in 1992). Probably they have swelled the numbers of those who believe that life has not changed. And their numbers have increased by one third, reaching 29 percent. The cohort of optimists, whose lives improved last year, has increased by a whole 2 percent. They number 13 percent. As we can see, we have no problems with the growth of optimism. Incidentally, there is no unity either in the economists' camp. Thus, some believe that the multiple increase in prices on the consumer market, inflation, the ruble which has decreased in values tens of times over, and the overwhelming production slump have made Russians' lives considerably worse. But others, including Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar, assert that despite everything their fellow citizens' prosperity has increased tenfold. It is true that they rely not on the opinion of these fellow citizens but on specific figures: Whereas in 1991 Russians' average wages in hard currency equivalent were $7, the figure now is $70. I remember the nostalgic words of a woman of my acquaintance: "I want 1982 and my 120 rubles wages!..." Probably there is something this woman fails to understand. Meanwhile, happy New Year and happy new prices!
