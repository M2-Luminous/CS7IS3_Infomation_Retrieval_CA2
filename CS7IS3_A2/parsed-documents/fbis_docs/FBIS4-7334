"It is an anachronistic dream to try to stifle socialist Korea and establish `domination' over the world with nuclear weapons", he said, urging the United States to withdraw its forces from South Korea. The Action Front of Malaysia in a protest letter to Kim Yong-sam on April 19 wrote that "development of nuclear weapons" by North Korea was, in actuality, a false propaganda invented by the West and that the South Korean authorities must not play into the hands of the United States which is seeking its political interests and hegemonism in Northeast Asia.
