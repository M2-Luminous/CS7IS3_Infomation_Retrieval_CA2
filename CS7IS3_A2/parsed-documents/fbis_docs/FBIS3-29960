In a statement sent to media offices, Sergio Romero, commanding officer of the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB], reiterated his group's threat to "renew attacks" if no "complete and unconditional" rollback is implemented. "It is unjust for the Filipino people the Ramos administration's move to force the enactment of new taxes as a replacement for the removal of the oil levy," Romero's statement said. "We will renew attacks if the government disregards the people's demands," Romero added, but refused to elaborate what kind of attacks the breakaway leftist hit squad is planning. The ABB, which broke off from the leadership of Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison, had claimed responsibility for the 1 February bombings of the offices of Shell and Petron in Makati, and Caltex in Manila. Two security guards of Petron were reported hurt in the bombings, which police said was carried out by four unidentified men using dynamites. The government panel in a 14-man committee looking for alternatives to the levy has recommended new taxes to replace the levy which President Ramos imposed last September. But members of the Kilusang Rollback [KRB; Rollback Movement], a multi-sectoral coalition opposed to the price increase, rejected the proposed new taxes. Leaders of the Freedom from Debt Coalition, one of the groups under the KRB, said the government could find alternatives to the levy without passing new taxes. According to Romero, the collection of additional taxes is a scheme to circumvent the people's demands for a rollback of petroleum prices. Romero added that new taxes are a different form of oppression. He urged the Ramos administration to "stop blackmailing" the people, roll back oil prices unconditionally, and refrain from implementing measures that will only further burden the people. The ABB had warned it will bomb more offices and assassinate officials of the government and the International Monetary Fund if prices were not rolled back permanently. But ABB leaders later said they were temporarily halting all armed operations while various people's organizations are protesting in the streets against the price increase. In its statement, the ABB also criticized the government for allegedly spreading distorted news that linked the armed group to terrorist acts, like the rumored planned bombings of oil depots and other facilities in the Visayas, and the reported coordination between the leftist rebel group and the rightist Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance]. "There is no other objective for these moves except to divide and divert the concentration of the widespread mass movement over the issue of oil and to smear our ranks," Romero said. Police intelligence reports claimed communists in the Visayas planned to bomb power plants, oil depots, and other strategic targets in the region if the government again raised oil prices. Based on the report, the Philippine National Police placed all police units on alert in the entire Visayas. Police personnel were sent to guard places likely to be targets of the bombings. But the standing committee of the CPP Visayas Commission denied the report, saying it is a "blatant lie." Indio Pluma, spokesman of the CPP territorial commission, said the report was just a "black propaganda" against communist rebels in the Visayas. Breakaway communist leaders also branded as a lie a report quoting an unnamed leader of the rightist military rebels as saying the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa provided a cache of explosives to the ABB in 1990.
