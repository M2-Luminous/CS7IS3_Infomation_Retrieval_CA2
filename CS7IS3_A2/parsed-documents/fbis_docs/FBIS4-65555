The division of roles is being carried out at the expense of the Socialists, who are not managing to find their role in the campaign. Thanks to the slogan dreamed up by Jacques Seguela -- "Europe, yes, but with solidarity" -- the Socialist Party [PSF] hoped to reconcile what is irreconcilable: loyalty to the historical ideal of the Left and rejection of the reality of a Community which this same Left has largely helped to construct. The Socialists' aim was to win forgiveness for Maastricht without repudiating their convictions, arouse enthusiasm while integrating the Euro-skepticism of a large section of their electorate, and to promise to repaint the liberal Europe of business in Socialist colors. This is a difficult task which the multiplication of lists has gradually turned into an impossibility for Michel Rocard. And yet, the PSF first secretary tried to protect himself against dangers of which he was fully aware. He took on the role of prophet of doom, in keeping with his natural vocation. His is a role of realism and critical statements. Bernard Kouchner [former Socialist minister] has the role of dreamer. The most famous of the "French doctors" was to give the Socialist list a historical dimension. The intellectuals' plot hatched by Bernard- Henri Levy is likely to deprive the PSF of this breath of fresh air. The indignation expressed yesterday by Jean Glavany, its spokesman, bears witness to the painful shock felt by the Socialists who thought they were protected from such an outrage. Of course, the humanitarian card is not out of date. Bernard- Henri Levy, even with the backing of Andre Glucksmann and Edgar Morin [French philosophers], is still less credible than the former minister [Kouchner]. If only he were there to provide his own defense. At Rue de Solferino [PSF headquarters], they hope that Bernard Kouchner will return from Rwanda quickly enough to meet urgent electoral needs and deter his intellectual friends from carrying out their evil plan. This position must be held. This is all the more vital for the Socialists, because they face competition on all other fronts. Michel Rocard's efforts to rally the Left's anti-Europeans have not enabled him to drown the deafening statements of his rivals. The prime minister, who tried to inaugurate his reign behind the scenes, wanted to launch the European election campaign in the poorest districts. Unfortunately, the working class voters only have eyes for Bernard Tapie! He does not bother with speeches on Europe. He talks to "the people," as Rocard likes to say, about what interests them, and the first secretary cannot even fight him face-to-face. Francois Mitterrand would be offended and Jack Lang [former Socialist minister] would certainly make that known. Michel Rocard cannot even give in to systematic opposition. The "other policy" is represented by Jean-Pierre Chevenement [former Socialist minister] or the Communist Party: left-wing voters are spoiled for choice. And, above all, the tone of protest does not suit the advocate of "telling the truth," be it on Europe or anything else. You cannot change who you are.
