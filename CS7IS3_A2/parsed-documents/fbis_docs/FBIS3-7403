The demand was aired to the Korean delegation during the latest March 14-18 negotiations under the auspices of the Council Working Party 6 of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which wound up without any agreement. The EU and Japan, in a joint statement to the full session of the OECD group March 17, voiced deep concern that the negative consequences of a renewed "overcapacity following the Korean government's decision to remove a temporary ban on capacity expansion by Korean shipbuilders." "An increase in capacity of Korean shipbuilders, which would in no way be justified by the reality of the market, would seriously undermine the purpose of the Revised General Guideline for Government Policies in the shipbuilding industry and the shipbuilding agreement currently under negotiation to aim at ensuring a balanced market for a return to normal competitive conditions," said the statement made available here. It recalled that "such an increase existed in the 1970s and 1980s where, at a time of deep crisis, when a majority of producing countries were reducing substantially their capacities, important new capacities were installed in Korea." In another statement to the shipbuilding session, the United States called for Korea to clarify its intention to neither contribute to the planned expansion nor extricate the industry from any difficulties that expansion may cause in future. The Korean delegation explained to the member countries that Korea's shipbuilding rationalization program, introduced in 1989, expired at the end of 1993 as scheduled, but not the Korean government's lifting of restraints on facility expansion by Korean shipbuilders as claimed by other members, according to the ministry officials. Korean delegates said the Korean government is now promoting deregulation and market-opening measures, and it is now finding it difficult to take any action against private investment plans, they said. Explaining the negotiations to reporters, a ministry official said Korea promised to the participating member countries that the Korean government would not provide any financial support in honor of the multilateral shipbuilding regime of the OECD and it could not bail out any Korean shipbuilders even if they suffered financial difficulties caused by their expansion plan. An estimation, made by Japan and the EU, that the global shipbuilding supply will exceed demand by 7 million to 9 million gross tons to 26 million gross tons in 1995, has yet to be verified, however, he said. The official said local shipbuilders appear to be following overblown expansion plans because of local rivalry, adding that the government would work out countermeasures after a cooling-off period it said is needed to cool down competition among them. The ministry will ask local shipbuilders to refrain from excessive competition and inform them that the government will not take any relief measures in favor of ailing companies, he said.
