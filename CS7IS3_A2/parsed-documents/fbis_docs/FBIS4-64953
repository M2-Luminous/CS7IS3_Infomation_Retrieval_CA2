Kartal said he told Demirel that the problems which Turkey was experiencing were political and would increase. Kartal said that the lawsuit against five DEP deputies and an independent deputy who were under arrest had not yet been opened, that he had mentioned that issue to Demirel and that Demirel was disturbed and told him that he would discuss this with Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay and take the necessary initiatives. Kartal, who is a deputy from Van, said he told Demirel that the Kurdish issue was the source of all the crises in Turkey, that Turkey's current crisis was political and would continue to escalate, that he and his colleagues had earlier expressed that opinion and that the matter should be solved from legal, administrative and constitutional aspects. Kartal said he also told Demirel: ``Our party is facing the danger of closure. We can solve the matter. We are ready to assume all kinds of responsibility. Our party is a chance if the country intends to solve the Kurdish matter. ``Closure of the party will block the democratic path. Legal changes are needed to be made for the removal of barriers in front of freedom of expression and politics. ``This matter cannot be solved with blood; the state cannot solve it with arms. They are also the people of this country like the policemen or soldiers who are being killed. An unarmed and bloodless solution should certainly be put into force.'' Kartal added that he received the impression that at present the higher echelons of the state were not taking any action regarding the solution of the Kurdish issue.
