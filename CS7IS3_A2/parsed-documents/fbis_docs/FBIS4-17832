Kambulov, deputy chairman of "Chernobyl Assembly," by Andrey Illesh; place and date not given: "Chernobyl: "Eliminators And Businessmen"] [Excerpt] Biographical details: Igor Nikolayevich Kambulov was born in 1914. A mechanical engineer, he is a graduate of the Bauman Higher Technical School in Moscow. He worked at Chernobyl in 1986, looking for discharged fuel, looking for seepage into the reactor shaft, setting up diagnostic equipment amid the ruins of the reactor after it had exploded. In 1987-1989 he led the full-scale survey team. As a result of the team's work, dozens of holes were bored in places where there were concentrations of fuel and it was established where the nuclear fuel was, how much there was, and what condition it was in, making it possible to arrive at conclusions concerning the safety of the nuclear facility (another explosion was ruled out). I. Kambulov is currently deputy chairman of the "Chernobyl Assembly" association. [Illesh] Igor, your guys were known as "stalkers." It sounded highly deferential at the time.... [Kambulov] Mine and the others -- everyone who worked on the site near the reactor and inside the sarcophagus (you must remember that together they crawled around the entire "Cover" structure, from top to bottom) really was respected at the station. But once they had left.... ...I would remind you that among our compatriots affected by the Chernobyl disaster there is a legal category of citizens who participated in the elimination of the consequences of the disaster inside the exclusion zone or were involved in maintenance or other work at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. Colloquially they are known as "eliminators." There are around 600,000 of them in the country. Why so many? The vast majority is made up of those who were connected with the construction of the "Cover" structure and the clearing up of the nuclear power station site and buildings for the startup of the three power units that were still alive. These people had a hard time then and life is not sweet even now! The state (in the shape of its leaders) made decisions that the obedient citizens carried out without asking themselves: Who needs this, and why? It is necessary, and that's all there is to it.... [Illesh] But was there any point in sending so many people to Chernobyl? [Kambulov] That is just it, there was indeed no need to send hundreds of thousands of people to that radioactive garbage pit. Certainly, the station had to be shut down right away, you cannot put together any kind of "cover" immediately, you have to think about it for two-three years (during that time the radiation background will have diminished tens of times over), and only then begin the requisite work in a calm and organized manner. It would have saved so many lives and so many people's health. Not to mention money. They would not have had to clear away the radioactive garbage with spades and handbarrows, nor would have billions been poured into the construction of Slavutich, the power workers' city in a cesium blackspot, doomed to die, since the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Staiton would close anyway. [Illesh] Fine, but build they did, and what did they build? [Kambulov] As for the "sarcophagus" (officially, "Cover"), as someone who has studied everything that remains of the fourth unit, from top to bottom, I can say that the structure does not give anyone much in the way of protection and does not cover anything. It was intended to protect the building, mangled by explosions and conflagrations, from prying eyes. The "Cover" is fine as decoration. But you could read a book inside it -- it is so light as a result of a multitude of fissures. The roof is riddled with holes. The interchange of air with the environment is also in "full working order...." But how they built, how they went at it! In the frantic chase for honors there was no time to think about human beings, who were sent to the unit in their hundreds to do their futile work and get a dose of radiation. Criminal case No. 18/926-92 concerning instances of misconduct and negligence during the elimination of the aftermath of the accident did not come out of nowhere.... [passage omitted]
