This statement was made over the weekend by Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the founder of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The shaykh was speaking to his attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik Dahamshah, in response to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' assertion that Yasin could be released if he were to express support for the peace process. Yasin said he rejects any conditions being set for his release; however, he supports a just peace process. Tomorrow will mark five years since the disappearance of soldier Ilan Sa'adon. In reaction to statements made by the Sa'adon family, Shaykh Yasin asserted this week that he does not know the whereabouts of the soldier's body. The shaykh claimed he only learned of the murder after the fact.
