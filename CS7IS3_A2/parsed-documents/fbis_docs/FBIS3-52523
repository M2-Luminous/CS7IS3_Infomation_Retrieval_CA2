I covered several important topics that I felt is my duty to explain to the brothers, the comrades in arms, and the soldiers of the Arabs. [passage omitted] This country is the heart of the greater Arab homeland. This country is the homeland of the emigrants [Meccans who emigrated to Medina in the early period of Islam] and the followers [Medinan followers of Prophet Muhammad who granted him refuge]. God willing, this country will remain the example to be followed in terms of patience, forbearance, and clear vision for all its sons at all stages. We all safeguard national unity with our souls, our minds, and our logic, and with an eagerness to give a good and unique example to the generations to come of the big meeting that unites the one march. I have said on more than one occasion, and I mean what I say, that any party which seeks to harm national unity in this country -- any individual who seeks to do this -- will be my foe until the end. [passage omitted] In the past, and over the past few days, I spoke more than enough about the atmosphere in which we live and the difficult circumstances we experience. I spoke about the peace process to which we are committed, about a comprehensive and just peace, and the peace that will give the generations to come an opportunity to live a free, dignified life in a secure and stable atmosphere and that will unleash their potential creativity. It is a peace we will not fear if we are armed with awareness, determination, and resolve and, as is the case, if we are the sons of a rich experience. I also spoke about this decisive stage with respect to the need to put emphasis on Arab action and coordination, starting with Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. I spoke out of my concern for the kinsfolk and the brothers in the occupied territories. We have lived and experienced with them difficult and harsh circumstances along their path of steadfastness on their land and their resolve to cling to it. This stage requires the Palestinian command to choose and to clearly define the features of its march. We firmly believe that this leadership will reflect what is in the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and elsewhere, and that it is rising to the level that will enable it to carry out its duty and great role in serving the people on the road to the attainment of their aspirations and hopes concerning their full rights on their national soil. Naturally, this could happen through the scenario we hope for, and in a way where this leadership represents this people and continues to serve them in the occupied territories, and in a way where this leadership reassures the kinsfolk and brothers that it has reached both the stage and level at which it is both for and from all Palestinians. Regarding the relationship with us, we are proceeding on a path that our fathers and grandfathers followed. We broke bread together. I am talking here about this one people and this one large family, not only in Jordan but in both Palestine and Jordan. We have suffered and continue to suffer together. In this phase, we must reach a situation whose features are clear, so we can know what is ours and they can know what is theirs, and all of us can know what is incumbent upon us. In my opinion, what is being proposed is: Either they seek our backing--and we are ready to offer it, just as we have always done from the very beginning--or the other alternative, which I need not discuss. As for us here in Jordan, when things go well, God willing, only then will the choice be presented for those who wish to stay with us or to choose another road. One can then make up their mind, and their choice will be respected. Until then, national unity, democracy, and human rights here should be preserved. This will not be for a limited period, but will be the beginning of a serious march with an ongoing objective, God willing. This country, God willing, is a symbol and a model for the brothers in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world, and everywhere. We spoke about Jerusalem. Jerusalem is in the hearts and the minds of all of us, and it will continue to be that way. I presented my remarks and ideas on the situation and the seriousness of this stage, and I voiced my concern that our relations with our sacred shrines -- and the shrines in Jerusalem in general -- or the responsibilities for them, may be affected in one way or another as a result of some development or circumstances. In order to avoid a new vacuum, as was the case after 1974, concerning Jerusalem and the shrines, we explained our view and suggestion. We are continuing our duty as best we can toward Jerusalem, which is in our hearts and the minds. We will never forget Jerusalem for one moment. We talked about what has been proposed with regard to confederation and related issues. As I asked the Palestinian leadership to drop this word from its lexicon, I will drop it from my lexicon also, as of this meeting, not because I do not believe that this people is one people, but because I believe that this people, here and there, are the owners of the decision. The decision with regard to the form of the future relationship is not imposed by any party or any group of people -- neither in the Palestinian arena nor here. After the return of the land to its people and owners, the decision on this issue will be made in the future in an atmosphere of democracy, freedom, respect for human rights, and participation in decisionmaking. God willing, the meeting [al-liqa'] will take place in one way or another on solid and firm ground with absolute confidence and accurate knowledge that this Jordan has always been for Palestine and that Jordan has never had any ambitions toward it. It has always assumed its duties as King Husayn I and King 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn assumed their duties. We have been performing this duty until today. Then, any formula that comes up will be the accepted and agreed upon formula through convergence of opinion -- whether the choice was made here or there. Therefore, all these will become guarantees to safeguard the march from what it will face in the future. Our talk in the past about this issue aimed at enabling our brothers to reach what they have reached and to shoulder the responsibilities they accepted in order to represent the Palestinian Arab people in terms of their rights. We were, we are, and we will continue to be committed to our stand with regard to the Rabat summit resolution -- regardless of any other consideration -- because our kinsfolk and brothers, the owners of this right, opted for this road. We supported them and we will continue to support with all our potential. We hope that it was a method that helped them reach the situation in which they represent themselves in the world. We ask God to help them maintain their credibility toward all their commitments. I am not speaking in general terms here, I am talking in particular about what concerns us here in Jordan. In other words, I hope that within a short period of time we will reach a clear, common view regarding all important issues. We will adhere to our pledges. We have always kept our pledges. However, if things remain as they were, particularly since we endured a great deal, this will be a risky thing not only with regard to Palestine, the cause and rights on Palestinian soil, but also with regard to Jordan. I have a great hope that during this period -- I said Tuesday, it seems now that it might be Wednesday or Thursday...[pauses] Without sincerity and cooperation to serve people and the cause, I do not believe we can proceed and wait forever. We are very concerned about assuming our duty and role. We hope that we will be in a position in which we can achieve this. We are aware of the burdens and responsibilities shouldered by this Palestinian leadership in this delicate stage. However, these are responsibilities that it opted to shoulder. With God's help, it will reach the level in which we can support it in all details and matters that must be tackled by all of us. We hope that it is seen in the world as a responsible party that represents all those it is shouldering the responsibility of representing. We hope that it will be flanked with the great human resources that are available in the arena and will be credible so that it will be able to move ahead, God willing, and so that all these initial developments will be the beginning of reaching the aspired objectives, with God's help. I spoke about coordination with our brothers, and this is something that is taking place with our brothers in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. Again, if the Arab trend has been toward a comprehensive solution, then we have kept our commitment to work for a comprehensive solution. If some thought that this country, for one reason or another, and due to the burden and responsibilities it is bearing, might choose a different path, such expectations have not been realized, praise be to God. A sisterly Arab country had concluded a peace treaty with Israel. We all agreed on the same objective when we agreed to go to Madrid. The Palestinian brothers--of whom we are part, whom we supported, and for whom we shouldered the responsibility until 1974--chose to shoulder the responsibility. This decision received an all-out Arab blessing. We were committed to a similar position toward them, and we will continue to be so. They have chosen to go with us, even formally in a certain stage when the umbrella was there, before we threw it in the wastebasket of history, and before they directly shouldered their responsibilities. Now, we are continuing our search and efforts, and everyone knows that since 1974 we have followed a clear path. We have been committed to a firm position. Neither before 1974, nor since the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 242 -- which the PLO accepted alongside Resolution 338 as the basis of what is going on now, nor after the disengagement of administrative and legal links with the West Bank, did we ever bargain for one moment on a grain of the Palestinian soil or any of the Palestinian rights on Palestinian soil. Our position has been the same since 1974, and we have been supporting the PLO position from 1974 until now. A greeting to all the sons of the homeland, under all circumstances, at this critical stage. A greeting of pride and appreciation. At the same time, we take pride in those who shouldered their serious and sensitive responsibilities under these circumstance by representing Jordan in the peace talks from the beginning when a national decision was made to go to Madrid. In every circumstance they were brave men who did not fear meeting with others, working for the sake of our interests, and preserving the right to live for the people and the whole nation. We hope that matters will move toward a comprehensive solution with the participation of all sides, stage after stage, and in light of the fact that we all have proceeded from the same point. I have previously mentioned, and I reiterate it now, that despite all pressures, we in this country are not prepared to sign a peace treaty unless we deal with all issues and matters in a satisfactory and balanced way acceptable to us and to the other party. When all these issues are dealt with, peace will follow in the final analysis or be the beginning for a new stage in which every one lives in security and stability and in which doors are opened wide, God willing, to progress and development for people to live in circumstances from which we were deprived from the beginning. We concentrate on land, water, human rights, and all the topics included in the agenda that we have endorsed in support of progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track. As you all know, we stayed behind, waiting for something. A surprise followed, and we decided to approve the agenda pertaining to the issues between Jordan and Israel. We also described the Palestinian step as courageous, and we hoped the leadership would rise to the required level. We hope that the Palestinian arena will be one in which all people meet with clear vision and unity in this critical situation. At the end of this meeting, I repeat my thanks to and appreciation for all the brothers, and I hope you will convey my heartfelt greetings to all the brothers who share your responsibilities in your various fields, as well as our love for and pride in you. We are part of this great march, which will achieve, with God's help, all its goals. God bless you, and God's peace be upon you. [applause]
