FR940105-0-00019 FR940105-0-00005 Subsequently, Honeywell Inc. has issued Service Bulletin 4066010&hyph;34&hyph;SW16, dated December 20, 1993. The service bulletin describes procedures for converting certain TCAS II computer units to new units (Version 6.04A). The new units incorporate all of the logic changes specified in the preamble to the notice, including updating CAS logic, modifying the computer surveillance logic to ensure that these units accommodate Mode C altitude input of 100-foot increments, and ensuring that the system will be tracked and coordinated by intruding aircraft when the Mode S transponder CA field is set at CA=7. The conversion is onboard-loadable, or it may be accomplished at a field repair shop. The first method involves data loading the TCAS II computer unit in the aircraft equipment bay using an ARINC 615 or 603 data loader. The second method entails performing a final test, and then programming the TCAS II computer unit to convert it to the latest enhanced version at a field repair shop. The notice proposed that operators accomplish the modification requirements of this AD in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. However, the FAA has reviewed and approved the Honeywell service bulletin discussed previously, and has determined that accomplishment of this service bulletin is an appropriate method of compliance. Consequently, the FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite the Honeywell service bulletin as the appropriate source of service information, and has removed the language referring to accomplishing the actions ``in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.'' Even though this language has been deleted from paragraph (a), operators may still be permitted to accomplish the actions in accordance with an FAA-approved method under the provisions of paragraph (c) of the final rule. In light of this new data and software developement, the FAA has revised the final rule by changing the reference to Mitre letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0056, dated July 20, 1993, which appeared in paragraph (a)(1) of the NPRM, to Mitre letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993, since the latter identifies the enhanced software package. Since the original Version 6.04A software was never issued, no operator could have installed that version. Therefore, no redundant actions would be required on the part of any operator as a result of this change. Since the enhanced Version 6.04A software introduces a change in the operation of the aircraft, the FAA also finds that a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) is necessary as a conforming change to correspond with that new software configuration. The AFM revision is advisory only, and will ensure that the flight crew is aware of the changes associated with the new software installation. Consequently, paragraph (b) has been added to the final rule to reflect this informational AFM revision. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received in response to the notice: One commenter, Honeywell, objects to the proposed compliance date of December 30, 1993, and states that December 31, 1994, represents a more realistic compliance timeframe. Honeywell indicates that operators vary in their ability to load the updated software due to maintenance and aircraft schedules and data-load/test resources. Honeywell states that, although it has been working aggressively to implement the latest change, that change has resulted in a delay in the date operators will be able to implement the latest change. Several other commenters also request that the FAA extend the proposed compliance date from 3 to 18 months after the date specified in the proposal in order to accommodate implementation, verification, certification, and incorporation of the proposed software change into existing installations. One commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, supports implementation of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A, and requests that the FAA issue a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose that this revised software be retrofitted by June 30, 1995. ATA contends that significant differences exist between Version 6.04A and the latest enhanced version. Another commenter requests that the FAA solicit comments from foreign agencies participating in TCAS evaluation and simulations to help ensure that the proposed Version 6.04A revision will be compatible and acceptable. The FAA concurs partially with these requests to extend the compliance time. The FAA has considered the safety implications, the time necessary for approval of the enhanced Version 6.04A software, the size of the fleet, and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of implementation of the modification. In light of these considerations, the FAA has determined that a compliance date of December 31, 1994, is appropriate. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to specify the revised compliance date. However, in response to the requests that a supplemental NPRM be issued and that further public comments be solicited, the FAA submits the following. Comments received in response to the proposal reflect unanimous support for implementation of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A software. The FAA considers the logic change (reduction of unnecessary crossing RA's) incorporated in the enhanced software to be a minor change. The intent of this AD is to require that the addressed unsafe condition be corrected by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated CAS logic. The FAA has determined that a requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement, will meet that intent, will not alter the substance of the rule, and will impose no additional burden on any member of the public. Additionally, issuance of a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional months. In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original NPRM, the FAA concludes that solicitation of further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate.
