FR940622-2-00042 FR940622-2-00031 [OPP&hyph;50792; FRL&hyph;4869&hyph;3] Receipt of Notification of Intent to Conduct Small-Scale Field Testing; Genetically Modified Microbial Pesticides AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received from Ciba-Geigy Corp. a notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing on cotton, vegetables and ornamentals in Florida, Mississippi, California, and New York with genetically modified strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from roots of cotton plants grown in Texas. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA. Information submitted and any comment(s) concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment(s) that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice to the submitter. Information on the proposed test and any written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 246 at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Steve Robbins, Acting Product Manager (PM-21), Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 227, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA, (703)-305-6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's ``Statement of Policy; Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act'' of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received from Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419. The purpose of the proposed testing is to evaluate the efficacy of five genetically modified strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens MOCG-0134 which are designated as MOCG-0134-137, MOCG-0134-E11, MOCG-0134-8392, MOCG-0134-2215, and MOCG-0134-6720. The genetic modifications have been limited to the use of plasmid and transposon vectors to deliver genetic information that is resident within the wild-type strain (MOCG-0134). Testing would be conducted to determine the efficacy of these strains for control of certain soil-borne pathogens of cotton, vegetables (including potatoes and green beans) and various ornamental plants. The proposed field tests would be conducted at Ciba-Geigy research stations located in Florida, Mississippi, New York, and California on a total area of less than 10 acres. A previous notification was submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corp. on March 22, 1993. The purpose of the proposed testing was to evaluate the efficacy of a genetically-modified strain (CGA-267356) of an indigenous strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens , strain MOCG-0134, isolated from roots of cotton plants grown in Texas, for the control of soil-borne pathogens of cotton, vegetables and ornamentals. The review of that notification was not completed because there was insufficient information to allow for adequate evaluation by the public in the releasable version of the notification.
