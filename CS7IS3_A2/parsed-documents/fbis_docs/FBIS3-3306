After the founding of new China, in order to protect wildlife in keeping with the relevant state provisions, the Ministry of Forestry, along with the Ministry of Public Security and the other relevant departments, have gradually tightened management on the production, sale, and use of hunting guns, thus promoting the development of undertakings to protect wildlife. Being a special product, hunting guns can inflict casualties, however. There is not an accurate statistical figure on the number of hunting guns across the country, but the actual number of hunting guns in the hands of the people is quite considerable. Data from the public security departments show there are well over 300,000 hunting guns in Hunan Province and approximately 110,000 in Hainan Province. The management of guns used for hunting involves a wide range of issues and is very difficult. This, plus the lack of perfect rules and regulations to manage hunting guns in the past, has led to many problems in the production, sale, and use of these guns. There have been frequent cases of wanton killing and hunting of wildlife involving hunting guns. In 1989, the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province killed a male northwestern Chinese tiger with a refitted hunting gun. In the same year, Gao Guanghua and three other peasants from Mayingzi township in Luanping County, Hebei Province, killed a leopard with hunting guns in Beijing's Miyun County. After conducting extensive investigation and study, the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Public Security jointly drafted and formulated the "Procedures of the PRC for the Management of Hunting Guns." The promulgation and implementation of these procedures indicate that China has begun the process of institutionalizing the management of hunting guns. The procedures have great significance for the normal production, sale, and use of hunting guns and for preventing their use in illegal and criminal activities, for protecting wild life resources, and for safeguarding public order.
