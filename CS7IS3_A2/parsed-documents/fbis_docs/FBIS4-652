FBIS4-652 "drafr072_d_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-072 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Madagascar President on Destabilization, Diplomatic Involvement President on Destabilization, Diplomatic Involvement EA1304180994 Antananarivo Radio Madagascar Network in Malagasy 1600 GMT 11 Apr 94 EA1304180994 Antananarivo Radio Madagascar Network Malagasy BFN [Excerpts] We begin with an item related to yesterday's special edition of "Sava-Ravina" ["Close Examination," Sunday radio program], which all of us probably listened to. Our guest was Professor Albert Zafy, the president of the Republic, who discussed the current state of national affairs for more than two hours. One of the topics he touched on during the program was the disruptive acts being perpetrated by some people in the country, acts which President Albert Zafy described as acts of destabilization. The head of state said yesterday that these acts of destabilization as well as those perpetrating them had many facets. He especially stressed that foreigners, local people, and foreigners in collusion with local people were among those involved in perpetrating these acts. We have this evening received news concerning foreigners in collusion with local people. It is now known that, once again, there is an important foreign ambassador, still working and living in our country, who is attempting to disrupt the country. In other words, he is indulging in what is called destabilization. According to news which reached us, the foreign diplomat is known to have toured various provinces during the series of elections held in the country in 1993, supporting at that time and still supporting, people who were not officially elected during these elections. Investigations are now being held and evidence shows that the foreign diplomat is really indulging in acts aimed at preventing the head of state from carrying out his duty. This is what is called conspiracy. There are even some top officials of the former regime who, according to what we have learned, are spreading rumors and even boasting that they would inevitably return to power. [passage omitted] Not long ago, during a ceremony held on the occasion of the launching of Radio France International, RFI, many of our country's leaders including President Albert Zafy himself talked to RFI journalists. The president also mentioned this destabilization on that occasion which this foreign diplomat was trying to bring about in Madagascar. President Albert Zafy, however, at that time, pointed out that it was not the foreign country which was the subject of his concern but the behavior of its ambassador in Madagascar. If we broaden our analysis, we may deduce that what happened in Togo, Rwanda, and Burundi, for example, may be considered as destabilization acts similar to those we are now experiencing in Madagascar. Those acts caused the death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. We will all be monitoring the developments of this affair. What is worth noting is that there are acts of destabilization being perpetrated in our country by some local people or foreigners or foreigners in collusion with local people. We all have to be vigilant.
