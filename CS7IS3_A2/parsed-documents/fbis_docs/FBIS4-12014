Al-Sahhaf met with the Egyptian, Jordanian, and Moroccan foreign ministers in a bid to improve Iraqi-Arab ties. Minister al-Sahhaf said that his country will be pleased to receive any Egyptian official who wishes to visit Baghdad in an attempt to normalize relations. The Iraqi foreign minister accused Israel of arming and training the Kurds in Northern Iraq to destabilize the security and stability of Iraq. Al-Sahhaf called for a stiffer Arab boycott of Israel until the latter stops its arbitrary practices in the occupied territories and respects the resolutions of the UN Security Council and international legitimacy. Al-Sahhaf said that his country implemented most UN Security Council resolutions. He denied that Iraq holds any Kuwaiti detainees, inviting Arab teams to visit Iraq to see for themselves.
