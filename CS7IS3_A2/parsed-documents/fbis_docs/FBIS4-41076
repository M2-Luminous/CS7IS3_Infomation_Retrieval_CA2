On 21 June, Lieutenant General Vardiko Nadibaidze, defense minister of the Republic of Georgia, received Kent Brown, U.S. ambassador to Georgia, who was accompanied by high-ranking officials from the U.S. Department of Defense. The meeting was attended by Major General Nodar Tatarashvili, chief of the General Staff. The defense minister told guests about changes in the Armed Forces, which had begun following his appointment as minister. The main purpose of these changes is to create a small but capable and modern Georgian Army. In order to attain this difficult objective, we are receiving a great deal of assistance from our partners--the command of the Russian troops in the Transcaucasus. However, we would also be pleased to receive assistance from our U.S. colleagues and are ready to cooperate with them within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace program in order to safeguard peace in the region, Nadibaidze said. At the end of the meeting, the minister thanked guests for the visit and for the attention that the United States was giving to Georgia and its army construction, adding that contacts between the the two countries' military would develop further.
