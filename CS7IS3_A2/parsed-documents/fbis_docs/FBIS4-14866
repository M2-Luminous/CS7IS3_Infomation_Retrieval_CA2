What Is New About It?"] [Excerpts] Military councils have always existed. Or, at least, they have existed since the olden days. In all wars, there have always been occasions when military leaders have deemed it necessary to submit their plans for upcoming battles for discussion with their commanders. But right until the 17-19th centuries, commanders and commanders-in-chief only convened military councils occasionally. Remember, for example, the famous military council convened by M.I. Kutuzov in Fili [village outside Moscow] in 1812. [passage omitted] In accordance with the Russian Federation president's edict dated 1 September 1993, which ratifies the Statute on Military Councils, these have been given the status of permanently operating consultative organs. They are formed in the Armed Forces, the Border Guard, Internal, and Railroad Troops, and government communications troops. In addition to commanders of the relevant formations, whose deputies belong to the councils ex officio, and also other officials from organs of military administration, the Russian Federation president includes representatives of state structures in them. One of the main tasks of the present-day military councils is to elaborate recommendations in spheres such as maintaining the troops in combat and mobilization readiness, strengthening organization and discipline, and the selection and placing of personnel. But after all, even in the past these questions were frequently reviewed at sittings of military councils. So what has changed? Let us look at practice. The Strategic Missile Forces which, incidentally, started to elaborate a state-of-the-art concept of the activity of military councils even before the decree currently in force was issued, carefully analyzed their work in formations, and then turned to the archives and discovered an interesting detail. The same shortcomings were revealed as had existed three, five, and even 10 years ago. The basic spheres of the work of the military councils in the operational echelon were determined from above by circulars. The standard set of mandatory questions moved from one plan to the next, and decrees were adopted on them. But the main point is that when attempts were made to find traces of their practical implementation in the relevant services, these were not discovered. That is, the same "collective responsibility" stamped its mark on everything -- in reality, collective irresponsibility. In order to break the vicious circle, the attitude to the planning of the military councils' work needed to be changed first and foremost. Of course, programmed areas of the troops' activity exist, and their examination may be recommended from above. But the main point is that the commander, like the chairman of the military council, should have a free hand, because he knows his formation's problems better than other people do. The actual sittings, the majority of which are visiting sittings, have also started being prepared in a new way. They are held directly in divisions and units. Practical studies on the questions being discussed are being conducted in parallel with commanders and chiefs of services. Urgent measures to back up combat training and the troops' vital activity are also adopted on the spot. But it is known that even the best decisions may remain on paper only if a mechanism for their implementation is not worked out. That is why the orders and directives being issued on the results of the work of military councils and being sent to the appropriate services and Strategic Missile Forces directorates also contain provisions enabling the adopted decisions to be implemented. A constructive attitude to work is also characteristic of the military council of the Ground Forces. Let us take the problem of protecting the lives and health of the personnel. The measures being adopted in the troops have made it possible to reduce the number of injuries among the personnel by 39 percent last year, and the number of deaths by 28 percent. However, the military council was not satisfied with this. At its recent sitting, it elaborated specific recommendations for the accident-free use of equipment and weapons in order to reduce injuries to people. The question of ensuring the safekeeping of weapons and ammunition, which is directly linked to this, was also examined. With the great shortage of manpower, there has been reliance upon the more intensive commissioning of security equipment and facilities at military installations and weapons dumps. However, military councils' tasks in the present conditions are not just limited to internal problems in the troops. Every military formation is stationed on the administrative territory of a specific republic or kray, and the implementation of Russian Federation normative acts and the social and legal protection of the servicemen depends in many respects on how well the work of the military councils with the local authorities is organized. Measures such as the organization of the defense of the territories, the region's communications, mobilization, and the draft to military service, and military training courses cannot be resolved by either local authorities or military formations on their own. And what about strictly everyday questions?! A kray or oblast counts on the military's assistance in the gathering of the harvest, and the latter, for their part, ask for housing to be subsidized.... The list of problems which must be resolved by both is long, but the whole question is how resolvable they are at all amid the current shortage of everything -- both for the military and for the local authorities. Nevertheless, it turns out that if the will is there you can achieve a lot. The activity of the military councils of the Moscow, Volga, North Caucasus, Urals, and certain other [military] districts confirms this. The coordinated work of the councils with the organs of representative and executive power, as well as -- and this is also very important -- good personal contacts, make it possible to settle a lot of vitally important questions. This is not just limited to mutual services, if you can put it like that: We give you apartments, you give us a work force. Concern for invalids and veterans of war and labor, the establishment of ties of sponsorship between enterprises and military units, the military-patriotic education of young people -- these things are classed as state-level. Of course it is six months since the military councils have been working the new way, which is not a very long period of time, but it seems that this is long enough for the first shoots of the new work to be seen. Experience suggests that a military council should specifically be a council of the military, as it was conceived at the very beginning. As such it will raise the prestige of the commander and will make it possible for his personality to be revealed, and it will strengthen the positions of one-man command. As such it will be in a position to elaborate genuinely necessary recommendations on all important spheres, ranging from the practical implementation of military policy in the troops and fleets, to ordinary everyday concerns.
