This event is in the center of attention now. We would like your comments on this event? [Jovanovic] As the Federal Government has already said in its statement, we deeply regret this act of the international organization, which used NATO to legitimize an act of aggression against the Serbian people and to carry out air strikes on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina close to our borders. The international organization has significantly compromised itself with this act and [words indistinct] for continuing the role of peacekeeper and impartial arbiter in the otherwise complex and contradictory Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. We are deeply concerned about this irresponsible and risky act, which borders on a military adventure because it actually marks the crossing of the Rubicon, after which nothing is clear any longer and nothing can be foreseen with any degree of certainty. We believe that those who have made this decision will soon realize their mistake and will withdraw the decision on the further engagement of NATO air power. For us, this act presents not only a threat to the peace process and a hindrance to the negotiations that should lead to the signing of an agreement on the absolute cessation of all hostilities, but also a new, very dangerous escalation whose consequences cannot in practice be entirely calculated and for which the international organization has taken all the responsibility. On the other hand, Gorazde has been taken as a reason and excuse for the engagement of NATO military forces, while at the same time, nothing is said as to why in this so-called safe haven Muslim forces still have not been demilitarized, and why Gorazde, as a zone, has been used as a [word indistinct] for the beginning of a massive military offensive by the east Bosnian corps against the Serbs in a number of places, and not only in the immediate vicinity of Gorazde. Therefore, if anyone has violated the provisions of the agreement and the resolution on safe havens, and certain provisions of the [UN] Charter, then it is precisely those who have called upon NATO to act. Therefore, no one can deny that with this act, NATO and the international organization have interfered in the civil war on one side and against the Serb side. All this greatly complicates the situation and makes it difficult to maintain the peace process and revive it with greater chances of ending the war and reaching a lasting political solution. [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, I would like to ask you one thing. What do you expect of other international factors that have not been consulted on all of this -- I have Russia primarily in mind. President Yeltsin's statement implies that the UN Security Council was not even consulted on all of this? [Jovanovic] Not only was it not consulted, it was circumvented. Certain provisions of a certain resolution were applied here that allegedly authorize the secretary general and other high officials of the international organization in Bosnia-Herzegovina to make the decision to use NATO forces on the spot. This is only one of the many interpretations possible, and whenever you have the possibility of diverse interpretations, it means that the one that has been highlighted is not enough to warrant making such an important decision. [sentence as heard] As far as I know, Russia objected to the NATO ultimatum [on Sarajevo] for precisely the same reasons, and I take President Yeltsin's statement as a continuation of Russia's dissatisfaction that the Security Council has been circumvented, and in this way, the voice and opinion of Russia as a great European and world power that has historical and other interests in its Balkan neighborhood. On the other hand, with these hazardous actions, the world organization itself has rather facilely become an instrument for the realization of aims and interests of the individual great powers and a group of countries, which is also a dangerous precedent as this could be repeated tomorrow in some other situation and in other places. Therefore, it is time for the international community, above all the smaller and medium-sized countries, seriously to study this problem and ask themselves where the international community is heading and what such irresponsible behavior means from an organization whose main aim is to preserve peace and security, that is, to carry out a peace-making role, and not expand military activities and escalate a civil war that threatens to assume the proportions of a wider-scale confrontation. Therefore, we want to believe that reason will nevertheless prevail in the minds of those who so irresponsibly headed into an adventure, and that they will also realize that peace cannot be reached through war, but through peace, and particularly through stopping any kind of war. Therefore we support the demands by the Bosnian Serbs, as well as all other people who advocate an immediate, unconditional, and lasting end to all hostilities throughout the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the only way to start finding a political solution to the crisis on the basis of equal respect for the legitimate interests and rights of all three constituent peoples. This is the only alternative to this gloomy development, which gathered speed with yesterday's and (?today's) military attacks on Serb positions and Serb-populated places in this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the alternative to peace that I am speaking about is a continuation of war, which nobody can consider a joyful prospect and nobody can profit from, not even these who crossed the Rubicon when they decided in favor of this adventure. [Colovic] Yes. What are your expectations in the coming hours and days? [Jovanovic] Despite all the dramatic events, one must retain both presence of mind and a cool head. After all, these air strikes, as much as their form and gesture denote an act of aggression, are nevertheless virtually limited to a few NATO aircraft that appear and carry out the destruction and killing of civilians of Serbian nationality. This shows that at this moment, the tactic of pressure is dominant in the other side's thinking. On the other hand, there is the presence of Mr. Churkin, special envoy to President Yeltsin, who has visited Belgrade today and has already gone to Pale, where he will try to repeat his role of a useful bridge between the opposing sides with a view to overcoming this tense situation as well. Finally, in this civil war, everybody can do much evil to others, but nobody can do I do not know how much evil and thereby benefit from it himself. These advocates of war in Sarajevo on the East River and in Brussels are finally going to realize that because, after all, any policy is carried out with a view to benefiting from it, and not exclusively to doing harm to the other side. [Colovic] You mentioned Mr. Churkin, who is visiting Pale and who will be talking about this with Serb republic officials. We would like to hear from you what the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will offer in this direction, in the direction of peace. [Jovanovic] In the announcement that I hope has already been issued to the public, we reiterate the consistent policy of peace, cooperation, and the political solutions to all disputes, including the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On that line we are ready to give full support and help to all efforts, wherever they may come from, directed to reducing the present tension, to ending all the hostilities, and establishing a just and lasting peace. This resoluteness of ours has not been abandoned even after this latest aggression. On the contrary, it has gained in topicality, significance, and strength because it has almost turned into a lighthouse in the darkness that has come in the wake of this unreasonable decision of the top officials of the world organization and NATO to start this adventure. We expect Russia and the other countries that kept their political presence of mind and rational reasoning about the entire situation to make their full contribution and help those people who have refused to use their reasoning and view the world with realistic eyes more easily to see their mistake and return to the only possible line leading to a way out of this crisis, to a reduction of tension, an end to hostilities, and a return to negotiations as the only means for finding way out of the Bosnian crisis. [Colovic] Thank you, Minister Jovanovic. [Jovanovic] Not at all, Mr. Colovic.
