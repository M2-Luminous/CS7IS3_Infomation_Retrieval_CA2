There is a real threat of a nomenklatura revanche and of national extremists and undisguised fascists coming into power. Russia has no future unless reforms are continued, norms of a civil society reinforced, and economic and political stability ensured. We can no longer tolerate the fact that the disciplined forces of reaction and revanche are opposed by a fractured and amorphous democratic movement. Therefore, we undertake to build an organized political force--a party of stability, order, and reforms. Russia's Choice is for a free society, where human rights constitute the highest priority and are securely protected; where authority is limited by law, and the law itself is fair and is observed unfailingly. Russia's Choice is a party of stability. Protection of ownership rights and bringing down inflation are the foremost conditions for economic growth in our and your country. Russia's Choice is for a state that is effective but not burdensome for taxpayers. We are against the omnipotence of bureaucrats, who reward themselves with wealth and privileges. Russia's Choice is for a Great Russia, occupying its proper place in the world community. Russia's Choice is a party of peace. We intend to resist any attempts to plunge the country into military adventures. We are for peace and accord in the Russian society. We urge everyone who is inspired by these goals and ideas to join the Russia's Choice Party. An organizational congress will be held within the next few months. [Signed] Ye. Gaydar, S. Kovalev, E.
