Speaking at his weekly news conference today, Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that the accusatory language used in the statements made by Greek Cypriot authorities following the killing of Yeoryiadhis has caused shock and amazement. He noted that those who know Turkey are well aware that it is against any manifestation of terror, whatever the reason. Ataman added that it is the responsibility of those who make such provocative allegations -- the goals which they serve being very clear -- to prove them. In reply to a question, Ataman described the conclusion of a series of military cooperation agreements during the sudden visit by the Greek defense minister to south Cyprus as goals and intentions that threaten stability.
