She was quoted as saying the decision should be seen as part of the overall effort Israel is making to meet Palestinian security concerns. She also said the United States is considering whether to put Kakh and Kahana Hay on its list of terrorist sponsors. Christine Shelly told reporters yesterday that Kakh and Kahana Hay, on the basis of their words and actions, have advocated and engaged in terrorism. Shelly added that U.S. law had provisions for curtailing fund-raising for such groups in the United States.
