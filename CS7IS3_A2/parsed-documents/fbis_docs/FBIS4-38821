Kim disclosed Yeltsin's pledge during a breakfast meeting with South Korean correspondents stationed in the Russian capital. Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow will neither renew the current treaty nor conclude any others of similar nature, Kim said. The Russia-North Korea treaty, which has been the ground for relations between the two countries, was concluded in 1961 and is due to expire at the end of 1996. It will be extended automatically for another five years unless either side abrogates it. The core part of this treaty, which calls for automatic military intervention by Russia in case of war in Korea, has practically become "a dead letter," Kim explained. With regard to possible sanctions against North Korea, Yeltsin told him that Russia intends to participate when they have become inevitable after the U.N. Security Council took necessary steps, including repeated issuance of warnings, Kim said. Kim said he was informed of "a top secret" by the Russian side in connection with problems related to North Korea's development of nuclear weapons, but he could not disclose it at this stage. The president said Yeltsin also promised to make a decision so that Russia would not sell any weapons or parts to North Korea under any circumstances. Commenting on the North Korean lumberjacks fleeing from Pyongyang-run Siberian logging camps, Kim said he and Yeltsin agreed that Seoul could bring as many to South Korea as it wishes. Kim said the Seoul government plans to bring home all Koreans living in Sakhalin if they so desire. On the shooting down of the Korean Air (KAL) 007 jetliner by a Soviet fighter plane in 1983, Kim noted that Yeltsin said the responsibility lies with the airline. This is the basic official Russian position, Kim said. But he said the two countries will hold working-level meetings to discuss the problem of compensating the victims' families. As for the development of gas fields in the Russian Far East, Kim said South Korea and Russia will invest 10 million U.S. dollars each to undertake a feasibility study.
