FR940928-1-00016 FR940928-1-00003 The BAAQMD has not implemented NO X RACT and has submitted monitoring data as part of its redesignation request to demonstrate attainment of the standard. As discussed above, the BAAQMD has monitoring data showing that the area attained the ozone NAAQS since the 1990&hyph;1992 timeframe. See section III.1. of this notice for a detailed discussion of the ozone air quality monitoring data. c. Proposed Action. The EPA proposes to grant the BAAQMD section 182(f) NO X RACT exemption petition based upon the evidence provided by the BAAQMD and the BAAQMD's compliance with the requirements outlined in EPA's section 182(f) exemption guidance. The final approval of this proposed action would exempt the San Francisco Bay Area from the requirements to implement the NO X RACT requirements and the applicable general and transportation conformity provisions for NO X . However, the NO X RACT control measures are included as contingency measures in the San Francisco Bay Area's maintenance plan (See discussion below, 5E. Contingency Plan). 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act In order for EPA to take final action approving the redesignation request and maintenance plan, the San Francisco Bay Area must have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and Part D. As discussed in Section 2.A. above, EPA approved numerous provisions of the San Francisco Bay Area SIP under the pre-amended Act and finds that these provisions meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2). In addition, EPA will take action on the following SIP revisions prior to taking final action on the redesignation request and maintenance plan: VOC RACT rules, NSR rule, and the emission statement rule. Also, EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory as required by section 182(a)(1) through this document. Assuming that these SIP revisions meet all requirements for approval, EPA will undertake rulemaking to approve them. Once EPA approves these revisions, the San Francisco Bay Area will have fulfilled the requirement to have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k). The proposed approval of the redesignation request is contingent upon the BAAQMD fulfilling the requirements of sections 173 and 182 discussed above prior to final rulemaking. In the alternative, if the requirements are not fulfilled, EPA must disapprove the redesignation request for the San Francisco Bay Area. 4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures Under the pre-amended Act, EPA approved California's SIP control strategy for the San Francisco Bay Area nonattainment area, satisfied that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Since enactment of the amended Act, the State has made additional submittals as identified in section 182(b) above. In addition, EPA finds that the measures listed below contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reductions in ambient ozone levels in the San Francisco Bay Area. ‚ê£ 1Selected control measures1 1BAAQMD reg 8 rule # 1Emission reductions 1987&hyph;1990 VOC (TPD) Stationary Sources: Architectural Coatings 3 1.8 Emulsified and Liquid Asphalts 15 2.0 Solvent Cleaning Operations 16 0.8 Valves and Flanges at Petroleum Refinery Complexes 18 1.4 Graphic Arts Printing and Coating Operations 20 0.7 Pump and Compressor Seals at Petroleum Refineries 25 1.1 Solid Waste Disposal Sites 34 3.1 Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Refineries 37 0.6 Motor Vehicles and Mobile Equipment Coating Operations 45 0.6 Marine Tank Vessel to Marine Tank Vessel Loading 46 0.5 Aerosol Paint Coatings 49 0.8 Stationary Sources Subtotal 13.4 lMobile Sources: l l ARB Motor Vehicle Program (including Basic I/M) n/a 56 Total 69 1Control Measures achieving at least 0.5 TPD reduction of VOC between 1987 and 1990.
