FR940805-0-00065 FR940805-0-00022 After reviewing the comments, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled, ``Structural and Operational Measures to Reduce Oil Spills from Existing Tank Vessels Without Double Hulls'' (Existing Vessels) on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54870). The Coast Guard issued two subsequent correction notices on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61143), and December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65298), which made technical corrections to the NPRM. In response to several comments received on the NPRM, the Coast Guard published, on December 16, 1993, a notice of public meeting and extension of comment period (58 FR 65863). The Coast Guard held a public meeting on January 20, 1994, to obtain information from the public on the proposed regulations. Topics addressed by speakers included applicability, differences between tank barges and tankships, exemptions, and economic and technical feasibility of the proposed regulations. Some of the basic assumptions of the proposed regulations were also discussed, particularly their reliance on Regulation 13G of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78). Information on the public meeting is available for public review at the address under ``ADDRESSES .'' In light of the comments received at the public meeting and in response to the written comments received concerning the NPRM, the Coast Guard is reviewing the proposed regulations. The Coast Guard, however, is committed to implementing all the provisions of section 4115(b) in a timely manner. To expedite the implementation of section 4115(b) of OPA 90, the Coast Guard has developed a three-pronged approach which encompasses three separate rulemaking projects. The Coast Guard intends to: (1) Issue this final rule implementing the requirements to carry emergency lightering equipment and to include the International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number in the advance notice of arrival report; (2) in the near future, issue a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) regarding additional operational measures for tankships and tank barges; and (3) review comments on the NPRM for major measures and revise the Regulatory Assessment (RA) before issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) regarding structural measures for tankships and tank barges. Background and Purpose Section 4115 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) mandates regulations to provide improved protection from oil spills in waters subject to jurisdiction of the United States due to collisions and groundings of tank vessels that are constructed or adapted to carry, or that carry oil in bulk as cargo or cargo residue. Section 4115(b) (which appears as a statutory note following 46 U.S.C. 3703a) directs the Coast Guard to develop structural or operational requirements for tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons (GT) or more to serve as regulations until 2015, when all tank vessels operating in U.S. waters are required to have double hulls under section 4115(a) of OPA 90 (46 U.S.C. 3703a). Regulations issued under the authority of section 4115(b) must provide as substantial protection to the environment as is economically and technologically feasible. Discussion of Comments and Changes Background information on structural and operational measures for existing vessels without double hulls is provided in the preambles to the ANPRM and the NPRM. The Coast Guard received a total of 132 comments concerning the NPRM; however, only 8 comments addressed the provisions on emergency lightering equipment, and there were no comments on the advance notice of arrival requirements for foreign vessels. The Coast Guard also received two comments on the applicability of the regulations. Emergency Lightering Equipment The NPRM proposed requirements for vessels covered by the regulations to be equipped with lightering equipment, including certain size reducers, bolts, washers, nuts, gaskets, and appropriate quantities of spares. The onboard emergency lightering equipment is intended to facilitate rapid transfer of oil from a vessel in the case of a collision or grounding. Although, normally, lightering operations should not commence until salvage experts and the vessel's master have assessed the condition of the vessel, under some circumstances immediate action may be required. If oil cargo is improperly lightered from a vessel or if oil cargo is lightered from the wrong tanks, additional damage to the vessel could occur, crew safety could be jeopardized, and additional oil cargo could be discharged into the marine environment. Even if lightering is not initiated until after a full assessment of its suitability, having the required equipment on board ensures that lightering will not be delayed. Eight comments on the NPRM expressed general support for the Coast Guard's requirement for emergency lightering equipment. In addition, four of these comments proposed modifications. Three comments agreed with the requirement to store emergency lightering equipment near the cargo manifold as long as the equipment is stored in such a manner that it is protected from the weather. The Coast Guard agrees and is requiring all emergency lightering equipment to be stored in one separate and marked location, in a space such as the cargo control room, pump room, or forecastle locker, and as convenient to the cargo manifold, as practicable. One comment disagreed with the specific pieces of equipment required by the NPRM and suggested that any requirement for emergency lightering equipment be considered as a total package along with other lightering and salvage equipment. The equipment required by this rule is in addition to the requirements for lightering equipment found in the Vessel Response Plans (VRP) IFR (58 FR 43434). This equipment is independent of all other lightering equipment; it is not to be viewed as part of a larger package of lightering equipment found in the VRP IFR. Additionally, it must be stored separately from all other lightering equipment for the purposes of easy identification and quick access. The Coast Guard has determined that the emergency lightering equipment required by this regulation is necessary to ensure that the vessel owner or operator has lightering equipment available immediately to use the vessel's cargo pumps to discharge through its manifold to another vessel alongside. This requirement will increase rather than decrease compatibility with other parts of an overall lightering or salvage system. Another comment suggested that the Coast Guard require two extra sets of bolts, washers, nuts and gaskets per reducer set instead of just one extra set. Although carriage of additional spares is encouraged, the Coast Guard has opted to establish a minimum requirement.
