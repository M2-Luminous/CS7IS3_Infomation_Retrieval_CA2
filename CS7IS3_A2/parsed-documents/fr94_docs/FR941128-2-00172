FR941128-2-00172 FR941128-2-00089 [Release No. 34&hyph;34984; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;33] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Reporting by the Exchange to the Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') of Information Concerning Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings November 18, 1994. On September 15, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change requiring the CBOE to report information concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings to the Central Registration Depository (``CRD''). 3 Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on October 13, 1994. 4 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the CBOE proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 The CRD is an automated industry database containing employment and disciplinary history of members and associated persons registered with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and state securities agencies. The CRD is operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') with input on policy and other matters from federal and state agencies and other SROs including the Exchange. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34792 (October 5, 1994), 59 FR 52014 (October 13, 1994). Currently, the Exchange discloses to the CRD information with respect to formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings only upon the conclusion of such proceedings. 5 Under the proposed rule change, the amount of information concerning formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings 6 reported by the Exchange to the CRD would be expanded to include the issuance of a statement of charges in such proceedings and all significant changes 7 in the status of such proceedings while such proceedings are pending. For purposes of Rule 17.14, a formal Exchange disciplinary proceeding would be considered to be pending from the time that a statement of charges is issued in the proceeding 8 until the outcome of the proceeding becomes final. 5 Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the Exchange, the NASD, and other SROs, as well as information concerning certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD, has been disclosed to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number service (``800 number service'') since October 1991. The Commission subsequently approved the NASD's procedures for operating its 800 number service in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30629 (April 23, 1992), 57 FR 18535 (April 30, 1992) (``800 Number Service Plan Approval Order''). On July 1, 1993, the Commission approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the public regarding pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state agencies and SROs that relate to securities and commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and information. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32568 (July 1, 1993), 58 FR 36723 (July 8, 1993) (``Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order''). In addition, the Commission recently approved rule changes by both the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. that are substantively the same as the CBOE's proposal. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33844 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16669 (April 7, 1994) and 34516 (August 10, 1994), 59 FR 42317 (August 17, 1994) (``NYSE and CHX Approval Orders''). 6 For purposes of CBOE Rule 17.14, and Exchange disciplinary proceeding would be considered to be a formal disciplinary proceeding if it is initiated by the Exchange pursuant to Exchange Rule 17.2 et. seq. 7 Significant changes in the status of a formal Exchange disciplinary proceeding would be deemed to include, but not be limited to, the scheduling of a disciplinary hearing, the issuance of a decision by the CBOE's Business Conduct Committee, the filing of an appeal to the Exchange's Board of Directors, and the issuance of a decision by the Exchange's Board of Directors. 8 See CBOE Rule 17.4(b). In addition to the foregoing, the proposed rule change would renumber the provisions which are currently contained in Rule 17.12 (Miscellaneous Provisions) without affecting the substance of these provisions. Specifically, under the proposed rule change, the current provisions of Rule 17.12 would be separated into two rules, Rule 17.12 and Rule 17.13. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 9 Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 9 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress mandated that the NASD establish its 800 number service for the purpose of receiving and responding to inquiries from the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons. 10 As initially implemented, a caller using the 800 number service could request a written report from the NASD with the following information contained in the CRD: 11 past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions, 12 taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions; and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U&hyph;4. 10 See supra note 5. 11 Under NASD procedures, the 800 number service operator does not provide any information over the telephone. Instead, a written copy of the information requested is sent to the caller and to the NASD member and/or associated person who is the subject of the inquiry. The identity of the caller remains confidential. See 800 Number Service Plan Approval Order, supra, note 5. 12 The NASD's 800 number service plan does not define the term ``disciplinary action.'' According to the NASD, however, the term includes, but is not limited to, information provided in response to question 7 on Form BD and question 22 on Form U&hyph;4. See Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order, supra, note 5. In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through its 800 number service. 13 Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations; civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers. Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on form BD or Form U&hyph;4, respectively. 14 Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary actions (other than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete and timely reporting by members and associated persons. 13 Id. The Commission notes that, in 1992, Congress requested that the General Accounting Office (``GAO'') conduct a review of various aspects of the Penny Stock Reform Act, including the NASD's 800 number service. Among other things, the GAO recommended that information about final arbitration awards be reported. Accordingly, the NASD submitted, and the Commission approved, a rule change authorizing the NASD to disclose certain arbitration awards, as well as pending formal disciplinary actions, through its 800 number service. In this context, the Commission notes that it has requested all SROs to coordinate with the NASD the transfer of information about awards rendered in each exchange's arbitration program. 14 See supra note 13. As stated in the NYSE and CHX Approval Orders, 15 the proposed rule change should help fill a potential gap in the NASD's 800 number service by authorizing the Exchange to report directly to the CRD the initiation of a formal CBOE disciplinary proceeding and significant changes in the status thereof. As a result, that information will be available to the public whether or not it is voluntarily reported by the member or associated person. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change should enhance the fairness and accuracy of the CRD database and, accordingly, of information released to the public through the 800 number service. 15 See supra note 5.
