The group was set up in 1986 to lobby for farm trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Cairns Group ministers agreed at the round's concluding meeting in Morocco last month that the group should remain in existence to monitor the implementation of the round's agreements on agriculture and to lobby for further liberalisation. The discussions on the group's future structure will take place at the group's 14th ministerial meeting in Montevideo, Uruguay on May 19-20. Thailand, which played a key role in setting up the group, still needs the group to push for more agricultural trade liberalisation under the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) scheduled to be established next year, Business Economics Department Director-General Kroekkrai Chiraphaet said on Friday. He said the meeting would discuss its role and internal cooperation, especially on the task of monitoring whether signatories of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would become members of the WTO, followed their commitment to open markets to farm products and reduce domestic and exports subsidies. Thailand, as an active member of the Cairns Group, believed that even through the Uruguay Round included clauses on agricultural trade, more free trade was needed, he said. Mr Kroekkrai said the group had to consider whether to opt for informal cooperation as existed or a formal office with a permanent secretariat. The group also needed to talk about nominating a representative to chair the WTO's agriculture committee to be set up to supervise world farm trade. In Marrakech last month, Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan proposed that the group should try to have one of its members elected chairman of the agricultural committee. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said he thought Thailand could play that role. Dr Suphachai will head the Thai delegation at this week's meeting in Uruguay. Mr Kroekkrai will be the leader at official level. The Thai delegation will visit Washington before going to Uruguay. Dr Suphachai will meet United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to discuss Thailand's position on Washington's "Priority Watch List" of countries accused of failing to provide adequate protection for US intellectual property. Dr Suphachai said even the US had recognised that Thailand had made progress in dealing with protection of intellectual property rights but Thailand wanted to explain to the US that the amendment of the Copyright Law depended on Parliament. Both sides will discuss the agenda for their talks expected to be held in Washington next month. Thailand wants to talk about cooperation on economic issues, particularly joint investments in Thailand the third countries.
