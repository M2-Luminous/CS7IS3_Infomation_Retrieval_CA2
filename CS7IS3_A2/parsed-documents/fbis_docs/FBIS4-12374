But while we are still engaged in trying to figure out its implications, another trial balloon, this time of "freezing" the Kashmir issue, whatever that means, has gone up. In the context of nuclear development a whole new vocabulary of "capping", putting the brackes on, "freezing", "not crossing the red line", "rolling back", etc, has grown and come to be understood. But application of the same vocabulary on human endeavour for the achievements of their basic rights, is really hard to swallow. The report that Pakistan has been asked by the US to "freeze the Kashmir issue", leaves one dismayed. Firstly, because unlike its nuclear programme, Paksitan is not its sole motivator or controller. There are two other parties -- the freedom fighters and the Indian occupation troops -- neither under Pakistan's control, who are hardly interested in freezing it. The troops will continue their atrocities and the freedom-fighters will continue their struggle. Unless Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris agree to stop all their activities, Pakistan's unilateral halt to its diplomatic offensive would mean little. Secondly, the term "freezing" implies that but for Pakistan there would be no trouble in Kashmir. This reading of the situation, repeatedly projected by India, is believed by all that is happening today. Pakistan had, in fact, kept Kashmir issue on its back burner for nearly a decade, particularly during General Zia's rule. Pakistani leadership had then been persuaded by India to believe that the less important differences between the two countries needed to be sorted out first. That would, it was said, create the right climate of confidence-building for solving the major issue of Kashmir. It was the people of Kashmir who rose against that apathetic approach. The message they sent to both Pakistan and India was that they had a voice that needed to be heard. And their voice continues to ring loud and clear, even as their blood flows freely in the Valley. How can Pakistan, even if it wants to, put out a flame that burns in the heart of every Kashmir? Pakistan was asked by the US not to raise the Kashmir issue in the UN General Assembly and instead talk to India. Pakistan complied. India used that full to crush the Kashmiris with even greater brutality. Then it passed a resolution in its Parliament to enable it to refile from its own admission of the status of Kashmir -- that of a disputed territory. Pakistan was again asked by the US (and others) not to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNHRC. Again Pakistan complied. India sent in more troops in the Valley and started killing more people on this side of the LOC. To keep the US beguiled, India first despatched its Foreign Secretary and then some non-papers to Pakistan. Their central theme was: "back to confidence-building measures". Pakistan has been bitten by that bug before. It is US's turn to be bitten by it. In a way it is the same approach as on the nuclear issue. Ask Pakistan to "cap" first then we will see if India follows. Now, ask Pakistan to freeze Kashmir first then we will see if India can be restrained from its reign of terror there. Someone has to be really naive to fall for that line again and again. Pakistan has learnt its lesson. Maybe the US will also learn its lesson at India's hands.
