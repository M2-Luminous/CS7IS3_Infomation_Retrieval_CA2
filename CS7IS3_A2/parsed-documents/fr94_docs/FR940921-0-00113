FR940921-0-00113 FR940921-0-00016 72. Section 86.527&hyph;90 of subpart F is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (c) and (d), to read as follows: ยง86.527&hyph;90 Test procedures, overview. (a) The procedures described in this and subsequent sections are used to determine the conformity of motorcycles with the standards set forth in subpart E of this part. * * * * * (c) The exhaust emission test is designed to determine hydrocarbon (gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled motorcycles), methanol, formaldehyde, and hydrocarbon (methanol-fueled motorcycles), carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen mass emissions while simulating an average trip in an urban area. The test consists of engine startups and motorcycle operation on a chassis dynamometer, through a specified driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust emissions is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler. (d) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, all emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motorcycle shall be functioning during all procedures in this Subpart. Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be authorized in accordance with subpart E of this part. 73. Section 86.540&hyph;90 of subpart F is amended by revising paragraph (a) introductory text to read as follows: ยง86.540&hyph;90 Exhaust sample analysis. * * * * * (a) For CO, CO 2 , gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled motorcycle HC and, if appropriate, NO X : * * * * * 74. Section 86.542&hyph;90 of subpart F is amended by adding paragraphs (q) and (r), to read as follows: ยง86.542&hyph;90 Records required. * * * * * (q) Additional required records for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Composition, including all carbon containing compounds; e.g. CO 2 , of the natural gas-fuel used during the test. C 1 and C 2 compounds shall be individually reported. C 3 and heavier hydrocarbons and C 6 and heavier compounds may be reported as a group. (r) Additional required records for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Composition of the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel used during the test. Each hydrocarbon compound present, through C 4 compounds, shall be individually reported. C 5 and heavier hydrocarbons may be reported as a group.
