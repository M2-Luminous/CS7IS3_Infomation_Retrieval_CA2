The decision to create it was adopted by the Council of CIS States' Heads of Government. As a preliminary step a decision was made on joint measures to combat organized crime. There is no time to waste -- despite differences in mutual relations among the republics, a unified crime-conducive space has survived in the CIS. Moreover, there is information that criminal formations have "spread out" across the whole of the former Union. Almost one-third of permanent criminal groups -- and 3,500 of them have been uncovered in Russia -- have interregional links. Commonwealth countries have a common problem in the shape of "illegal" business in such lucrative fields as the export of various kinds of raw materials and cultural treasures; large-scale bank fraud and the theft and resale of cars; and extortion, thefts, and attacks on means of transport. A particular danger is posed by gangs engaged in the illegal distribution of drugs and firearms and in foreign currency dealings. Criminals have "staked out" their own areas in each Community state. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, for example, are "distinguished" for weapons sales and foreign currency dealings. All the Transcaucasus republics are famous for their concentration of bandit formations and also for weapons sales. And raw materials illegally transit the Baltic states. The newly created Bureau is a prototype "Europol." Its work will be much more practical than that of Interpol, which is more reminiscent of a police mail box. The Bureau's main task will be precisely to combat crime in the CIS (particularly in its organized forms). This is a task which is intended to result in a decline in social tension, an improvement in the socioeconomic situation, and the regularization of the consumer market. It is also important to ensure that the dangerous processes of the merging of criminal and economic crime do not gather momentum and that criminal gang leaders and corrupt officials do not find a common language. And how is drug addiction and the drugs business to be eliminated? All this will undoubtedly fall on the new Bureau's shoulders. The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Arrangements in Civil, Family, and Criminal Cases signed in Minsk 22 January last year provides a good legal basis for the matters which the Bureau will tackle. But first the Convention has to be ratified. This is a task for the new [Russian] parliament, which will be faced with a whole series of legislative acts.
