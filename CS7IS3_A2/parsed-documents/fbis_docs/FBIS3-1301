Yesterday morning, German Horst Klentz (57) was arrested, along with his accomplice, Alex Neidnelein, in Boskop, close to the South African capital, Pretoria. Last Monday, there was a gunfight with the South African police. According to information obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG, Klentz, who is wanted in Namibia for murder, belongs to the same network of German right-wing extremists with whom the murderers of South African communist leader Chris Hani, who was killed in April 1993, were in contact. He wrote, among other things, for the neofascist circular DIE AUSCHWITZLUEGE [The Lie About Auschwitz] and used newspaper advertisements to recruit "young, strong people." They were later trained in shooting and bombing techniques on farms in South Africa. Helmut Hornung, who owns a farm on the Sabie River near the city of Graskop in Transvaal, also belongs to the Klentz group in South Africa. Hornung only receives visitors who have been personally recommended by National Democratic Party of Germany functionary Guenter Deckert in Weinheim and Peter Dehoust, publisher of the magazine NATION UND EUROPA in Coburg in Upper Franconia. According to Hornung, the German right-wing extremists are still in training on farms in South Africa. NATION UND EUROPE publisher Dehous was in close contact with South African journalist Arthur Kemp, who procured the addresses of politicians who were to be murdered at the order of Hani's murderers. At that time, Kemp was not arrested because he helped the authorities with their investigations. Before that, he had written articles for NATION UND EUROPA and held lectures before right-wing extremists and the "German-South African Society" in Coburg. Moreover, the Klentz group in South Africa maintains contacts with German neo-Nazi Manfred Roeder, who was released from prison early in 1990. He held lectures when he visited the Cape in early 1993. During a gunfight last Monday, Thomas Kuntz, who was wanted for aggravated robbery in Germany, was killed. His accomplice Stephan Rays was arrested. Some weeks ago, the two had been watched in the circle of South African right-wing extremists around the formerly illegal radio station, Radio Pretoria.
