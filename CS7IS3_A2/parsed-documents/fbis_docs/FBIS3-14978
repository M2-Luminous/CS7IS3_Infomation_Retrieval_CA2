I am convinced that after we signed the trilateral agreement in Moscow, this visit will become a turning point in the establishment of relations between Ukraine and the United States. Another thing I would like to emphasize is the fact that the preparation for the visit is taking place in a good atmosphere. All the issues put on the agenda, and all the draft agreements upon which the experts are working, agree with the interests of both Ukraine and the United States. I attach great importance to this visit, and hope that our plans and forecasts will be accomplished. Now I am ready to answer your questions. [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Radio Liberty Russian service. Esteemed Mr. President, after your statement of 18 February this year [words indistinct] that you believe early presidential elections inexpedient, do you realize that in the eyes of the U.S. Administration and the entire Western community, because the parliament of Ukraine in fact failed to ratify the January agreement, you remain the sole guarantor of its implementation? [Kravchuk] I will start from the end: I do not think the parliament failed to ratify it. The parliament ratified START-I and made the decision to exchange instruments of ratification, and the parliament lifted its reservations on Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, which is interpreted as Ukraine's commitment to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a nonnuclear state. Thus, the parliament did not fail in anything, but made an important step forward. Another thing is that the parliament did not ratify the NPT -- that is also true. Second, my statement had to do with the situation that emerged today and that can emerge, according to the forecasts, in April, May, or June. I explained this both in my interview for Radio Liberty and in my interview for our television. I never say everything at once, however; I always leave some room for future clarification. You know that the parliament's decisions on early elections of the parliament and president were made under the pressure of a miners' strike. I agreed that such elections were needed, but I do not agree that it should become customary in the life of the society for elections and re-elections to be held under the pressure of a strike. Agreeing to that sort of thing, one will have to agree that we are not building a civilized or a law-governed society. My participation in an early election would mean that I agree to that. That is why I am saying this to emphasize that I have stood and do stand for a law-governed and civilized state, and I will do my best to ensure that this state is being built in Ukraine. Therefore, the president may agree to any steps required by the situation at hand, but his personal involvement would mean that he agrees, not only theoretically but also practically, with an unlawful situation. [Rudenko] Larysa Rudenko, SVOBODA newspaper. Mr. President, a body has been set up within the Cabinet of Ministers to deal with clearing up enterprises. Does that mean that large emissions will be launched again? Which enterprises, do you think, need to be saved from bankruptcy? [Kravchuk] First, those that manufacture products needed for Ukraine must be saved. Also those that manufacture products that can be sold and bring hard currency to Ukraine must be saved. Those that will be of crucial significance in the future structure of Ukraine's economy must be saved. There is no point in saving the rest, which manufacture products that may not be needed in the future and may not be competitive in quality and technological standards. This is a conceptual principle that was also voiced in Russian President Yeltsin's address to the joint session of the Federal Assembly and Duma. He also emphasized that Russia would manufacture products needed for Russia. Taking this into account, I think that Belarus will also manufacture products needed for Belarus which can also be competitive. Taking this into account we must create a market in the CIS instead of crying over broken ties. If we should restore, as some wish, all the ties, we will have to restore the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet economy. The budget and the decisions made by the Cabinet of Ministers have nothing to do with the emission. They have to do only with those problems that are agreed upon today with the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank concerning the granting of appropriate credits to enterprises needed for Ukraine. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, as far as I understand, the issue of providing Ukraine with guarantees is not in a very good state. Do you think that your visit to the United States can improve the situation in this respect, because we understand this situation has to do with the attitude of the U.S. Administration? [Kravchuk] I do not think that anything will change on paper regarding the guarantees. The trilateral agreement in Moscow, a document that the three of us signed, ties guarantees to Ukraine's accession to the NPT. That is, the issue of guarantees has been resolved in principle, but the provision of guarantees and putting them in a documented form is tied to Ukraine's accession to the NPT. I do not think this position will be called into question or will be subject to change. Another matter is that we will be able to clarify again conceptually the essence and the nature of guarantees, textually and conceptually. The provision of guarantees, however, I must stress, is tied to Ukraine's accession to the NPT. [Unidentified correpondent] Will the instruments of ratification be exchanged in Washington, and if not, where? The second question, apart from $350 million, what other aid do you expect from the United States? Third, can you explain to American readers, how can an independent Ukraine that is outside Russia's sphere of interest be within the U.S. sphere of interests? [Kravchuk] I will have, if nothing changes, a telephone conversation today with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and we will agree upon the issue of exchange of ratification instruments. This needs to be agreed by both sides, not only by Ukraine. The second question on the U.S. aid, specifically the $300 million: With all the importance of $300 million, or even a lesser figure, for Ukraine, I am going to America not for the $300 million, but for the establishment of large-scale economic cooperation. To revive Ukraine's economy on market foundations and for Ukraine to join market structures, including European and world ones, we need billions in funds, powerful investments, an influx of private capital, and others. All this needs establishment of large-scale economic cooperation. For your third question -- it is a rather original one, implying certain complications, both politically and otherwise. Ukraine is a member of the CIS, and as a member of the CIS, it is placed within a political, economic, and legal area determined by the CIS documents. The CIS documents do not preclude any state from joining other structures, in Europe or worldwide, including political ones. We in Ukraine understand very well that Ukraine, and not only Ukraine, but also other European countries -- I mean the European countries of the CIS and the former Warsaw Pact -- are today under a certain influence of the Russian policy. The question is, what kind of influence is it? Is that an influence of democratic and market- oriented transformations, or is it an influence which certain political forces in Russia want to impose today? We are in favor of cooperation, partnership, and interaction with Russia. Everybody must understand, however, that Russia will never resign itself to playing a mediocre role in the world. Russia cannot renounce its thousand-year-old history; this would not be understood either by the Russians or by Russian politicians. The question is, how can we prevent the transformation of this concept into an imperial one? Therefore, we cannot set ourselves euphoric goals, to have Russia suddenly renounce its role in the world and in Europe. It is unfeasible. However, we -- I mean Ukraine -- can and want to give an opportunity to the states of the world to balance out the politics in Europe. I would even say that we can, given the will and assistance to Ukraine, open the road for democracy to the east, from Europe's old borders. We can also play a certain part in the creation of a [word indistinct] market in Central Europe and further east. Thus, I am talking about a stabilizing role for Ukraine. However, to see that happen, the Western countries must decide whether they can assist Ukraine in this, while Ukraine is ready, because Ukraine currently has no political or conceptual complications in this respect. We all need to assist both Russia and Ukraine, and others, in the development of democratic processes. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think the refusal of the Supreme Council to join the NPT will affect the granting of aid to Ukraine by the United States? When do you expect Ukraine to join the NPT? Another question, will you discuss the issue of guaranteeing American investments by Ukraine? [Kravchuk] I will reply in several theses. The first thesis is that, having ratified Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine in fact announced its commitment to join the NPT. I will try to convince the American business community, politicians, the President and the public that Ukraine has its peculiarity as a country having nuclear arms on its territory. The peculiarity is that Ukraine cannot use its nuclear arms and does not pose a potential threat to the United States. Therefore, the main thing is that Ukraine has practically begun to carry out the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow, thus creating favorable conditions for its relations with the United States. That is why there is no need to tie so closely all the documents and relations between Ukraine and the United States with accession to the NPT. Our accession has its specifics, because Ukraine, I stress again, is not a nuclear state. Moreover, everybody understands that even if someone should wish this, Ukraine will not be able any time soon to become a state that produces nuclear arms or has all the components of a nuclear state. The guarantees for investments will be discussed. We have an agreement called Treaty Between Ukraine and the United States on the Encouragement and Mutual Safeguarding of Investments. This agreement has been fully coordinated and finalized. [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. President, are you worried by the fact that if the election fails to take place in March, the situation can get out of hand and will not be possible to deal with by normal means? [Kravchuk] Of course I am worried, but I attach greater importance to the economic situation, rather than to the question whether the election will take place or not, although I always stressed that I would like the election to take place at once. Even if the election fails to take place, there is an executive authority, there is a president, there are local power structures, presidential representatives, and councils that perform their functions today, and there will be no great complications. However, the economic situation can be complicated even by the problems involved during the election to the Supreme Council. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you emphasized that a priority in your policy toward Washington is the expansion of economic relations with the United States. What can Ukraine offer to the United States, and what would you like to receive from the United States? [Kravchuk] I would like the United States and the European states to actually settle the issue of quotas for Ukrainian goods, and then we would have a great deal to offer. This is first. Second, we have a rather powerful Black Sea shipping company, Blasco, but the main cargoes are carried not by our ships, but by ships of third countries. We could do this ourselves and make money. As for the United States, I stress again, I would wish for large-scale economic cooperation, to open the road for private investments, to open the road for investment, genuine trade, scientific, and technical cooperation in all areas. Then we would feel a real boost to economic transformations in Ukraine and to normal cooperation in the economy. I would say this: Ukraine is a young state and does not have a lot of experience. The United States, with its possibilities and experience, could lead Ukraine to the economic market, the scientific market, the technological market, and give us an opportunity to work there, to sell and earn, and to buy. [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. President, can you name all the agreements that are (?prepared for signing in Washington)? [Kravchuk] The first agreement: Treaty Between Ukraine and the United States of America on the Encouragement and Mutual Safeguarding of Investments; second: Convention Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Ukraine on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Tax Evasion in Respect of the Income and Capital Tax; third agreement: Joint Statement on the Main Principles of Cooperation in the Sphere of Agriculture; fourth: Statement of Intent on the Granting of Expertise in the Sphere of Agriculture Between the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of Ukraine and the Department of Agriculture of the United States; next, a document on the sphere of competence of the Ukrainian-American Joint Commission for Assistance to the Development of Trade and Investment. The other four agreements are at the stage of coordination. The first is a treaty between the Goods and Credit Corporation of the United States and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture of Ukraine; an agreement between the Governments of Ukraine and the United States on cooperation in the sphere of science and technology. Next, an agreement on protection and conservation of cultural heritage, and a joint statement on cooperation in the sphere of trade and economy. The last two have already been mentioned -- a charter and a treaty between the ministries of defense. [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Kravchuk] Well, Oksana Baiul is a world champion. I met her, if I recall, with a glass of champagne, and I greeted her as a world champion. Naturally, when I saw it on television, for me it was not just the joy of a human being. It was very important. It was the first time Ukraine appeared as an independent team, it was the first time it won two medals -- gold and bronze. Thus, Ukraine makes its appearance as a world power. It is important that it be represented by such young, beautiful, and gentle people as Oksana Baiul.
