Mr. Kanyenkiko, age 40, is a member of the Tutsi people and of Uprona [Unity for National Progress], the principal opposition party and formerly the country's only party. In appointing him as prime minister the new President Cyprien Ntaryamira has thus respected the agreement reached last week to free the country from its present deadlock and prevent any further upsurge of interethnic violence that left 50 dead last week. [passage omitted] Special Mission...To Liege Various sources report of Burundian officers or intermediaries close to the army being charged with "secret missions." Last week an interlocutor introducing himself as former President Bagaza told us by telephone that 14 officers, putschists or close to the putschists, were in Europe, four of them in Belgium. Their mission could be to try to purchase arms. Information from Germany also indicated the presence in Europe of putschist soldiers or those close to the faction members. Interviewed by telephone, Colonel Bikomagu seemed to confirm the defections of some officers and the fact that meetings had been held in Brussels and Charleroi. According to the chief of staff, these officers are in France at the moment, after having had to leave Belgium due to the vigilance of the Burundian Embassy. Certain sources also report that several Burundians, Messrs. Jean-Claude Ndiyo, Bondo, Nahimana, and Busuguru, stayed at the grand hotel in Liege from 24 to 28 January last, charged with taking delivery of 1,500 machine guns destined for the criminal investigation department. A Belgian is apparently in Bujumbura at the moment providing training in the use of these weapons. Information from the FN company of Herstal, a possible supplier of these machine guns, states that the company is not in the habit of divulging the names of its customers and any intermediaries. FN nevertheless states that it is subject to very precise regulations: Every six months, it contacts the Economic Affairs Ministry to check that the beneficiary countries are not subject to an arms embargo. In the case of Burundi, the FN management checked with the ministry just recently, and the reply was categoric: No export licences are at present being granted, with an embargo on all arms, and no contracts concluded under President Ndadaye may be respected. The present Burundian Government has also decided to block any delivery of arms to the Burundian Army and a cargo is immobilized at the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, despite the efforts made by soldiers to take delivery of it.
