Estonian government on January 7, 1993 concluded a $60 million agreement with state-owned Israeli arms company TAAS under which the company must supply Estonia with arms by end of 1995 and Estonia must makes payments by 2000. The deal brought about a political uproar in Estonia resulting in ratification of the deal at Riigikogu's closed session on December 15 last year with 57 affirmative votes against 10 negative and two abstentions. "The deal with Israel does not so much increase Estonian national defence than the will to defend Estonian state," Rein Helme, deputy head of the parliament's state defence commission, said. Estonia bought from Israel automatic rifles Galil (5.56 mm caliber), machine guns Negev (5.56 mm), submachine guns Mini-Uzi, sniper's rifles, grenade launchers, mortars, antiaircraft guns, missiles, ammunition, radio transmitters. First shipment arrived in Estonia last summer.
