Mulino said that he, as a private citizen, supported the political option Carles represented during these elections, because he believes it was the best, and he said he respects the people's decision and accepts defeat. Mulino said: "I am one of Carles' friends. We accept defeat, but we will continue our struggle and political militancy to monitor the PRD." Mulino formed part of the civic groups that struggled against militarism without being part of any party, although now he announced "he will become a member of one very soon," but he did not specify of which party. Mulino said he will conclude his work at the Foreign Ministry on 1 September, when he will then become a part of his country's opposition. Mulino praised President Guillermo Endara, saying he made possible free and honest elections that will go down in history as an example for future generations.
