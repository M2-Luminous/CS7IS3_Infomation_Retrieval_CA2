FBIS TRENDS-JAPAN-U.S. Tokyo Makes Slow Progress on Framework Issues Tokyo Makes Slow Progress on Framework Issues SUMMARY The recent rise in the yen appears to be putting pressure on the Japanese Government to step up efforts to resolve trade friction with the United States and take steps to reduce Japan's trade surplus. However, the government appears to have no detailed strategy for breaking the impasse and remains firmly opposed to the objective criteria demanded by the United States. Moreover, the weak political position of the minority coalition means that progress on areas of interest to Washington in the framework talks is likely to remain slow. END SUMMARY The ruling Japanese coalition moved swiftly in the wake of the recent rise in the yen to reaffirm its commitment to take steps to open Japanese markets, reduce Japan's trade surplus and defuse trade tensions with the United States. On 30 April, two days after they took office, cabinet ministers in charge of economic affairs held an emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with the yen's surge, according to a Kyodo report the same day. At the meeting, they reportedly agreed on the need to devise concrete measures to open Japanese markets and come up with tax reform proposals. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reportedly told the press after the meeting that the ministers agreed that spurring domestic demand and reducing Japan's trade surplus, especially the surplus with the United States, would help stabilize the yen. The 5 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported that the new government believed that it was "essential" to implement "structural economic reform, including deregulation" to halt the yen's rise. The article indicated that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata planned to meet with administrative vice ministers in all of the government ministries to urge them to draw up "positive" steps to deregulate the economy and to meet with cabinet ministers responsible for economic affairs to discuss the issue. Concern over the yen's rise may also be reducing--at least somewhat--resistance to deregulation and market opening measures in parts of the bureaucracy. The 11 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unnamed Ministry of Finance source as worrying that if the market-opening package that Tokyo has promised to compile by the end of June "falls short of U.S. demands," Washington might attempt to drive up the yen further--a move that, the source reportedly said, would "dampen" the Japanese economy and slow Japan's recovery from its current recession. Continued Opposition to Targets However, the government appears to have few new ideas on how to defuse trade tensions with Washington. Both the cabinet and the bureaucracy appear to remain firmly opposed to Washington's demand for setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance, especially if these criteria might be interpreted as numerical targets. -- Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata, for example, has recently spoken out against targets on a number of occasions. In an interview in the 29 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, he stated that the government could not set targets to reduce Japan's trade surplus because the surplus was "largely" caused by the activities of private enterprises. During meetings with German Economic Minister Guenther Rexrodt on the margins of a 5-7 May Muenster Conference on East-West Economic Relations in Warsaw, Hata apparently solicited Germany's support for Japan's stance on targets, stating that Tokyo opposed the targets because "they are linked to managed trade" (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 8 May). Hata also reportedly alluded to Tokyo's opposition to targets during meetings with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on the margins of the same meeting. According to the 7 May Yomiuri Shimbun, Hata told Brown that while Tokyo wants to conclude the U.S.-Japan framework talks, it did not want to do so in a way that "could result in managed trade" --a formulation Tokyo uses to characterize the use of targets. -- A 25 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun report quoted unnamed Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials as stating that Japan "has not changed its principle that 'numerical targets' should never be accepted." While some senior officials have called for flexibility on the issue of objective criteria, they, too, appear to have no clear idea of how to define the criteria in ways acceptable to both Washington and Tokyo. For example, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated in a 30 April Yomiuri Shimbun interview that it is "important for Japan to "flesh out the 'objective criteria' demanded by the United States." He gave no details of what proposals Tokyo might make, indicating only that in the process of defining objective criteria, Japan "should not relent on its principle of opposing any numerical targets." Similarly, Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu, told the 11 April Nikkei Weekly that while he remained opposed to the setting of numerical targets, he believed that Washington and Tokyo should break out of the "vicious circle" in which Washington demands targets and Tokyo rejects them. He said that both sides should seek a "third path" somewhere between what he characterized as Washington's "results-oriented" approach and Tokyo's "process-oriented approach." He offered no ideas, however, as to what this third path might be. Slow Progress on Deregulation The Japanese press has provided little insight into progress on Tokyo's promise, made in its 29 March market opening proposal, to deregulate portions of the Japanese economy. Available reporting suggests that this progress is slow and that many plans may not have progressed beyond the study stage. A 4 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun article reported that the government had drawn up a "guideline" for the deregulation measures it has committed itself to draw up by the end of June. According to the article, this guideline calls for the "review" of 51 regulations in 16 separate areas, including a proposal for abolishing, in stages, the Large- Scale Retail Stores Law which limits the operations of larger retail stores. The report indicated that this guideline was only the "foundation" for intra-governmental discussions of specific measures. It added, without providing details, that many of the specific measures were likely to encounter opposition from the bureaucracy. Among the deregulation measures that have been announced are some that are likely to have little effect on increasing Japanese imports. For example, according to an 11 May Kyodo report, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) decided on 11 May to abolish regulations requiring Japanese exports to be inspected for quality before being shipped overseas. Opposition to New Stimulus Measures At the same time, portions of the Japanese bureaucracy, especially the Ministry of Finance (MOF), appear to be gearing up to resist any new U.S. or European pressure for Tokyo to implement additional measures to stimulate the Japanese economy and promote domestic demand beyond those incorporated in the fiscal year 1994 budget now before the Japanese Diet. -- Vice Minister of Finance Jiro Saito reportedly told a 21 April news conference that Japan would respond to an International Monetary Fund report calling for additional Japanese measures to stimulate its faltering economy by taking "continued measures and not additional ones" (Kyodo, 21 April). -- The 21 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted unnamed Finance Ministry sources as expressing concern that Washington might ask Japan to draw up additional measures to stimulate the Japanese economy that MOF did not consider necessary. -- Governor of the Bank of Japan Yasushi Mieno argued, during a speech on 19 April, that additional macroeconomic measures will not help Japan curb its trade surplus, but might overheat the Japanese economy, according to a Kyodo report that day. He reportedly argued that if Japan adopts an "overly ambitions macroeconomic policy to rectify its external imbalances, this may well result in inflation and overheated economic activity." -- Ryutaro Komiya, a professor at Aoyama Gakuin University with close ties to the government--he is director general of the Research Institute of International Trade and Industry, a research arm of MITI--appeared to agree with Mieno's line of argument. In an interview in the 19 April Asahi Shimbun, he stated that further fiscal measures may "destabilize" rather than stimulate the Japanese economy. Tax Reform The ruling coalition appears to have no clear strategy to deal with the opposition that any tax reform proposals it puts forward will probably encounter in the Diet, especially from the Social Democratic Party of Japan. Speaking about tax reform in his policy speech before the Diet on 10 May, Prime Minister Hata appeared to go no further than the vague wording of the policy agreement hammered out by the ruling coalition parties, including the SDPJ, before the SDPJ seceded from the coalition. Hata spoke of the need to institute "sweeping tax reform" in order "to actively develop welfare policies" to support an "aging society," while at the same time "giving consideration to improving the fiscal structure . . . and ensuring fiscal sources to support tax reduction." The 11 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the Tax System Research Council was studying possible compromise reform proposals that might gain SDPJ support, including a plan that would incorporate both an income tax and a system of selected increases in the consumption tax. Under this plan, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the consumption tax on food would remain low in accordance with proposals supported by the SDPJ. Outlook The minority coalition's political weakness will probably prevent it from taking any bold steps or making any substantial progress in any of the areas of interest to the United States in the framework talks--especially on the more controversial issues, such as tax reform. At the same time, however, the coalition will probably be under some political pressure to take steps to address trade friction with Washington. Failure to do so would give the opposition parties, particularly the Liberal Democratic Party, additional ammunition to attack the coalition in the Diet. (AUTHOR: BOUNDS.
