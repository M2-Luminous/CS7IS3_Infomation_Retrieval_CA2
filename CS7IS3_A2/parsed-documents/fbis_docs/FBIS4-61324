He announced his decision on Wednesday but declined to give the reasons for the move. It looks like supporters of market reforms are staking on former Economics Minister Vladimir Lanovoy, 42, organiser of the "reforms for the people" parliamentary faction, president of the centre of market reforms and master of economic sciences. He stands a better chance of being elected than Pinzenik, since Lanovoy is believed to be the "victim" of cabinet games. When Lanovoy was an economics minister and vice-premier, he suggested several programmes of coming out of the crisis which were blocked both by the cabinet of ministers and the parliament. During the current election campaign Lanovoy has been insisting on these programmes again, saying that this will bring about economic recovery of the country. One of the real candidates to the presidential post, Leonid Kravchuk, maintains his former position, saying that elections should be postponed until later. He motivates his position by the absence of a new constitution, an indefinite status of the president and an inadequate structure of the executive power. A total of 120 Ukrainian lawmakers had come out in support of Kravchuk's position, demanding in an address the nation that the presidential elections be postponed. This caused a stormy reaction from other lawmakers and primarily, those contesting for the post of the president. Former speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Ivan Plyushch, is busy finding out the names of those who signed the address. The Ukrainian parliament has been putting pressure on the Ukrainian UKRINFORM news agency which circulated the address in a bid to get a list of the 120 lawmakers who put their signatures under the document.
