He also said that the withdrawal of the Russian forces from the former Soviet republics and from foreign countries creates problems in providing housing for Russian servicemen. He said that next year the volume of housing construction will be increased and that in 1996-97 all servicemen will be provided with comfortable apartments. He stated that a peacekeeping force would be created in the Volga Military District on the basis of the 27th motorized infantry division. In addition, there is a motorized infantry division in the Leningrad Region which can also be used as a peacekeeping force. This will be enough for tackling all peacekeeping tasks within the CIS and by decision of the UN, he said. He expressed the opinion that Russia's air force can perform any peacekeeping mission without preliminary training. On Tuesday, Grachev visited the construction site in the Samara Region where 1,910 apartments are being built for servicemen. From the Samara Region he went to Udmurtia where he met with local leaders
