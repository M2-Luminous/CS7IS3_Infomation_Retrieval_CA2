FR940826-2-00096 FR940826-2-00055 C. Allowing a BOC to Provide Interexchange Service from Cellular Exchanges. Without Equal Access. Would Reduce Competition for Cellular Interexchange Service. The crux of the BOCs' original waiver application to the Department, seeking the removal of equal access and the unrestricted removal of the interexchange prohibition on their wireless businesses, the BOCs argued that ``competition in radio services is extremely robust,'' that ``competition is flourishing in mobile service markets,'' and that ``without a showing of market power, the bell companies are plainly entitled to the relief they seek.'' 19 19 Memorandum of the Bell Companies in Support of their Motion for Removal of Mobile and other Wireless Services from the scope of the Interexchange Restriction and Equal Access Requirement of Section II of the Decree, pp. 6, 16 (Dec. 13, 1991). Contrary to that last claim, the burden is on the movant to show a lack of market power. Rufo. 112 S. Ct. at 760 (``a party seeking a modification of a consent decree bears the burden *␣*␣*''); Triennial Review, 900 F.2d at 296 (``the ultimate burden under section VIII(C) remains on the petitioning BOC''). Specifically, all of the BOCs argued in 1991, and the movants argue again, that equal access raises prices for long distance by permitting non-BOC cellular carriers to buy long distance in bulk but charge retail rates; if equal access were eliminated, the cellular duopolists would purportedly compete with each other on long distance, driving down the price. BOC Mem. 45 (Dec. 13, 1991); BOC Reply Mem. 21&hyph;26 (Aug. 3, 1992); BellSouth Mem. 22&hyph;23; Southwestern Mem. 27. To support this logic, it must be shown that the cellular duopoly is competitive. The facts, however, are just the opposite. Cellular duopolists plainly have market power in cellular service, and the major premise of the BOCs' argument therefore fails. It follows inexorably that if the BOC has market power in cellular service, and can exclude competitors in long distance, it can exclude the benefits of competition that those competitors bring. 1. Cellular Exchange Service Markets are Not Competitive Today. These cellular systems have substantial market power. The FCC has so concluded on four separate occasions in the last three years, 20 and the General Accounting Office has reached the same conclusion. 21 The Department's extensive investigations into the cellular industry likewise indicate that cellular duopolists have substantial market power: ``the ability to raise prices or restrict output.''

Rcd. 7700, 7744 (1993) (`` FCC PCS Order ''). The FCC's recent decisions_particularly its 1993 PCS Order_were entered after and despite the cellular industry's intensive (but unpersuasive) efforts to argue that the cellular duopoly is competitive. See Reply Comments of the Department of Justice, In re Personal Communications Services, at 17&hyph;22 (F.C.C. Jan. 19, 1993) (citing and rebutting arguments). 21 Report to Hon. Harry Reid, U.S. Senate, Concerns About Competition in the Cellular Telephone Service Industry, pp. 2&hyph;4 (Gen. Acctg. Ofc. 1992). The basic structural problem with cellular markets is well known_the fact that they are and have been duopolies with (at least until very recently) absolute barriers to entry. While the FCC's decision to issue two cellular licenses_rather than only one_was motivated by a desire to stimulate competition. Cellular Communications, 89 F.C.C.2d 58, 61 (1982), two-firm markets are not particularly competitive. 22 The noncompetitiveness of two-firm markets is exacerbated here by the overlapping alliances of the cellular carriers, so that firms that ``compete'' with each other in one market are partners in another. 23 22 Economic theory generally predicts that prices will be higher and output less in markets with fewer rather than more competitors, or in markets that are more highly concentrated, absent mitigating factors, See. e.g., Scherer & Ross at 277&hyph;78; 4 Areeda & Turner, ¶910b at 55 (``there is general agreement that beyond some point the smaller the number of firms and the larger the share of the market dominated by one or a relatively few firms, the greater the likelihood of substantial departures from competitive performance, particularly with regard to price''); Stigler, ``A Theory of Oliogopoly, 72 J. Political Econ. 44&hyph;61 (1964). Studies indicate that markets dominated by duopolies are particularly troublesome. ``Large market shares for the two leading firms seem most decisive for industry price-cost margins, with a depressing effect from a sufficiently large third share.'' Kwoka. ``The Effect of Market Share Distribution on Industry Performance,'' 61 Rev. Econ. & Statistics 101, 108 (1979). Many studies have found a statistically significant positive correlation between price and market concentration. See Schmalensee, ``Inter-Industry Studies of Structure and Performance,'' in 2 R. Schmalensee & R. Willig, Handbook of Indus. Org. 987&hyph;88 (1989) (collecting studies); L. Weiss, Concentration and Price 268 (1989) (``overwhelming support'' for concentration-price hypothesis). 23 For example, AirTouch (the former PacTel cellular properties) is a partner with McCaw in operating a cellular system in San Francisco, and competes against a McCaw/BellSouth system in Los Angeles, BellSouth, McCaw's partner in Los Angeles, is McCaw's rival in Miami. Southwestern Bell partners with McCaw in operating the ``Cellular One'' marketing organization, but competes against McCaw in Dallas, St. Louis and Kansas City. The BOC's internal documents, written at the same time that they were telling the Department that cellular is ``robustly competitive,'' demonstrate that in the BOCs' view cellular is comfortably noncompetitive. Southwestern, which argues that ``wireless markets today are vigorously competitive'' (SWB Mem. 11), observed in 1991_the year it and the other BOCs filed for this waiver_that there was an ``absence of significant price competition'' in cellular, and that the market is ``highly attractive'' for that reason. [218486] Southwestern further observed: The FCC predicted sufficient levels of rivalry from a duopoly. In actuality, the two players in each market have been able to avoid serious competition in this rapid growth environment. [218492] In the current environment, characterized by rapid growth and limited rivalry, relative position is less relevant than in mature, competitive industries *␣*␣* In the future, as new competitors enter the market and subscriber growth eventually levels off, positioning will become increasingly important. [218517] More recently, Southwestern observed that ``new industry entrants will not be effective competition before 1996'' (emphasis in original). Southwestern assessed that threat of new entrants as ``medium,'' and the bargaining power of buyers as ``low''_recognizing that the ``threat of substitute products or services [is] low'' and that ``extensive time periods for regulatory determinations, license awards and infrastructure construction will occur prior to the emergence of effective competitors.'' [SWB 203264&hyph;65] Other BOCs have made similar observations about cellular markets. The duopoly structure is a continuation of the status quo. *␣*␣* Under this scenario, competitive intensity is greatly reduced. This enables direct cellular competitors to improve margins *␣*␣*. In fact, the most significant element of this structure is the probability that profit margins for all competitors would tend to increase under prolonged restricted competition. (AM00385&hyph;86, Ameritech, July 1990) Cellular industry_unusually attractive structural characteristics_government-mandated duopoly providing very high barriers to entry_essentially unregulated with regard to rates and rate of return *␣*␣* overall competitive rivalry is low to moderate *␣*␣* to date little competition on service pricing. (PT00008&hyph;12, Pac Tel, Sept. 1, 1987) The burgeoning demand for cellular service when coupled with the duopolistic market structure mandated by the FCC has led most investment analysts to conclude that the cellular industry will be even more profitable than cable TV, to which comparisons are constantly made. *␣*␣* While BAMS believes that providing quality cellular service requires considerably more investment in the infrastructure of the business *␣*␣* than does cable, it must be acknowledged that the investment community has been generally correct in forecasts of thriving cellular revenues. It is also important to note that increased market penetration in the absence of downward price pressures will buy alot of infrastructure. (106707, Bell Atlantic 1989) In June 1992, six months after filing this waiver application asserting that cellular was ``robustly competitive,'' US West observed: ``Current duopoly structure and market growth limits competitive intensity.''
