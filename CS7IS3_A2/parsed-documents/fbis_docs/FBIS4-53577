But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's East Asia Analytical Unit warns that Australia's current market share in India will drop "unless Australia increases its efforts in India". At a preview of India's Economy at the Midnight Hour: Australia's India Strategy, the unit's director, Dr Meredith Borthwick, said the private sector will have to drop its outdated and largely negative image of the subcontinent. Dr Borthwick acknowledged that India was a difficult market but "it will repay the perseverence required". The new report -- to be launched by the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan in Melbourne today -- says the Indian business environment is not well regarded, even by Australian companies which have been successful there. "This negative image must be redressed. Although some difficulties remain, old stereotypes no longer reflect the realities of the Indian market. India is changing, and our competitors have been quick to realise this," the report says. "More and more, India is being hailed as the `new tiger' [with annual growth rates of around 6 percent] and its economic prospects are being compared favourably to the other giant in the region, China" The report chronicles the transformation of India's political and economic climate over the past three years. Key changes include big reductions in industrial tariffs, the easing of foreign investment rules, the abolition of licensing requirements for industrial ventures, tax cuts and increased capital market flexibility. The report says the Indian reform process has passed the point of no return. "Three years of courageous, bold and rapid liberalisation have sufficiently entrenched deregulation trends in both the popular middle-class thinking and among most economic actors and opinion leaders." Australia last year enjoyed a trade surplus with India of $513 million with Australian exports of $920 million against imports from India of $407 million. The report concludes that "Australia could double its annual exports to the Indian market by the year 2000" but warns that "opportunistic, ill-researched approaches bear high risks."
