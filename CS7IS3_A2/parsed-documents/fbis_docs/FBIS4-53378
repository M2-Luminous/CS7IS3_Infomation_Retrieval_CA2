"To face the challenge, ASEAN's economy should be turned into a more efficient one. Apart from that the quality of their products as well as management should be improved to achieve world standards," he said at an international conference, entitled "Waves of The Future -- ASEAN, Vietnam, and China: Opportunities for World Business." At the conference which lasts from May 17 through 19, the Indonesian coordinating minister further said that a number of opportunities would be wide open for ASEAN investors to conduct business in rapid developing countries in the field of industry, including China, India, and Vietnam. "These countries are potential markets for our exports," he added. According to Hartarto, those countries provide comparative advantages in industry which is labour-intensive with relatively low labour wages and a hard working labour force. ASEAN should make the necessary adjustment if it wants to be successful in an increasingly stiff competition. Hartarto also touched on the success of the Uruguay Round and the acceptance of GATT and its connection with ASEAN. He further believed that the success of the Uruguay Round would contribute to ASEAN's economic growth and after the ratification of the GATT, the Association of Southeast Asian nations would have access into the international market without any obstacles. In his working paper entitled "ASEAN: New Opportunities and Challenges," the coordinating minister reiterated the ASEAN position and that of the developing countries which rejected the interconnection of trade with social and labour standard issues, urging that these issues be tackled by existing international organizations. The ASEAN labour ministers, who convened here from May 16 through 17, urged the International Labour Organization (ILO) to oppose the Western countries pressure to protect their domestic markets. The Western countries should not be permitted to force the ILO to apply stiff labour standards as a precondition for the developing countries to obain market access, said a joint communique of the ASEAN ministers. After seven years of negotiations on the GATT, the 125 participating countries agreed to implement the GATT at the last meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco on April 15. The centre of attention of the GATT is world economic growth based on free trade and multilateral system or on an open and transparent system. The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade body, will replace the GATT and is expected to have more power to eradicate global protectionism. Meanwhile, social clauses interlinked with international trade agreements are considered as a new form of protectionism. Hartarto stated that the European Union and the NAFTA should remain open and transparent as was the case with the ASEAN economy which adhered to the open system, so that in the future Europe, North America, and Asia would achieve a favourable economic balance without one region considering itself dominant. Hartarto went on to state that when competition became increasingly stiff, increasing productivity in the three regiona would become a driving force for world economic growth and expansion of world trade which in turn would also create new opportinuities for all countries. The coordinating minister for industry and trade also revealed that the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) was established to face global challenges. The aim of the AFTA is to enhance economic cooperation among the ASEAN member countries through the application of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) which will be in force as of January 1993, Hartarto said.
