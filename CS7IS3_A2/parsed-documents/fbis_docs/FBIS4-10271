Upon condemning the attack against the deputy, Garcia said this incident demonstrates an attempt is being made to end the democratic system in the country. He added the attack represents an unjustifiable action, just like the assassination of Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez at a time when the government and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] signed a global human rights accord. The human rights ombudsman demanded the government of the Republic end this series of events aimed at disrupting the democratic regime. He asked the government to implement the constitutional mechanisms; that is, to have security forces comply with their duty.
