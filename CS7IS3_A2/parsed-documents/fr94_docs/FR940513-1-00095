FR940513-1-00095 FR940513-1-00020 The regulations implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994), increased the minimum mesh size for fishing for any of the regulated multispecies finfish, including winter flounder, and applied it throughout the range of the species. Prior to Amendment 5, the minimum mesh size was 51/2 inches (13.97 cm) in the Gulf of Maine, on Georges Bank, and a part of Southern New England, while elsewhere there was no minimum net mesh size. Under Amendment 5, the minimum mesh size requirement is 6 inches (15.24 cm) throughout the net in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank, as of May 1, 1994. The minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97 cm) throughout the net in Southern New England in 1994, remaining 51/2 inch (13.97 cm) diamond and increasing to 6-inch (15.24 cm) square in 1995, and thereafter. In the mid-Atlantic, the minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97 cm) as described in the summer flounder regulations under 50 CFR 625.24(a). Also under the amendment, the minimum size for winter flounder was increased from 11 inches (27.9 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm). The ASMFC Plan was approved in May, 1992. The fishing mortality objectives of the ASMFC Plan, a maximum spawning potential (MSP) target of 30 percent by January 1, 1995, and an MSP target of 40 percent by January 1, 1999, are more restrictive than in the FMP for federally managed stocks (20 percent MSP). The ASMFC Plan allows individual states to utilize different measures to achieve these objectives. State plans must be reviewed by the ASMFC's Winter Flounder Technical Committee and approved by the ASMFC Winter Flounder Management Board as meeting the management objectives. The Council proposes the winter flounder exemption on the basis that, while the management objectives of the ASMFC Plan are more conservative for winter flounder than those of Amendment 5, they may be achieved by a different set of measures than those in the FMP. Without the proposed exemption, a vessel would have to comply with the more restrictive elements of both the state and Federal regulations. Under these circumstances, compliance with both state and Federal rules simultaneously might impose an unnecessary regulatory burden on federally permitted vessels fishing in state waters for winter flounder that exceeds that which applies to either state-permitted vessels fishing exclusively in state waters or federally permitted vessels fishing in Federal waters. The purpose of the proposed action is to alleviate the cumulative impact of the regulations on fishermen, while still achieving the FMP's objectives for winter flounder and other regulated species of the FMP. The proposed rule provides that a vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit may fish for winter flounder with mesh smaller than that specified in the regulations governing the multispecies fishery (50 CFR part 651), may retain winter flounder smaller than the minimum size allowed by those regulations, and may retain more than the possession limit of winter flounder, if certain conditions are met. These conditions are: (1) The fishing is conducted exclusively in the waters of the state from which the exemption certificate was obtained; (2) the vessel has on board a certificate issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's participation in the state's winter flounder fishing program and is in compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum mesh size and minimum fish size for winter flounder; (3) the state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the ASMFC as being in compliance with the ASMFC Plan; (4) the state elects in writing to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to participate in the exemption program; (5) the amount of regulated species, exclusive of winter flounder, on board a vessel issued a limited access permit that is fishing under the days-at-sea (DAS) program or under a DAS exemption program in ยง651.22(d), does not exceed the possession limit; (6) the vessel does not enter or transit the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), unless the vessel is in a designated transit zone established by the Regional Director at the request of the coastal state; and (7) the vessel does not enter or transit the waters of another state, unless such other state is participating in the exemption program described by this section and the vessel is enrolled in that state's program. The exemption to Federal fishery regulations being proposed in this action would apply to minimum fish lengths, minimum mesh size, and the regulated species possession limit of winter flounder, in certain cases. A vessel must still comply with all other applicable Federal fisheries regulations while fishing for winter flounder under this exemption. The intent of this revised version of the winter flounder exemption is to achieve conservation objectives under the FMP and the ASMFC Plan for winter flounder, and to meet conservation objectives under the FMP for other regulated species of groundfish as defined in the FMP, while still providing for the winter flounder exemption in state waters. The Council intends that any vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit under the FMP subject to requirements of the DAS program in the FMP will have its fishing activity in state waters for winter flounder credited towards its individual DAS or fleet DAS. This requirement should minimize the effect of fishing for winter flounder in state waters on other regulated species of groundfish. Vessels fishing in state waters under the winter flounder exemption program would be subject to possession limits that would vary, depending on the vessel's gear type and the category of the Federal multispecies permit it holds. Vessels fishing with gillnets, vessels less than 45 ft (13.7 m) in length, and vessels under the individual or fleet DAS program may harvest an unlimited amount of winter flounder and not more than 500 lbs (226.8 kg) of the remaining regulated species other than winter flounder. Vessels using hook gear still would not be subject to any possession limits on multispecies. Vessels fishing with a possession limit only permit would be subject to the 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit for regulated species.
