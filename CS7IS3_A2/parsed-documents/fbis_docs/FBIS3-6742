He disclosed that a huge amount of nuclear waste has annually come from the nuclear power stations now under operation in South Korea and their storing facilities in South Korea have already reached the limit. South Korea has turned into a nuclear powder magazine in the true sense of the term due to the nuclear weapons development manoeuvrings of the puppet clique and the deployment of more than one thousand nuclear weapons of the U.S. forces, he noted. He referred to the racket kicked up by the puppets over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North as an intrigue to cover up their nuclear armament. Nuclear threat comes from the South, not from the North, he said, adding that the South Korean authorities should unconditionally and immediately get the U.S. nuclear weapons, the hotbed of a nuclear war, withdrawn and discontinue for good the "Team Spirit" manoeuvres that may cause a nuclear war.
