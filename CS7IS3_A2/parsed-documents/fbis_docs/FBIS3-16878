The meeting dealt with a specific subject discussed in detail by the MPs on the previous day -- defaults of payments -- and not the entire spectrum of socio-economic problems. It is noteworthy that, despite the premier's rigid stand (he firmly declared against emergency measures in the economy, against mutual offsets of debts and the emission of money), the discussion was rather peaceful. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Friday's heavy snowfall and coup rumours: "It snowed heavily in Moscow on Friday and, as is usually the case, the mayor's office as represented by the road-cleaning service was not prepared for such a whim of winter. "There developed huge traffic jams in the streets, and the cars of many statesmen got stuck. According to reliable information, some of them, to while away the time, discussed rumours about a coup that was allegedly to be carried out on Thursday. "Analysing numerous pronouncements by opposition members at a rally and in the state duma, one can only guess who it was who intended to overthrow the lawfully elected president or, vice-versa, to enhance his authority. "Even if a coup began, it would have hardly succeeded because tanks (as the main attribute of Moscow unrest) would not have been able to manoeuvre in the snow-drifted and traffic-blocked streets of the capital". KOSMOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who, touching upon possible actions of the opposition on May 1, stated: "We prepare for a possible unrest most seriously. Militia have been provided with all the necessary technical equipment. Law enforcement agencies have been instructed to put a stop to actions that would threaten the safety or disturb the peace of Muscovites". NOVAYA GAZETA on a timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia: "The diplomats of Russia and Latvia have agreed upon a timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Latvia. Russia will lease the Skrunda radar for four years and then it will dismantle it in 18 months' time. The question of radar lease payments remains undecided. An amount of two million U.S. dollars does not suit the Latvian side. "Russian politicians do not want to draw lessons from their lamentable experience. We assumed obligations for a withdrawal of Russian troops from Eastern European countries and we ourselves determined time-limits and then tried to settle the financial problems. "Having left behind residential buildings, a developed infrastructure, office space, etc. In the countries where its troops stayed, Russia in exchange received bills for ruined ecology, moral damage, etc". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus. Two missile divisions stationed at Mozyr and Lida are to be withdrawn and are to be fully disbanded by mid-1996. All military and residential townships of missilemen are to be turned over to the Belarusian side. Speaking about the future of missilemen themselves, Lieutenant-General Viktor Yesin, chief of the operations division of the main headquarters of strategic missile forces, pointed out that they will serve in undermanned Russian units. Commissioned and non-commissioned officers who remain in Belarus will enjoy all the rights of Belarusian citizens. SOVIETSKAYA ROSSIA runs an address to the citizens of Russia by the leaders of the left-centre opposition. The address reads, in particular, as follows: "We are backed by the creative experience and heroism of the great citizens of Russian and the patriots of the motherland. "We are backed by the millennia-long experience of Russian statehood. We shall strive for national concord and consolidation of society and for the enlistment of the efforts of all citizens-patriots for the restoration of the wrecked Russia which is at a loss." ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE recalls that cityfolk are to go the polls on Sunday to elect members of the ST. PETERSBURG municipal assembly. Fifty seats are being contested by more than 740 candidates. The municipal court issued a ruling recognising as invalid the point in the statute of elections which previously limited the participation of servicemen and students without a residential registration in the polling. This time they are also included in the voters' lists.
