FR940628-2-00107 FR940628-2-00084 Customs Service Accounting Procedures for Drawback AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury. ACTION: Proposed Change of Position; solicitation of comments. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that Customs proposes to amend the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives to permit first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting for exports and drawback deliveries of petroleum products with different drawback factors which are commingled in inventory. Currently, such accounting is required on the basis of lower-to-higher drawback factors, and is not consistent with recent changes to the Customs Regulations in this regard or commercial accounting procedures. Additionally, Customs proposes to revoke a published ruling and any unpublished rulings to the same effect under which identification of merchandise and articles for drawback purposes is permitted on a higher-to-lower basis. This change is consistent with the Customs Regulations, commercial accounting procedures, and efficient administration and will result in revenue neutrality when drawback claimants choose to commingle merchandise or articles and to identify them by an accounting procedure. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments (preferably in triplicate) may be addressed to the U.S. Customs Service, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Regulations Branch, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229. Comments filed may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street, NW., Suite 4000, Washington, DC.

Background Section 313, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313), authorizes ``drawback''. Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax, or fee. There are a number of different kinds of drawback authorized under law, including manufacturing and same condition drawback. Under paragraph (a) of §1313, drawback is authorized when imported merchandise is used in the manufacture of articles which are exported. Under paragraph (j)(1) of §1313, drawback is authorized when imported merchandise is exported (or destroyed) in the same condition as when it was imported, if the merchandise is not used in the U.S. Paragraphs (b) and (j)(2) of §1313 respectively provide for the substitution of domestic or other merchandise for the imported merchandise in manufacturing and same condition drawback. Paragraph (l) of §1313 provides that the allowance of drawback shall be subject to compliance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe. The Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback are found in Part 191 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 191). Under the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 191, Subparts B and D), manufacturers or producers of articles intended for exportation with drawback under §1313(a) or (b) must apply for and obtain approval of a drawback contract (sometimes called a drawback ``rate'') describing the manufacturing or production operations covered and setting forth the conditions which are to be met to obtain drawback. The general requirements in the Customs Regulations for records, storage, and identification pertaining to drawback are found in 19 CFR 191.22. Section 191.22(c) authorizes the identification for drawback purposes of commingled lots of fungible merchandise and articles by applying first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting principles or any other accounting procedure approved by Customs. Section 191.22(c) was added to the Customs Regulations in its current form when the drawback regulations (formerly in Part 22 of the Customs Regulations) were revised in 1983 (T.D. 83&hyph;212, published in the Federal Register on October 14, 1983 (48 FR 46740)). Before this revision, the corresponding provision in Part 22 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 22.4(f)) permitted identification of fungible merchandise and articles commingled in storage on the basis of the lot or lots of merchandise or articles with the lowest drawback value or allowance first, then the next-lowest, and so on (i.e., ``lower-to-higher''). The Notice of Proposed Revision of Part 22 (published in the Federal Register on August 26, 1982 (47 FR 37563)) would have limited the accounting method for identification of merchandise and articles commingled in storage to FIFO only (47 FR 37565, 37573). The reason given for the introduction of the FIFO accounting procedure was that the then existing provision was difficult to administer and inconsistent with commercial accounting techniques. Section 191.22(c) was changed to its current form when the final revision was issued as T.D. 83&hyph;212. The change (i.e., permitting other accounting procedures in addition to FIFO) was made in response to a comment that identification should not be limited to FIFO. Customs stated, in the T.D., that the comment was believed to have merit and ``[t]herefore, other accounting procedures such as `low-to-high,' `identification,' and `blanket identification' may be used.'' (``Identification'' is direct or actual identification (i.e., identification without recourse to an accounting method such as FIFO) and ``blanket identification'' is similar to lower-to-higher.)
