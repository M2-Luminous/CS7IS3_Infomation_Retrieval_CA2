A. Sklyarov, Yu. I. Brichkov and V. A. Vorobyev, Saratov State University imeni N. G. Chernyshevskiy; UDC 528.83] [Abstract] Two methods for satellite measurements of outgoing radiation fluxes are examined (with scanning narrow-angle and nonscanning wide-angle radiometers) in connection with determination of the Earth's radiation budget, requiring a knowledge of the mean intensity of radiation over extensive areas. The problems involved in processing the measured quantities for determining the outgoing radiation fluxes are discussed and a comparative analysis of the measuring capabilities of both methods is presented. It is shown that measurements made with scanners are inferior to wide-angle radiometers. A wide-angle radiometer immediately registers the instantaneous mean value of outgoing radiation over a great area, whereas scanners give a better result when it is necessary to obtain a more detailed regional distribution of outgoing radiation (in grid units measuring 2.5 x 2.5ï¿½). The color effect arising due to the difference in the spectral composition of radiation between the calibration target and the object is much greater for a scanner. A wide-angle radiometer operating in the SW range can be calibrated quite simply directly in ordinary actinometric units, whereas the calibration procedure is extremely complex for scanners and must be accomplished virtually continuously, a serious source of errors. The scanner is structurally more complex, whereas wide-angle radiometers are simpler in design and operation and have a longer useful life and provide an accuracy in determining budget parameters equal to scanner determinations. However, it is concluded that both types of instruments (scanning and wide-angle radiometers) effectively supplement one another. References 15: 8 Russian, 7 Western.
