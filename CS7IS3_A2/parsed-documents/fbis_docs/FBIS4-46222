The statements, sent to the Red Army's contacts in Japan, mark the May 30, 1972, Red Army machine-gun and grenade attack on passengers at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel. That attack was carried out as a mark of solidarity with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. This year's statement claims the United States is creating tensions by using the threat from North Korea to promote its own plans to achieve nuclear exclusivity. "The Japanese Government also accepts this and, in line with the United Nations, is agitating over whether or not to introduce sanctions," the statement says. The statement also says Japan should reflect on its aggression during World War II and observe the spirit of peace enunciated in Article 9 of its constitution. It says the Red Army opposes Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
