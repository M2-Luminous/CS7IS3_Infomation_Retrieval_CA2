In this regard, the Sunday weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE uses as an example the case of two people killed on 12 May while trying to reach the U.S. military installation over land; that is, by crossing mine fields. According to JUVENTUD REBELDE, the bodies were found two days later in the area of Paraguay, a swampy area near the waters of Guantanamo Bay where they had been led and presumably killed by alleged guides, who, in exchange for 20,000 pesos, would supposedly help them reach the base. The report also adds the killers, who had already received the money after one presented his driving license as identification to the brother of one of the murdered individuals, were arrested by the police and will be tried in a court of law. The weekly publication says Cuban authorities have repeatedly warned of the risk of attempting to illegally depart the country by entering this U.S. installation, which has thousands of mines planted around its perimeter. The publication adds that during these illegal attempts at emigration, the lives of those that have been lost or the bodies that were mutilated were not only of those wishing to leave the country but, rather, young border guards "committed more to the safety of others than their own." JUVENTUD REBELDE also notes that Cuban dissuasive mechanisms will never be enough as long as the generosity with which the United States welcomes illegal Cubans keeps boosting the expectations of those who want to leave. The publication goes on to explain that the legal possibilities of leaving Cuba are limited because the U.S. Government grants only a reduced number of visas despite an agreement signed by the two countries in 1987 establishing the yearly granting of 20,000 U.S. visas. In 1993, it adds, only 1,600 residents were issued U.S. immigrant visas. According to JUVENTUD REBELDE's commentator, those same reasons explain why, during the first months of 1994, another 1,100 Cubans left Cuba on rafts or rudimentary crafts thereby risking their lives.
