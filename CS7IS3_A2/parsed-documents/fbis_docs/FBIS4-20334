Of the 800 phosphate fertilizer-producing enterprises covered by a national unified inspection, the sample qualified rate of small enterprises was only 76.9 percent, 19.3 percentage points below the sample average qualified rate (96.2 percent) of large- and medium-sized enterprises. Of all of them, the 21 inferior-quality products were all produced by the small enterprises; of the 93 samples with unqualified phosphate content, the small enterprises accounted for 96.8 percent. An official in the relevant part of the State Technology Supervision Administration (STSA) has pleaded for a strengthening of quality management in small phosphate fertilizer enterprises. The STSA recently organized a nationwide unified supervision and inspection of the quality of two phosphate fertilizer products: calcium magnesium phosphate and calcium superphosphate. The results of inspection of 811 samples in 800 phosphate fertilizer-producing enterprises in 28 provinces throughout China showed that 644 qualified, the sample average qualification rate being 81.9 percent. Of them, of the 209 samples in 199 large- and medium-sized enterprises 201 qualified, the qualification rate being 96.2 percent, and in the 601 small enterprises inspected there were fairly many problems in 602 samples. The main problem is that, because old and obsolete methods of production continue to be used, the moisture content is high, the effective phosphate content is low, and the free acid content is overproof. For example, in the fourth-grade calcium superphosphate produced by Shaanxi Province's Chenggu Yuantian Chemical Plant, the moisture content was as high as 26.8 percent (the standard requirement is less than 15 percent), and the effective phosphate content was only 3.7 percent (the standard requirement is greater than or egual to 12.0 percent). The Qiling-brand fourth-grade calcium superphosphate produced by the Linzi Guoli Chemical Plant in Zibo City, Shandong Province, went directly out of the factory without going through a maturation process; the free acid content of its products was 15.5 percent (the standard requirement is less than or equal to 5.5 percent), exceeding the upper limit of the standard requirement by nearly three times. The STSA official concluded: The main causes of the quality problem in small phosphate fertilizer enterprises are: the consciousness of quality is poor and enterprise management is slack; production conditions are poor and the technological level is low; and products are turned out in large quantities without regard for quality, shoddy work is done, and inferior materials are used. The official demanded that the enterprises that were found unqualified in the unified inspection supervise and urge their relevant departments in charge to be responsible for rectification and reform, and said that the original producing firms must recall inferior-quality products and reprocess them technically. With regard to enterprises that intentionally turn out products in large quantities without regard for quality and that cheat the consumers, he said that, besides meting out severe punishment, cases in which the circumstances are serious must be turned over to the judicial organs for investigation into the responsibility for the crime.
