He says the agreement is not likely to be implemented given further economic recession in Ukraine. Derkach pointed to a lack of convincing arguments in statements by the American and Russian leaders about security guarantees and technical assistance to Ukraine. "The $175 Mn aid to Ukraine the Americans promised a long time ago will be used to pay U.S. experts," he said. The dismantling and transfer of long-range missiles from Ukraine to Russia will cost $3 Bn, according to the estimates local experts made prior to the ratification of the Start I agreement by Ukrainian deputies.
