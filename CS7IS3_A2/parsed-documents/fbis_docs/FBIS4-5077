Referring to the current situation surrounding the "nuclear issue", Ho Chong-man said the United States is entirely to blame for the situation in which the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York on Februray 25 and the Feb. 15 agreement between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency had been reversed, and for the situation of the Korean peninsula which is rushing headlong to the brink of war. He said that the "presidential statement" of the UN Security Council was another international pressure upon the DPRK and that such "threat" and "pressure" could never be a solution to the problem. "The `nuclear issue' must be solved fairly in keeping with the special status of the DPRK in which it has temporarily suspended the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," he said, expressing the hope that the JSDP would play a positive role to this end.
