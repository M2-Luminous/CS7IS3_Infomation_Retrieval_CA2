But debts remain -- 250 million rubles [R] to the "Pressa" Publishing House and many millions to paper combines, printing centers, and partners in the newspaper's delivery. How did these debts arise? It is known that production of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA was halted for two and one-half months during October-December 1993 because of the actions of the former Ministry of the Press and Information, which were subsequently deemed illegal in court. The editorial office incurred tremendous losses as a result of the abortive subscription campaign for the first half of 1994 and was deprived of the revenue from advertising and retail sales -- in all, by the end of 1993 the loss exceeded R1.3 billion. In addition, the editorial office's current account was frozen for a long time by a Central Bank directive, which the Superior Court of Arbitration deemed invalid -- this was how the chain of debts and unjustified sanctions in the form of fines arose. At the same time we know that our readers have a very great need for the newspaper -- it has largely restored its readership in a short time: The number of subscribers has topped 270,000, and the total circulation is approaching half a million. A further 18,000 subscribers have joined us in April. But it is becoming increasingly costly to produce the newspaper. It now costs R25-30 million to produce a single issue. This is only at present! What is to be done?! Let us consult one another.
