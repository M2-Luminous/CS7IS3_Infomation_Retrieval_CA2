The extraordinary Diet session ends today and a package of political reform bills has been enacted in the Diet. Ruling and opposition parties have agreed to amend the enacted bills at the next ordinary Diet session. I think there will be various questions about the settlement of the political reform bills, but as dean of the press corps, I would like to ask what the Hosokawa cabinet will do from now on. The Hosokawa cabinet has continued to delay mapping out a new package of stimulus measures and compiling a budget for fiscal 1994. Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to deal with these policy tasks? In particular, income tax reduction has become a focal point. Mr. Prime Minister, how much do you plan to cut income tax? How are you going to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from cuts in the income tax? I hope you will answer my questions specifically. [Hosokawa] Among other things, I would like to mention the political reform bills. The bills were passed a while ago in the House of Councillors but it cannot be said that they have been enacted completely. First, I would like to say that the government has hurdled a big obstacle, which is the passage of the political reform bills. Now, I feel relieved. The passage of the political reform bills in the Diet has been the most important policy task for my cabinet. Looking ahead, there are many mountains I will have to scale, and I believe I will scale these mountains one by one. I feel anew that my cabinet is saddled with a lot of difficult policy tasks. It is really good that both the ruling and opposition parties have managed to pass the bills in the Diet in response to the people's hopes, and I would like to express my gratitude anew to the people for their support. This is what I am now feeling. I was asked about stimulus measures. Now that the bills have been passed in the Diet, it goes without saying that the immediate task for me is to map out a package of stimulus measures. Currently, relevant offices, with the Economic Planning Agency at the center, are preparing economic measures. However, I am hoping to complete them by the end of next week, if possible. We are still not ready to disclose their scale or contents. But we want to have a pump-priming package that can generate the immediate effect of spurring Japan's economy. There was a question about income tax reduction. At 1730 today, the Economic Reform Council held a meeting and I have asked the council to discuss ways to cut the income tax. There was a question about compilation of the budget for the fiscal 1994. As for the third supplementary budget, I would like to submit it to the Diet after completing the economic measures, or after coming back from the United States. We will submit it as soon as we can. Also, as for the fiscal 1994 budget, we will tentatively announce it by 10 February if possible -- although we are still not at a stage to announce something definite -- and approve the government's proposal after I return from the United States. [Unidentified reporter] Now that the bills have been passed in the Diet, political parties are expected to quickly move toward realignment. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any blueprint for forming a ruling coalition party? [Hosokawa] I do not know how the political parties will be realigned in the future. It seems to me that the realignment of political parties will not take concrete shape so soon. [Dean of press corps] Prime Minister. You are scheduled to visit the United States on 11 February to hold Japan-U.S. summit talks. You are going to hold the talks while you are faced with many tasks, including the Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade talks. Can you explain your fundamental stance regarding the upcoming meeting with President Clinton? [Hosokawa] This is going to be our third meeting. I think it will be a venue for confirming what we have been doing through our series of meetings. We are having the final discussions on both macro and micro issues. These are very difficult issues. We are doing our best to produce an outcome satisfactory to both sides before the Japan-U.S. summit talks. As for the macroissues, the United States is insisting, more than anything else, on the need for Japan to introduce measures designed to reduce our trade surplus -- including economic stimulus measures, increase of domestic demand, and the tax system issue. The United States is strongly demanding we take daring measures as much as possible. Well, I should rather say this is the largest concern of the United States. We are planning to do our best to come up with a package before the summit talks. As for the microissues -- such as government procurement, insurance services, and autos -- the opinions of Japan and the United States are divided over fundamental issues, including the two-way dialogue system [sohoko seido], target figures, and the extent of the government's influence on private companies. However, I am of the opinion that we have to clearly insist on our stance. We are now having the final discussions on these issues. I have instructed the government officials to somehow find a point of compromise and thereby conclude the comprehensive trade talks. [Dean of press corps] Will the issue of tax reduction be included in the economic measures which will be announced next week? [Hosokawa] Well, I still do not know about that. As I have said earlier, we are still not at a stage to clearly explain their scale or contents. We will complete drawing up the measures as soon as we can. [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are worried about the new electoral system. Can you explain how much public opinion will be reflected under this system? [Hosokawa] We had long discussions at the Diet as well on the issue of reflecting the people's will. This issue was talked about at council meetings too. As we all know, a compromise was reached between the ruling parties and the Liberal Democratic Party, which is the largest opposition party. I do not think this combination of the single-seat and proportional representation systems will only help political parties merge into a fewer number of groups. My fundamental understanding is that this system was formed after giving thorough consideration to the people's will. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. At the joint news conference held last night, you said you will hold a summit meeting again with the LDP president to discuss issues regarding the economic situation and the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. I am wondering if such talks will lead to the LDP's support of the government from outside the cabinet in the future in a broad sense. This is my first question. The next question is about the pending issue concerning a merger of your party, Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake -- which would mean the establishment of a new-New Party. How is this issue progressing? I would like to ask you these two questions. [Hosokawa] I said to LDP President Kono I would like to frankly discuss the issues concerning the economy or Japan-U.S. relations -- there may be other issues -- with him as early as the beginning of next week. I think it is very important to occasionally hold such meetings, particularly with President Kono of the LDP, which is the largest party in the Diet. I do want to have such meetings when opportunities arise, and I hope we can cooperate with each other as much as possible over what we can do. But I do not think -- I think your question is about the possibility of forming a powerful coalition that includes the LDP -- such cooperative moves will lead to forming such a coalition. As for the issue of JNP's merger with Sakigake, I think it is necessary to see how the political situation and moves toward regrouping political parties develop after the political reform bills are passed. Forming a collaborative group in the Diet, the JNP and Sakigake are actually already cooperating with each other, and at present there is no big obstacle to the two parties' activities. I would like to study this issue while seeing how moves toward the realignment of political circles develop. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. With the passage of the political reform bills, government subsidies will be provided for political parties. However, originally, the ruling coalition's proposal was that the government subsidy system should be introduced on the assumption that donations by corporations and organizations to individual politicians would be banned. But I think the people must be considering the agreement on that point as running counter to the original proposal. What do you think? [Hosokawa] This question was also raised at the news conference yesterday. I am fully aware of the fact that there are doubts about that point. However, the LDP asserted that as a matter of fact, it is impossible for the party to accept the government's original proposal in a single stroke. With the LDP's position in mind, therefore, I have reached a compromise on abolishing donations by corporations and organizations after five years, as an interim measure. However, I believe the agreement proposes various measures: namely, politicians will be required to report their acceptance of donations if a donation exceeds 50,000 yen -- currently the amount of donations subject to reporting is over 1 million yen -- and the penal regulations will be beefed up. In this way, I think drastic measures will be taken to make political donations more transparent, and to strengthen penal regulations. I believe the people will certainly understand that point.
