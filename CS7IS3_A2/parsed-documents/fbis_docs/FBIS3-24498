G. Kostsov; UDC 537.226] [Abstract] Electrooptical effect in thin ferro-electric films of strontium barium niobate (SBN) Ba[.sup]x[/]Sr[.sub]1- x[/]Nb[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]6[/] and features of its application as a reversive memory medium with electro-optical information reading, when the state of the medium element is determined by the polarization direction in the ferro-electric material were examined. The electrophysical characteristics of this medium are discussed. This ferro-electric material was selected because in addition to other high electro-optical parameters it exhibits other qualities: a high melting temperature, small values of piezoelectric losses, time stability of the samples, a high value of dielectric constant, etc. Thin- film (In[.sup]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] + SnO[.sup]2[/]) - SBN film - (In[.sub]2[/]O,[.sub]3[/] + SnO[.sup]2[/]), obtained by high frequency sputtering method on sapphire substrates were used for the studies. Based on comparative analysis of different contemporary methods for obtaining multi- component 2 - 5 ï¿½m thick ferroelectric films, it can be assumed that at the present time the high frequency sputtering is a preferred method.
