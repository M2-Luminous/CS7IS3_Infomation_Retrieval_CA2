The executive committee will be run by a Fatah majority, but next year the Islamic list will have a majority. This arrangement was dictated by the need to rotate one seat. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that since the Islamic movements have traditionally held a majority in the Engineers Association, the Gaza Strip Fatah chapter views the election results as a victory.
