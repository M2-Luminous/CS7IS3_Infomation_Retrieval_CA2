The meeting studied and arranged the issues on how to further strengthen the improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work style and to ensure the elevation of the economic construction to a new height under the socialist market economic conditions. Sun Weiben, Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma Guoliang, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Meng Qingxiang, and Qi Guiyuan attended the meeting. At the meeting, Sun Weiben made a speech entitled: Leading Cadres Should Take the Lead in Waging an Arduous Struggle. He said: In 1994, there are many difficulties that we should overcome and there are many new contradictions and problems that we should solve. So, the leading cadres at various levels are required to take the lead in waging an arduous struggle in an effort to create a situation of waging an arduous struggle and cooperatively pioneering the great undertaking. He pointed out: In the new stage of reform, opening up, and modernization, the spirit of arduous struggle means unswervingly implementing the basic line of the party and organically combining hard labor with creative labor. We should strive to create concrete work achievements. We should concentrate energy on economic construction, try every possible means to overcome the difficulties cropping up in the course of development, and strive for a faster development speed. We should persist in the mass line, share weal and woe with the masses, do more concrete deeds for the masses, and establish close contacts between the party and the masses. It is necessary to resolutely resist the influence of the corrosive ideas of the capitalist class, to be diligent and honest in performing official duties, to encourage frugality, and to promote a social practice of healthy progress and opening up in a civilized way. Sun Weiben stressed: Setting up the new socialist market economic system is a completely new and arduous task. Thus, the leading cadres at various levels are required to bravely blaze new trails, keep forging ahead, and fundamentally persist in the three-conducive standards. Instead of simple and indiscriminate imitation, we should creatively implement the higher-level arrangements according to our actual conditions. We must not adopt the attitude of dodging or shifting responsibility onto others when coming across [words indistinct] problems in our work. On the contrary, we should carry forward the spirit of having the daring to do pioneering work, trying and risking; and advancing despite difficulties. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, made an arrangement for further strengthening the improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work style. He said: We should regard that whether or not the basic line of the party is successfully implemented and whether or not the role as the core in conducting reform and developing the economy is better played as the fundamental standards for assessing the leading bodies' performances so as to noticeably strengthen the improvement of their thinking and work style. The leading bodies at various levels should undertake the heavy task for reform, become powerful collectives to guide the people of the province to develop the economy, arm the thinking with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, strictly implement democratic centralism, bring into play their overall functions, strengthen the improvement of administrative honesty, foster a good image, work solidly, and [words indistinct].
