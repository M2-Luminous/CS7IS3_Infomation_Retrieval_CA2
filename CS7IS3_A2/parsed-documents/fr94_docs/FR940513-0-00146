FR940513-0-00146 FR940513-0-00034 The labeling rules do not prohibit manufacturers from disclosing operating cost information, if they choose to do so. The Commission has determined not to prescribe standardized assumptions for these disclosures. The final labeling rules, however, require that, if manufacturers voluntarily choose to make operating cost disclosures on packaging labels, in catalogs or in point-of-sale printed materials, they disclose the unit energy cost, usage patterns, purchase price, and other assumptions upon which the operating cost claims are based. See §§305.11(e)(3), 305.13(a)(2) and 305.14(d)(2) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. c. Advisory disclosure. As discussed above, the Commission has determined to require that packaging and catalogs contain an Advisory Disclosure that advises consumers how to select the most efficient lamp for their needs. The Advisory Disclosure is: To save energy costs, find the bulbs with the light output you need, then choose the one with the lowest watts. This statement advises consumers how to use the lumen and wattage disclosures that will be on the packages to make energy efficient choices. It has the benefits of the explanatory statement that would have accompanied the Energy Index, without the potential overbuying drawback of the index number itself. Like the proposed Energy Index, it may alert consumers to consider lamps, such as halogen incandescent lamps or compact fluorescent lamps, which have lower wattages but produce comparable amounts of light output as higher-wattage incandescent lamps. 3. Additional Disclosures for Multiple Filament Incandescent Lamps For multiple filament (``three-way'') general service incandescent lamps ( i.e. , incandescent lamps with two filaments of different wattage that can be burned either separately or together, producing three different light output levels), the Commission proposed requiring that design voltage, wattage, light output and an efficiency measure be disclosed for operation at each level. It proposed that the life rating be based on the life of the first filament that fails. The Commission solicited comments on whether and how proposed operating cost disclosures should apply to multiple filament lamps. 128 128 See 58 FR at 60155, and Questions 3 and 4, at 60158&hyph;59. Five comments addressed how to disclose wattage, light output, laboratory life and the energy index for these lamp products. 129 There was general agreement among these comments that the Commission should require disclosure of watts and lumens for all three settings, and that the required disclosure of the laboratory life of the lamp should be determined on the basis of the major filament. 130 One comment recommended requiring use of the average wattage ``as used'' in calculating an estimated operating cost. 131 129 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 45, (Tr.), 206&hyph;207, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 14; GE (Tr.), 211; Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 3; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 1; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 7. 130 Id. 131 ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3.
