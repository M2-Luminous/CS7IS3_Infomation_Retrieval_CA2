There was no immediate confirmation from Belgrade. The Macedonian press Thursday said unpaid debts by Macedonian airlines had risen to 2.5 million dollars. The measure would mean another hardship for Macedonia, which is already suffering under a controversial trade embargo imposed last month by Greece in a dispute over Macedonia's name. The Greek embargo effectively cut off Macedonia's oil supplies. Vanja Bitoljanu, director of Macedonia's biggest airline company Paler Makedonija, told AFP there was no way for airlines to pay their debts to Yugoslavia since there was no transport agreement between the two former members of the old Yugoslav federation. Rump Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has not recognized Macdonian independence, which was declared in 1991. Air traffic taking off from Macedonia has been rerouted over Bulgaria and Romania, which adds an average 30 minutes to flights and increases the cost by some 2,500 dollars each time, the press reports said. Bitoljanu also said that for the last two years only Yugoslavia was receiving payments of taxes for the 300 to 400 yearly overflights airlines make over Yugoslavia and Macedonia en route to Greece. Analysts cited Thursday by the daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA suggested there was a link between the reported ban on Macedonian flights over Yugoslavia and the trade embargo imposed by Greece, a traditional ally of Serbia. Greece has challenged Macedonia's use of its name, the same as a Greek province. It accuses Skopje of usurping part of Greek heritage and harboring expanionist aims over Greek territory. Its trade embargo cut off Macedonian access to the Greek port of Salonika, though which most of Macedonia's essential supplies including oil arrive. A prolonged blockade could strangle Macedonia's economy. NOVA MAKEDONIJA also said the European Union had agreed to a 15 million-dollar credit for Macedonia to finance the development of its air transport system. Britain meanwhile has granted 50,000 pounds (75,000 dollars) to modernize Skopje's airport.
