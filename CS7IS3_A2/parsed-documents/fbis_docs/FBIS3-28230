The program, drawn up in response to criticism by Japan's trading partners and applied to all government purchases, will make it easier for foreign companies to bid for such contracts through competitive bidding. It is also aimed at improving cooperation and finding better ways to handle complaints from foreign companies dissatisfied with the procedures. Under the program, foreign companies can make complaints about all items procured by the government. The new steps will also lower the minimum procurement limit from the current 1 million special drawing rights (SDRs), worth some 150 million yen, to 800,000 SDRs, or 120 million yen. Hosokawa will brief U.S. President Bill Clinton about the new measures when they meet in Washington on February 11.
