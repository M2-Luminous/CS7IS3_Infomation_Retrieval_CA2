The information cited facts exposing that since it seized power the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has committed despicable treacheries against the nation, doing harm to and bartering away the national interests by resorting to humiliating sycophant, traitorous acts, "civilian" fascist dictatorship, reckless war moves and malicious anti-North confrontation racket. It says in part: The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, in his "summit talks" with the United States and at the South Korea-U.S. "annual Security Consultative Meeting" in July and November offered to pay more than 3,000 million dollars for the maintenance of the U.S. Forces present in South Korea, begging for their permanent presence in South Korea, and had the planned U.S. troop cutback in South Korea shelved. During his visit to the United States in November he begged his master to "exercise strong influence", raising a hue and cry over the "suspicion of North's nuclear development", a fictitious talk. And, in a bid to put the brake on the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks, he entreated his master to object to the North-proposed formula of package solution of the nuclear problem and establish an "international cooperation system" aimed at stifling the same fellow countrymen, and promised in privacy to open in return for it the South Korean rice market, a matter which even his preceding dictators didn't dare to deal with. Further still, the traitor invited the Japanese prime minister to South Korea in early November and asked for "joint action" against the North's "nuclear problem" till its solution. He blared that South Korea and Japan should "develop their relationship into future-oriented one", whitewashing the thrice-cursed brutalities committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past. Since it took the helm of power the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has zealously followed the anti-socialist moves of the international reactionaries to stifle the DPRK. Taking office, the traitor Kim Yong-sam made quite a noise as if he would bring about any "change" in the relations between the North and the South, saying "relations with the North would be improved from the viewpoint of the same nation". But it was a mere deception designed to mislead public opinion at home and abroad. His criminal records reveal to the whole world that he has committed heinous crimes in bringing dark clouds of war over the head of the nation and driving the North-South relations to the worst phase.
