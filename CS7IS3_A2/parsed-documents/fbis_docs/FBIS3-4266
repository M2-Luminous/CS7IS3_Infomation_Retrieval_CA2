The document, initialled by the countries' top military officials last July, was formally signed by Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev here on Monday [28 March]. The traditional ties between the armed forces of Romania and the former Soviet Union have gone through twists and turns in recent years. Previously cemented in the Warsaw Pact, they hit rock bottom with the dissolution of the eastern military bloc and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and plummeted further in the summer of 1992, when a bloody ethnic conflict flared up between Moldovan troops and mainly Russian-speaking national guards of the breakaway Dnestr River region. Historically and ethnically, Moldova, where a majority of the population speak Romanian, has had close relations with Romania. However, a thaw in the relations took place last July when Romania's chief of the general staff visited Russia and initialled the military cooperation accord with the Russians. But some later incidents including the bloody clash between the Russian Government and rebel parliamentarians in Moscow and the invectives by Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy against Romania forced Grachev to postpone his visit time and again. The eventual realization of the trip, Tinca said, indicated the end of the most difficult period in bilateral relations. The accord envisages a restoration and expansion of cooperation in military training, armament and military science. The media here appeared more interested in the cooperation in the area of military materiel, disclosing Romania is in dire need of upgrading its Soviet-made military equipment and importing parts from Moscow to keep it working. After the signing ceremony, the two defense ministers said that the accord would help promote mutual trust between the two countries, and contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and to security in Europe as a whole. During a meeting with Grachev, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said Romania's security not only depends on the Partnership for Peace relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but also on Russia's domestic situation and Romanian-Russian relations. The press here said that a once prevailing strategic thinking in Romania's diplomacy, which stands for bilateral cooperation with both Russia and the West for the sake of the country's own national security, is still applicable nowadays. Since 1989, Romania has signed as many as 15 military cooperation accords with its neighboring and Western countries. Grachev and Tinca agreed that the significance of the accord has gone beyond the military area, as the document represented part of the efforts to foster many-sided cooperation between the two countries. The signing of the accord has also paved the way for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Romania, they said.
