In a speech made at the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission held in late February this year, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly stressed the need to develop a "sense of crisis." Jiang's speech was so abridged that the term "sense of crisis" and relevant content disappeared when published by the news media, but the essentials of the speech remained unchanged. Jiang Spoke About the Reasons for Developing a Sense of Crisis In August last year, Jiang spoke about combating corruption at the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, concentrating on making preparations for an anti-corruption campaign. In a speech at the Central Discipline Inspection Commission meeting in late February this year, however, he mentioned the anti-corruption campaign in a more serious manner and made a grimmer estimation of the situation. In appraising the anti-corruption campaign last year, Jiang said: "Corruption does exist in our party and government departments and it continues to spread in some areas." "If we treat the problem lightly and allow the malpractice to go unchecked, our party, the people's political power, and our socialist modernization drive will be doomed." Based on the findings and prosecutions over the last six months, Jiang admitted the problem was serious. "Corruption has penetrated into many areas of our social life," "the crimes of abusing power for personal gain and of perverting justice for bribes have reached an appalling point." After advancing nine specific opinions on combating corruption, Jiang dwelt on the CPC's future. He pointed out that the CPC would fall from power if it failed to make achievements in promoting economic development or to hold corruption in check despite its success in economic construction. A source said the seriousness of a great number of problems exposed by the anti-corruption campaign since last year was well beyond the CPC hierarchy's expectations. This is one of the reasons Jiang stressed the need to develop a sense of crisis, the source added. Aside from this, Jiang also mentioned other problems which he said could not be underestimated. The Clinton administration's policy toward China aims at achieving the same political evolution as that in the former Soviet Union so that the CPC will step down and China will become a dependency of Western countries. But Jiang maintained that recent developments in Russia had not followed the course expected by the West. The United States makes use of China's human rights to find fault in a bid to achieve something through pro-democracy activists. These pro-democracy activists are not dangerous; so long as our comrades keep in step with the party Central Committee politically, we can remove certain destabilizing factors in time. As disclosed by Jiang, a certain number of rather high-ranking leading cadres fail to keep in step with the party Central Committee politically. Jiang warned: We are clearly aware of this. Never suppose that we are in the dark. Zhu Rongji Said "Approval Procedures Give Rise to Corruption" Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau standing committee and vice premier, has spoken about corruption in the economic field on many occasions since the beginning of this year. Zhu pointed out: Abuse of approval rights is a major reason for corruption. Many people believed that Zhu's remark referred to the serious and hardly suppressible corruption in the economic field. China has not separated politics from economics for a long time. Efforts have been made over the last few years to separate the two, but with little success. The functions of the administrative department have been basically separated from those of enterprises in form, but various approval procedures makes it possible for the administrative department to rule the roost, subjecting enterprises to its control. The fact that the administrative department requires enterprises to apply for approval before they can go ahead with their plans can only serve to prevent enterprises from exercising their right to make their own management decisions, thus leading to corruption. This is because such a practise will allow power to be traded for money. Zhu said while telling cadres in the administrative department to correctly exercise their approval rights in the public interest, we must simplify approval procedures. The reform is aimed at lifting restrictions. This does not mean we should do away with the approval procedures, but we should minimize them. This is also essential to eliminating corruption, Zhu added. When commenting on China's property development, Zhu called for early introduction of the system of appraising land prices. We should appraise land prices on a scientific basis and enlist the assistance of experts to act according to economic laws, Zhu continued. Zhu pointed out that the right of government officials to fix land price is also a cause of corruption. Serious Inflation Brings High Pressure To Bear on Top CPC Leadership China's excessive inflation, which constitutes a serious problem, has applied high pressure to the CPC hierarchy. In his 1994 government work report to the NPC, Li Peng proposed to keep the 1994 growth rate of retail prices below 10 percent. Developments in the first quarter, however, indicate it will be difficult to attain this intended goal. According to the statistics released by the State Statistical Bureau, the economic growth rate has dropped to 9 or 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, but the inflation rate has continued to surge. Nationwide retail prices increased by 21 percent over the same time last year. The inflation rate was 13 percent nationwide last year. In June last year when macro-controls were put into effect, the growth rate of retail prices was only 12.5 percent. China's present inflation bears two unprecedented features. One, inflation is found in both urban and rural areas. In the past, prices climbed in major and medium cities, but they remained relatively stable in the countryside. However, the countryside registers a two-digit inflation rate now. Two, both old and young suffer from inflation. In the past, only prices of consumption goods and charges for services not essential to daily lives were affected, but people have to pay more for the services and items of everyday use now. The CPC hierarchy has realized that if the situation worsens, economic order will be jeopardized and a large number of social problems will follow. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are said to have held several meetings after national conferences of the NPC and the CPPCC National Committee to study the current economic situation. They have decided to control the total volume of credit and of fixed assets investment to curb inflation and, at the same time, to increase the deposit rate in compensation for the people's losses incurred by the inflation. This notwithstanding, the possibility of a galloping inflation cannot be ignored. Presevation of Political and Economic Stability Is of Paramount Importance In light of the present situation, the CPC has focused on maintaining political and economic stability this year in implementing the principle of "reform, development, and stability." Many economic reform measures which were to be introduced this year have been put off. In the political field, the CPC will conduct positive ideological education and take strong measures against destabilizing factors to eliminate them in the bud.
