Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on Tuesday [10 May] began talks seen crucial to the fate of the economic agreement they signed in January outlining a framework of ties between the Kingdom and the Palestine self-rule authority expected to take over the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Jordanian comments after the five-hour session at the Prime Ministry were non-committal, reflecting the Kingdom's quest to learn firsthand about the PLO's intentions after the organisation signed an economic agreement with Israel in Paris last month. The Paris agreement contains many provisions which have brought to question many elements in the Jordan-PLO accord signed in Amman on Jan. 7. Officials said Monday the Kingdom would be seeking clarifications on these points and answers to questions on key issues related to banking and monetary affairs, trade and customs etc. Sources said the Jordanian delegation to the talks, headed by Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information Jawad al-'Anani, presented to the PLO side a paper containing the points of the clarifications that the Kingdom was seeking. No definite details were available, but the sources indicated that these questions dealt with the implications of the Paris agreement on the Jordan-PLO accord and how the PLO intended to go about tackling some of the obvious "contradictions" and "overlappings" between the two documents. PLO officials appeared anxious to reaffirm that they were not seeking to "renegotiate" the Jan. 7 agreement and that the talks were aimed at detailing the modalities of implementing the accord in terms of mechanisms and guidelines. In general, the Jan. 7 agreement was seen as a general framework for Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations without going into specifics. However, it was widely assumed then that the principles in the accord, as and when implemented, would have cemented the relationship. According to the sources, Jordan and the PLO had agreed in earlier meetings on economic relations that the specifics could not be worked out as long as it was not known how far the Israelis were willing to go in giving economic freedom to the Palestinians in the occupied territories. However, the Paris agreement, which detailed the specifics of economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous territories, was seen here as severely curtailing the scope of Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations. The meeting, which was supposed to have begun early Tuesday, did not get off until after the Jordanian Cabinet held its regular weekly session during which the Kingdom's strategy in the talks with the PLO was expected to be discussed and finalised. Speaking after the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani would only say that "all economic issues of common concern were discussed" during the session with the PLO and that the discussions would continue on Wednesday. Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO, who led the Palestinian side to the talks, said the meeting was "comprehensive and extensive" and covered "all aspects of the Jordanian-Palestinian economic relationship." "The Jordanian-Palestinian accord (of Jan. 7) is the basis of the relationship," he told AL-RA'Y and the JORDAN TIMES. Asked whether the PLO was seeking any changes in the agreement in view of the Israel-PLO accord, Mr. Quray' said: "Changes if any will be in favour of the Jordanian-Palestinian accord." He did not elaborate. However, he stressed, any possible changes in the accord "will mean detailing the agreement's provisions. There will be no changes in the basis and principles of the agreement." "Certain joint committees will be activated," he added. "We discussed all issues such as banking currency, trade, and customs," he said. "These are issues that should be clarified to sustain the unique, brotherly relation between Jordan and Palestine." Asked whether the Israel-PLO accord had narrowed the scope for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation, Mr. Quray' said: "On the contrary, I believe that the agreement with Israel has helped implement the Jordanian-Palestinian accord." "It is true that the (Israel-PLO) accord did not give us all that we were seeking, but it gave us some of what we sought," said mr. Quray'. "The door is not closed for the rest of our rights, which will be restored gradually..." Mr. Quray' said: "We will soon witness Palestinian-Arab agreements. We are part of the Arab World and a permanent member of the Arab League and we have a strategic Arab depth which supports our position." Attending the meetings on the Jordanian side were planning Minister Ziyad Fariz, Minister of industry and Trade Rima Khalaf, minister of State 'Adil Irshayd, Central Bank of Jordan Deputy Governor Michel Martu and Foreign Ministry advisors Ibrahim Badran and Ahmad Qatanani. The PLO side to the meeting included Jawad Naji, head of the Economic Department of the PLO in Amman, Amin Haddad, 'Atif 'Alawinah, 'Awn al-Shawwa, Midhat Kan'an, Palestinan Ambassador al-Tayyib 'Abd al-Rahim and Samir Hulaylah.
