In this regard it is playing an important role in the peace process to achieve stability and prosperity in the region. President Mubarak was speaking during a meeting he held today with a delegation of the American Association of Chief Editors of Newspapers and Magazines, which includes 14 chief editors and publishers from various parts of the United States. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the Presidential Press Office, stated that President Mubarak described U.S.-Egyptian relations as good. President Mubarak said the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was just a start and that Egypt is doing its utmost to achieve stability in this part of the world. President Mubarak stressed that peace has become a necessity. After it is achieved, numerous marginal problems could be solved. He explained that Egypt's firm goal is to establish peace and security in the region, offering prosperity to everyone. Asked about Egyptian-Iranian relations, President Mubarak said that since coming to power, he has wanted to maintain good relations with every country. But the Iranians have policies of their own. President Mubarak reaffirmed that terrorism has no future in Egypt and Egypt embraces many Arab institutions and acts according to the law and Constitution. We abide by the law, he said. He noted: We could have ended terrorism within a few days had we resorted to emergency measures. But we abide by the law. We are encouraged that all the popular factions are against terrorism and do not sympathize with it. Citizens' reports on the terrorists and their activities were a primary factor in uncovering and arresting them. 'Abd-al-Mun'im said that President Mubarak emphasized that religions are a very sensitive issue, adding that the establishment of religious parties must be avoided and noting that the extremists do not seek democracy. Ultimately they want to establish their own style of dictatorship, he said. President Mubarak explained that he is not against anyone but always works for stability and security. Regarding U.S. aid, President Mubarak said: We know the aid will not continue forever. We need this aid for a few more years until peace is established throughout the area. We use most of this aid to strengthen the Armed Forces. He noted that many security problems exist in the area. The president also dealt with the population issue. He affirmed that the birth rate has recently dropped and noted that he has drawn attention to this problem because it constitutes a real threat to the state. He also noted that the popular response has been positive. In response to a question on tourism, President Mubarak said that the number of tourists dropped after the Gulf war and increased after the acts of violence by terrorists.

He stressed that Egypt is firm on dealing with terrorism within the framework of legitimacy and law. He pointed out that efforts of those who are trying to threaten Egypt are to no avail. He discussed the domestic situation since he assumed power and reviewed the great projects in the fields of infrastructure, transport, energy, housing, schools, factories, and new cities. 'Abd-al-Mun'im said that in his meeting with the U.S. press delegation, President Mubarak touched on investment in Egypt and explained the removal of numerous obstacles, the last of which was exempting investors from routine measures, which will cost the government 10 million pounds. He noted that these steps have greatly encouraged investment and that three months after making this decision, 180 projects were begun in Suhaj and other areas in Upper Egypt. In discussing the water problem and its scarcity on regional and international levels, President Mubarak stressed that if peace does not prevail, frictions and conflicts may flare up because of water scarcity. He noted that Egypt is using its water resources in the best possible way.
