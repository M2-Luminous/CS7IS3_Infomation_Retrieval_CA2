For the time being, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] will not be taking part in the discussions. Together with the party leaders Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo, Tjeenk Willink wants to establish whether there is sufficient political will for a three-party government without the Christian Democrats. On Monday [9 May], the day on which Willinks received all the party leaders from the Second Chamber, Kok and Bolkestein, in particular, were still expressing doubts about a coalition of this kind. From the round of talks held yesterday, the possibility of a "purple" coalition emerged as the "greatest common denominator." Especially D66 leader Van Mierlo, his CDA colleague Brinkman, and the Green Left leader Rosenmoeller were clearly of the opinion that only a government including the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66 should be given a chance. Several smaller parties also expressed a similar opinion to Willink. Following his talks with Tjeenk Willink, PvdA leader Kok said that he was prepared to assess over the next few days as to whether such a "purple" coalition is possible. However, he explained that he could not cry victory. "I am not convinced that there is sufficient support for a coalition of this kind," he said. Kok said that he could see "substantial bottlenecks," particularly regarding cooperation with the VVD, "not only regarding the social issues, but also on the subjects of immigration and integration, development aid, and the environment. It is not a question of political will, as Van Mierlo says, but of the objective possibility of the PvdA and the VVD joining forces. This must first be a possibility. Sometimes differences are too great to be bridged." In his reaction to this, Van Mierlo said: "First you must want to do something, then you can decide how to bring it about. We all have the key to this affair, and we can all make it fail." The D66 leader does not regard the fact that Kok is acting in such a reserved manner as "writing on the wall." "It is a question of those parties slowly getting used to the idea. The past of the PvdA and the VVD is simply rooted in the self-evidence of the presence of the CDA [in government]. The PvdA and the VVD are used to distrusting each other in the formation, with one playing on the left wing of the CDA, and the other on the right. That distrust must gradually disappear, and it must do so soon," Van Mierlo claimed. VVD party chairman Bolkestein did not want to make any comments on his talk with Willink. The liberals have always spoken out in favor of a coalition between the two winning parties, the VVD and the D66, complemented by one of the losing government parties. Bolkestein has always desisted from stating a preference for the PvdA or the CDA. However, during the election campaign, the rift between the VVD and the PvdA grew larger rather than smaller. "Our program, and that proposed by Kok, are two extremes," Bolkestein said, for example, referring to the paragraph on employment in the VVD and the PvdA platforms. Furthermore, Bolkestein considers the total of cuts that the PvdA intends to make in the upcoming period of government, approximately nine billion guilders, to be too low. He has said that the VVD will not enter into the government if the amount set aside for rationalization remains stuck at between 8 and 10 billion. CDA leader Brinkman reiterated to Tjeenk Willink that the CDA, in view of its loss of 20 out of 54 seats, would prefer him to look into the possibility of a "purple" coalition. Tjeenk Willink has taken it upon himself to give his opinion to Queen Beatrix on around 17 May, the day on which the Second Chamber is established. By then, Willink expects to be able to present three potential government parties that have committed themselves to "undertake to make an effort," as well as a list of matters for which it has been decided a settlement must be found.
