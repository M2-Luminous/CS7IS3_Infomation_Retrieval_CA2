At the top of the agenda were expansion of the Council of Europe and the CE Vienna declaration on combating anti-Semitism, racism and other manifestations of intolerance. Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that most representatives from the CE member states underscored that Russia, in order to become a full member of the CE, must withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia. Arusoo said the participants affirmed no exceptions in admission to the CE can be made for Russia. Luik emphasized in his address that Russia, to gain full membership in the CE, must pull out its troops from the Estonian territory, abandon the "near abroad" concept in its foreign policy, and give an unequivocal assessment to the events in Estonia in 1940. The session discussed the Vienna declaration that was adopted by the October meeting of the CE member states' heads of state and government. Luik signed on Wednesday in Strasbourg the 11th protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which introduces some amendments in the mechanism that controls the implementation of the convention. The protocol foresees the formation of a permanent European Court of Human Rights to interpret the convention. The court will accept petitions about human rights violations from individuals, groups of people, and states. The signed protocol comes into force from the moment of ratification. The Estonian parliament also has to ratify the human rights convention and ten other protocols pertaining to it.
