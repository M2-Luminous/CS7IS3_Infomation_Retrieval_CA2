This is what Karl-Hermann Fink, the manager of the committee, said at a conference on financial and advisory assistance for East Europe. According to Fink, 400 firms are involved with unsecured claims totaling 700 million German marks [DM]. Roughly half of them are medium-sized companies, for which a satisfactory arrangement with Russia is of existential importance. Fink admitted, however, that the negotiations with Russia, which will be resumed no later than the middle of next month, are difficult. In some cases, the Russians suggested separate options and wanted to make down payments to the German companies concerned. However, this was not desirable from the German point of view. Fink said a comprehensive option had to be found. According to Otto Wolff von Amerongen, chairman of the Committee for Trade with the East, above all realistic financial concepts for trade with the East European states had to be developed. "Otherwise, we will have a bottomless pit," Amerongen said. Basically, the task was also to finance projects through close cooperation between banks and industry, he said. In addition, barter deals would serve as complementary instruments. Approximately 200 industry and policy representatives took part in the conference, which was sponsored by Berlin Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. The participants primarily discussed the question of to what extent the activities of the private sector could be connected more closely with public financial aid for the reconstruction of East Europe. According to Board Chairman Manfred Gentz of Daimler-Benz InterServices (Debis) AG, Berlin, there are still fractional losses between private banks and the banks of the European Community. In addition, bureaucratic obstacles in the East European countries have to be eliminated, he said. According to Gentz, the opening of Western markets is one of the most important conditions for a successful transformation of the system in Central and East Europe. "The West must contribute its share to create, over the long term, the desirable political, economic, and social conditions," said Gentz, who is also chairman of the working group dealing with "general financing and consultation problems as well as problems concerning contracts" in the Committee for Trade With the East. German industry and the Committee for Trade With the East advocate in particular the association of Central and East Europe with the European Union. For the German national economy, the East European neighbors already play an important role today. For all the problems, their weight will increase, said Gentz. With DM43 billion, more than 7 percent of German exports went to the East European region in 1993, while almost 7 percent of German imports also came from East Europe, accounting for DM36 million. The most important trading partner is Russia, closely followed by Poland. German exports to Poland alone accounted for DM9.7 billion last year; they were thus higher than exports to China, the Asian country which is marked by an "economic miracle." Last year, 10 percent of the overall German direct investment was made in East Europe -- compared with just 1 percent in 1990. East Europe was the only region in the world where new German investment increased in recent years. An important motor in this respect was opening up of market and utilizing the considerable wage and production cost advantages. According to Gentz, tying in the young market economies and utilizing their wage cost advantages will also increase German competitiveness. "Our response to NAFTA and ASEAN could be close cooperation with East Europe," said Gentz. In the scope of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit, the Committee for Trade With the East organized a meeting between the Russian leadership and German business and industry representatives in which the strategic modernization of the Russian national economy was discussed. Some pilot projects were suggested. Specifically, the projects include the modernization of conventional power plants and the more effective utilization of Siberian natural gas resources.
