This was stated at a press conference today devoted to Latvia's participation in the Balladur, or European stability, pact, by the acting foreign minister, Justice Minister Egils Levits. The Estonian and Latvian delegations to the conference in Paris on the inauguration of the pact presented a joint document on the border question, declaring that the state borders of Europe are based on internationally recognized and binding treaties. As is known, part of the Abrene district, an area of 1,260 square km, was apportioned to Russia in August 1944. Nine Eastern and Central European countries, which wish to join the European Union, have created discussion forums, namely the Baltic Table and the Central European Table, at which the other interested countries and the European Union will take part. The Baltic Table will be attended by the Baltic countries, perhaps also Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and the United States. Russia will specify issues to be reviewed and will only then decide on partciipation at the Baltic Table.
