His statement came as a follow-up to the message Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania, sent to the MSZP. (The message and Horn's verbal answer were covered earlier tonight.) The message, handed over by Ambassador Ion Donca, refers to "sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary which may succeed in normalizing bilateral relations." "Whom can we consider Hungary's sober-minded forces that may guarantee the success mentioned in the letter," Oberfrank asked. "Do the two countries need a treaty to settle their relations or do they need citizens who are satisfied and have rights, no matter whether they belong to a minority or the majority? Why do both sides consider the border issue timely?" the cabinet chief asked. "It is contrary to international diplomatic practice that an ambassador hands over a party message and comments it," Oberfrank said.
