The figure may increase to 8.2 billion dollars in the following eight years. At the same time, representatives from well-known American companies came to Vietnam and worked out a promising future of doing business in the country. The director in charge of selling Kodak products in Indochina said Kodak could gain from four to eight million dollars in its first year of doing business in Vietnam. The Boeing Aviation Company predicted that Vietnam would have from 60 to 80 passenger planes within 10 years and the company hoped that its income from selling planes to Vietnam would be from three to five billion dollars. The Caterpillar Construction Machine Company said it was considering selling heavy excavators and other construction equipment worth 700 million dollars to Vietnam. There are many other plans for doing business with Vietnam by American companies. But while the embargo was lifted, the United States has not yet granted Vietnam an opportunity to equally trade with the United States. Vietnam is one of ten countries in the world who do not enjoy the most favored nation status. Vietnamese goods imported to the United States are taxed very highly in comparison with the same goods imported from elsewhere. In order to be an equal trade partner, Vietnam has to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff, or GATT. Concerning this matter, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that Vietnam was ready to participate in the GATT system. He was speaking at an international conference called New Waves: ASEAN, Vietnam, and China, held in Singapore last month. Therefore, it is clear that obstacles in trade ties between Vietnam and the United States were coming from the United States. If Vietnam was not able to enjoy the most favored nation status, trade relations between Vietnam and the United States would not develop and American companies would lose their opportunities in the Vietnamese market. Therefore, while 30 American companies have set up representative offices in Vietnam and the embargo has been lifted, American businessmen's operations in Vietnam have not yet boomed. The potential for the development of trade ties between Vietnam and the United States exists and this potential can only be fully developed if there are equal opportunities.
