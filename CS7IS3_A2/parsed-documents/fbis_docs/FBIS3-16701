Niyazov Ready To Replace His Government Unless the Consumer Market Is Put in Order"] [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] -- It is a long time since viewers tuning into the Turkmenistan news have seen the kind of dressing down given by President S. Niyazov to ministry and department leaders over the abominable state of the consumer market. Calling his adjutants [zampred] to attention, the Turkmenbashi told them: "All of our slogans and promises are worth nothing if store shelves remain empty. People are becoming exasperated -- and rightly so. How much longer are you going to trade commodities from state resources at market prices?!" Store shelves that have been stripped bare and on which you will not even find toothpaste, shoe polish, matches, or soap; soaring prices at state trade outlets -- not to mention commercial kiosks and markets -- even by comparison with those in Russia; the despondent faces of people gloomily wandering around the stores with the now-worthless manat -- this, IZVESTIYA wrote 18 February -- this is the situation in Turkmenistan's cities, even in the capital. Nor has it changed one iota today. The lack of the essential range of commodities conntinues, with the very same wildly inflated prices at state retail outlets. How can you live if you earn 200-250 manats while a kg of meat at the market costs between 35 and 40 manats, a kg of potatoes is 10 manats, and a pack of cigarettes anything from 20 to 30 manats? Who controls all of this here in the Republic? Indeed, is it under control? In the final analysis, who regulates prices? These questions were quite rightly asked at the Cabinet of Ministers session. Prices are one thing, but the absence of commodities in the stores, even those which are produced in Turkmenistan, is another problem dogging the consumer market. "Why is it that, despite the availability of raw materials and labor, production of these goods is not increasing?" S. Niyazov exclaimed indignantly, turning to his adjutants. "Who sanctions market prices for state resources?" By the way, he put these questions to them some five months ago, when the manat was being introduced and when, taking advantage of the Turkmenbashi's absence from Turkmenistan, departments pushed up prices for goods and foodstuffs so that people ended up wandering around the stores as if they were in a museum. In those early October days a major dressing down was also delivered, but everything was quickly forgotten, and that is why today, when returning home from a trip to Moscow, people from Turkmenistan cram all their free luggage space with sausage, cheese, fresh eggs, jam, confectionery, and fruit in the Russian capital, because they will not find any such thing at state trade outlets in Turkmenistan. Those who cannot fly to Moscow do "the next best thing": On weekends, thousands of people from Krasnovodsk, Tashauz, and Mary come to Ashkhabad on the local trains and clear out the already impoverished stores, despite the exorbitant prices. Giving his adjutants a 10-day breathing space before what is left of confidence in the government runs out, the Turkmenistan president demanded from it concrete, vigorous action to improve the consumer market situation and the supply to the population first and foremost of foodstuffs, medicines, and vital commodities.
