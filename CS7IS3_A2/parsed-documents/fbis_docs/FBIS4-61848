According to him, this session is supposed to determine a specific duration of state programming and the sums to be earmarked for it. According to Anatoliy Nazeykin, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking at a recent conference on the operation of Russian post offices and problems of the television and radio broadcasting complex, held with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin taking part, already let it be understood that "the government intends to appropriate money only for state-ordered programming," meaning those programs that society needs most of all in the opinion of the country's leadership. As has been made clear, such would be children's programs, sports, general education, information-political, and a number of other programs of educational importance. The broadcasting of ads and commercial programs will be done "for the finances of those who need them." In this question, as the trade union leader thinks, Viktor Chernomyrdin completely shares the position of the communications workers, who have repeatedly demanded that air time taken up by ads and commercial broadcasts be excluded from the state-order time and be paid for at negotiable prices, and that the resale to other customers of the air time meant for state-ordered programming and paid for from the federal budget be prohibited. Viktor Chernomyrdin also expressed readiness to solve the question of a preferential rate of payment for electricity for communications enterprises. The government session is also expected to look at the question of increased budget financing in a bid to preserve the reception and transmission network of television and radio communications enterprises on the basis of the minimal duration of broadcasting worth up to 1.5 trillion rubles instead of the 679 billion provided for in the draft budget. Today this is one of the main demands of communications enterprises work collectives, "therefore the trade union's Central Committee leaders intend to insist that it should be acted upon," Anatoliy Nazeykin has stated.
