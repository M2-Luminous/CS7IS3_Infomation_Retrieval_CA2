Their Killers Have Not Been Found, Their Families Are Still Awaiting Condolences...."] [Text] U.S. congressmen make the development of relations with Vietnam directly dependent upon Hanoi's readiness to clarify the fate of U.S. MIA's in the Vietnam war. And that is not a diplomatic whim: The history of the pretty difficult relations between Washington and Hanoi cannot be rewritten -- what happened, happened. But it is impossible to inaugurate a "new era" between them while the fate of the last soldier from that almost 20-year-old war still remains unknown. It is not always proper to draw analogies in such a delicate area as relations between two countries, but they do sometimes arise. Like, for example, today, on the eve of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, where it is expected that a "major" interstate treaty on friendship and cooperation will be signed. Credit and praise are due to those who have tirelessly advanced this solemn moment. There have been difficulties. And there still are: After all, Georgia is signing a treaty with a country which it saw -- at the height of the Abkhazian campaign -- as its main adversary and, incidentally, stated so from the highest rostrums.... But, be that as it may, it would be good to inugurate the "new era" in relations by eliminating misunderstandings. The killers of Major Vladimir Berilov, Captain Yakov Ivanov, the 8-year-old captain's daughter Marina Savostina, and another 69 Russian servicemen and members of their families still roam free in Georgia to this day. There is no statute of limitation for these crimes. But if it is impossible for some reason to track down the criminals (although the killer of a U.S. diplomat was found in Tbilisi in just a matter of days. Excuses were not enough. Was it because he was an American?) is it really impossible to expresss, albeit belatedly, very belatedly, simple human sympathy to the families of the Russians whoi have been killed? German World War II POW's who died in Georgia have had a memorial erected in the republic's capital. Is it because they were Germans? But who will answer for the Russians, will they be remembered during the talks in Tbilisi?
