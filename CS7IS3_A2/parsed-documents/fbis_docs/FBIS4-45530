FBIS4-45530 "jptdd028__l94030" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 22 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Senator Pava `Angry' Over Linkage to Presidential Campaign Senator Pava `Angry' Over Linkage to Presidential Campaign `Scandal' PA2206162594 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 22 Jun 94 PA2206162594 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network Spanish BFN [Telephone interview with Senator Alvaro Pava by unidentified station announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota and Caracol News Director Dario Arizmendi in Los Angeles, California; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live] [Text] Senator Alvaro Pava has been mentioned in a recorded conversation which, the government has admitted, included the participation of journalist Alberto Giraldo and the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers. The government, which has made a comparison, has confirmed the voices in the recording belong to them, according to a Defense Ministry communique. During the conversation between Giraldo and one of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Giraldo says he had already talked with Pava, who had everything arranged. Last night, the "CMI" television newscast even reported that Giraldo had telephoned the station saying he had received a message from Rodriguez Orejuela offering to finance the campaigns of Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper, an offer which neither of the two candidates accepted. According to the "CMI" newscast, Giraldo had said he had talked with Pava and Hernandez of the Pastrana campaign and Santiago Medina of the Samper campaign but that neither of the two campaigns accepted the money the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers had offered. We have Pava on the telephone and will ask him what he has to say about this report linking him to this scandal of the alleged participation of tainted money to finance presidential campaigns. Good morning, Dr. Pava. Pava: I am, of course, angry and shocked at the report that my name has been mentioned in connection with this type of conversation. I am particularly grieved by it. I have been listening to remarks by journalists and other people involved. The Attorney General's Office and control agencies that are determining the authenticity of the recording and the fact that it has been confirmed are likewise very important. I have known Giraldo for many years, as has the entire country. He is a respectable journalist and is a very important man socially. As manager of Dr. Pastrana's campaign, I had no authority to collect any money. As Dr. Pastrana will surely explain during his news conference at 1000, such a collection was not my responsibility. For the good of the country, institutions, and democracy, it is important to clarify this bothersome episode, which, nevertheless, mars the prestige of Colombian institutions. For the good of all, and as the president-elect has said, the Attorney General's Office should conduct a thorough investigation to confirm, as quickly as possible, that what I have said is the truth. It assuages me to know that remarks have been made affirming and clarifying the facts. I have nothing to fear, but I am very upset that my name was mentioned in the cassette. Announcer: I will now connect you with our news director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the United States. Arizmendi: I would like you to answer a question that is surely in the minds of many fellow countrymen. When Dr. Pastrana made a speech at the Tequendama Hotel on 19 June admitting his defeat, did he already know of the existence of the cassette and that it involved the leaders of the Samper campaign in this money deal that was apparently being secured through journalist Giraldo? Pava: Would you please repeat the question? Announcer: Arizmendi's question is this: On 19 June, when Pastrana said it was necessary to determine whether there was some participation of tainted money in the presidential elections, were the Pastrana campaigners aware of the existence of the cassettes disclosed today? Pava: According to a Defense Ministry communique that was released last night, Dr. Pastrana personally handed the cassettes with the conversations to the president of the Republic on 16 June. An unidentified person had given him the cassettes in Cali; therefore, I believe it can be said that he was familiar with the text of those recordings and that for this reason he revealed them to the authorities so an investigation could be conducted. Arizmendi: Is Giraldo's version as told to the "CMI" newscast true that he had talked with you and Dr. (Veliz) of the Pastrana campaign to present the offer of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers to finance the campaign, an offer to which you replied no? Pava: I am not familiar with that version. I could not say yes or no to something I did not handle. Giraldo must be regarded in the context of his life. You and the country know him. Let the people know that Alberto is a journalist who talks with political circles everyday. He has excellent relations. He is a friend of the president and all the ministers, former President Betancur, and the two presidential candidates. He has excellent relations and continually talks with the media. He is familiarly well-known as Crazy Man Giraldo due to his eccentricities. He is very well-known in the country. He is always making inquiries, investigating campaigns. I had some responsibility in the campaign, and he was always asking me questions about the campaign. In addition, the country must know that since 1976 or 1977, he was attached to Cadena Radial Super, where I was deputy manager. He was assistant director for Javier Ayala, one of the leading Caracol journalists and his personal friend. You all know him. Let the people know that he is always talking with national leaders, has lunch and talks with people. I have talked with Giraldo about the campaign many times but not on the subject of money. May I repeat that I had nothing to do with it. I did not have to handle that or any other matter in the campaign. Of course, morally speaking, I could not accept a conversation of that kind. It was proposed to me, and I turned it down, of course. I could not hold such a conversation for moral principles and because it was not my responsibility during the campaign. I did not have to manage anything regarding money. My responsibility was a different one, as Pastrana will surely affirm during his news conference. Arizmendi: What will Pastrana say during his news conference today at 1000? Pava: I do not know what he will say. You will have to ask him. I suppose he will explain the campaign's position, which has been very clear. Pastrana's position will not be changed either in his public or private life. I suppose this will be his position, but I do not know what he will tell the media that have been invited to his news conference at 1000. Arizmendi: How do you interpret Giraldo's remarks that he talked with you and Dr. [name indistinct] to offer the money that you refused? Pava: The Attorney General's Office will investigate this remark, which upsets me. I expect the Attorney General's Office and investigative agencies to establish the truth. May I repeat: I could not have accepted any such dialogue because it was not my responsibility. If it was proposed to me, surely I turned it down, because, morally speaking, I cannot accept such a dialogue for obvious reasons. Arizmendi: What do you think of Samper's initial position? Are you satisfied with his explanation? Pava: I believe the president-elect has spoken clearly. The two campaigns should ask the authorities to clarify this matter. From the viewpoint of the institutions, this speculation risks much regarding the institutions. The country requires absolute clarity on the subject. The president has spoken very clearly and has inspired confidence in the country regarding management of the money the campaign had used. We hope his assertion will coincide with the result of the investigation that the proper authorities will conduct.
