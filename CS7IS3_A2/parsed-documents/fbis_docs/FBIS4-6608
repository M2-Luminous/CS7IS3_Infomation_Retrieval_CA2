Since the moderator asked me to explain the details of what we discussed at the party leaders' meeting, I will now do so. The party leaders' meeting started at 1400 [0500 GMT] in the Standing Committee chairman's room. As has been explained, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa acted as chairman of the meeting. As the moderator said, we had long discussions at the meeting. I am sure all of you have a list of what we discussed and confirmed at the meeting. The party leaders confirmed a total of 10 policies -- nine policies plus one supplementary policy -- and signed an agreement. After the discussions, Chairman Hosokawa said he wanted to discuss with us the selection of a candidate for the next prime minister. I immediately said that I wanted to recommend Tsutomu Hata, who served as deputy prime minister of the Hosokawa administration, for the post, saying that he is the most suitable candidate. After each party leader explained his opinion, the meeting unanimously endorsed Tsutomu Hata as a candidate for the next premiership. After that, the meeting was ended. That is what we discussed at the meeting. [Unidentified moderator] Now, I would like to ask the Komeito chairman to speak. [Ishida] We had serious policy debate during the past two weeks. As a result of it, we reached an agreement on the items needed to be confirmed for formation of a new coalition government. After agreeing on the items, we decided to recommend Tsutomu Hata as the next prime minister. Now we have agreed on formation of the second coalition government, I feel that each party has shouldered quite a heavy responsibility. Moreover, the opening paragraph of the policy agreement states that we will unite under the banner of reform, which the Hosokawa administration called for, to regain the people's trust in politics. Because of this, I think that continuation of efforts for realization of reform is one of the main tasks of the second coalition government. Moreover, various opinions were expressed during the policy debate and I think it is a very important task of the new coalition government to play a responsible role in dealing with the international situation. Another task is that we have to start budget deliberations as soon as possible to accelerate economic recovery. Steady economic recovery is the major task of the second coalition government. These are what we are determined to do. [Unidentified moderator] The next speaker is DSP Chairman Ouchi. [Ouchi] I am Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan. Our party has asserted not only that a new leader to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be decided within the framework of the current coalition government, but also that it should be clarified to the people what the new administration intends to do. As a result of many hours of policy discussion, coalition representatives have pulled their hearts together to successfully work out an agreement, even though it was a formidable task. This is a historical achievement in the history of Japanese politics as regards coalition governments. Clarifying policies and forming a new cabinet are important responsibilities of the coalition government which must be fulfilled for the sake of the people. Since I felt this has been achieved, I gave it my appraisal. After carefully considering in our own way who should be chosen leader from among the coalition alliance, we judged that Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, was the most appropriate candidate based on his character, knowledge, and ability. I made a statement to that effect at the meeting of coalition party leaders, explaining that our party fully endorsed Hata. Should a new coalition government under Hata be formed, its major responsibility would be to first have Diet deliberations carried on as smoothly as possible regarding the draft budget bill, which is what the people want right now, and have it enacted as soon as possible. I also feel this would tentatively be the most important key to help bring about economic recovery. There are still problems which need to be solved before political reform can be completely carried out. While continuing to work toward this end, it will be necessary as soon as possible to settle those issues which will be particularly important from now on, particular among them relations with the United States, especially regarding economic ties which continue to be entangled. In view of the upcoming Naples summit, I also feel improving Japanese-U.S. relations is an impending issue. Many other problems have accumulated. The fact that coalition representatives have conducted heated debates on such issues as tax system reform and the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development is extremely significant. The new administration must carry out its policies by building a foundation on the results of such debates. This is a great task that will be imposed on the new administration. We plan to give our full support so the new administration can carry out this task. That is all.
