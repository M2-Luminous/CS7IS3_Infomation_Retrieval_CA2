The State Duma has taken a failed attempt to pronounce them unconstitutional from the outset. Russian Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that "many provisions of the edicts run counter to the current legislation, and some of them are simply astonishing." The Finance Ministry, while refraining from issuing any statements, yesterday presented its calculations to the State Duma showing that the room for tax maneuver is not so large as the edicts' authors thought. The essence of the package of presidential edicts, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported Wednesday, boils down to budget maneuvering with the view to easing tax pressure on enterprises, a measure which, according to the drafters, must finally bring about economic recovery. Naturally, at a time of a budget deficit taxes can be cut only if the resulting decrease in the budget revenues is offset by something else. This is the reason why the edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export Deliveries of Goods and Services" should not only liberalize a certain sector of the economy, but also give a boost to the federal budget's hard-currency revenues. The lifting of tariff benefits serves to achieve this objective. It is the abolition of benefits together with the tightening of tax and payment discipline (to which other edicts in the May package are devoted) that should help painlessly to cut taxes. In a letter to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Budget, Finances, and Banks, the Finance Ministry has dissipated these hopes. The ministry is proceeding from the assumption that hard-currency losses from scrapping state quotas on oil, oil products, non-ferrous metals, and natural gas, estimated in the draft federal budget at $2.6 billion, will not be offset by the expected earnings from export customs duties ($2.47 billion). At the same time, the ministry has already taken into account the new export duty rates that have been significantly reduced under the upcoming draft government decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 21 May). So, the budget will not benefit from that in real terms. (Customs duties have not been levied on exports to meet state requirements, but virtually all hard-currency earnings have been transferred to the budget. According to the logic of the edicts' authors, the abolition of state quotas and customs duty benefits is designed to replace budget revenues from state exports with earnings from export customs duties.) The Finance Ministry's general conclusion is clear: the edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export Deliveries of Goods and Services" will not help increase the budget revenues. Hence, what is left at the government's disposal is in effect only administrative measures to combat persistent tax evaders. This does not inspire any particular confidence, however, that the promises to slash profit and added-value tax rates by 10 to 20 percentage points will be fulfilled. Federal budget hard-currency export revenues in 1994 As of 1 May, $738 million has been received. Revenues according to the draft federal budget -- total -- $2.6 billion -- from oil, oil products, and non-ferrous metals exports -- $1.4 billion -- from natural gas exports -- $1.2 billion Revenues after changes introduced by the presidential edicts (Finance Ministry's estimate) -- $2.47 billion
