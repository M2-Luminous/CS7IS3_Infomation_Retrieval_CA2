Kovac's statement calls for dialogue and rejects the expressions of nationalism that appeared in a Hungarian-language daily on the eve of a meeting of representatives of the Hungarian minority in Komarno convened by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island. Although Kovac resolutely rejected as unconstitutional a proposal to create a special province in southern Slovakia, at the same time he supported as justified demand that the new territorial administrative division of Slovakia not discriminate against the Hungarian minority.
