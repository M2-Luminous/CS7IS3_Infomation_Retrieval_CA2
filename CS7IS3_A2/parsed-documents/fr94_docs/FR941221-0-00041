FR941221-0-00041 FR941221-0-00015 As noted above, we also have revised the final rule to be consistent with the amendment to IRCA made by the FY 1995 Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;333. Section 402.11(q) provides that States use reallocated funds to reimburse SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the funds but no later than July 31, 1995. Finally, we have revised §402.51 to indicate that no reporting on obligations or expenditures is required for funds allotted under §402.34. The second commenter suggested that States be allowed to liquidate obligations incurred before October 1, 1994, through the statutory deadline with funds allocated under §402.34. From the beginning of the SLIAG program, the regulation has defined SLIAG-related cost as an expenditure by a State or local government. Costs incurred by private providers and State obligations with private providers have, therefore, not been accepted as SLIAG-related costs for reimbursement. This definition of SLIAG-related costs incorporates IRCA's goal of reimbursing State and local governments for their costs resulting from the legalization of certain aliens. It also has ensured that allocations of SLIAG funds are based on actual costs incurred by States and that allocations have not been influenced by States' obligating large amounts of funds. In view of this existing definition, obligations incurred by States prior to October 1, 1994, but not expended by December 29, 1994, cannot be considered SLIAG-related costs acceptable for reimbursement with reallocated funds. This suggestion has therefore not been incorporated in the final rule. Section 402.30, Basis of awards; Section 402.40, General The final rule in §402.30 states that no application is necessary for receiving reallocated funds; reallocated funds will be awarded to States whose annual cost reports show that their accepted SLIAG-related costs exceed their allotments under §§402.31 and 402.33. Section 402.40 provides that, to be eligible for reallocated funds, States must submit annual reports which document that their SLIAG-related costs exceed the amount of their allotments under §§402.31 and 402.33. Comment One commenter suggested that both of these sections be revised. According to this commenter, §402.30 should be revised to state that reallocated funds would be awarded to States which have drawn down the full amount of their allotments as of December 30, 1994. The commenter also suggested that §402.40 be revised to provide that, to be eligible for reallocated funds, States must have drawn down their entire allotments as of December 30, 1994. Response As we noted above, we believe that the best way to meet the goal of the amendment to IRCA is to define unexpended funds as the difference between a State's allotments through FY 1994 and the State's SLIAG-related costs. The final rule therefore incorporates this definition. For this reason, we believe that the basis of eligibility and the basis of awards should also be based on a State's SLIAG-related costs, rather than on drawdowns. The final rule therefore states that reallocated funds will be awarded to States whose annual cost reports show that their accepted SLIAG-related costs exceed their allotments under §402.31 and §402.33. It also states that, to be eligible for reallocated funds, States must submit annual reports which document that their SLIAG-related costs exceed the amount of their allotments under §402.31 and §402.33. Section 402.34 Allocation of unexpended funds This section provides that unexpended funds will be reallocated based on the percentage share of unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs of each State with such costs to the total of all unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. The section provides further that the allotments awarded to States will be the amount of the reallocation or the amount of each State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, whichever is less.
