The missile, which has an ability to strike at a 25 km range can also engage several targets simultaneously. An indigenously produced radar (a phased array radar) on the weapon can track several targets together. The Akash test follows successful flight manoeuvres carried out late last month of the anti-tank missile, Nag. In the wake of the induction of Prithvi surface-to-surface missile (range of 150 to 250 km) and the likelihood of a third test of the Agni IRBM, these successes bring India closer to acquiring its own arsenal of sophisticated missiles. The development of the Akash is expected to give India an edge especially over Pakistan, which is not in the race for a weapon in this category. Significantly, Thursday's test validated the ramjet propulsion technology, thus making India the third country which has achieved this capability. The ramjet principle utilises atmospheric air to obtain enormous energy from a low volume and weight. Consequently, this makes the missile lighter and extends the range.
