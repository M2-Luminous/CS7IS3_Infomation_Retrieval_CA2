In particular, leader of Russia's Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin called it unacceptable. As he said, according to Agrarians, the draft Agreement "goes astray from the Constitution" because it negates the opportunities to introduce changes into the Basic Law, contained in it, and the opportunities for holding early elections. Lapshin compared the agreement with "a tough bridle" for political parties. He also qualified the present situation with peasants in Russia, their "humiliation and oppression" as unacceptable for a civilized society. On behalf of the Yabloko faction Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy, co- chairman of Russia's republican party, expressed doubt with respect to "the expediency of signing these documents which cannot really lead to any accord." In his opinion, the proposed agreement is a means "to divert the Duma and the government from the real politics and real reforms." At the same time Shestakovskiy underlined that his faction is not against accord and is ready to start a search for it "in practical deeds and parliamentary work." Representative of Russia's Democratic Party faction Aleksey Leushkin pointed out that his position with respect to the agreement would be determined after the national congress of the Democratic Party of Russia scheduled for Saturday. However, as he said, this document has the aim "to drive everyone into a trap," because the president and the government "who can do nothing to draw the country out of the crisis intend to place the responsibility for this on other people." Some time earlier leaders of the Communist Party and Russian Pan- National Union Gennadiy Zyuganov and Sergey Baburin were very critical about this document; and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir Zhirinovskiy set forth a provision that the party would support the agreement only in the case that Andrey Kozyrev, Viktor Yerin, and Anatoliy Chubays resign. In the course of the debates leader of Russia's Choice bloc Yegor Gaydar declared about his readiness to sign the proposed draft agreement. In his estimate, the agreement says that the public forces take the obligation to act in the framework of the Constitution and the acting legislation and not to act in a way inducive to violence and confrontation. At the same time Gaydar noted that "we understand that there exist certain restrictions when we want to reach accord with those who again want to introduce rationing tickets, to create long lines, and to again pull Russia into a Cold War." Meanwhile, the presidential aide Georgiy Satarov believes that the agreement "proposes mechanisms ensuring political stability in society" and helps "to remove conflicts" in the relations between the authorities and political forces at the earliest stages.
