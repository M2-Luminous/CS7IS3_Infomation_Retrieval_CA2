About 500 Cambodian Government soldiers seized a Khmer Rouge stronghold near the Thai-Cambodian border yesterday morning and were later able to seize the camp after attacking it with heavy shelling. Some of the Cambodian forces allegedly intruded into Thai territory at An Ma Pass and later occupied a Thai military base about 50 metres from the common border. The Cambodian troops earlier refused to pull out of the base, claiming they wanted to wait until they were able to clear landmines on the Cambodian side. They later agreed to withdraw after a tough stand from the Thais. During negotiations, a Cambodian soldier was killed when he stepped on a landmine. A Cambodian soldier said the Cambodian government planned to launch large-scale offensives against Khmer Rouge strongholds this dry season. About 100 shells reportedly landed on Thai soil during fighting yesterday morning but there were no reports of casualties or damage to Thai property.
