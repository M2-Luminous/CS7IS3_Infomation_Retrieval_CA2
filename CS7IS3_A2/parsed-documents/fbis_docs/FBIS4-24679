The old premises are now used for science and technology and real estate development. Moving industrial enterprises out of the city proper to make room for service trades is now well under way in Shanghai. At present, there are nearly 1,000 industrial transformation programs oriented toward the Shanghai suburbs, and more than 200 new industrial areas are emerging there. As one of China's most economically advanced cities, Shanghai's real estate has obvious graded prices. For the 400 pieces of land already allowed to be leased, the lowest price in the suburban area is 20 U.S. dollars per sq m, while the highest in the city proper has reached 5,000 dollars per sq m. Since the beginning of the 1990s Shanghai has planned to divide the city into four functional areas -- a central trade area, commercial and trade area, suburban industrial band and second-grade market outskirts area, forming four concentric circles. In the past two years nearly 100 financial and trade buildings have been set up in the center of the city, which provide quick and concentrated services for both domestic and foreign customers. While secondary industry, in urgent need of funds for technical transformation and low-priced land for expansion, finds its location in the suburban areas. Besides the factories, the residents in the old districts and government offices located in busy trade areas have also moved out. It is estimated that about 300,000 people have already moved to new homes in the inner suburbs. And the number will increase along with the city's development. It is noteworthy that dozens of government departments will move out of the waterside bund area and all the 37 buildings there will be leased to domestic and foreign financial institutions. Some government departments like the aviation bureau have already moved out. This area, crowded with government departments for over 40 years, may become a financial district just like that in New York's Manhattan.
