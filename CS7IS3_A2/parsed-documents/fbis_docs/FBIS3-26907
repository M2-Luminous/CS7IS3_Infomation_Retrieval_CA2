Li Peng said at the meeting that 1993 was a year in which the nation fully implemented the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and proceeded victoriously along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; major successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and modernization; new situations appeared in work in all fields; and the tasks which the first session of the Eighth NPC set for the year were basically accomplished. He said: The year 1994 is important for the national economy to maintain its good developmental momentum and a year crucial for expediting reform. On the basis of fully analyzing the situations at home and abroad, the CPC Central Committee has clearly defined the basic principle governing the work of the whole party and the whole country. This principle is: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the party's basic line, we should fully implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; accelerate the process of building a socialist market economic system; maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development; maintain political stability; and expedite social progress in all fields. The CPC Central Committee stressed that seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability are requirements of overall importance for the whole party and the whole country. The State Council and governments at all levels must clearly understand these requirements while doing their work in all fields and must earnestly and properly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability. We must continue to be firm in handling things in two areas at the same time, namely: While concentrating our efforts on promoting economic development and reform, we must make positive efforts to develop science and technology education and cultural services, intensify construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and intensify construction of a socialist democracy and legal system. This is also the basic principle we followed while drafting the government work report. Li Peng said: The government work report has been printed and distributed to all departments, all relevant units, and all provinces, municipalities, and regions to solicit their comments. The purpose of doing so is to pool the ideas of all quarters so that the government work report can embody the views and wishes of all social circles, and so that the government will be able to do its work more effectively. During the meeting today, Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council Research Office and person in charge of the government work report drafting panel, reported on the drafting of the report.
