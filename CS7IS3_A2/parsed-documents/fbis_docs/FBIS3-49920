Director of the Press and Information Department in the Foreign Ministry Wladyslaw Klaczynski told newsmen after the meeting that U.S. President Bill Clinton described the initiative as opening doors, not setting up barriers. President Lech Walesa stressed Poland's doubts concerning the initiative in the light of both Polish past experience and the present situation. President Walesa pointed out Poland's determination to effectively and quickly integrate with the European structures which is not intended to work against the interests of Russia. Bill Clinton reiterated that U.S. security is connected with the security of the central and eastern Europe and said that the "Partnership for Peace" is a project valuable as such and is not a compromise between doing nothing and full NATO membership. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who was referring mainly to economic issues, stressed the need to start a "partnership for development." Bill Clinton replied that he had encouraged businessmen present at the recent E.C. summit in Brussels to expand their investments in eastern and central Europe and appealed to western leaders to facilitate the access of eastern European goods to western markets. President Lech Walesa especially emphasized the necessity for western Europe's greater effort in the integration processes.
