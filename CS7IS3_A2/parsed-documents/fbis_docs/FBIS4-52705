Since the airfield is state property, use of the site will require the permission of the Ministry of Finance. However, according to village officials, the permission may be granted as early as the first half of fiscal year 1994. According to village officials, the village started negotiations with the NDFAB in 1991 with the aim of seeking the "outright return of the airfield," or if not, "shared use of the airfield." Meanwhile, basic design for the new village government building was completed at the end of fiscal 1992, and the construction plan has been decided upon. Yomitan plans to finish the operational designs this fall, start construction work in fiscal 1995, and complete it in fiscal 1996 for the village government to move in. While there have been moves toward the return of the airfield this spring, the village government thinks that this will not come in time for architectural design work in the fall. Thus, it has attempted to negotiate shared use of the airfield. According to the basic design, the village building will be located on a site extending from the center of the runway to the northeast, near the Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground. The building is designed to be a four-story structure, with one floor underground and three floors aboveground, and a total floor area of 6,376 square meters. It will also have a parking lot, and the village civic hall is scheduled to be moved to a nearby site. At present, the U.S. Forces also share the use of the Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground. The U.S. military is hesitant to return the auxiliary airfield because of possible hindrance to telecommunications at the neighboring Sobe Communications Station after the return. However, Yomitan claims that "the construction of the ball park and other facilities proved that there has not been any radiowave jamming."
