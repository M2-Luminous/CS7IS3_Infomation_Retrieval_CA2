The council supported Boris Yeltsin's initiative to develop an agreement between the major political forces and his declared course towards social consensus. At the same time, Democratic Russia listed a number of conditions which, in its opinion, must be met while developing and signing the agreement. According to Democratic Russia, the Russian government can be allowed to sign the agreement only if it fulfills all its promises to pay salaries to state workers such as servicemen, medical and culture workers and policemen. Democratic Russia believes that persons and political forces whose actions violated Russian laws, who triggered and deliberately organized mass disorders, fanned ethnic differences and called for war and violence must not be allowed to sign the agreement. The agreement must impose a responsibility before society upon everyone who signs it, Democratic Russia maintained. The movement's political council believes that the agreement should clearly outline the obligations of all sides, including the president, the government, the Federal Assembly, political parties, trade unions and other social organizations.
