But Sensitive Issue Remains Regarding Aerospace Research Policy That Awaits Clear Answers"] [Text] "We are not waiting for approval of the fourth research framework program by the Twelve to launch specific programs." That was how Antonio Ruberti, European commissioner responsible for research policy recently submitted a working document on what the future specific research programs should be and that will be, in principle, the concrete expression of the Community research framework program for 1994-1998. Antonio Ruberti does not conceal the fact that the main objective in submitting that working document is to speed up the legislative process of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to avoid momentary interruption of the financing of research projects in January 1995. That is why, anticipating the conclusion of the work of the Twelve and of the Euro-deputies, Antonio Ruberti further defined the content of the specific programs and sketched out the related budget lines (see box). Many Unresolved Problems If, from a perspective of the impact of the announcement, Antonio Ruberti and his colleagues are scoring a point, in reality, all the problems presented some months ago have not been resolved. To be sure, the college of commissioners did somewhat lower the antagonisms among the various general directorates of the Commission. It clarified the respective purviews of the services that are parties in this issue. It did set up inter-service groups to coordinate approaches and avoid duplications. But it did nothing affecting the substance since it did not manage to give concrete expression to its idea of having horizontal research benefit the largest number while supporting well targeted industries, no matter what it says in this regard. This applies especially to the aerospace sector that functions like a magnifying mirror for the contradictions of the member states and the European Commission. In fact, the top question that some in Brussels are posing is to know whether research projects can reasonably be conceived that can contribute to improving the competitiveness of railways, shipping and aviation simultaneously while the aerospace industry, for instance, needs to face its own technological challenges in order to be able to confront its chief rivals. A top European official states: "You see, generic research has become a religion, whether with the Commission or the member states. So, horizontal research has to be done. But simultaneously, the member states are telling us to still coordinate specific actions for certain elements of European industry without giving the impression that the Community is supporting one sector more than another. The problem is that the mechanism enabling us to solve this contradiction still has to be invented." For an old veteran of the Brussels scene, there is no doubt: "Therefore, within the Commission as well as among the Twelve, everyone has to agree on what coordination means. By planning the work, precisely defining the objectives to be pursued, concurrently with the member states and their industries, over the short, medium and long term, whether for research on behalf of the aerospace, automobile or computer industry, then there are prospects of being able henceforth to solve this contradiction. All parties also have to know the precise level of the total credits allocated for research in those three sectors. On the other hand, if coordination means drawing up a list of projects, the odds are strong that we will have a heck of time in doing away with that ambiguity. And each industry or laboratory will continue to try to glean as much funding as possible." Lowering Acoustic and Gaseous Emissions But it is not only on this underlying issue that the working document on specific programs has not contributed any answer. Others remain pending. For instance, those involving knowledge of what Community aerospace research covers in terms of funding allocated and specific activities to be performed. What is the underlying strategy? Put another way, in which direction is Community aerospace research headed? For example, is it going to end up as massive financial support for projects focusing on problems of management and control of air traffic to the detriment of projects aimed at lowering acoustic or gaseous emissions or improving propulsion technologies. In its working document the Brussels Commission believes that the EEC should support ground/on-board communication, especially via the use of satellite links supplementing traditional resources like radar. The catch is that the real question has been skirted. Europeans are lagging quite a bit in this sector and they therefore have to opt for U.S. technology -- Global Positioning System [GPS]-Global Navigation Satellite System [GNSS] -- or for Russian Glonass know-how. But, neither the Commission's services nor their officials have found a common bond. Air Traffic Management The General Directorate of Telecommunications and new technologies, the DGXIII, that controls all projects developing computerized communications in transportation and therefore those focused on air traffic management, swears only by the U.S. military system while the General Directorate of Transportation, the DGVII, the policy and reflection leadership in matters of transportation, is steadfastly inclined towards the Russian option. By failing to clearly broach some issues, the European Commission is simply reflecting the pervasive coolness prevailing among the member states and their contradictions. It is unwilling to risk suffering a refusal. Hence its current low profile. And yet it has made some attempts. Last year, Jacques Delors, European Commission president, was prepared to supply more resources to research policy to enable the Europeans to stay in the technology race. The Twelve said "nyet" at Edinburgh in December 1992. Jacques Delors should press forward again with his White Book on the growth initiative. But the odds are heavy that the Twelve will send him back to his fond analyses. [Boxed item] European Commission Proposals Capable of Benefiting The Aerospace Industry Computer and communications technologies: - Total budget: 3.888 billion European Currency Units [ECU] (One ECU=FF6.6). - The Commission proposes earmarking 24.5 percent of the total budget for computer communications with 40-52 percent of that 24.5 percent set aside for computer communications in transportation, medical care and administration. - In the transportation sector, the Commission set two priorities: finalize a unified system using computer communications instruments to enhance the capability and promote use of satellite links to improve air/ground communication. Industrial Technologies: - Total budget: ECU1.573 billion - The Commission is proposing that 34-39 percent of the total budget be earmarked for design, engineering, production systems, 33-38 percent for related materials and technologies, 10-12 percent for advanced propulsion technologies and 12-16 percent for standardization and testing. - In the aerospace sector, the Commission set two priorities: work on fluid dynamics and on lowering energy consumption in propulsion systems. Environment: - Total budget: ECU625 million - The Commission is proposing to earmark 55-56 percent of the total budget to the natural environment, to quality of the environment, to global change, 20-30 percent to improvement of "own" technologies and 10-20 percent to enhancement of earth observation know-how. - In the space sector, the Commission drew up the following priorities: assistance for advanced technologies research in the sensors sector, EEC participation in the "Vegetation" space sensor that will be incorporated into the SPOT satellite system, EEC participation in development of AMAS atmospheric sensor, financial support for development of a European decentralized system for management and access to space data. Transportation: - Total budget: ECU 280 million - The Commission is proposing to earmark 18-22 percent of the total budget for definition of a European multimodal system and 78-82 percent to optimization of existing transportation systems. Of that 78-82 percent, air transportation should appropriate a not insignificant share for itself since it will get 16-18 percent of that budget. Ditto for railways, albeit somewhat less than the maritime and internal waterways navigation that will get 19-21 percent. Third Country Cooperation - Total budget: ECU790 million - The Commission is proposing to earmark 47-54 percent of the total budget to scientific and technological cooperation in Europe with the lion's share (41-47 percent) set aside for research and development projects with the East European countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union [CIS], 4.8-5.3 percent with non-European industrialized countries and 41-47 percent with developing countries.
