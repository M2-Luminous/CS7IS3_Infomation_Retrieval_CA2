Speaking on the NATO ultimatum about air strikes at Bosnian Serbs' positions, he said: "This is a shameful act of the Western countries to practice power politics and show off their military forces to small nations." Speaking on the bloodshed in Sarajevo on 5 February, Karadzic said: It was "created by Islamic jihad warriors from abroad," who attempted to put the blame on somebody else. He maintained that the bloodshed "had damaged the process of peace talks for Bosnia-Herzegovina"; "it was a base action against not only Serbs but also Muslims." Karadzic continued to stress: The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has so far claimed over 200,000 lives, produced millions of refugees, and caused more than $100 billion in material damages, pulling the economy of the area back to the level of several decades ago. He believed that the Bosnian war could be ended if the international community treats all sides of conflict equally. Karadzic said he was grateful for the Chinese Government's principled stand of firmly opposing foreign military intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and advocating a resolution to the Bosnian crisis through political negotiations. He felt that the Chinese mass media have fairly and objectively reported the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and have fully respected the facts.
