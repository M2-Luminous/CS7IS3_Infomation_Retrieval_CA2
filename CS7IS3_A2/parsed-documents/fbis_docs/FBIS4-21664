At the same time, the Foreign Ministry believes that the sanctions problem is not yet practicable. Sanctions are an extreme measure to be used when all the political possibilities have been exhausted. According to reports from Seoul, South Korea has placed its 650,000-strong Armed Forces on a heightened state of alert. All leave has been canceled. Meanwhile, ITAR-TASS reports from Pyongyang, the situation in the DPRK capital remains calm. No changes have as yet been observed which would point to preparations for a possible military conflict.
