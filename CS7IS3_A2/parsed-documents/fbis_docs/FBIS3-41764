An increase in cancerous diseases of the thyroid gland after Chernobyl had been predicted by specialists but for later time periods. In 10 years before the Chernobyl catastrophe, only 7 cases of thyroid cancer were discovered in children. In 1990 alone, 47 such cases were recorded, and 43 cases were recorded in the first half of 1993. The overwhelming majority of cases of disease have occurred in the Gomel Oblast. Ranking second is not the Mogilev Oblast as might be expected, but rather the Brest Oblast. The village of Olmany in the oblast's Stolin Rayon, which used to be known in Byelarus for its literature thanks to Yakub Kolas's novel ``Tryasina'' has now become famous for its ``radiation.'' The level of contamination of the soil with cesium in this swamp-surrounded small corner is just 1-5 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]; however, the coefficient of radionuclide transfer into products grown here is extremely high. Gastrointestinal tract injury has been noted in many children of the village of Olmany, and the health of 77 children (of the 250 living here) is in such a threatened state that oncological diseases are inevitable in several years for them without preventive medical measures. In 1991 physicians discovered dangerous changes in the digestive systems of 8.1 percent of Olmany's children, whereas today every fourth child has such changes. Specialists confirm that local residents must either be resettled or completely switched over to products that are shipped in. Indeed, even giving the children here regular trips to Germany, Italy, and summer rest bases in clean rayons to improve their sanitary conditions will not help them because after they return home, their health status will return to its previous level owing to strong irradiation.
