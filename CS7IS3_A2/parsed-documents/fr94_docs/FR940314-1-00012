FR940314-1-00012 FR940314-1-00004 Sections 91.417(a)(2)(v) and 121.380(a)(2)(v) of the FAR require that a record be made of the current status of applicable AD's. With regard to proposed paragraph (b), such a record would be required to be made when the maintenance/inspection program is revised to incorporate the program specified in the Document; at that time, paragraph (b) of the AD would be fully complied with. Regarding paragraphs (d) through (g) of this proposal, those paragraphs would impose separate requirements; therefore, except as discussed below, separate entries would have to be made to reflect compliance with each of those paragraphs. Section 121.380(a)(2)(iv) of the FAR concerns recording ``the identification of the current inspection status of the aircraft.'' Section 91.417(a)(2)(iv) contains a similar requirement. Because proposed paragraph (b) would require operators to revise their maintenance/inspection program to include the program specified in the Document, each operator's program would be required to identify each inspection (e.g., ``C'' check) at which each basic task specified in the Document will be performed on each airplane. By recording the current inspection status of each airplane, and by maintaining a cross-reference system between these records and the maintenance/inspection program revision, it will be possible to determine the current status of each basic task on each airplane. Once this cross-reference system has been established, this recording provision of Sections 91 and 121 requires no additional recording beyond what would otherwise be required normally. Section 121.380(a)(1) concerns ``records necessary to show that all requirements for the issuance of an airworthiness release under section 121.709 have been met.'' Section 91.417(a)(1) contains a similar requirement. These are also referred to as ``dirty fingerprint records.'' This provision of sections 91 and 121 requires most of the recording that would result from this proposed AD. Each time a basic task is performed, the operator would be required to make a ``dirty fingerprint'' record of the task, identifying what actions were accomplished. It should be noted, however, that these records are not different from the records made for any other actions taken under the operator's maintenance/inspection program. In addition to the record making requirements, discussed above, sections 91 and 121 of the FAR impose requirements for record retention: Section 121.380(b)(1) and Section 91.417(b)(1) require that the ``dirty fingerprint'' records be retained until the work is repeated or superseded by other work, or for one year after the work is performed. Therefore, most of the records resulting from this proposed AD would not have to be retained indefinitely. However, such retention might facilitate subsequent transfers, or substantiate requests for repetitive interval escalations, and therefore, may be in the operator's interest. Section 121.380(b)(2) requires that the records specified in paragraph 121.380(a)(2) [current status of AD's and current inspection status] be retained and transferred with the airplane at the time it is sold. Section 91.417(b)(2) contains a similar requirement. These recording requirements are not considered to be unduly burdensome and are considered the minimum necessary to enable the cognizant FAA Maintenance Inspector to perform proper surveillance and to ensure that the objectives of the proposed rule are being fulfilled. However, because of the numerous concerns expressed previously by operators regarding the recordkeeping obligations imposed by section 121.380 with regard to similar rulemaking on corrosion prevention and control programs, the FAA has included in this proposal certain provisions for alternative recordkeeping methods. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would provide for the development and implementation of such alternative methods, which must be approved by the FAA. For example, operators may choose to submit proposals to record compliance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of the AD by a means other than they normally use to record AD status. (The FAA has developed guidance material that will contain information to be considered by FAA Principal Maintenance Inspectors (PMI) when reviewing proposals for alternative recordkeeping methods.) Paragraph (c) of the proposal provides for increasing a ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval by up to 10% in order to accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements. Operators would be required to inform the FAA within 30 days of such increases. Paragraph (d)(1) of the proposal sets forth the reporting actions that are necessary to be accomplished when Level 3 corrosion is determined to exist. Within 7 days after such a determination is made, an operator would be required to accomplish one of the following actions: 1. Submit a report of the determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected area on the remainder of the Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or 2. Submit a proposed schedule, for approval by the FAA, for performing the basic tasks in the affected area on the remainder of the operator's Model F&hyph;27 series fleet; or 3. Submit data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion was an isolated occurrence. Once the FAA has received such a report, it may, in conjunction with normal surveillance activities, request additional information regarding the results of the basic tasks performed on the remainder of the operator's Model F&hyph;27 series fleet. Paragraph (d)(2) of the proposal specifies that the FAA may impose schedules different from what an operator has proposed under paragraph (d)(1), if it is found that changes are necessary to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion in the operator's Model␣␣ F&hyph;27 series fleet is detected in a timely manner.
