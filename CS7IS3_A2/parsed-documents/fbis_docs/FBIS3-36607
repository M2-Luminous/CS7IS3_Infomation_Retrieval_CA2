Three bases are supposed to be set up: in Tbilisi in Vaziani region (Military-Air forces), in Akhalkalaki (Motor-infantry brigade) and in Batumi (Motor-infantry brigade). Batumi's base will have its branch offices in Sukhumi, Poti and Gudauta. The bases will be established from those Russian troops which located now in Transcaucasia. They are mostly infantry troops, aircraft, planes SU-25 and bombing aviation. It should be noticed that Russian military bases are set up in Georgian regions neighbouring with Turkey which are inhabited by Armenians and Adzhars. Military ships of the Black Sea fleet will be placed in Poti. The bases will be established till July 1 1994. Their goal is to safeguard the security of Russia and Caucasian countries which enter Collective Security Pact. The troops located in Georgia will be led by Commandant of the group of Russian troops in the Caucasia General Fedor Reut excluding 345th landing regiment. This regiment is under the control of Russian Defense Minister. In the times of the USSR a corps consisting of three motor-infantry divisions, units of 40th air army and units of the 19th army was located on the territory of Georgia. As far as the 4 point of the agreement (on equipment of Georgian armed forces with Russian technique) concerns, the Russian President Yeltsin said that one can not speak about military equipment until the problems concerning ethnic minorities of Abkhaz and South Osets are left unsolved. According to Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the agreement can stimulate the achievement of political settlement of the situation in Abkhaz and South Osetia. However, on February 4 Deputy Chairman of Abkhaz mass media Yuriy Vorontsov said that Georgian government set South Osetia and Abkhaz outside of Georgia. Minister of Foreign Relations of South Osetia, Urusmak Jioyev stated that Russia tries to settle Georgian problems by military way. He recalled recent developments in Western Georgia when "Russian troops seized the whole regions and the supporters of Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed the genocydis". Deputy Chairman of mass media of South Osetia, Valeriy Khubulov said that republic step aside from Georgia and joined the Northern Osetia. "We want to live together with the Northern Osetia", he stressed. At the same time political and social movements of the nations of the North Caucasus (excluding Inghush) came out against the conclusion of Russian-Georgian treaty. According to the opinion of the leadership of the Confederation of the Caucasian Nations, Russia decided to back Georgia to strengthen its positions on the Black Sea and the Caucasus. This Moscow's policy will lead to the fact that Russia will lose its positions in the North Caucasus which is isolated from Russia. The officials of the North Caucasus say that the more Russia tries to preserve the integrity of Georgia the more the nations of the North Caucasus step aside from it. The day before Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Russian State Duma came out against conclusion of the treaty with Georgia. According to majority deputies, if Moscow establishes close relations with Tbilisi it will lose the North Caucasus.
