[Pastrana] As in Venezuela, there was traditionally a two-party system in Colombia. The system actually began breaking up in the 1990 elections when the M-19 rejoined public life and consolidated its position as a third party. This new political movement has grown stronger since then in the National Constituent Assembly. We in New Democratic Force started getting involved during the elections for senators, when their mandate was revoked. We are neither a party nor a political movement. This means that we do not have legal status, that we are not registered as a party. We are different from the Conservative and Liberal parties and the Democratic Alliance (M-19), which as a result get certain benefits from the government. We have chosen not to register. I invited Liberals to take part, I invited my Conservative Party, and independents. Today we have eight senators, two of whom are from the Liberal Party. Moreover, I have not resigned from my party. I have not told the Liberals to resign from their party; rather, I have said that we should put together a political force. What is happening in Latin America is that the parties are wearing themselves out and have ceased to be spokesmen for their people. People no longer expect the answers to be Liberal or Conservative, just as I am sure that in Venezuela one party alone cannot govern. [Matute] How would you define yourself ideologically? [Pastrana] As I told you, I have not resigned from my party, the Conservative Party. In accordance with the new philosophy, I would define myself as a centrist. As for economic policy, I believe in the liberalization and the integration that are taking place in the world. In this regard we have backed President Gaviria. The development minister belongs to the political movement of New Democratic Force. We believe that some adjustments have to be made in connection with this policy in Colombia's case, especially in the area of agriculture. I think that the country has to aim for growth of over six percent, but along with the well-being of its people. We have to lend a social meaning to this economic growth. In this case I have backed President Gaviria's efforts to do so because I think that this is the way to lead the country into the future. [Matute] Hasn't such support for a Liberal president carried a high political price for your career? [Pastrana] A few days ago I said that I do not hope that things go bad for President Gaviria so that they will go well for Andres Pastrana. I hope that things go well for President Gaviria so that things go well for Colombians. And I think that this is what people are hoping for today. I signed a political accord with Gaviria and for this reason I am part of the administration. It is a political accord under which I can continue to disagree with him. I personally think that social investment in Colombia has been weak. We have to really earmark resources in order to move the country forward. I think that governments have to be supported for what they do well and criticized for what they do poorly, and this is what we are doing. [Matute] Do you think that the manner of practicing politics is changing? [Pastrana] I think that there is another way. People may think at times that a political group is involved in an administration in order to reap benefits. When I joined President Gaviria's administration, Pablo Escobar had just escaped from prison, and energy rationing was starting. In other words, President Gaviria was at his low point. I think that this is the new way of practicing politics. To a great extent this is being shown in Venezuela, because Convergence is made up of 17 parties. In the case of Venezuela, even though COPEI [Social Christian Party] is a party and AD [Democratic Action] is a party, what the presence of Convergence may show is this: that problems today cannot be identified as problems for AD or COPEI members. As I think is the case in Colombia, problems are neither Liberal nor Conservative; they belong to everyone. And I think that in the face of this, if we can join efforts, we will succeed, that is to say, form a national government. [Matute] If you are elected, will you deal with Congress through pacts? [Pastrana] No, what I am talking about is the presidential election; this is what we are putting together a movement for. We are not submitting slates for Congress. We are putting forward a political agenda for the presidency. [Matute] What is your government program? [Pastrana] We have not yet put forward our government program because we have not officially put forward a candidate. Our aim is to launch the campaign officially this January with a pledge in the form of a government plan. What Colombians are expecting today is a very specific program to deal with the problems besetting them. This is why it is hard at the moment to talk about a plan. [Matute] Colombia's two main presidential hopefuls, you and Ernesto Samper, are being accused of using image, propaganda, and the mass media more than contact with the people. [Pastrana] If there is any distinguishing feature of Andres Pastrana in politics, it is the slogan that I used during the campaign for mayor: "saying and doing." And this is why I want to commit myself to a government program. But I want to commit myself to Colombians on the things that I can do as president. They have tried to stereotype Andres Pastrana as someone who does not speak up. But, as I said before, I am not officially a candidate. Therefore, my campaign has not begun officially. I have tried to introduce new styles in politics. During the past election campaign for Congress we managed to get a half-million votes in a month and a half without delivering a single speech. [Matute] How did you manage that? [Pastrana] Traveling all over Colombia, talking with people, exchanging personal opinions with them. This is the same thing that I have wanted to do in the presidential campaign. I have been traveling around the country listening to people. In general, it is the candidate who talks to the people, but we never listen to the people so that a candidate can express what they want through a government program. We are now holding forums in each department to learn about people's deep-seated concerns and worries, to find out what the priority projects are. [Matute] What is Andres Pastrana's diagnosis of Colombia? [Pastrana] The main issue in the country, and we cannot hide it, is security. I think that with Pablo Escobar's death we are doing away with one of the problems, which was narcoterrorism. We are thus beginning a new chapter in Colombia's history. But the guerrillas and crime in the streets remain. Infrastructure is the other major issue. A study by the U.S. firm Monitor on competitiveness in Colombia, an issue that our development minister, Luis Alberto Moreno, has been addressing in this administration, says that Colombian exporters' costs are 12 to 14 percent higher owing to the lack of roads. It is very difficult to compete like that. We have to build all this infrastructure so that the liberalization can expand and we can compete on an equal footing. [passage omitted] [Matute] In your opinion, what is the best way for Colombia and Venezuela to settle the pending problem of delimiting offshore areas? [Pastrana] I personally believe in direct negotiations, as they are called for in the San Pedro Alejandrino accord. But I am going to be clear about this. I proposed an agreement to put the delimitation issue on ice, because I do not think that it ought to be a campaign issue. Venezuela kept its word, and the candidates tacitly honored the agreement; the issue of the delimitation was not a campaign issue. They heeded my proposal. My worry is that in Colombia the candidates agreed to put it on ice only until after the presidential election in Venezuela. I think that the agreement has to extend until after our presidential campaign. The other issues I think should continue being discussed. [Matute] Don't you think that the issue of immigration has been brought up in the campaign in Colombia? [Pastrana] Right now, yes. But I do not think that we can continue to view relations from a negative perspective all the time. People say that kidnapping is going on in Venezuela; they complain about guerrilla raids. These are problems that directly affect us and indirectly affect Venezuela. At times minor problems disrupt relations between the two countries. There is even one issue that is insignificant to us but not to Venezuela: car theft. We have to do away with the scourge of kidnapping. We have to look for ways to control our borders so that we can put an end to these crimes both here and there. Let us hope that the issue of immigration is not used for political purposes in Venezuela either. President Velasquez has said that he is going to review Decree 1911. I think that it has to be. In the final accounting, there are Colombians who have helped to develop this country, just as there have been Venezuelans in Colombia. We cannot say that problems do not arise for us, both here and there. The important thing is to investigate these complaints and, if there are violations between the two countries, to punish the guilty. [Matute] Would one of the ways be to set up a bilateral commission on immigration? [Pastrana] Yes, this would enable the two countries to sit down and talk about the issue of immigration, whether offices need to be opened up along the border; it would provide a place to look into the problems, to investigate. The most important thing is to view relations not in terms of the past but with an eye towards the future. I told President Rafael Caldera: Why don't we use the Andean Pact as a bloc to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States. Trade between the two countries is almost $1.5 billion. This is something that I do not think most people would ever imagine. This entire process is irreversible. There were fears in Colombia that President Caldera might be thinking about backtracking; I do not think so. On the contrary, I am optimistic now. We know Caldera; we know who he is, and we know that relations between the two countries are going to grow stronger in several ways. One of them has to be integration. I think that the Group of Three has been a significant example of development. All of this is not going to be easy, but these efforts at integration and liberalization are important to us.
