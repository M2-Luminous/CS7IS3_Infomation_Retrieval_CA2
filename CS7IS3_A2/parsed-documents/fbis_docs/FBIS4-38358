This was stated to UKRINFORM by Yuriy Serhyeyev, chief of the Information Administration at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He pointed out that the decision had been adopted in view of the actions, which are incompatible with international concepts of information. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the decision had been adopted following "the provocative coverage of events in Odessa, the Crimea, and in Eastern Ukraine." All of this led us to adopt such a decision, he said. We are not depriving these mass media of a possibility to work, but we want information carried by them to be objective.
