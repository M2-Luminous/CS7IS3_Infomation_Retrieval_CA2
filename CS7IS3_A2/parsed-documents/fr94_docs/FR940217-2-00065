FR940217-2-00065 FR940217-2-00032 General Statutory Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' ``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1991&hyph;92 or academic year 1992&hyph;93, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in these settings. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of the academic year 1992&hyph;93 graduates are working in these settings. Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the Federal Register at 58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993. To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1994, criteria for the statutory and the administrative funding preferences have been developed to apply only to them. This criteria is provided in the application materials. Proposed Funding Preference for Fiscal Year 1994 The following funding preference is proposed for FY 1994: A funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate that (a) More than 50 percent of their graduates in 1993 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1991, 1992, and 1993) entered a generalist specialty. Proposed Funding Priority for FY 1994 The following priority is proposed for FY 1994: A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes.
