The Mozambican head of state conveyed that message -- which we perceived to be conciliatory -- when he commented on the report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government now that he is touring that province. Chissano said that, quote, if we have the understanding that that is a common goal, we will always see our ideas as contributing toward the resolution of problems, unquote. [Begin Chissano recording] It is true that we have reached a stage when there are two issues that are talked about in such a way as to be made to look contradictory. That should not be the case. Much is said in connection with political competition and there is also a lot of talk about national reconciliation. This has caused some confusion -- namely, the perception that political competition can be destructive. Others believe that political reconciliation is tantamount to scrapping political competition. That should not be the case. We have decided that political competition is desirable, so we have created a multiparty system. Let us compete politically, but let us do it constructively. We must not think, however, that reconciliation means we all toe the same political line and we all share the same views concerning national reconstruction. There is opposition. That has to be recognized. There is opposition. Reconciliation means that we are going to engage in serious political fighting, but that we will do so with respect, so that it will not interfere with the economy, in the sense that it could be sabotaged. [end recording] The report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government generally deals with the impact of war, natural disasters, and political and economic developments over the last two years.
