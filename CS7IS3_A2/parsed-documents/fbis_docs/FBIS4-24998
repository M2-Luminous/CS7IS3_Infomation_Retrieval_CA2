The 2.2-square-kilometer area in the western part of the city houses 110 plants involved in industrial chemicals, medicine, paper- making, metallurgy, machinery and electrical appliances, and meters and instruments, which discharge heavy pollutants, waste water and gas. Since 1985, the municipal government has spent 450 million yuan in the treatment of pollution in this area, which has completed 407 pollution-treatment projects and removed, closed down or merged 25 plants and workshops discharging heavy pollutants. The municipality has also planted more trees, lawns and flowers. As a result, the industrial output value of the area last year went up by 33 percent over 1985 and the amount of discharged waste gas was reduced by at least 70 percent and waste water by 50.7 percent. Noise in the area does not exceed the municipal government-set standard at present.
