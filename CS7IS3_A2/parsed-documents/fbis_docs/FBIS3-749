H. Kemp] [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, flew to Mmabatho on Friday [11 March] night to ensure that the Bophuthatswana government will co-operate fully with the IEC. This follows two hours of talks between President F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on the Bophuthatswana crisis. Mr Justice Kriegler will meet President Lucas Mangope to obtain his assurance that free and fair elections will be allowed in the territory. He will submit a report which will be discussed by the management committee of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Saturday. Mr Mandela, flanked by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, told journalists Mr Mangope's statement on Friday in which he said he would recommend to the Bophuthatswana parliament that the homeland participate in the April election, was "inadequate". He said the Transitional Executive Council had laid down four conditions with which Bophuthatswana had to comply in order to normalise the situation. Besides committing itself to free and fair elections and co-operating with the IEC, the TEC's resolution also demanded that Mmabatho remove all restrictions on free political activity and co-operate fully with the TEC regarding its reincorporation into South Africa. Asked whether Mr Mangope had effectively been restored to power, the ANC president said information from both the South African Defence Force [SADF] and the commander of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] indicated that Mr Mangope had "lost the loyalty and control over the security forces. "He has also lost control over the civil service and the masses in Bophuthatswana. There is no government in Bophuthatswana." Both Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk said it was essential that there should be full co-operation between the South African Government and the TEC on stabilising the situation in Bophuthatswana. Mr de Klerk said the security situation had been brought under control by the SADF, with the full co-operation of the BDF. He said members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] had left the territory and a group rallied by Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Gen Constand Viljoen was also in the process of leaving. Mr de Klerk said in terms of the TEC act, the governments of each of the independent states would remain in office until the election. referring to Bophuthatswana, he said: "In less than two months, that government will stop governing. It will then be replaced by a new negotiated system. This is the last chapter of an old imperfect system." He denied any agreement between himself and Mr Mandela that Mr Mangope should be removed from office. Mr de Klerk said the objective of Friday's negotiations was not to restore Mr Mangope to power "on the same basis as he held power yesterday". "His statement today has changed that. He is now committed to participating in the election." Mr de Klerk said he believed Gen Viljoen had tried to "play a constructive role to prevent an escalation of the violence and restore law and order".
