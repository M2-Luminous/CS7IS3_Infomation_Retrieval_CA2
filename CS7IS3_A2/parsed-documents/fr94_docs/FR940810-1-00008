FR940810-1-00008 FR940810-1-00002 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MI26&hyph;01&hyph;6294A; FRL&hyph;5029&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Michigan AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency proposes to grant an exemption from the oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) requirements to the State of Michigan. These requirements include adopting and implementing regulations addressing general conformity, transportation conformity, inspection and maintenance, reasonably available control technology, and new source review. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , EPA is granting the State's exemption request, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received by August 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), EPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590.
