Smyk: "Even Metal Cannot Withstand It"] [Text] The team of monetarists pushed us into a financial and economic crisis and then left. We shall seek to resolve it, "that was the way Vladimir Zimovetsk, director of the Volga Tube-Rolling Plant, explained the goal of the field session of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy] which gathered executives of the branch, directors of the largest metallurgy enterprises in Russia at Staryy Oskol. Today it is more difficult for tube-rolling production workers than for others. In five months the sub-branch cut its production in half. In ferrous metallurgy the decline continues for almost all types of production, while in the case of the producers of tungsten concentrate it is particularly significant amounting to 74.3 percent. The loss of the domestic market is taking place primarily due to the lack of an effective demand. But not only because of that. The speech by Serafim Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, for instance, contained the following fact: ZIL [Moscow Automobile I. A. Likhachev Plant] and AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] are in a disastrous situation, but the metal-cutting tool containing tungsten and molybdenum, however is acquired by them not from the Moscow Hard Alloy Combine, but from abroad, and they pay for it with foreign currency. Production capacities of tube-rolling plants, built on a latch-key basis by foreign firms, stand idle while Russia acquires many hundreds of millions of dollars in credit and purchases pipes abroad for trunk pipelines. The Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine has been idled together with the Lysvenskiy Metallurgical Plant. Here is a typical example. Import duties were reduced or completely eliminated last year on the initiative of Roskommetallurgiya. These and other preferential terms gave the branch enterprises 500 billion rubles [R]. It was proposed to use that for investments. The enterprises, however, invested not 130 billion as planned but a total of only R15 billion. As a result the building of the Yakovlev Mine for the mining of ore with a 70 percent iron content and other projects of interest to all ferrous metallurgy enterprises was disrupted. Metallurgists understand that if they confine themselves within the framework of their branch, they will be unable to resolve their problems. They are in the same group with power engineers and transportation workers, and it is necessary to balance the interests of each link. That can be accomplished if one includes another link: the government. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA recently wrote that German railways suffer annual losses of seven billion marks. This with distances that are insignificant compared to those in Russia and the higher level of equipment. The government covers this loss, understanding that without such a measure the country would simply be losing export income. Russia in particular cannot neglect such a measure if we do not want our railroads and ports to die out. Already at the present time metallurgical enterprises are changing the routes for their freight since for many of them Baltic and Ukrainian ports are more advantageous than Russian ones. The collegium stressed that the government must at least finance investments in power engineering and transportation. That measure, first of all, would permit a significant lowering of tariffs without freezing, and secondly, funds necessary to modernize and lower the cost of these branches would not create a burden on the entire economy. A hospital, built for the city by the Staryy Oskol Electrometallurgical Plant, was opened on the eve of the collegium session at Staryy Oskol. It is a magnificent building with modern medical equipment. The city cannot take it over at the present time which means the combine will have to operate it. With what funds? The metallurgists believe one of the solutions to be a lowering of taxes by an amount equivalent to expenditures on the maintenance of such facilities. At any rate they do not intend shouldering that burden indefinitely. After all the metallurgists must include the maintenance of the social sphere in the cost of all production and these expenditures equal those on wages. Executives in metallurgy worked out a number of concrete measures designed to resolve the economic crisis. They are being summarized and will be proposed to the government. The decree adopted at Staryy Oskol begins with the words: "Having studied the economic state of branch enterprises, the Collegium of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy views it as highly critical one."
