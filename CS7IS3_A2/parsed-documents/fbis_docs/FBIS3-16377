According to Alizade, the actual outcome of the agreements and the negotiation process will depend mostly on the Russias position. Touching on the question about the status of Upper Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] Alizade said, "We support the idea of giving the status of autonomy to Upper Karabakh...in fact, Armenian civilians do not live there, for the most part... [ellipses as received] Since the ethnic cleansing of Azeris from that territory, fascist-military control was established in Upper Karabakh." He also noted that the autonomy does not pose a threat to the integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. "It does not mean that federalisation of the republic will take place; Azerbaijan will remain a united republic", he added. The Azerbaijani National Independence Party's leader, Etibar Mamedov, said that he was not yet acquainted with the results of the talks. "I am not yet aware the concrete conditions of the agreement. One thing is known. The Armenian party has demanded to a guarantee prior to its withdrawal. If they mean that this guarantee includes the deployment of the Russian army in the territory, we are categorically against that and we shall not give them such an opportunity", said Etibar Mamedov. In his opinion, "one country cannot solve this problem as a mediator. Moreover, Russia has its own interests in this matter." According to Mamedov, the question of autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh could be solved on the basis of international norms, i.e. on the level of self-governance without the representation of a state. "It is impossible to have a state in the state", noted he.
