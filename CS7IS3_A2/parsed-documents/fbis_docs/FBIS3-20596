Today, the focus of rural work is on accelerating rural economic development and increasing the peasants' income. Now that the masses of peasants are warmly clothed and well-fed, income has become the issue of greatest concern to them. To prompt society to pay more attention to the rural areas, we have compiled some letters and essays from the rural areas. On the one hand, they reflect some of the poor conditions in the rural areas, and on the other hand, we urge comrades who have contact with the peasants and the villages not to further add to the peasants' burden by artificial means.
