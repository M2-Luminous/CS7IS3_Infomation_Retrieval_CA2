Peasants are learning a hard lesson because they cannot sell drugs due to the shortage of flights and low prices; therefore, they have discovered that "coca is no longer the remedy for all their ills." A peasant in the Tres Unidos settlement, 250 km from Tarapoto, said: "When I was growing corn or yucca I could eat them if I did not sell them. But if I don't sell coca I cannot eat it." The great majority of peasants in Huallaga abandoned agricultural production to grow coca and make cocaine base, which was more profitable and easier to sell. During the 1991-1992 agricultural season in San Martin Department, peasants planted 16,524 hectares of corn, which was about half the area planted the year before. Coffee production was affected most, dropping from 3,149 hectares in the 1990-1991 harvest to 143 hectares the year after. The same thing happened with beans, dropping from 3,945 hectares in 1990-1991 to 1,388 hectares the next season. Even banana production dropped considerably. A Juanjui peasant said: "In the jungle we were eating bananas grown in the coastal region. We were all going crazy growing coca." Although coca fever has not ended, police were able to reduce drug trafficking activities in Huallaga, thus reducing drug prices considerably. Tingo de Ponaza Mayor Enrique Reategui said: "Peasants now are more willing to grow other products because coca growing has become risky and not very profitable." During the 1992-1993 agricultural season, peasants planted 34,443 hectares of rice; two years ago it was only 22,723 hectares. During the same season, peasants planted 18,753 hectares of corn, which was 13.5 percent higher than the year before. Cotton production also increased considerably, going from only 53 hectares in 1991-1992 to 1,173 hectares. One Taraporo peasant said: "We will continue growing coca but we are back growing corn, bananas, and yucca to have something to eat when we are not able to sell coca." Some people believe the increased rice and corn cultivation is a demonstration of agricultural reactivation in San Martin. One of the most optimistic is Gonzalo Villavicencio, president of the San Martin Regional Government, who said: "Agriculture is in full reactivation because there is greater support by the government and a trend by peasants to get on the legal path." Many peasants have abandoned coca growing, but many more are willing to begin poppy growing because it is more profitable than traditional crops, the article concludes.
