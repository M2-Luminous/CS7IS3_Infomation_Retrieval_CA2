CEDLA asserts that eight out of 10 urban families do not have enough income to pay for their basic needs, according to research carried out in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. According to the study, 80.1 percent of the urban population are poor, of which 49.4 percent are destitute, while the percentage of non-destitute (those who earn enough to buy food, but not clothes or pay for housing or anything else) reached 30.5 percent. The CEDLA study, which was disseminated today by the JATHA news agency, states that "the neoliberal adjustment implemented by Bolivian governments since 1985 has worsened the unfair distribution of wealth, increased the concentration of income, and reduced the purchasing power of salaries and wages." During the last few years, workers in the largest cities extended their work week by four weekly hours, with low salaries, lower income, and less labor stability. The researchers said that not only has poverty increased, but the benefits to which a minority are entitled have been reduced as well. The report states that 15 percent of the working population obtained half the income generated by the Bolivian economy, while the remaining 85 percent of the working population got the other half. Bishop Edmundo Abastoflor, chairman of the Bolivian Bishops Conference, today warned of the serious social consequences that this gap between rich and poor, which increases daily, may bring. "It is shocking to see the squandering of money in the downtown areas of Bolivian cities, with luxury cars and millions' worth of construction work, while you can also see the deterioration in the standard of living of the poor classes," said the bishop, who is worried about the increase of poverty in the country. Abastoflor said that the poor must be helped with political and social measures so that they can improve their standards of living with dignity, as is appropriate for human beings.
