By 18:00 only 12 per cent of registered electors had turned up at polling stations. "The elections have been simply foiled and 200 million roubles thrown away," said Sergey Larionov, head of the managing department of the city mayor's office and member of the Regional Electoral Commission. He blamed poor results of elections not on a low turnout, but rather on those who scheduled the elections and who turned out to be totally devoid of an ability to forecast the situation. St. Petersburg - A little over 20 per cent of registered electors had turned up at polling stations of the Leningrad region. However, some constituencies and rural regions in particular, reported a good turnout which in some regions reached 28-30 per cent. The St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has ordered elections to the St. Petersburg city assembly to be extended until 22:00 p.m. Monday. The mayor issued this instruction at the request of representatives of electoral commissions concerned about a poor turnout in the polls, which might render the results of elections in St. Petersburg null and void. Orel - A turnout of 36.3 per cent had been reported by 17:30 p.m. in the Orel region, exceeding the minimum 25 per level necessary to consider the polls to be valid. Vologda - Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission of the Vologda region, Sergey Pervushin, told ITAR-TASS that by 18:00 p.m. Sunday the minimum 25 per cent barrier had been overcome in all rural districts and two constituencies of the regional centre. In the city of Cherepovets, only 17 per cent of registered electors took part in the polls and it is unlikely that the necessary 25 per cent turnout will be reached by the end of the polls, Pervushin said.
