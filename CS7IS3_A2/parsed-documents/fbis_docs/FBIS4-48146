In a statement on the present situation following the strike action by the police force, the minister addressed the business community in particular. He said he did so with great sadness that Lesotho once again experienced the present state of instability, when neighboring South Africa was taking part in the democratic process through which Lesotho had passed. Mr. Malie said the Government of Lesotho will make every effort to ensure an environment conducive to a free business and investment climate in the country. He said the Lesotho Government abhorred in the strongest terms the destruction of property and unwarranted intimidation that some business persons had endured without the usual protection they received from the police. The minister said the senseless damage and plundering of business properties which took place in the last few days had resulted in the loss of invaluable jobs for the people of Lesotho. Mr. Malie appealed to all the communities in the country to continue with the spirit of cooperation in the best interests of peace, stability, and the maintenance of law and order throughout the country.
