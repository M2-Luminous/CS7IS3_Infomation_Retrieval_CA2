The Gaucho Group is headed by Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul State]), the government's leader in the Senate. The Gaucho Group supports the candidacy of former Social Security Minister Antonio Britto in the upcoming presidential elections. The Quercia faction has been strengthened by former President Jose Sarney's announcement that he will stay in the PMDB. Harassed in the PMDB and believing he had lost Quercia's support, Sarney had tried to launch his candidacy for president through the PP [Popular Party], PFL [Liberal Front Party], PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], and even through the PL [Liberal Party], but he was not accepted by any of these parties. On 15 January, the Quercia and Sarney factions will resume their old alliance and will announce their intention of getting the PMDB to break with the government. This was announced during a luncheon at Sarney's home.
