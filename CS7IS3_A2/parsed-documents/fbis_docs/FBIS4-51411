The tasks high on the conference's agenda are to relay and implement the guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and ideological work and to study and work out plans, in close connection with Xinjiang's reality, on strengthening and improving propaganda and ideological work. The conference will study ways to exercise more effective party leadership over and improve propaganda and ideological work. Janabil, deputy secretary of the regional CPC Committee, presided over the conference. Entrusted by the regional party committee and Comrade Song Hanliang, Abulaiti Abudurexiti, deputy secretary of the regional CPC committee and chairman of the regional government, delivered a speech: "Implement the Guidelines of the National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work and Raise the Region's Propaganda and Ideological Work To a New Level." Abulaiti Abudurexiti's speech was divided into three parts: 1) further enhance our understanding of the importance and functions of propaganda and ideological work from an overall strategic viewpoint; 2) strive to accomplish the various tasks with regard to propaganda and ideological work in close adherence to the fundamental principles; and 3) exercise more effective party leadership over the propaganda and ideological work and improve the competence of the ranks of the cadres in charge of propaganda and ideological work. Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: The propaganda and ideological front is a very important front charged with the responsibility of providing motive force, ideological guarantees, and support through the creation of public opinion. At the national conference on propaganda and ideological work earlier this year, central leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji, delivered important speeches that stressed once again the great importance of reinforcing propaganda and ideological work in the new period. We must recognize the importance of propaganda and ideological work from the high plane of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the overall task of the party's work as a whole. Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: It is especially important and urgent for Xinjiang to step up propaganda and ideological work. Due to reasons both historical and contemporary, Xinjiang is relatively backward economically and culturally. Ideologically, the region is also relatively closed and outdated. Therefore, it is especially urgent -- and more difficult also -- for us to emancipate our minds, change our ideas, intensify reforms, and open up wider to the outside world. The propaganda and ideological front, therefore, must provide theoretical guidance and support in public opinion to reform efforts so that the principle, policy, and measures of reform will strike roots in the hearts of the people and that cadres and people of all nationalities will understand, support, and join the reform efforts to ensure smooth implementation of all reform undertakings. He said: Xinjiang is faced with a slew of difficulties and problems in the course of speeding up its economic development. This makes it even more necessary to make full use of propaganda and ideological work to help people get a correct understanding of Xinjiang's ongoing economic situation and its economic prospects. He pointed out: On balance, Xinjiang is stable socially and politically. Destabilizing factors, however, remain. Effective propaganda and ideological work is essential if we are to safeguard and maintain social stability and ensure lasting peace and stability. In his speech, Abulaiti Abudurexiti called on the region's propaganda and ideological front to adhere closely to the fundamental principle of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and pay close attention to the following tasks now and in the future: 1. make more conscientious efforts in educating the cadres and the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and use this theory to guide Xinjiang's work in all areas; 2. get a firmer grasp of public opinion, guide it in a proper way, and create good public opinion that serves Xinjiang's reform, opening up, and stability; 3. promote ideological education with patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and national unity at its core and foster good mental outlook and social conduct; 4. give greater emphasis to the central theme; help our cultural, art, and publishing undertakings flourish; and encourage the creation of more works with healthy content for people of all nationalities; and 5. carry out in-depth external propaganda, improve the region's external propaganda in terms of the breadth and depth, and make it serve reform, opening up, and economic construction. Speaking of exercising effective party leadership over propaganda and ideological work and reinforcing the ranks of propaganda and ideological cadres, Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Effective party leadership over propaganda and ideological work serves as a fundamental guarantee for the successful implementation of propaganda and ideological work. It also represents a new demand on party organizations at all levels in the new historical period. Party committees at all levels must place propaganda and ideological work high on their agenda, review it at regular intervals, and set priorities for different periods in a timely fashion. They should pay greater attention to helping and guiding propaganda departments focus on the key tasks and improve their work. Abulaiti Abudurexiti noted: Generally speaking, Xinjiang's contingent of propaganda and ideological workers are dependable politically and hardworking. The regional party committee has full confidence in this contingent and has always placed great hopes on it. Party committees and government at all levels must show concern for comrades on the propaganda and ideological front politically, ideologically, and in terms of material benefits. Propaganda and ideological cadres should continuously enhance their sense of honor and responsibility for their work, live up to the trust of the party and the people, and make constant new progress in their work. Leaders of the regional party committee, government, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, including Zhang Fusen, Keyum Bawudun, (Amina Apar), (Wufuer Abudula), Feng Dazhen, Sha Ming, and Ni Haomei, are attending the conference. Also present were officials in charge of propaganda and ideological work from the prefectures, cities, and counties; directors of propaganda departments from all over the region; and officials of the regional departments, commissions, offices, bureaus, and large state-owned enterprises in charge of propaganda work. Representatives to the regional conference on radio and television also attended the conference. (Li Kangning), head of the propaganda department of the regional party committee, relayed the guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and ideological work and other relevant meetings at this morning's session.
