FBIS4-65315 "drweu094_p_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 GREECE Geneva Meeting Hailed Geneva Meeting Hailed LD1405210894 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1904 GMT 14 May 94 LD1405210894 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Athens, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou agreed on Saturday [14 May] that the ministerial meeting on Bosnia held in Geneva on Friday was major step in the direction of a political settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The officials stressed as the most important that the whole negotiating process had been brought back to the framework of the European Union and its plan for Bosnia. President Lilic is on a one-day visit to Athens en route from South Africa where he attended the ceremony of inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium, Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month ceasefire, "with provision of extension," in which to open talks on a settlement of their disputes under the guidance of the recently formed contact group. The ministers coordinated a common strategy in the efforts for solving the Bosnian conflict, and approved the European Union's formula for Bosnia under which that war-wracked former Yugoslav republic should be divided in such a way as to give the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the territory in which to form their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 percent. Lilic and Papandreou stressed the need for an equal treatment of all sides to the conflict in order that a just final solution might be reached, and agreed on the necessity of abandoning the practice of pressure, ultimatums, intervention and imposition of patent solutions. They hoped that the resumption of Geneva talks would be dominated by reason on all sides in order that a peace [word indistinct] might be signed and the crisis resolved. The talk brought to light the view that the lifting of the UN Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), which were voted in place in May 1992 in retaliation for the country's alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, is a precondition for a peaceful settlement of the overall crisis in former Yugoslavia. Lilic expressed his dissatisfaction that the Geneva ministerial meeting had not taken the position that the sanctions should be lifted, but added that the reference to their phased easing was nonetheless a positive step and an improvement on the earlier attitude and threats of intensifying pressure on Yugoslavia. Lilic thanked Greece for its principled and firm position on the crisis in former Yugoslavia, particularly the problem of the sanctions. He expressed fear that Turkish and U.S. military influences in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and [word indistinct] might be a threat to the Balkan's and to Europe as a whole.
