The goal is to use half a percent of gross national income (GNI) for the purpose in 2002 -- probably around 6 billion kroner. Half of this will go directly to environmental efforts. Denmark has allocated more than 600 million kroner for global environmental aid in 1994 to meet its international commitments. The investment, which will be close to 3 billion kroner annually in 2002, is expected to set an example for other donor nations. Denmark's global scrub brush will pick up speed in the years ahead. And it will go to work in East and Central Europe, Southeast Asia, southern Africa, the Arctic region, and many other places around the world. The government's recent approval of a long-term environmental strategy from the Environment Ministry and the Foreign Ministry makes it possible to move fairly quickly to follow up the statements from the environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the meeting of European environment ministers in Lucerne last year with massive economic action. The money will be taken primarily from the environmental and catastrophe aid fund that a Folketing majority decided to set up on 18 December 1992 to strengthen our efforts with respect to international environmental problems. The environmental part of the fund involves 500 million kroner this year and will increase by 200 million kroner a year until 1998. The goal is to provide a total of 0.5 percent of national income by the year 2002, around 6 billion kroner, half of which will go to the environment. In addition the Foreign Ministry will channel a nine-digit sum annually, 145 million kroner this year, primarily to UN organizations where the money, along with the contributions from other countries, will be used for environmental projects. For the first few years the Foreign Ministry will also finance distinctly environmental projects in the poorest selected countries in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, through its general development aid. But later on, in 1996, these countries will also come under the fund. Unique This joint long-term strategy means that Denmark is the first donor nation in the world to put its international environmental aid in a fixed framework. "The environmental and catastrophe fund is unique on the international level and I definitely think it will set an example for like-minded donors in the UN circle, i.e., countries like Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States, and perhaps Germany as well," said Leo Larsen, assistant administrative director of the Environment Agency. He is head of the department of the Environment Agency that takes care of environmental aid, which is currently in the process of being expanded. The department will have almost 30 employees. The four individual parts of the environmental strategy designate the countries and their environmental problems that the Danes feel especially qualified to tackle. Also with reference to the sale of Danish environmental technology and know-how and thus more jobs and additional technological advances in this country. From Europe to Asia More than half the money will be used close to home: in the three Baltic countries, Poland, and the heavily polluted and polluting Russian areas around Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg. In addition, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary also have a high priority. A somewhat smaller nine-digit sum will go to Thailand and Malaysia in Southeast Asia where, as mentioned above, the Foreign Ministry will initially support the neighboring countries through development aid. The special developing countries department is also considering aid for countries in southern Africa, but so far no recipients have been designated. "This is mainly because we were working so hard to formulate a program for Southeast Asia that there was no time for anything else. And plans for Africa will not be relevant this year. At most there will be some preliminary soundings," Larsen said. The reason why the Environment Agency specifically chose the five developing countries in Southeast Asia is that it was seeking a single contiguous region and that emphasis was placed on going into a growth area. Thailand and Malaysia are experiencing rapid economic development. It appears that Vietnam will follow suit within a fairly short time and the countries' purchasing power in the commercial environmental market obviously played a part in the selection. "It is clear that environmental considerations are the most important for all this. But it is also obvious that we are drawing on the vast Danish knowledge in this context. Therefore the selection also reflected the fact that the Danish state and its business sector are telling these countries: `This is what we can offer. What do you need?' Where these two things coincide, things happen. And I think this is quite legitimate," Larsen said. He foresees that Danish businesses can participate in about half of the fund's environmental aid in the form of supplying environmental technology and knowledge. But an investment must be made, among other things, through product development. "There are big perspectives for the Danish environmental industry in the countries of Southeast Asia. With all respect for our funding, the countries' own investments in combating pollution are enormous in relation to the small amount of aid they receive. I would guess that they receive less than 10 percent from outside sources, the rest they pay themselves," said Larsen. Apropos money and industry, the world market for environmental technology is big and growing. In 1990 it amounted to a good 1.2 trillion kroner and will rise to an estimated 2 trillion kroner by the year 2000. To the Poorest The environmental strategy designates four investment areas in Southeast Asia, namely cities, forests, coastal zones, and the protection of biological diversity, i.e., animals, plants, habitats, ecosystems, and genetic variation. At the same time an effort will be made to provide the aid to the poorest areas of the country and the poorest sections of the cities because there is a clear connection between their pollution, health, and poverty problems. And just as in the eastern nations, conservation will be given its "natural" place because Denmark has a lot of experience with sustainable management and protection of nature preserves. Environmental aid for the Arctic region also comes under the developing countries section, with the emphasis on Greenland. Especially monitoring and conducting research into ocean and air pollution, climatic changes, and the thinning of the ozone layer. But part of the aid will probably be used to help Russia monitor its long coastal stretches along the enormous ocean areas. "It is necessary to give the Russians some kind of assistance in providing environmental data from their region for otherwise the picture we get of the total stress on the ocean will be incomplete. At present we have no clear impression of how much pollution, including radioactive pollution, they have there," Larsen said. Environmentally Correct As mentioned above the Foreign Ministry is in charge of the fourth part of the joint strategy, namely multilateral aid. Environment Ambassador Erik Fiil, who heads the ministry's environment secretariat, expects that the largest amount will be given to the so-called global environmental facility (GEF). This is controlled by the World Bank and the two UN organizations for the environment and development, the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and the UN Development Program (UNDP). The ministry has just started a biogas project in Tanzania in cooperation with the GEF, which has been selected as the financial mechanism for the Rio summit's four main areas: climatic changes (with the climate convention that goes into effect on 21 March), biological diversity, ocean pollution, and the depletion of the ozone layer. Forest and desert projects may also be considered. In addition, multilateral Danish environmental aid will continue to go directly to UNEP, UNDP, and a number of international environmental organizations, including private ones, for example the World Wildlife Fund and Nepenthes, the rain forest group. Incidentally, the Foreign Ministry's environment secretariat was set up last September to follow up on the Rio summit's principle that environmental protection should form an integral part of development policy, among other things. "Thus it is also our task to constantly remind our colleagues in DANIDA [Danish International Development Authority] that their development projects must also be environmentally correct, so that all our international aid will now hang together," said Erik Fiil. [Box, p 7] - Air pollution: Combating local and multicountry air pollution in the East European nations and in the cities of Southeast Asia through support for increasing efficiency and purifying heat and energy production, promoting alternative energy sources, and improving mass transit. - Ocean pollution: Support for treating waste water from industries and cities in East Europe, which will benefit the Baltic Sea. In Southeast Asian cities it will benefit the important ocean areas along the coast, which function among other things as a development area for young fish. Agricultural advice on fertilization to reduce the nutrient load in oceans, for example the Baltic Sea. - Nuclear power plants: The goal is to continue to improve safety, especially at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania and at Sosnovy Bor near St. Petersburg (both of the Chernobyl type) through aid for improving control systems, fire protection, and communications. The aim is to make the plants superfluous through aiding other energy sources. - Ozone layer/greenhouse effect: Aid to Greenland under the Arctic program for compliance with international conventions. Aid for reducing CO[.sub]2[/] emissions and the use of substances that destroy the ozone layer in East European countries, for example, through improving energy efficiency, making traffic more environmentally friendly and phasing out the harmful substances. - Hazardous waste: Aid for limiting and eliminating hazardous waste from industries in the East European countries and in Southeast Asia, for improving local household waste systems, and for the environmentally correct location and establishment of incinerators and recycling plants. - Environmental technology: Environmental efforts include the transfer of (Danish) environmental technology to recipient countries -- which will also benefit employment and the further development of environmental knowledge and technology in Denmark. Danish firms, authorities, and institutes have a great deal of knowledge in the key areas of handling waste, water treatment plants, protecting ground water, cleaning smoke, and combating ocean pollution. - Conservation: Aid for preserving the large untouched natural areas that still exist in East Europe -- in spite of everything -- along with their animal and plant life by expanding preserves and restoring and including consideration for nature in agricultural and forestry methods. In Southeast Asia aid for regenerating forests and preserving biological diversity, among other things. Aid to safeguard the delicate ecological balance in the Arctic. - Environmental training: Support for developing environmental and conservation regulations, the training and education of personnel, and building up both central and local environmental and nature authorities. Providing advice on regulation in the environmental area via both rules and taxes. Support for improved supervision of the environment and nature.
