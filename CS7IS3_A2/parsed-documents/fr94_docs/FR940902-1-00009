FR940902-1-00009 FR940902-1-00002 Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise removed from service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of property installed must be shown on construction work orders. To ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is as accurate as possible, an effort should be made to accurately accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme care has been exercised, however, it may still be necessary to use estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures. When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above construction and retirement costs represent maintenance expense. Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines, straightening poles, and replacing minor items of property. When extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to an operating condition without delay usually results in excessive costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a guide in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are used, all excess costs are charged to maintenance expense. Because of the storm's destruction, property is retired prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses occur. When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the year in which the losses are incurred. If the recording of such losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may be charged to Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may defer certain costs, provided such costs are included in the utility's rate base and recovered through future rates. If an REA borrower elects to apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, REA approval is required. To obtain REA approval, a borrower must submit: a. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the deferred costs through future rates, or in the absence of commission jurisdiction, a resolution from the cooperative's board of directors authorizing such recovery; and b. A statement from the borrower's certified public accountant (CPA) or CPA firm indicating that the deferral and amortization of these costs is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal government often provides assistance through FEMA. Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the restoration of facilities based upon the cost estimates submitted by the entity requesting assistance. If the FEMA grant is for less than 100 percent of the cost estimates, FEMA does not specify which costs are to be reimbursed. When the funds are received, therefore, they should be accounted for by crediting construction, retirement, and maintenance expense in direct proportion to the total costs incurred. For example, if total storm damage costs are $1,000,000 with $500,000 incurred for maintenance, $300,000 for retirement, and $200,000 for construction, the FEMA reimbursement should be accounted for by applying 50 percent of the funds received as a credit to maintenance expense, 30 percent as a credit to retirement costs, and 20 percent as a credit to construction.
