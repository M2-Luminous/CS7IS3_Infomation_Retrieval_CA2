FR941013-1-00035 FR941013-1-00005 (b) Any hearing under this part shall be independent of, and not in lieu of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings under the Act or any other law of the United States. §1309.52 Purpose of hearing. If requested by a person entitled to a hearing, the Administrator shall hold a hearing for the purpose of receiving factual evidence regarding the issues involved in the denial, revocation, or suspension of any registration. Extensive argument should not be offered into evidence but rather presented in opening or closing statements of counsel or in memoranda or proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. §1309.53 Waiver or modification of rules. The Administrator or the presiding officer (with respect to matters pending before him) may modify or waive any rule in this party by notice in advance of the hearing, if he determines that no party in the hearing will be unduly prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be served. Such notice of modification or waiver shall be made a part of the record of the hearing. §1309.54 Request for hearing or appearance; waiver. (a) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to §§1309.42 and 1309.43 and desiring a hearing shall, within 30 days after the date of receipt of the order to show cause, file with the Administrator a written request for a hearing in the form prescribed in Section 1316.47 of this chapter. (b) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to §§1309.42 and 1309.43, within the period permitted for filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing, together with a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact and law involved in such hearing. Such statement, if admissible, shall be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the lack of opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to be attached to matters of fact asserted therein. (c) If any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to §§1309.42 and 1309.43 fails to file a request for a hearing, or if he so files and fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived his opportunity for the hearing, unless he shows good cause for such failure. (d) If any person entitled to a hearing waives or is deemed to waive his or her opportunity for the hearing, the Administrator may cancel the hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final order pursuant to §1309.57 without a hearing. §1309.55 Burden of proof. (a) At any hearing for the denial of a registration, the Administrator shall have the burden of proving that the requirements for such registration pursuant to section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) are not satisfied. (b) At any hearing for the revocation or suspension of a registration, the Administrator shall have the burden of proving that the requirements for such revocation or suspension pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) are satisfied. §1309.56 Time and place of hearing. The hearing will commence at the place and time designated in the order to show cause or notice of hearing published in the Federal Register (unless expedited pursuant to §1309.44(c)) but thereafter it may be moved to a different place and may be continued from day to day or recessed to a later day without notice other than announcement thereof by the presiding officer at the hearing. §1309.57 Final order. As soon as practicable after the presiding officer has certified the record to the Administrator, the Administrator shall cause to be published in the Federal Register his final order in the proceeding, which shall set forth the final rule and the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the rule is based. This order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect, which date shall not be less than 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register unless the Administrator finds that the public interest in the matter necessitates an earlier effective date, in which case the Administrator shall specify in the order his findings as to the conditions which led him to conclude that an earlier effective date was required. Modification, Transfer and Termination of Registration §1309.61 Modification in registration. Any registrant may apply to modify his or her registration to authorize the handling of additional List I chemicals or to change his or her name or address, by submitting a letter of request to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chemical Registration/ODC, Post Office Box 2427, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;2427. The letter shall contain the registrant's name, address, and registration number as printed on the certificate of registration, and the List I chemicals to be added to his registration or the new name or address and shall be signed in accordance with §1309.32(g). No fee shall be required to be paid for the modification. The request for modification shall be handled in the same manner as an application for registration. If the modification in registration is approved, the Administrator shall issue a new certificate of registration (DEA Form 511) to the registrant, who shall maintain it with the old certificate of registration until expiration. §1309.62 Termination of registration. The registration of any person shall terminate if and when such person dies, ceases legal existence, or discontinues business or professional practice. Any registrant who ceases legal existence or discontinues business or professional practice shall notify the Administrator promptly of such fact. §1309.63 Transfer of registration. No registration or any authority conferred thereby shall be assigned or otherwise transferred except upon such conditions as the Administrator may specifically designate and then only pursuant to his written consent. Security Requirements §1309.71 General security requirements. (a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of List I chemicals. Specific attention shall be paid to storage of and controlling access to List I chemicals as follows: (1) Chemicals shall be stored in containers sealed in such a manner as to indicate any attempts at tampering with the container. Where chemicals cannot be stored in sealed containers, access to the chemicals should be controlled through physical means or through human or electronic monitoring. (2) In retail settings open to the public where drugs containing List I chemicals that are regulated pursuant to §1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter are distributed, such drugs will be stocked behind a counter where only employees have access. (b) In evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and procedures, the Administrator shall consider the following factors: (1) The type, form, and quantity of List I chemicals handled; (2) The location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on the security needs; (3) The type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or buildings; (4) The availability of electric detection and alarm systems; (5) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility; (6) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to List I chemicals; (7) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel in areas where List I chemicals are processed or stored; (8) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's systems for monitoring the receipt, distribution, and disposition of List I chemicals in its operations.
