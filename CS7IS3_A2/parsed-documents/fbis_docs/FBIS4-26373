He said that the key to improvement in Sino-British ties lies in Britain's attitude and action. Zheng urged the British side to give up its policy of confrontation with China and effect a fundamental change in its policy. The Association of New Territories Mass Organizations held a gathering yesterday to mark the ninth anniversary of its founding and to congratulate its members being elected as deputies of National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the Preliminary Working Committee, Hong Kong affairs advisers, deputies to the Guangdong People's Congress, members of the Guangdong CPPCC, and Hong Kong district affairs advisers. In response to a question by a reporter at the gathering, Zheng Guoxiong said that everybody is concerned about recent Sino-British relations. While meeting with state leaders in Beijing, the same question was raised by members of delegations from the Hong Kong Federation of Industry and the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce. In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng said, China and Britain should cooperate in resolving major issues related to Hong Kong's transition because this will benefit Hong Kong's smooth transition. This is also the consistent stand and position of the Chinese Government. The British Government had changed its policy toward China at the previous stage, made a mistaken evaluation of the situation, and pursued a policy of confrontation with China, which produced a negative impact on Sino-British cooperation, Zheng stated. Now the key to resumption of Sino-British cooperation lies in Britain's attitude and action, Zheng continued, and the Chinese Government hopes that the British side will give up its policy of confrontation and will effect a fundamental change in its policy. Zheng stressed that because of the unilateral action taken by Patten, it has been impossible for China and Britain to cooperate in the political system. Proceeding from the fundamental and long-term interests of the Hong Kong residents and for the sake of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, however, the Chinese Government still hopes to cooperate with the British side in terms of economy, people's livelihood, and other fields. This is also the consistent spirit of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government's proposal to increase openness in information access involved a major change in government operations and did not conform with the relevant spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng Guoxiong stated. As the British Hong Kong government did not consult the Chinese side in advance, it is unacceptable to the Chinese side. Zheng also refuted the so-called statement that this was Hong Kong's internal affair. He said that the move involved the transition to 1997 and exerted an influence on current, as well as future operations. Therefore, the Chinese side must be consulted. Otherwise, the Chinese Government will not undertake any responsibility. Neither will the future government of the special administrative region undertake any responsibility.
