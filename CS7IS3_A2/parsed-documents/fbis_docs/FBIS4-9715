FBIS4-9715 "drlat063_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Roundup of Electoral Developments Roundup of Electoral Developments PA3103212194 PA3103212194 BFN [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of reports on developments related to El Salvador's run-off elections scheduled for 24 April 1994. Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Democratic Convergence coalition, said at the Presidente Hotel on 29 March that, if the presidential run-off elections are to be held on 24 April, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] must correct all of the mistakes made on 20 March to make the process legitimate. Zamora said: "As the coalition's presidential candidate, my position is that it is necessary, even essential, to make changes in the electoral process in order that it makes sense to hold the second round." Zamora decried the irregularities that took place on 20 March, which, he said, prevented thousands of Salvadorans from voting. He and his coalition have presented a list of 11 things to the TSE that need to be changed in the second round. He regretted that so far the TSE has failed to respond. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 29 Mar 94) On 29 March, Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, accused the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] of delaying the final vote count for the 20 March elections. He attributed the FMLN's slowness to its lack of electoral experience and asked the party to step up the final count. Calderon Sol said: "I am hereby expressing my dissatisfaction over the slowness with which members of the FMLN are conducting the final vote count. I know they lack experience and I know this is their first election following their recent induction into the Salvadoran political and democratic process. This does not mean, however, that they should have doubts and lack the resolve to abide by the law." (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 29 Mar 94)
