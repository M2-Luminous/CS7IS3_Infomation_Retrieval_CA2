FR941122-2-00104 FR941122-2-00078 2. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Class A shares under the plan, existing Class B shares will stop converting into Class A unless the Class B shareholders, voting separately by a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class B shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Class A''), identical in all material respects to Class A as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Class A. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Class B shares for a new class (``New Class B''), identical to existing Class B shares in all material respects except that New Class B will convert into New Class A. New Class A or New Class B may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Directors/Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Class A or New Class B shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Class B shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Class A shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Class A plan and the relationship of such plan to the Class B shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 3. The Directors/Trustee of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Distribution System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Distribution System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Directors/Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Distribution System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders. 4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the four classes of shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Adviser and Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees. It a conflict arises, Adviser and Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing one or more new registered management investment companies. 5. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
