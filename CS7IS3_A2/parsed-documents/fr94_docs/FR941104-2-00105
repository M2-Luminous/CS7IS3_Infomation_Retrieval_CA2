FR941104-2-00105 FR941104-2-00064 [Release No. 34&hyph;34912; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;50] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Excess Spread Parameters for CQS Securities October 28, 1994. On September 9, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b4&hyph;4 thereunder. 2 The rule change amends Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to provide that the calculation methodology used to determine the excess spread parameters for CQS securities shall include quotations from national securities exchanges. In addition, to avoid confusion concerning the application of the excess spread parameters to CQS securities, the NASD is moving the excess spread parameters for CQS securities, as amended by this filing, to Section 2 of Part VI of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws 3 from Section 2 of Part V of Schedule D. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 NASD Manual, Schedules to the By-Laws, Schedule D, Part V, Sec. 2(d) (CCH) ¶ 1818. 4 Id. , Schedules to the By-Laws, Schedule D, Part VI, Sec. 2(c) (CCH) ¶ 1829. Notice of the proposed rule change together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release and by publication in the Federal Register . 5 No comments were received in response to the Commission release. This order approves the proposed rule change. 5 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34682 (Sept. 19, 1994), 59 FR 48920 (Sept. 23, 1994). Currently, Section 2(d) of Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws provides that registered market makers in CQS securities may not enter quotations in CQS securities that exceed the NASD's parameters for maximum allowable spreads. The maximum allowable spread presently is 125 percent of the average of the three narrowest market maker spreads in each security, with the limitation that the maximum allowable spread can never be less than 1/4 of a point. 6 6 If there are fewer than three market makers in a security, the maximum allowable spread is 125% of the average of all market makers' spreads in the security. The calculation of ``average dealer spreads'' in CQS securities, however, does not include quotations ( i.e. , spreads) from national securities exchanges trading those securities. Accordingly, to have the excess spread parameters for CQS securities be more reflective of and related to the quotations disseminated by all market centers trading CQS securities, the NASD proposed to include quotations from the exchanges into its ``average dealers spread'' calculation. As a result, to the extent that the spread reflected in the best bid and offer disseminated by an exchange(s) is narrower than any of the three narrowest spreads quoted by CQS market makers, the proposed rule change may contribute narrower spreads by CQS market makers. Narrower spreads by CQS market makers, in turn, will enhance the continuity and quality of the markets provided by CQS market makers, to the ultimate benefit of investors. In addition, to avoid confusion concerning the application of the excess spread parameters to CQS securities, the NASD is proposing to move the excess spread parameters for CQS securities, as amended, to Section 2 of Part VI of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws from Section 2 of Part V of Schedule D. Part V of Schedule D imposes obligations on all Nasdaq market makers and Part VI pertains to trading of CQS securities on Nasdaq. By placing the excess spread parameters for CQS securities in Part VI of Schedule D instead of Part V. CQS market makers will be less likely to overlook the parameters. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act and, therefore, has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principle of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(11) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations. By including exchange quotations in the calculation for determining maximum allowable spreads in CQS securities, the excess spread parameter may contribute to narrower spreads in CQS securities, which, in turn, will promote the efficiency, continuity, and quality of Nasdaq's market in CQS securities. In addition, more stringent excess spread parameters will compel market makers to maintain quotes that are reasonably related to the prevailing market, reinforcing their obligations to make continuous markets. For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act. In the instances where the spread reflected in the best bid and offer disseminated by an exchange(s) is narrower than any of the three narrowest spreads quoted by CQS market makers, this rule change may contribute narrower spreads by CQS market makers. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;50 be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
