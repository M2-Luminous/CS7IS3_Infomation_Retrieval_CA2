The ambassador made his remarks during a meeting with Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon. Although the treaty stipulates that U.S. companies are entitled to equal treatment with their Thai counterparts here, the treaty does not say that Thailand must open its insurance market for the United States. Thai Governments, past and present, have tried all ways and means, e.g. passage of the copyright law, to have Thailand's name erased from the U.S. Priority Foreign Country watch list (PFC). But the United States still keeps Thailand on the (PWL) [Priority Watch List] list of countries on which it must keep close watch. Thailand, however, is ready to give permission to Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in the country in exchange for its removal from the U.S. trade watch list. The commerce minister has the authority to give permission to Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in Thailand without consulting the Judicial Council if he deems his decision benefits the country. The Commerce Ministry, however, has forwarded the issue to the Judicial Council for fear of making a mistake in interpreting the law, not because it wants to delay the issue as accused by the U.S. side. Chaloemphon said after the insurance market is opened for Phaisan Insurance Company, it is hoped that the United States will not make such a request for other U.S. insurance companies because the treaty provisions only deal with specific cases. The interpretation of the treaty in this case does not set the criteria for general practice. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his capacity as chairman of the International Economic Committee, is expected to call a meeting of the committee in February to appoint a working team comprised of officials from the agencies concerned namely the Finance, Commerce, Industry, and Foreign Ministries to review the treaty and decide whether it should be amended or abrogated.
