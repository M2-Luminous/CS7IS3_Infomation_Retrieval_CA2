FR940527-1-00184 FR940527-1-00014 E. Transfer Changes (Column 4) In column 4 of Table I, the impacts of the changes we are proposing in transfer payment policy are shown. These changes would revise our methodology for payment for transfer cases under the prospective payment system to more appropriately compensate transferring hospitals for the higher costs they incur, on average, on the first day of a hospital stay prior to transfer. Our current transfer policy pays a flat per diem amount for each day prior to transfer up to the full DRG amount. The per diem is calculated by dividing the amount that would be paid for a patient assigned to the same DRG who is discharged from the hospital, and dividing that amount by the geometric mean length of stay for that DRG. Our proposal is to replace this flat per diem methodology with a graduated methodology that would pay twice the per diem amount for the first day, and the per diem amount for each day beyond the first. In addition, we are proposing to expand our definition of transfer cases to include patients transferred from a hospital or unit paid under the prospective payment system to a hospital or unit excluded from the prospective payment system. Currently, these case are considered to be discharges. Under this proposed change, these cases would be paid in accordance with our transfer policy, including the proposed change to the graduated payment methodology described above. The payment impacts shown in column 4 illustrate the combined effects of these two changes, relative to the baseline simulation based on current policy (a flat per diem transfer payment methodology and cases transferred to excluded hospitals and units are paid as discharges). In order to simulate the effects of the proposed changes, it was necessary to identify current transfer cases, as well as current discharges going to an excluded hospital or unit. Current transfers are identifiable by the discharge destination code on the patient bill (see ``Transfers of Medicare Hospital Patients Under the Prospective Payment System'', RAND, PM&hyph;191&hyph;HCFA, January 1994, for a thorough discussion of identifying transfer cases on the MedPAR file). Next, to determine whether payment would be made under the per diem methodology, we compared the actual length of stay prior to transfer to the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG to which the case is assigned. A full discharge or a transfer case that received the full discharge payment would be counted as 1.0, while, under our current transfer policy, a transfer case that stayed 2 days in a DRG with a geometric mean length of stay of 5 days would count as 0.4 of a discharge. To determine the transfer adjustment factor, we then added together these adjusted discharges and divided by total discharges, including transfers. In this manner, transfer cases are counted only to the extent that the transferring hospital received payment for them. To simulate our proposed change to the per diem payment methodology, we added 1 day to the actual length of stay for transfer cases, thereby replicating paying double the per diem for the first stay and the flat per diem, up to the full DRG amount, for subsequent days. Finally, we calculated transfer-adjusted case-mix indexes for each hospital. The adjusted case-mix indexes are calculated by summing the transfer-adjusted DRG weights and dividing by the transfer-adjusted number of cases. The transfer-adjusted DRG weights are calculated by multiplying the DRG weight by the lesser of 1 or the fraction of the length of stay for the case divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG. By adjusting the DRG weights, nontransfer cases and transfer cases that have a length of stay at least as long as the geometric mean length of stay will be represented by the full DRG weight, while transfer cases with lengths of stay below the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG will be represented by a lower number, reflective of their payment. The FY 1995 baseline model reflected in columns 1 through 3 incorporates transfer-adjusted discharges and case-mix indexes based on current law. That is, cases transferred prior to reaching the geometric mean length of stay received payments based on the flat per diem and cases discharged to excluded hospitals and units received the full DRG amount. In column 4, our model substitutes transfer-adjusted discharges and case-mix indexes that reflect our proposed policy changes. The first row in column 4 shows that the net effect of our proposed changes is budget neutral compared to total payments under current transfer policy. RAND estimated the number of transfers under the prospective payment system during FY 1991 to be about 230,000. Our analysis indicates that, applying current policy, the number of cases during FY 1993 counted as discharges to excluded hospitals or units is approximately 190,000. Our preliminary analysis indicates that these latter cases are more likely to be surgical cases, and thus are more expensive on average than cases that are currently defined as transfers. Thus, redefining discharges to excluded hospitals as transfers and paying them accordingly generates savings sufficient to offset the higher per diem payments for the first day of all transfer cases.
