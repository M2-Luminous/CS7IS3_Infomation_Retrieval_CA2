FBIS3-22544 "jptep006___94012" JPRS-TEP-94-006 Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Epidemiology 7 March 1994 EAST ASIA INDONESIA AIDS Statistics, Programs Reported AIDS Cases Increase in Bali 94WD0150B Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 3 Dec 93 p 8 94WD0150B Jakarta KOMPAS Language: Indonesian Article Type:CSO [Text] Den Pasar, KOMPAS -- During the past two months the total number of persons suffering from AIDS in Bali has increased by two, from 23 as of 15 September to 25 as of 30 November. Meanwhile, the total number of persons suffering from AIDS on a national basis has risen to 185 individuals in 12 provinces, since the first HIV case was discovered in West Kalimantan Province. Dr. Tuti Parwati Merati, chairperson of the AIDS Working and Research Group at the Faculty of Medicine of Udayana University in Den Pasar, is treating a person in Den Pasar who has recently been discovered to be infected with the HIV virus. The person concerned came directly to her clinic and asked for a blood test. Later, after "Elisa" and "Western Blot" tests were performed, it was learned that the person concerned was infected with the HIV virus. The person concerned, who is in the tourism business and is 26 years old, had himself tested because he became aware that his behavior involved the risk of infection. Doctor Tuti said on 2 December: "The person concerned took the initiative to have himself examined after obtaining information through the mass media. Later on, he came to my clinic to ask for a blood test. It turned out that he was HIV-positive." Positive Regarding the participation of a number of groups, including ulama [Muslim religious teachers], businessmen, and officials from a number of government services, in programs concerned with handling AIDS, such as the seminar held in Jakarta on the commemoration of World AIDS Day on 1 December, Doctor Tuti thought that this was a positive sign. This is because this disease is not just the responsibility of the Department of Health. Neither is it possible for the matter to be resolved through the media alone, because there is a close connection with sexual behavior. According to Dr. Tuti Parwati, who is also chairperson of the Indonesian Business Image Foundation [YCUI] and is active in the field of handling AIDS, the involvement of businessmen in this area is very much needed. For example, in helping to provide funds to support community information activity. The same thing is true with businessmen in the tourism field in particular. They can provide warnings of the danger of AIDS to their hotel guests. A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Gde Muninjaya, MPH [master's degree in public health], chairman of the Epidemiological Research and Training Unit of Udayana University. He said, for example, that the involvement of the Department of Manpower in handling AIDS is intended, among other things, to provide security and protection to workers known to be infected with the AIDS virus. Those who suffer from AIDS can be protected from being dismissed from their jobs or from being quarantined. Doctor Muninjaya said: "As long as those suffering from AIDS are not quarantined, as happens in Western countries, we must take action quickly to protect them." Regarding activities to celebrate World AIDS Day in 1993, Dr. Tuti Parwati said that, in cooperation with a number of senior high schools and the Student Senate of the Faculty of Medicine at Udayana University, the YCUI sponsored the "World AIDS Day Walkathon" at the end of November 1993. After that a discussion was held with students at senior high schools concerning the danger of AIDS and related problems facing us. According to Doctor Tuti, the AIDS problem cannot be handled by only one or two events each year. Rather, it must be handled on a continuing basis. The information efforts undertaken by the YCUI up to the present have included the formation of discussion groups, at which persons suffering from AIDS talk about their feelings and the problems which they face. One of them, who has previously been provided with a variety of information, acts as the chairman of the meeting. Doctor Tuti said that the attitude of persons suffering from AIDS who have received this training has been very positive.
