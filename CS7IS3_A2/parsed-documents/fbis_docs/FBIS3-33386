I did what I could for the country; I have no further comments to make. These are the words he used while addressing the press. [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] At least one chance must be given to the discussions I started while I was out of the country. We must give these discussions a chance to succeed. We are going to continue to work not only to find the ideal solution to get the country out of the crisis but.... This is all I have to say, I will no longer answer questions. [Unidentified journalist] You said at the beginning that.... [Unidentified journalist, interrupting] What was the subject of the discussions you held in Washington? [Sansaricq] I have no more comments to make; I have no further comments. [passage omitted] [Journalist] ...the country has the right to know what its president went to do in the United States. [Sansaricq] Listen, I was off on a trip to the United States. I did what I could for the country. We have to wait for the results. [Journalist] What did you do exactly, Senator? [Sansaricq] I cannot answer questions. The first secretary [of the Senate office, Sen. Ebrane Cadet] is there; he heard my briefing [last word in English] on the results of my trip on 20 February. He can answer the questions. It is a team effort. [passage omitted] [end recording] Sen. Cadet did not provide precise information on the question and contented himself with stating that the country would experience some surprises within fewer than 24 hours. Rony Mondestin says he is amazed at the label, intransigent, attributed to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This label would be more suitable for General Raoul Cedras, according to the senator of the North. Meanwhile, Dejean Belizaire thinks the Governors Island agreement is outdated. Sen. Belizaire asks the Haitian head of state to fill the political vacuum. The following is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "Sen. Mondestin asserted that he does not have many problems with the plan being discussed in Washington but he has reservations as to the sequence of this plan. Like the president of the country, Gen. Roul Cedras should resign from the Army before the head of state appoints a new head of government. [sentence as heard] [passage omitted] ``Dejean Belizaire, the president of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, has a different opinion than that of Sen. Mondestin. Belizaire thinks the president of the country should agree to the plan proposed to him and appoint a new head of government as soon as possible. Contrary to Sen. Mondestin, Belizaire says he opposes Gen. Cedras' resignation from the Haitian Army:'' [Belizaire] "If I had agreed with the departure of the general, I would have already asked for that. I know very well that the Governors Island agreement is something that has already been exhausted. We are no longer within the scope of the Governors Island agreement. But I believe that today an action must be taken. That action is that President Aristide is supposed to appoint a prime minister. Let him appoint his prime minister. Then, after the government is established, we will see how we will settle the other questions." [Valet] "Unlike Bernard Sansaricq, the other Senate president, that is, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the other quaestor, namely Julio Larosiliere, have not yet entered Port-au-Prince. ``We can inform you that Robert Malval's resigning government has refused to acknowledge both the signature and the authority of the office headed by Sen. Sansaricq.'' [end recording]
