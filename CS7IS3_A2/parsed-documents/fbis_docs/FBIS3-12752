During the meeting, the labor minister delivered a statement urging the ILO to implement the decisions made by the international labor conferences in 1974 and 1980. These decisions call for extending all forms of aid to the Palestinian people and their labor forces in order to support their steadfastness on their land. [passage omitted] Minister al-Ghizawi noted the inhumane policy that Israel is pursuing in the occupied Arab territories. He said: We in Jordan only recognize the sovereignty of God Almighty over the Islamic holy places. He also pointed to Israel's policy, which aims to Judaize Jerusalem, and, consequently, complete the greater Jerusalem project. The minister added that Jordan condemns and vehemently denounces all forms of Judaization, and urges the international bodies to intervene in order to protect the mosques and churches, so that they will be outside the framework of the bloody conflict. He said that Jordan also demands a halt to the building of Israeli settlements, the disarming of the settlers, and a total transfer of the settlers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
