At the same time, at a news conference in Jerusalem this morning, the organization criticized Israel's deliberate recruitment of collaborators. Details from reporter Mark Weiss: At almost every Betzelem news conference over the years, the organization has been accused of avoiding the issue of collaborator killings while concentrating exclusively on human rights abuses committed by the Israeli authorities. Yuval Ginbar from Betzelem denies the accusation. [passage omitted] Between 750 and 950 Palestinians suspected of collaboration have been killed since the start of the intifadah, many after suffering severe torture. Both Israeli and Palestinian sources estimate that more that half of the Palestinians killed as collaborators did not in fact work for the authorities. According to a sample investigation conducted by Betzelem, many of those called collaborators had committed so-called social or criminal offenses, such as drug-trafficking or homosexuality. Many suspected collaborators were killed without any prior interrogation or judicial proceeding. Betzelem considers the Palestinian political organizations, whose activists torture and kill, as responsible for these gross violations of human rights, along with the perpetrators themselves. The organization calls on the Palestinian political organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and killing of suspected collaborators, to sever all financial and organizational ties to groups that commit such acts, and to place suspected perpetrators on trial. Betzelem also criticizes the Israeli Government for flaunting international law, for what it terms the exploitation and extortion tactics employed to recruit collaborators. The recruitment of agents from the occupied territories by these methods is prohibited under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Betzelem calls on the Israeli Government to end the recruitment of collaborators, to stop using collaborators in illegal actions such as violent interrogations, and to enforce the law equally against collaborators who use violence or commit other criminal acts.
