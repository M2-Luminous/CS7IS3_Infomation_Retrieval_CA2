Effective May 16, foreigners will no longer be required to pay a levy to commercial banks for holding their ringgit funds -- a term referred to as "negative interest" in the banking circle. These funds held in vostro accounts (non-interest bearing ringgit funds held by foreigners in local banks) will no longer be subjected to statutory reserve and liquidity requirements. To moderate the effect of the lifting of this negative interest measure, Bank Negara will mop up additional liquidity by raising the statutory reserve ratio (SRR) from 9.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent effective Monday. The SRR is the amount of funds based on a percentage of eligible liabilities or reserve assets that commercial and merchant banks and finance companies need to place with the Central Bank. These two measures will likely result in a return of foreign funds into the local financial system and help shore up the strength of the ringgit. Ahmad said in a statement that these measures were consistent with the Central Bank's overall strategy of creating a conducive environment for genuine investors as well as maintaining price stability. "Bank Negara will continue to monitor the situation and will not hesitate to introduce measures as and when necessary to achieve its objectives." In line with this, commercial banks, nevertheless, are still required to place their vostro balances with Bank Negara for it "to continue sterilising the remaining inflows". The negative interest rate measure introduced in February had been successful in reducing the amount of speculative funds maintained in vostro accounts from a high of more than RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 8 billion in January to RM2.6 billion yesterday. "Consequently, it is no longer necessary to continue with a negative interest rate on the vostro balances held by foreign banking institutions." The newly appointed Bank Negara Governor also outlined the importance he would place on fighting inflation, giving an indication of how he would tackle the problem. He said much of today's inflation was anticipatory, hence psychological in nature. "The objective of the policy is to affect inflationary expectations so that they will not become self-fulfilling. "In this, Bank Negara stands prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure that the inflationary psychology is not entrenched. "We will act again, when act we must, in order to convince investors, businesses and the public that the (Central) bank will continue to give priority to this continuing battle against inflation." Ahmad said large inflows of speculative funds had prompted the Central Bank to take drastic steps of late to re-establish control over the monetary aggregates. "Now that most of the speculators have unwound their positions, the ringgit has strengthened in the markets. "Before long, the positive impact of the bank's various measures, including those announced today, will be reflected in the financial markets in a way that should bring new confidence in the bank's resolve to fight inflation." The ringgit reacted positively today, closing higher at 2.6100/30 against the US dollar from 2.6180/90 yesterday. Dealers attributed the active trading to buying interest in the ringgit, fuelled by talks that Bank Negara is raising the SRR and lifting the restriction on the vostro accounts.
