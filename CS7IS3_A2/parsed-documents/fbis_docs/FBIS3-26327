In assessing the talks, he said: The joint press release born of the talks summarizes the results of the talks between the two organizations in Xiamen and Taibei [Taipei] following the "Wang-Gu [Ku] talks." It has positive implications for strengthening cooperation between the two organizations and for developing cross-strait relations. Tang Shubei said: Because the Taiwan authorities last year raised the question of "joining the United Nations," the Chinese Government released a white paper entitled "The Taiwan Question and Reunification of China," which led to a sharp political standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Mr. Jiao Renhe's current visit to Beijing for talks was good for the two sides' eschewing political issues to settle routine matters. We have always called on the two organizations to hold talks in the spirit of respecting each other, holding consultations on an equal basis, seeking truth from facts, and seeking common ground while reserving differences. During five days of talks, the two sides constantly coordinated their actions and reshaped their opinions in light of the other side's views, thereby bringing about an outcome that is acceptable to both sides. This outcome, which was born of enhanced trust between the two sides, is, in turn, good for increasing mutual trust. In response to questions on the significance of explicitly including in the joint press release plans for the two organizations to exchange views or hold talks on a number of economic, scientific, and technological issues during their fourth round of talks on routine matters, Tang Shubei said: ARATS has always called for incorporating the economic topics, outlined in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks," in the agenda at the earliest possible date. Given the current political differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, we believe that economic exchanges and cooperation can promote closer relations between the two sides and that shared economic benefits will widen our common political language. Talks between the two organizations currently stress the settlement of routine matters stemming from cross-strait exchanges. Although this is the duty of both organizations, we believe it is more important to promote the favorable development of cross-strait relations through contacts and cooperation between the two organizations. In this sense, economic topics represent a very important aspect and are forward-looking. The two organizations should actively promote the development of cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation. On the question of protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights and interests regarding their investments on the mainland, Tang Shubei said: The mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots on the Mainland" after reviewing the 22-article regulations on encouraging Taiwan compatriots to invest on the mainland, after considering the views of the SEF and Taiwan entrepreneurs, and after repeatedly carrying out investigations and studies. Once it is approved by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the law will serve as the single supreme law on the mainland that guarantees Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and interests. We are not against holding discussions with the SEF on protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights and interests. We also hope to include relevant economic topics during our fourth round of talks. In accordance with the principle of mutual benefit and reciprocity, we expressed our hope that Taiwan would open its markets to mainland products, loosen restrictions forbidding people from the mainland's industrial and business circles to visit Taiwan, and carry out cross-strait cooperation in labor services. On the basis of these moves, we do not exclude the possibility of signing a people-to-people agreement with the SEF on protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and interests. Asked by a reporter about his impression of Jiao Renhe, the SEF vice chairman cum secretary general, Tang Shubei said: When I first met and talked with Mr. Jiao, I had the feeling that he, like his predecessors, was willing to actively promote the development of cross-strait relations. Despite our differing political stands, we share a desire to develop cross-strait relations. Consequently, the two sides were able to surmount difficulties and to reach several common understandings. In response to the question of whether ARATS will set up an office in Hong Kong, Tang Shubei noted: ARATS has not considered this. The main targets of ARATS' contact are the SEF and various mass organizations and people from all walks of life in Taiwan. Now that the two organizations have established channels of communication and are in close contact, there is no need to set up a branch office in Hong Kong.
