Yakovenko] [Text]As a result of a number of natural disasters and technogenic accidents, global changes are presently occurring in man's environment, and this makes it necessary to develop a new scientific discipline, ecological psychology. Formation of radioecological psychology is taking place within its limits. The subject of radioecological psychology consists of objective facts, patterns and mechanisms of development of the human personality, his mental activity in the presence of complex interweaving of radioecological and sociopsychological factor related to the major nuclear accident at the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power plant]. Under such conditions, there is dramatic and prolonged mandatory change the lifestyle of millions of people, which leads to often misunderstood and largely dangerous changes in the mental aspect of their life. Radioecological psychology is called upon to demonstrate the patterns and mechanisms of occurring changes, assess possible consequences and propose adequate ways and means of rendering psychological aid to people with consideration of their age-, sex-related, individual psychological and sociopsychological distinctions. Thus, radioecological psychology is an applied scientific discipline. The distinctions of the subject and actual execution of deployed research determine the complex nature of formation of radio-ecological psychology, which is closely linked with psychophysiology, general, medical, age-related, pedagogic, and social psychology, as well as sociology, pedagogics, law and other disciplines. It utilizes the techniques of experimental psychology, psychohygiene, psychotherapy, etc. At the same time, within the mainstream of this scientific direction, it is developing its own theory, methodology, specific methods of investigation and correction of impaired mental development and behavior of people who have suffered from the sequelae of the radio-ecological disaster. The social relevance and humanitarian orientation of this discipline are instrumental in close interaction between scientists and practitioners in different specialties residing not only in affected country but also in distant foreign lands. Beneficial scientific ties are being established between psychologists of Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine. Psychologists of England, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, the United States, France, Japan and other countries are displaying interest in these problems and expressing the desire to give scientific and practical aid [8]. The ``Children of Chernobyl'' project is being implemented under the aegis of UNESCO; it involves construction of a number of community centers for sociopsychological rehabilitation of children up to the age of 7 years (in the Ukraine, in Vishnevyy, Kiev Oblast), and preparations are under way for opening a UNESCO international laboratory in Kiev to work on overcoming the socio-psychological and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster. There is a history to the formation of radioecological psychology in the Ukraine. In the early days and months after the accident, it was impossible to determine the nature and extent of impact of the radioecological disaster on social and psychological phenomena, or to predict their dynamics without appropriate studies. The earliest observations in 1986 (for example, those of A. U. Kharash from Moscow State University), and subsequent purposeful studies (in particular, of the staff of the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute in 1987) were carried out by scientists at their own initiative [9]. The findings gave cause for serious concern about the social and psychological consequences of the accident. The results of observations, interrogations and special studies were reported in the form of papers and accounts relayed to superior agencies; however, the reaction to them was quite restrained, since the findings contradicted the official assessment of the sequelae of the Chernobyl accident. A comparative study of more than 1300 3d, 5th, 7th and 9th grades students -- namely of: a) children evacuated from the 30-km zone, b) those who remained in the zone of radioactive contamination in Zhitomir, Kiev and Chernigov oblasts, c) those residing in Kiev, d) a control group from Poltava Oblast -- carried out by 16 staff members of the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute in 1987 revealed a number of statistically significant differences between them. Thus, the exposed students revealed decline in indicators of attention, memory, work capacity, impairment in volitional-emotional and emotional areas [1]. All this was indicative of sustained stress. Children and adolescents evacuated from the 30-km zone were in a particularly difficult situation: about 50 percent of them experienced serious difficulties in socio-psychological adjustment to their new place of residence [2, 3]. A small research team was formed in 1988, which became the Children of Chernobyl scientific and practical center in 1990 (headed by S. I. Yakovenko), to carry out further investigations at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute. Several articles and methodological recommendations were prepared on the basis of their studies [4, 5, 6]. The next step toward deeper investigation of the socio-psychological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES was the Union-Republic Children of Chernobyl program approved in 1991. In spite of organizational and financial difficulties, it was possible to recruit the nation's leading scientific institutions to implement it. In the Ukraine, the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute was appointed as the head organization (director: A. V. Kirichuk), and 18 of the 42 topical problems of this program were worked on there. The results of its research and clinical work carried out in 1991 were summarized at the interregional scientific conference on ``Socio-psychological Rehabilitation of Children and Adolescents Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster,'' which convened in February 1992 in Kiev [8]. The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: The accident at the Chernobyl AES caused catastrophic changes in the ecological situation, radical breakdown of the age-old lifestyle, system of relations, and made substantial adjustments in people's value orientations (first of all, those dealing with attitude toward the environment, society, health and rearing children). The psycho-traumatic situation that developed after the Chernobyl disaster enhanced "centrifugal tendencies" in personality development of children and adolescents, which was manifested by a tendency toward accentuation of temperament, diminished resistance to stress, increased aggressiveness and conflict in some, passivity, asthenization, formation of consummatory and pension-neurosis mindsets in others. On the whole, the following developmental disturbances were typical in children and adolescents who suffered the consequences of the Chernobyl accident: --physical: asthenization, deterioration of indicators of physical readiness, early development of chronic diseases; --mental: stress, deadaptation, diminished attention, memory, work capacity (including mental work), volitional and emotional disturbances, nostalgia for the past and uncertainty about the future, diminished motivation, distorted self-appraisal, and others; --spiritual: existential crisis, difficulties in personal and professional self-assertion, formation and persistence of the helpless victim complex doomed to a short and difficult life; --social: increased aggressiveness, conflict; social apathy, difficulties in communicating (particularly in children evacuated from the 30-km condemned zone). In other words, there was a large number of "children who had gone through a lot," which is not normal in peacetime. At the same time, what had been experienced was, in a number of instances, instrumental in intensive formation of the personality of affected children and adolescents, appreciable improvement in family relations, and others. However, the existing positive facts have not yet been reliably aired in psychological publications. The following tasks moved to the fore in solving problems of sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl catastrophe: --determination of factors and conditions that arose because of the Chernobyl disaster and prevent proper development of children and adolescents in the accident zone, and their relationship to other concurrently existing factors; --establishment of patterns of impact of the aggregate of all existing factors on mental development of different territorial and age groups of victims; --elaboration of an integral concept of providing for proper development of children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster; determination of scientific ally validated ways and means of rendering the necessary psychological aid to victims. The most important factors that hinder proper development of children and adolescents in the accident zone are: --external and internal radioactive irradiation that is deleterious to health and particularly dangerous for children born in 1986; --unsatisfactory level of medical care of affected children, only 15 percent of whom are under clinical observation; --inadequate information given to the public about the radioecological situation, safety measures, health status, and results of scientists' studies; --distorted image of the Chernobyl disaster in the mass media, which are transformed into "mass mental traumatization" media, continued circulation of various rumors and conjectures that initiate social stress and personal anxiety, also affecting children; --deterioration of sociodemographic population indicators in the accident zone, which is being abandoned by the best educated people who are replaced by those who expect only benefits, housing and high wages; --erosion of family-relative relations, prolonged separation of parents and children during vacations, impossibility of restoring previous forms of organization of everyday work and leisure; --material and technical difficulties in organizing the educational-rearing process in public education institutions situated in the zone of rigid radiation monitoring (crowded cafeterias, no gyms, ancillary facilities, technical educational equipment, etc.), shortage of qualified personnel, overfatigue of pedagogues; --inadequate efficacy of sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents during vacations, its virtual absence at their place of residence; --shortage of funds and resources to implement laws and enforceable enactments called upon to provide social protection of victims, diminished attention given to the latter on the part of local authorities and the world community. In assessing the prospects for overcoming the sociopsychological sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl AES, we must state that: 1) the sources of radiation hazard have not disappeared and their impact will probably last for tens of years; new victims of the disaster have also been found who were previously convinced that they were not involved in its consequences; 2) it is impossible to provide all victims with normal living conditions, good medical care, work in their special field, to compensate them for the material damage; 3) social tension persists in society due to the ``unfair'' distribution of benefits, humanitarian aid, etc.; 4) victims do not trust the authorities, mass media, scientists and specialists; 5) it was found that the victims have extremely limited opportunities to solve their problems; nor is there any effective State sociopsychological and legal aid for these people. The reason for the existing situation is not only that the necessary funds and resources are wanting, but also there is a shortage of constructive ideas to be systematically implement, or a scientifically validated conception for eradication of the sociopsychological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES. In this respect, the only exception is the concept of providing for proper mental development of children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, which was developed at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute and approved by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. However, it requires further definition, since there are still not enough scientific data for accurate assessment of the sociopsychological and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster and prediction of further development of the situation. The information we have to date is fragmentary, and for this reason it is dangerous to draw far-reaching conclusions on its basis. Only one thing is apparent: we can make a distinction of at least nine subgroups among affected children, which differ in number, relocation, proportion of radioecological and psychotraumatic factors, and how the stress situation is experienced. They are: --1) those evacuated from the 30-km accident zone in 1986; --2) those living or who have lived in the zone of mandatory relocation; --3) those referred to the guaranteed relocation zone; --4) those living in regions of continuous radiometric monitoring; --5) those living on "safety islands," situated in the accident zone (Kiev, Slavugich and others), who do not, however, agree with this assessment of the situation, as well as: --6) children of "eradicators," who were born after their parents had fulfilled their civic duty; --7) "grandchildren of Chernobyl," i.e., children of the grown representatives of the above subgroups; --8) children and adolescents in "clean" territories, who were exposed to the risk of internal irradiation due to consumption of contaminated food; --9) children born in 1986 who were the most affected by the radiation factor. A considerable number of children and adolescents of the Chernobyl zone were given the status of victims and have the right to expect the State's aid; the rest who have, so to speak, fallen through the cracks, have not undergone humanitarian socio-psychological expert evaluation. The reason is clear: not a single decision or enforceable enactment underwent expert humanitarian sociopsychological evaluation. The program of further scientific and clinical work in 1992-1995 aimed at eradicating the socio-psychological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster covers the following: --organization of monitoring of the sociopsychological situation, mental development of a representative sample of children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, starting a distributed data bank in order to assess the situation and predict its future dynamics; --expert humanitarian evaluation of decisions pertaining to provision of appropriate living conditions for children and adolescents affected by the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES, organization of the educational-rearing process in and beyond the area where they reside; --development, experimental trial and adoption of psychological-pedagogic recommendations to workers in public education and health care institutions, and parents of affected children; --establishment of an infrastructure of specialized institutions for socio-psychological rehabilitation of affected children and adolescents, provision of psychological consultations for them; --training and advanced training of personnel (clinical psychologists, pedagogues and social workers), providing them with scientific-methodological and psychological aid. These tasks have been fulfilled to varying extents. In 1992, Kiev State University handed out diplomas of clinical psychologists to 140 people who were referred there from the 5 most affected oblasts of the Ukraine. They returned to their homes to work with children in public education institutions and specialized psychorehabilitation offices, the network of which is already beginning to proliferate. In the future, it is planned to graduate 60 clinical psychologists annually from the specialized department of Kiev State University, who will be involved in implementation of the Children of Chernobyl program. An agreement has been reached to organize training of psychologists from affected regions of the Ukraine at Fordham University in New York and the New Hope Guild Center also located there, which specializes in sociopsychological adaptation of migrants. A program for organizing a network of regional psychorehabilitation centers in the Ukraine, a decree on regional centers and prototype plan to outfit them have been developed. Methodological recommendations have been elaborated for: parents of affected children (M. I. Alekseyeva), preschool institutions for children from the zone of radioactive contamination (S. Ye. Kulachkovskaya), different types of schools situated in different zones of the Chernobyl disaster (I. L. Fedorishina, Yu. M. Shvalb and others), non-educational institutions called upon to provide conditions for creative development of children and adolescents living in radiation zones and unable to spend their free time in the usual way (V. V. Rybalka), as well as workers in health camps and rest homes where children of the Chernobyl zone spend long periods of time (M. I. Borishevskiy, I. M. Turchaninova). Much work has been done in the field of methodological and software-hardware support of monitoring the sociopsychological situation, mental development of children affected by the sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster, and managing a distributed data bank (A. M. Karpukhina, V. G. Panok). In 1993, the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute is joining in a comprehensive investigation of the adult population affected by the sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
