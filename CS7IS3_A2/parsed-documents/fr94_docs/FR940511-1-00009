FR940511-1-00009 FR940511-1-00001 (8) If there are any exceptions of record. (9) What measures are required for preparing, obtaining, or approving curative material, conveyances, and security instruments, (10) Provide copies of these interests and exceptions as requested by the approval official. (e) Use of title insurance. When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects in, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable, and the curative or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a mortgagee and owner's title policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan. In the case of an assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect. (f) Approval official's responsibilities after receipt of preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder. Upon receipt of the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder, the approval official will: (1) Check the opinion or binder carefully. If any required information is omitted, or if the standard form of opinion or binder is amended, the approval official will return it for completion or correction. If the closing agent is unable or unwilling to comply, the approval official will send the opinion or binder with a full explanation to OGC through the State Director for advice. (2) Check the legal description of the land, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other security involved, to determine that the description covers all of the property rights intended to be taken as security. (3) Review all exceptions to title shown in the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder. The approval official will determine which exceptions must be modified, eliminated or waived, or whether an agreement with prior lienholders is necessary or advisable to protect FmHA's interests. If prior encumbrance(s) will remain, the approval official should obtain and review a copy of each to insure that its terms are acceptable to FmHA. If an option or sales contract which lists acceptable exceptions is involved, the approval official will determine whether the exceptions in the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder are the same as those in the option or sales contract and inform the applicant of discrepancies. If the approval official has any doubt as to the acceptability or effect of any exception, the applicant will be requested to obtain a clarification. The approval official will consult with the closing agent and/or the State Director when necessary to determine the acceptability of any exception. If the approval official determines that any defects cannot be corrected, or the effect of certain exceptions on the title, suitability, security value, or successful operation of the property is not clear, and they cannot be corrected or eliminated without undue expense, the approval official will forward the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder to the State Director together with comments regarding the objectionable features and copies of the exceptions when needed. (i) If, with the advice of OGC, the State Director determines that the exceptions will not adversely affect the title to the property or its suitability, security value, or successful operation, the State Director will advise the approval official. The approval official will then arrange for closing. (ii) If the State Director, with the advice of OGC, finds that these exceptions will adversely affect the title to the property, its suitability, security value, or successful operation, the State Director may waive them conditionally and instruct the approval official as to how the conditions may be met, or instruct the approval official that the loan cannot be closed because of the defect. ยง1927.56 Scheduling loan closing. The approval official may arrange a closing when he/she determines that exceptions shown in the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder (if any) will not adversely affect the suitability, security value, or successful operation of the property. (a) The approval official will make sure that all requirements of subpart I of part 1940 of this chapter have been met before the loan is closed. (b) In arranging for loan closing, the approval official will send Form FmHA 1927&hyph;15, ``Loan Closing Instructions/Loan Closing Statement For,'' to the the closing agent. When a title insurance commitment is involved, the ``loan closing instructions'' will include any corrections required by the commitment. Therefore, the title insurance commitment must be received before the final closing instructions are transmitted. At the same time, send written notification of loan closing to the applicant. For single family housing loans Form FmHA 1927&hyph;16, ``Notification of Loan Closing,'' will be used to notify the applicant. ยง1927.57 Preparation of closing documents. (a) Preparation of deeds. The closing agent will prepare, complete, or approve deeds necessary for title clearance and closing of the transaction. FmHA forms will be used whenever possible. (1) Types of estates for married borrowers. If the borrowers are married, FmHA prefers, but will not require, that title to the real estate will be held in such a way that, upon the death of a borrower, it will pass to the surviving spouse by law to prevent the real estate from being tied up in probate proceedings. Title may be held in any manner that permits obtaining the required mortgage. (2) Deeds will be prepared as follows: (i) Conveyances of title to borrowers by parties other than FmHA will be by general warranty deed. If a general warranty deed cannot be obtained, a special warranty deed, quitclaim deed, or grant deed may be used if the entity providing title clearance (closing agent) determines that the deed used will vest in the borrower a good and marketable title of record. All conveyances by FmHA will be by quitclaim deed. (ii) The deed to the security property will show the exceptions to which the title is subject and should, where customary, contain a tie-in description showing that it covers the same land or part of the same land as that designated or described in another deed or mortgage described specifically by date, parties, and recording data. (iii) Each deed should recite legal consideration.
