Russia "firmly rules out" the possibility of extending the Sarajevo cease-fire model and rejects "any repetition of the NATO ultimatum in other parts of Bosnia," Churkin said after a meeting with diplomats from other nations on peace in Bosnia. In a joint statement, ranking officials from the U.S., Canada, the UN and European Union member states, said the latest developments in Sarajevo represent a "major step toward an end to the whole Bosnian war." The participants expressed grave concerns about the serious situation in other parts of Bosnia and their readiness to cooperate closely, by taking advantage of the current positive factors, to bring about a settlement to the conflict through negotiations. The participants also said in the statement that they would seek to improve the humanitarian situation in Serb-encircled enclaves and pressure Muslims and Croats for a cease-fire in central Bosnia and the southern city of Mostar. Meanwhile, they warned the serbs not to move to other war fronts any of the artillery they had pulled back from around Sarajevo before the deadline of the NATO ultimatum which expired peacefully on February 20. Churkin, who is also Russia's special envoy for former Yugoslavia, said the participants discussed measures for peace that can all be achieved without the use of force. "There was no attempt to resort to strong language at this meeting because we're acting together," he said. The final step of the Serb withdrawal over the weekend in accordance with NATO's demands was negotiated by Russia, which has traditionally maintained close ties with the Serbs. Russia has sent 400 troops as UN peacekeepers to Sarajevo to help monitor the cease-fire. Therefore, Churkin said, Russia's message to Europe and the United States was, "when you get in trouble with the Serbs, before raising hell please turn to us. Maybe we can resolve it without any difficulties." He agreed to use Russian influence with the Serbs to get Tuzla airport re-opened, a long-time demand of Western governments. Tuzla is the eastern Bosnian base for aid agencies to send emergency relief supplies to the local people. Its airport lies within the range of Serb artillery. The Russian envoy also urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to send American soldiers to Sarajevo. But Clinton has offered to send troops only after a peace agreement. During the meeting, the participants agreed with Russia's proposal to use the momentum from the Sarajevo cease-fire to push for political progress in the war-torn republic as a whole.
