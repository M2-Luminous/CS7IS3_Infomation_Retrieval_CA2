The voice of defiance is not only the voice of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, but it is the voice of the masses, the free masses. Here in Surman, the same as yesterday and the other days in other regions, everywhere there are people ready for confrontation; people who insist on living on the land of their fathers and ancestors freely, independently, and with pride. [passage omitted] Let the world hear the voice of the masses of Bu 'Isa and Surman. Let the world hear the voice of the free masses, however much those around us surrender and whatever the shivers of the rulers of the Arab nation might be. They want the Arab nation to be subjugated to its enemies. Whatever those who surrender might do, whatever those who prostrate themselves might do, and whatever those who tremble might do, we have decided to live freely and with dignity on the land of our fathers and ancestors. [passage omitted] For this reason, to live in freedom and live a life worthy of the free man, for this reason we have decided that we will confront anyone who wants to challenge us over the land of our fathers and forefathers. This is our land, the land of the fathers and forefathers. We paid for this land with the lives of our fathers and forefathers. We have written its history in their dear blood. We will not squander one grain of sand of this land. The banners of this land will never fly under the banners of the colonialists. No foreigner or colonialist can settle this land. We challenge anyone who wants to challenge us. [passage omitted] The defiance started in Libya; the cry of confrontation started in Libya; and the preparations for battle started in Libya. Brothers, we hear now another voice from Sudan. Sudan announced yesterday the expulsion of the British ambassador because he considered Sudan a British colony. The dreams of the colonialists have returned again. The dreams of the West have returned again. Their ambitions in Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and everywhere in the Arab world have returned. Their ambitions have returned again. Yesterday Britain acted as if Sudan was not celebrating the 38th anniversary of its independence. Britain ignored Sudan as an independent state. Britain ignored Sudan's dignity and Sudan's independence. Britain proceeded along the course of marching on the Arab homeland, trampling on the dignity of the Arab homeland, and Arab existence with an indifference to the national sovereignty of the peoples of the Arab nation. Its ambassador quite insolently interfered in Khartoum's domestic affairs. Brothers, look at this. It is not the year 1881 or 1882 or 1830, and it is not even 1911 [the date of the Italian invasion of Libya]. Today it is 1993-94. Britain behaved as if Sudan was a colony that belonged to King Faruq and Faruq belonged to Britain. This is how Britain sees Egypt's and Sudan's independence. Yesterday, however, the Sudanese people headed by al-Bashir announced that the confrontation was not only in Libya, it has extended to Sudan by the expulsion of the British ambassador. Sudan said to him that Sudan is an independent state and only death can separate it. This is what happened yesterday. The colonialists recognized the legitimacy of the Somali national resistance. They recognized Aidid as its national leader and that they must negotiate with him after they used to say that he was a war criminal who must be captured. Brothers, this is a retreat in the face of the determination of the Somali people to uphold truth and defeat lies. The truth is that every nation has the right to live on the land of its fathers and forefathers in freedom and dignity. Brothers, all the peoples possess the right to die in defense of their honor and independence. The colonialists will pull back when they face these [words indistinct] these challenges and this determination; the determination of peoples to live freely brothers. Yes, they will have to be very wary. This is coming from the masses of Surman and Bu 'Isa only, not to mention the masses of the Arab nation and the masses of Libya as a whole. There are masses in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iraq, the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and Sudan [repeated as heard]. There are innumerable masses and the colonialists will find it difficult to impose their dominion again on a nation that is beating the drums of confrontation, a nation that has decided to live freely. Yes, brothers, we are not just talking, we are demonstrating with deeds. The national resistance in southern Lebanon is daily writing in blood the words that we are speaking now, and it is paving the path of liberation with the bodies of the martyrs of Hizballah and the Lebanese national resistance. There is fighting every day [word indistinct] in southern Lebanon and Palestine under the leadership of Palestinian Jihad, the Fatah Eagles, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Popular Front, the Popular Democratic Front, the Popular Front-General Command, the Fatah of Intifadah, and Fatah-Revolutionary Council. [passage omitted] Brothers, those who sell Palestine now in a public auction will be punished by the Palestinian people. Brothers, those who betray the Arab nation will see their just fate. Brothers, we did not decide to go outside our borders. We did not decide to commit aggression. We did not decide to sabotage the world. We did not decide to trample on international legitimacy. We only decided to live with respect and dignity on our land. This is what we demanded and we will defend it until death. They are the ones who trampled on the international treaties and tore the UN Charter. They are the ones who violated international law. [passage omitted]
