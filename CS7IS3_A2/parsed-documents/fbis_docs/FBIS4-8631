According to the ministry's statement, Ambassador Brankovic stressed that Italy had thereby taken on itself responsibility for the risk of escalation of the war with unforeseeable consequences. NATO military operations on the very border of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are a provocation against the FRY, a threat against its security, and pose a serious threat to peace and stability in the region. Taking part in a NATO military action, even under UN auspices, is contrary to the CSCE principles on the peaceful resolution of disputes, the observance of which--as the CSCE chair country--Italy should particularly advocate. Such actions by Italy are contrary to the efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and contradict principles of good-neighborliness and traditional cooperation between friendly countries and peoples. The FRY Government--interested in preservation of peace and security in the region, in the fate of the Serbs, and in finding a peaceful and just solution for the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina--expects the Italian Government to prevent any further use of its territory for armed actions against the Serbs in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
