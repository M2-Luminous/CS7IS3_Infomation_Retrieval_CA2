FBIS4-58071 "drnes084_j_94027" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 1 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' `Sources:' Efforts of Egyptian Envoy `Last Hope' NC0105141194 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1130 GMT 1 May 94 NC0105141194 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA) -- Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo have stated that the shuttles that President Mubarak's envoy Ambassador Badr Hammam is currently making between Sanaa and Aden are the "last hope" in the attempts designed to prevent the outbreak of a devastating all-out civil war between north and south Yemen. According to these sources, numerous Arab and international parties have exerted intensive efforts to mediate between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, leader of the General People's Congress [GPC] in Sanaa, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leader in Aden, to preserve the unity of the state. However, the mediation efforts have been in vain and failed to prevent the recent military clashes that left more than 1,000 military personnel dead. These sources expressed their fear that the Yemeni crisis might reach the point of no return in view of the resumption of clashes between the northern and southern forces. They also expressed their fear that Yemen may not remain united. These sources noted that the Yemeni opposition is currently demanding that confidence be withdrawn from the government because it is responsible for the current disarray. They pointed out that the opposition is demanding the formation of a national salvation government in which all political forces participate in order to preserve the unity of the state and implement the "Pledge and Accord" document on national reconciliation that was recently signed in Amman. The battles that occurred in the 'Imran camp north of Sanaa represent a fresh escalation of a serious political crisis that has continued for eight months between the two main parties in the ruling coalition, the GPC in the north and the YSP in the south. During their propaganda campaign they traded severe accusations that the other one is seeking to secede and is responsible for the deterioration of the political and economic situation in Yemen. This crisis has crippled political and economic activities and caused Vice President al-Bid to stay in Aden and refuse to return to Sanaa. It has also led to the deterioration in the economic situation, caused the national currency to plummet, inflation to spiral, prices to go up, and unemployment to increase because of a lack of new jobs as local investments declined and foreign investors fear to enter the Yemen market in view of instability and the assassination and kidnapping of foreigners. Despite the recent signing of the "Pledge and Accord" document in Amman following intensive mediation by Jordan's King Husayn, the two parties to the conflict failed to implement its clauses. This document has been frozen, as it is the only hope for the Yemeni people to emerge from the crisis and the Yemeni leaders have already signed it and approved its clauses. Arab sources in Cairo affirm that Egypt's efforts, led by President Mubarak, are almost the last ditch for the Yemenis to keep the banners of unity flying.
