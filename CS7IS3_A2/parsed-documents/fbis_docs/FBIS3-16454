We have a historic mission, whose nonfulfilment would be a betrayal. If our border guards leave the border, bloodshed will begin and innocent people will be killed," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents here today. The minister visited a border post of the Pyandzh border unit during a break in the current Dushanbe conference of foreign ministers from Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Russia. Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS that Russian presence in former Soviet Republics was discussed in this very light during his meeting with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher on Monday [14 March] in Vladivostok. "The Russian special mission is not our caprice, it is a fact one cannot avoid. We do not need any imperialism, but we will fulfill our duty. I think that our Western partners come to understand this. It will be fine if they help us, if not we will make it ourselves," stressed the official. Asked whether inter-Tajik dialogue will be held in Moscow in due time, the minister said that the dialogue has begun, including that with the Russian mediation. "It is important to understand that the dialogue may have diverse forms. It is the result that is important, and in order to achieve it, it is necessary to find out who's who: Who has the guns and who has real control over armed people. It is they whom one should speak to first," he added. Asked what the reason is for his frequent meetings with the military, Kozyrev said: "We have a common cause although different means. This cause is consolidation of statehood and protection of Russian interests."
