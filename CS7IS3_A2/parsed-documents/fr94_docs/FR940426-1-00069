FR940426-1-00069 FR940426-1-00007 (7) A certification that the applicant will promptly notify the designated DFAS official to discontinue the involuntary allotment if the judgment is satisfied prior to the collection of the total amount of the judgment through the involuntary allotment process. (8) A certification that if the member overpays the amount owed on the judgment, the applicant will refund the amount of overpayment to the member within 30 days of discovery or notice of the overpayment, whichever is earlier, and that if the applicant fails to repay the member, the applicant understands he or she may be denied the right to collect by involuntary allotment on other debts reduced to judgments. (9) A certification that at either the time of application for the involuntary allotment or the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, the applicant (and the judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) was (were) not in an ``off-limits'' status, or had not been determined to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial practices detrimental to the morale and welfare of service members, pursuant to applicable directives of the military services, to include the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation. (10) A certification that the applicant (and the judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) has (have) complied with the Standards of Fairness contained in appendix C to this part. (11) Acknowledgment that as a condition of application, the applicant agrees that neither the United States, nor any disbursing official or Federal employee whose duties include processing involuntary allotment applications and payments, shall be liable with respect to any payment or failure to make payment from moneys due or payable by the United States to any person pursuant to any application made in accordance herewith. c. The original and three copies of the application and supporting documents must be submitted by the applicant to DFAS. d. A complete ``application package'' (the DD Form aa, ``Involuntary Allotment Application'', supporting documentation, and three copies of the application and supporting documents), is required for processing of any request to establish an involuntary allotment pursuant to this part. e. The designated DFAS official shall refuse to process any application that does not conform with the requirements of this part, is unsigned, is incomplete in any material regard, lacks required documentation, or contains false certifications. If an application is ineligible for processing under this part, the application package shall be returned to the applicant with an explanation of the deficiency. In cases involving repeated false certifications by an applicant, the designated DFAS official may refuse to accept or process additional applications by that applicant for such period of time as the official deems appropriate to deter against such violations in the future. 2. Processing of Involuntary Allotment Applications a. Promptly upon receipt of DD Form aa, ``Involuntary Allotment Application'', the designated DFAS official shall review the ``application package'' to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part. If the application package is complete, the DFAS official shall: (1) Determine the location and address of the commander as designated by the military service to have authority to give notice of the involuntary allotment application to the member against whose pay the involuntary allotment application in sought, and, if required, to determine whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered; (2) Mail one copy of the application package to the member and two copies of the application package, along with DD Form bb, 3 ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing,'' to the commander of the military member; 3 See footnote 1 to section B.1.a. to this appendix. (3) Within 60 days of mailing of the copies of the application package and DD Form bb, ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing'', DFAS will provide notice to the member and the member's commander that automatic processing of the involuntary allotment application will occur if a response is not received within 90 calendar days from the original date of mailing. Additionally, notice will be provided that automatic processing may be delayed if the member's commander provides DFAS notice that the member has been granted an extension to respond as authorized by this part, the date the response is due, and the reason(s) for the extension. In the absence of any additional correspondence from the member's commander, DFAS may automatically process the involuntary allotment application 15 calendar days after the extended date that the commander notified DFAS the response was due. (4) Retain the original of the application package. b. Upon receipt of an application package and DD Form bb, ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing,'' from the designated DFAS official, the commander (as noted in paragraph B.2.a.(1) of this Appendix) will immediately notify the member of the receipt of the application, provide the member a copy of the entire application package, and counsel the member using and completing Part I of DD Form bb concerning the following. (1) That an application for the establishment of an involuntary allotment has been received and that the member could have up to 15 percent of disposable pay taken to satisfy the judgment upon which the application is based. (2) That the member has 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the notice to respond to the commander by completing Part II of DD Form bb and submitting any information or documentation deemed relevant by the member. That for good cause shown, the commander may grant an extension of reasonable time (normally not exceeding 30 calendar days) to submit a response. That during times of deployment, war, national emergency, or other similar situations, extensions exceeding 30 calendar days may be granted.
