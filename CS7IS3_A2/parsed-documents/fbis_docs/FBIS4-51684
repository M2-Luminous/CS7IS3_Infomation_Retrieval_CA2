"I think the program should be expanded. I want to study it more," he told reporters at a news conference, his first as construction chief. The former Hosokawa government decided to add more projects to the 430 trillion yen program, which was set up in line with Japan's agreement on the structural impediments initiative (SII) talks with the United States concluded in June 1990.
