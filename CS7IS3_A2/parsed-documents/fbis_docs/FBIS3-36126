But he added that land was being returned quicker at the moment. He said in 1991-1992, the documents returning the property were handed to 12.6 thousand former landowners and only in 1993 -- 25.2 thousand. Slezevicius said the reform would be speeded up when local authorities hire enough officials working with the land issues.
