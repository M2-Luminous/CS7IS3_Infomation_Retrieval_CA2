The U.S.-Latvian military cooperation will substantially expand this year, said Willian Perry, under secretary for defense. The cooperation will include visits of U.S. warships to Latvia's ports, joint maneuvers with U.S. and NATO's Armed Forces. The U.S. president has received a draft resolution to lift restrictions of shipments of all kind of war materials to the Baltic states, Perry said. Latvian parliamentarians voiced a concern over the lack of any security guarantees what was said to be potentially dangerous against the background of the political climate in Russia becoming worse. U.S. officials reiterated that the Baltics were granted a priority status in the American foreign policies. Consequently, the absence of concrete security guarantees should not be overdramatized because formal guarantees are actually redundant. The United States had never signed a formal security treaty with Israel but the existing relationship allows to attain the desired result without a formal document, U.S. speakers said. The Latvian-U.S. relationship is also very close to similar attitudes, they noted. The Latvian delegation met with Senator Carl Levin and discussed the potential U.S. financial support for the dismantling of the Russian military early-warning antimissile radar in Skrunda, Latvia. The senator promised to study the request. The group also visited Anthony Lake, president's adviser on national security issues.
