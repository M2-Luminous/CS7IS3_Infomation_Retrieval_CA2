Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file. * * * * * (2) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* (B) Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's operation (including balance sheets and statements of income and expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of the owner-builder's accounts and any contingent liabilities that may exist. FmHA personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender. * * * * * (G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder. Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13 will be used for this purpose. If cost certification services are required by FmHA, the cost of such services may be included in the total development cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder as defined in §1924.4(i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed amount. (H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder, subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA 1924&hyph;13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to FmHA by the owner-builder. * * * * * (ii) *␣*␣* (C) The total development cost of the project does not exceed that which is typical for similar type projects in the area. The total development cost recognized by FmHA for each individual case will be determined by the MFH Coordinator with the advice of the State Architect. * * * * * (iii) *␣*␣* (A) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file. * * * * * (iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements and a builder's profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area. The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.
