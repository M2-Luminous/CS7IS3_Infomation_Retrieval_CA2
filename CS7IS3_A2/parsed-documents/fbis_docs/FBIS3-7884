The report says that the continuous lack of the dialogue between the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities on one side and the leadership of the Albanians of Kosova on the other side, has hindered the improvement of the situation in defined fields such as the parallel system of the education of the ethnic Albanians. Considering this question, the situation in the University of Prishtina remains a source of tension. This is the third school year during which the registration of the students, the lectures, the exercises, the examinations and other activities of more then twenty two thousand students and nine hundred teachers of university are going on in private houses and buildings. The continuous reports inform about the discriminating acts of the Serbian police against ethnic Albanians. The beatings and the tortures against them are common. The report mentions the declaration of the head of the Prishtina Regional Court, who has supported the ill-treatment of the prisoners from the police saying that "even if their guiltiness is not shown by facts, they are implicated in the crimes against the state." Considering the use of the brutal force by the Serbian police, the report show the case of January 13, when the Serbian police confiscated gold and silver from the shops of the Albanian owners in Prizren without giving any explanation. On further more, as it is reported, the police confiscated facilities and even passports of the ethnic Albanians in the cross border between Serbia and FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. On further more, the report writes about the illegal expel of the Albanian families from their houses. In most of the cases, this is carried out without any previous procedural law and on further more, their houses are given generally to the Serbian families, underlines the report, which adds that during January 1994 alone, the urban office of Prishtina has given seventeen decisions to the Albanians' families, who had absolute property and all the legal documents which proved that they had lived for decades in those buildings. The report also mentions facts which testifies for arbitrary arrests and abuse of the right for a just and on one sided court. These abuses in particular have to do with a series of penal processes against ethnic Albanians in Prishtina, Peje, Gjilan and Prizren where Albanians have been accused for "putting in danger the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia." Most of the defendants are former officers of the Yugoslavia People's Army or officers of the territorial defence of Yugoslavia, informs the report of Mr. Mazowiecki published yesterday from the Albanian press in Kosova.
