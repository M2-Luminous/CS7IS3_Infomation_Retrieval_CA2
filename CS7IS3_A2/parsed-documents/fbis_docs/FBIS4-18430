During the meeting there was a mutual briefing regarding the difficulties in support for national issues in international organizations. Kaklamanis stated that besides the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], the Cyprus issue is also at a critical phase as a result of the talks on confidence-building measures. The president of the Greek Chamber of Deputies repeated the commitment repeatedly expressed by the government and prime minister to togetherness, solidarity, and common direction between he two countries. Alexix Galanos, the Cypriot House of Representatives president, referred to the hypocritical practice of using different measures and putting different weight on the issues of Skopje and Cyprus. Although Turkey invaded and occupies the north of the island, today it appears as a peaceloving nation. The president of the Cypriot House of Representatives stressed that besides the unified defense space, Greece and Cyprus should formulate a unified diplomatic area to promote national issues, which are undivided. At 1500 [1200 GMT] this afternoon, Galanos also met Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. After meeting Galanos, Pangalos said they discussed topics regarding Cyprus, developments around the Cyprus issue, and the Cypriot Parliament's participation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Asked to comment on developments in Istanbul, Pangalos said: We have a series of developments that concern us and we have the statement of the new mayor. I hope calm will prevail and that someone will prove to those who use such methods that they should choose between a return to the past and a move to the future. Turkey cannot possibly seek a position in the family of European nations and, at the same time, remember the achievements of the captors [reference to the Ottoman Empire]. I believe that Hellenism, the civilized world, and the great community of Orthodox nations, Pangalos concluded, are determined to protect the Orthodox Partriarchate, which is an international organization with particular importance for the world community as a whole.
