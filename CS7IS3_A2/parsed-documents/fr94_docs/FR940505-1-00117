FR940505-1-00117 FR940505-1-00012 (i) Onroad Testing. Although not expressly required to do so as part of its FIP effort, EPA proposes to use remote sensing devices (RSD) as a supplement to the proposed FIP I/M program, because EPA believes RSD to be a useful way of identifying gross emitters for possible out-of-cycle repairs. The actual onroad testing would be performed by the test provider and would cover a larger percentage of the fleet than the minimum required of state-adopted enhanced I/M programs under the I/M rule (i.e., approximately 10 percent). Owners of vehicles which fail the RSD check would be notified of the failure by registered mail, and would be required to report for an out-of-cycle confirmatory test at a test-only test site. Should the vehicle fail this confirmatory test, the owner would be responsible for the procurement of necessary repairs and would be required to submit the vehicle for retesting. The owner would have an opportunity to apply for a waiver, but only after meeting all the same criteria that would apply during the regular testing cycle. Vehicle owners who did not respond to the NPRM of RSD failure would be assessed a late penalty at the time of their next scheduled test. The late penalty would be the same as that charged for missing a regularly scheduled test (i.e., $10 per week late). (j) Program Start Date. The FIP I/M program would initiate testing 100 percent of the subject vehicle population beginning in January 1997. d. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Light-Duty Vehicles _EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions of cars and light-duty trucks, compared to the federal standards. However, despite the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements, CARB projects LEVS will exceed their certification standards in-use, although, for the reasons noted in Section III.D.1.a(2), by a much smaller margin than has occurred in the past. Emissions above the certification standards, referred to as excess emissions, will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected, or because individual vehicles experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not immediately corrected by the various existing in-use compliance programs, including enhanced I/M. Because the magnitude of the emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the adoption of further measures to reduce these remaining excess in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard. EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program, and cause in-use emissions to approach the certification standards. Specifically, EPA is considering three approaches. The first would modify the current federal recall program to initiate recalls based on the emission results of vehicles tested in their as received condition. This differs from current practice, and would result in a shift of responsibility for maintaining low emissions from the consumer to the vehicle manufacturers. The second possible program would make manufacturers responsible for repairs for vehicles whose failure rate for that model in an enhanced I/M program exceeds a threshold level (e.g., greater than 5 percent within the first 5 years). This approach, like the first approach, provides an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to increase the durability of their designs, or implement other programs designed to maintain the emissions of their products in-use. Both of these possible programs would apply throughout a vehicle's statutory useful life. The third possible program involves adoption of a requirement that the on-board diagnostic system of new vehicles be capable of communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the emission control system (i.e., whether a fault has been detected). This approach allows for the immediate identification of high emitting vehicles, and their timely repair. Unlike the first two approaches, this approach would remain in effect for the vehicles's entire life, a significant point since over 40 percent of cars and light trucks on California's highways have over 100,000 miles on their odometer. EPA requests comments on these three approaches, and on any other approaches to further reduce in-use emissions. Comments should address the need for and viability of EPA implementing, within the context of the FIP, compliance programs in addition to those already adopted by California. EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance program described in Appendix I A. e. On-highway Motorcycles _Provisions for on-highway motorcycles are contained in section III.D.4.c(1). Because engines used in nonroad recreational vehicles such as all terrain vehicles and dirt bikes are similar to those used in on-highway motorcycles, all control strategies for these engines are contained in the section referenced in the preceding sentence. f. Discussion of Emission Registration and Fee Systems for Light Duty Vehicles _In the light duty vehicle and light duty truck sector, emission reductions can result from direct regulation of the vehicle and fuels or can be brought about by regulations or incentives (either positive or negative) to change vehicle ownership patterns and/or driver behavior. Emission standards for light duty vehicles and their fuel have significantly decreased the amount of pollution emitted by any one vehicle over a given mile. Standards continue to tighten and within the FIP EPA is proposing to reduce tailpipe and evaporative emissions even further. Additional reductions could come from incentives to increase the number newer vehicles on the road and reduce the number of older vehicles. Accelerating fleet turnover through any means would reduce on road emissions by replacing older vehicles (which have older emissions technology) with newer, cleaner vehicles.
