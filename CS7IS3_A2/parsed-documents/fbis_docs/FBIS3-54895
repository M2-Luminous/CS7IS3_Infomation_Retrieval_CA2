He emphasized that since the radical change in Ukraine's political tack in respect of nuclear weapons and the Black Sea Fleet at the meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents in Massandra on 3 September, "less attention has been paid" to Ukraine at the United Nations. Viktor Batyuk characterized mutual relations with Russia as "a pendulum situation" and stressed that the Russian mass media "are defaming Ukraine." The Ukraine representative said that members of the Ukrainian delegation made over 50 speeches in the course of the session, Ukraine co-sponsored 39 resolutions and was re-elected for three years as a member of the Committee for Program and Coordination. In Viktor Batyuk's words, Ukraine spoke against allowing any country's claim to be granted peace-making powers in any given region and demanded that peace-making actions should be carried out in accordance with the CSCE Charter and the major UN documents. Viktor Batyuk confirmed that he has been appointed Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and that he will leave for Ottawa at the end of this week.
