Other European leaders are now acutely aware that not only does Berlusconi have the freshest and most enthusiastic mandate of any European leader, but that he may not abide by the time-honoured rules of the old "European establishment." Although he clearly intends to keep other heads of government guessing about his true intentions, strong diplomatic signals emerging from Rome indicate that Berlusconi will play his cards ruthlessly in Italy's national interest. Far from being able to write Berlusconi off as a non-politician who may have only temporary support and some uncomfortable neo-Fascist allies, Europe's established leaders have suddenly recognised that the populist chord he has struck may have implications for them as well. Most significant are the overtures made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to woo Berlusconi into the political mainstream. After a meeting in Bonn with Kohl scheduled on 15 June, the tycoon-turned-politician can be confident that his maverick party, born only a few months ago from a network of football fan clubs, can count on a warm welcome into the political establishment. With 27 Euro seats, Berlusconi's Forza Italia would constitute one of the most prominent national contingents within the dominant right-wing grouping at Strasbourg, the European People's Party (EPP). Traditionally this has been the home of moderate Christian Democrat parties across Europe. Senator Livio Caputo, Rome's deputy foreign minister, told The European: "I know that Kohl is very keen on Forza Italia entering the EPP. Berlusconi wants to adhere to the EPP to maximise its power in Parliament, and so far we have received no negative signals." Berlusconi's men would outnumber the discredited Italian Christian Democrats in the European Parliament by nearly three to one. And they would help close the gap at Strasbourg between the EPP and the Socialists, the largest single party. Caputo explained: "With one-sixth of the Right's vote in Strasbourg, we carry a certain weight. The latest election result shows other governments and public opinion that Berlusconi did not win by chance but thanks to exceptional popular support. This will reinforce his position at next week's Corfu summit." Bringing Forza Italia in from the cold, however, will throw up several obstacles. Certainly the biggest will be the necessity to accommodate the Italian government's new, more nationally assertive tone on European affairs. For many years Italy has been an uncritical supporter of the ideal of a federal Europe, inclined to press its own national interests within the EU only weakly. But that is changing rapidly, with some top ministers in Rome championing the EU predominantly as a free-trade zone. Antonio Martino, the foreign affairs minister, a founder member of the anti-federal Bruges Group, said recently: "We want a new direction on Europe -- something more market-oriented." Since the EPP is an avowedly federalist party, to avoid embarrassment the Berlusconi forces may ally themselves rather than joining the group outright. This ploy was adopted in the last parliament by the British Conservative MEPs, who are expected to resort to the same tactic again now that British premier John Major has assumed a distinctly Eurosceptical tone. Caputo admits that Forza Italia is "likely to see eye-to-eye" with Britain's Euro-sceptics on several issues, notably the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. "The social chapter must be handled with care," he said. "Excessive social policies, including more pensions and state handouts, could become a great burden in the future. Instead Europe must look to become more competitive vis-a-vis the United States and southeast Asia." In a sign of its growing influence in Europe, Berlusconi's party is already being courted by contenders for the presidency of the EU Commission. Caputo makes it clear that the new Rome government will shed few tears when Jacques Delors leaves the post. "The new Commission will not be led by a socialist -- and I believe that the new European Parliament will oppose the dirigisme which has emanated from Brussels in the past few years," he declared. Since its election in May, Berlusconi's administration has suffered a series of snubs from senior EU politicians worried by its alliance with the neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Caputo dismisses this as a smoke-screen by the French socialists and the Belgians to mask their own domestic failures. Even so, Forza Italia will not be allying with the handful of MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] the MSI is sending to Strasbourg. Before Forza Italia makes a deal with the EPP, both sides must be satisfied on institutional appointments. There are more than 40 top jobs to be handed out under a system of party patronage, and Forza Italia may argue it should have at least one key post.
