FR940524-0-00036 FR940524-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 90&hyph;01; Notice 4] RIN 2127&hyph;AF32 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Interim final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: In response to a petition for rulemaking from Blue Bird Body Company, this notice amends Standard No. 131, School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices, with respect to the flash rate for stop signal arm lamps. Specifically, this notice amends the standard to remove design restrictive language that acts to prohibit strobe lamps. The agency has determined that immediate action is in the public interest since school buses are currently being ordered and manufactured with strobe lamps so that purchasers can comply with the laws of several States and local jurisdictions that require these types of lamps. The agency is also requesting comments on whether NHTSA should make permanent its amendment of the flash rate requirement. DATES: Effective Date: The amendments made by this interim final rule are effective May 24, 1994. Comments. Comments must be received on or before July 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Charles Hott, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366&hyph;0247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On May 3, 1991, NHTSA published a final rule establishing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) requiring each new school bus to be equipped with a stop signal arm. (56 FR 20363). A stop signal arm is a device patterned after a conventional ``STOP'' sign and attached to the driver's side of a school bus. When the school bus stops, the stop signal arm automatically extends outward from the bus. Its purpose is to alert motorists that a school bus is stopping or has stopped. The standard specifies requirements about the stop signal arm's appearance, size, conspicuity, operation and location. To enhance the conspicuity of a stop signal arm, Standard No. 131 specifies that the device must be either reflectorized or be illuminated with flashing lamps. If flashing lamps are used to comply with the Standard, they must comply with the requirements for color, flash rate, vibration, moisture, dust, corrosion, photometry, and warpage, as set forth in S6.2 of the Standard. In the preamble to the final rule, the agency stated that the tests for flash rate were patterned after the tests in the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE's) Recommended Practice, J1054, Warning Lamp Alternating Flashers (January 1977). Specifically, S6.2.2 of the final rule states: The lamps on each side of the stop signal arm, when operated at the manufacturer's design load, shall flash at a rate of 60&hyph;120 flashes per minute with a current ``on'' time of 50 percent. NHTSA received a petition for reconsideration of the May 1991 final rule from Epicor Industries, a manufacturer of turn signals, hazard warnings and alternating flashers. It requested that the agency change the requirements for the flash rate for stop signal arm lamps under S6.2.2 to conform with the most recent version of SAE J1054, ``Warning Lamp Flashers, (October 1989). The petitioner stated that such an amendment would assure that the lamps on either side of the stop signal arm would flash alternately and have ``on'' times that meet an accepted requirement and have proven effective. The previous version of SAE J1054 (January 1977), which was used by NHTSA to develop the final requirements of S6.2.2, was determined by the SAE to have been incorrectly written. After reviewing Epicor's petition in light of the modified SAE recommended practice, NHTSA decided to amend S6.2.2 to make the requirement consistent with the most recent SAE Recommended Practice. (57 FR 40131, September 2, 1992). In that notice, the agency explained its decision to revise S6.2.2 to reflect the most recent language adopted in the October 1989 version of J1054. The amended version of S6.2.2 states: S6.2.2‚ê£ Flash rate. The lamps on each side of the stop signal arm, when operated at the manufacturer's design load, shall flash at a rate of 60 to 120 flashes per minute with a current ``on'' time of 30 to 75 percent. The total of the percent current ``on'' time for the two terminals shall be between 90 and 110. II. Petition for Rulemaking On February 22, 1994, Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) petitioned the agency to amend Standard No. 131 to allow the use of strobe lamps on stop signal arms. Blue Bird stated that, according to Specialty Manufacturing Company, one of the largest manufacturers of stop signal arms, approximately 15 percent of the total stop signal arm market (5,000 units) were equipped with strobe lamps in 1992. Citing previous agency notices, Blue Bird stated its belief that NHTSA had not intended, in issuing the May 1991 final rule, to prohibit the use of strobe lamps on stop signal arms. For instance, it stated that in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), the agency had solicited comments about whether the agency should require strobe lamps. 1 1 The agency notes that there was no ANPRM addressing stop signal arms. The discussion described by Blue Bird was contained in the NPRM.
