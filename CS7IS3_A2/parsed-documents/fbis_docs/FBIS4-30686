Up to this point, the strong yen reflected "political pricing" influenced by statements of high-ranking U.S. Government officials, but this time the major difference is that the strong yen has been triggered by fears of U.S. inflation and changes in economic trends encompassing an economic recovery in Japan and Europe. Japan and Europe take the position that the United States must raise its interest rates to calm fears of incipient inflation, but the U.S. Government is cautious out of fear that such a move could interrupt the economic recovery. It appears that the near-term focus will be on whether differences in views among the respective nations can be coordinated at the conference of principal nations (Naples summit) in early July. A factor underlying the recent weakness in the dollar is a move to reduce interest differentials between the United States and Germany. At the beginning of the year, the market rate on 30-year government bonds which serves as a barometer was at 6.3 percent, but recently has risen to around 7.5 percent. On the other hand, the German economy recently showed signs of hitting bottom and market interest rates on 10-year government bonds, which stood at 5.7 percent at the beginning of the year, recently rose to 7.3 percent. Interest rate differentials between the two nations, which stood at about 1 percent in the spring, have shrunk to about 0.2 percent. Such trends have recently encouraged money that was concentrated in dollar-denominated assets to shift to European investments such as mark-denominated assets, causing the recent weak dollar-strong mark relationship. Further, the rise in crude oil and grain markets because of the favorable U.S. economic climate has magnified fears of inflation. Moves to buy marks have also influenced similar moves in yen-denominated assets, leading to the recent strong yen. Market intervention in this cycle has been limited to actions by the Bank of Japan and the expected intervention by the Federal Reserve Board did not take place, accelerating the disposal of dollars while reflecting a lack of any effective measures by the G-7. Further, the quick break in the value of the dollar at 100 yen which was believed to be a line of resistance symbolized the fragility of any cooperative actions to support monetary values. In the near term, the focus will be on whether the G-7 nations will be able to take coordinated intervention action in currency markets. There is the view in certain quarters such as that held by former Ministry of Finance official Makoto Utsumi: "The United States should be formulating tactics and strategy to respond appropriately to speculators." On the other hand, opinions exist such as that of Managing Director Toshiaki Kakimoto of the Japan Research Institute, who says, "If the United States is unable to formulate appropriate tactics and strategy, the weakness in the dollar will persist." On a medium- and long-term basis the markets reflect the view that "the U.S. Government has failed in its efforts to calm fears of inflation," and unless the U.S. authorities quickly prepare clear-cut inflationary measures, pressure to sell the dollar will remain. It appears that Japan and Europe will express the view at the Naples summit that the United States needs to implement a fifth series of interest hikes. The United States fears a decline on three fronts--including stocks and bonds as well as the dollar--causing it to be cautious and posing difficulties for any coordinated action. On the other hand, Japan has already played its financial and fiscal policy cards and manifests conspicuous signs of striking a barrier. It is unclear as to what responses it can effectively formulate in the face of political turmoil.
