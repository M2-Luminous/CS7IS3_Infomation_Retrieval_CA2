What before had been done secretly is now announced openly. Thus, in the new Russian military doctrine the near abroad is declared a zone of vital interests of the former mother country. The change in theoretical declarations goes along with practical successes. The entry of Georgia into the CIS and its consent to the stationing of Russian troops in its territory seems like just the first symptom of Moscow's triumphant march into the near abroad. Thus, in the opinion of Abdudzhalil Samadov, prime minister of Tajikistan, at the completion of the term of the presence of Russian troops in his country (December 1994) they will most likely form the basis for creation of a Russian military base, and a similar agreement is supposed to be reached with Armenia in the near future. As our NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] reporter was told in circles close to the leadership of the Dniester Republic, in talks with Chisinau Moscow is insisting on conversion of the 14th Russian Army, which is stationed in this region, into a military base of the former mother country. Aleksandr Lebed, commanding officer of the 14th Army and an implacable foe of Tiraspol, agrees with this point of view: "It is not necessary to resort to blatant force to convince Chisinau of the need to form a Russian military base on the basis of our army; economic sanctions are enough." The views of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the RF State Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties with countrymen and member of the "Shakhrai party" PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], are much more radical. It is instructive that Zatulin, as a member of Shakhrai's party, belongs more to the democratic camp than to the national-patriotic bloc. PRES today, with two representatives who are vice premiers, occupies key positions in the Russian Government. These views are also quite close to the RF MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Thus, in conversation with an NG reporter Vadim Kuznetsov, director of the MID Department of CIS Affairs, said that the goals of the corresponding Duma committee and his department are identical and they are developing constructive relations with Zatulin. It is another matter that the RF MID is sometimes accused of being too soft. For example, in Zatulin's opinion, Russia should use economic levers to defend the Russian-speaking population in the near abroad. Although Kuznetsov generally agrees with this position, he thinks the Russia should also show flexibility. The department director said that Russia has its own vital interests, and naturally they are above all in the countries of the near abroad. The main task of Russian diplomacy in the near abroad is defense of the Russian-speaking population. "We are now saying directly that we will defend our interests on the basis of the precepts of international law," the Russian diplomat stressed. The position of the RF MID in relation to the separatist regions (the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia, and Nagornyy Karabakh) is analogous. In Kuznetsov's opinion, Russia is guided in these regions by two fundamental and equally weighted principles: "Preservation of the territorial integrity of the corresponding states and granting of broad rights to ethnic formations within the framework of these states on the basis of a formula that should be worked out by political means." It is true that, unlike the chairman of the Duma committee, the Russian diplomats uphold this formula only in the above-mentioned conflict regions: "Application of this principle in other territories is plainly going too far and could provoke new conflicts." It is instructive that the Russian radical democrats too agree with the idea of restoring something like the Russian empire. In the opinion of Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Council of the Federation, the CIS has demonstrated its ineffectiveness. As the chairman of the upper house of the Russian Parliament believes, it would be wise to establish a closer union of several states of the former Soviet Union to which the other countries of the near abroad would be joined after a time. Although there are many differences among the positions of the Russian political parties in relation to the near abroad, they are still fundamentally similar because they proclaim the near abroad to be a zone of vital Russian interests and view Moscow as the natural, realistic defender of ethnic minorities in the new independent states. The "softness" of the positions of official Moscow can hardly create any illusions--the imperialist views of the moderates were also preceded by a period of anticolonial declarations, but an analysis of the metamorphosis of Russian policy in the near abroad allows us to assume that a sharp turn to the right is just a matter of time. It appears that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is right (IZVESTIYA, 27 April 1994): "Two and one-half years ago I ran in the presidential elections with the slogan, 'I will defend Russians and small peoples.' I was called a chauvinist then. But now even Kozyrev is defending (in words for now) the Russians in the Baltic region. Where are the democratic Russians with their universal human values now? Where is the Russian democratic appeal to the regions, 'Take as much sovereignty as you can carry'? It is unseemly even to recall that." So it is not impossible that the idea of a "final dash to the south" may become the foundation of state policy, even if the national patriots are unable to achieve the fall of the present regime.
