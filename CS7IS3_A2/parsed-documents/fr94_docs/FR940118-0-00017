FR940118-0-00017 FR940118-0-00004 One commenter contended that it would be unfair for VA to reduce any of the evaluations in the current rating schedule because doing so could prevent some veterans from maintaining their current levels of evaluation and thereby deprive them of the protection which would otherwise attach to those evaluation levels after 20 years under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 110. VA does not concur. In section 103(a) of the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;86), Congress modified 38 U.S.C. 1155 to provide that a readjustment to the rating schedule will not result in a reduction of any disability evaluation in effect on the date of the readjustment unless that disability has actually improved. The statute effectively protects against the situation which the commenter anticipates. Since no evaluation may be reduced solely due to a readjustment to the rating schedule, a readjustment cannot compromise the potential for any veteran to have an evaluation preserved under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 110. One commenter suggested that VA allow special monthly compensation at the level for aid and attendance whenever a veteran requires hemodialysis three or more times a week. Another commenter suggested that we allow special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) for loss of a single kidney. VA does not concur. The entitlement criteria for special monthly compensation are established by Congress and codified at 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) through (s). Regulations implementing these statutory grants of special monthly compensation are found in VA's Adjudication regulations (38 CFR part 3) rather than in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR part 4). This issue is therefore beyond the scope of the current rulemaking. VA appreciates the comments submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted with the amendments noted above. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory amendment is non-major for the following reasons: (1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. (2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. (3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.
