The council reviewed the agreement signed in Cairo recently between the PLO and Israel regarding the security of Hebron, as well as the broad outlines in the agreement regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for Prime Ministry affairs and minister of information, told the Jordanian news agency that the government considers this agreement a positive step on the road to a comprehensive peaceful solution that leads to the restoration of the basic rights of the Palestinian Arab people on their national soil and territory. Dr. al-'Anani added that the Council of Ministers asserted that the security measures agreed upon between the PLO and Israel, namely, the temporary deployment of international observers from Norway, Denmark, and Italy, will contribute to the protection of the city and its holy sites, since these sites are part of Arab and Islamic heritage. This is in addition to the right of citizens to worship without any restrictions. Dr. al-'Anani said that as a result of the massacre committed by the settlers in Hebron and the consequent martyrdom and injury of dozens of people in the city, the Jordanian Government asserts that the security measures will not be complete unless the Israeli Government evacuates the Israeli settlers from the city of Hebron. This is meant to return basic rights, after settlements were established in the city, and so as to prevent a repeat of the acts of violence that have claimed the lives of innocent Palestinians. Dr. al-'Anani said the PLO is about to undertake major responsibilities in light of the expected developments -- the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and the PLO's takeover of the territory from which Israel is going to withdraw. The government would like to express its support for the PLO so that it will be strengthened and so that can assume its responsibilities in the best possible manner so as to restore the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories and so that the Palestinian people can attain their rights in full.
