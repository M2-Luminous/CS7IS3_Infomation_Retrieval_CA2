"The Crimea needs a body, wielding real power, that would handle all military issues, a Security Council chaired by the Crimean president elected by popular vote," Yermakov told INTERFAX. In his words, the stationing of new and movement of existing military units in the Crimea must be cleared with the Security Council. Yermakov said that he wanted the Black Sea Fleet to be controlled by Russia, but it was up to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to decide who "must show firmness, political will and not take heed of the noise made by various nationalistic groups." He believes that the fleet must become a major element in the security system of the Crimea and CIS member states. Yermakov said that Sevastopol, an integral part of the Crimean Republic, has been and will remain the main base of the Black Sea Fleet. He called for a "civilized" solution of the Crimean problem and emphasized that "changing the borders at this stage may result in a war." "Conditions, historic and political, must be right, but everybody knows now that economically the Crimea is linked with the Russian industry," the presidential candidate said. He believes that Ukraine needs "to mature before it is prepared to give the Crimean back to Russia." Furthermore, Ukraine must become a full member of the CIS economic union. "If Ukraine does not become a member of that union, I think that the Crimea can enter it on its own," Yermakov said. The presidential elections will be held in the Crimea on January 16.
