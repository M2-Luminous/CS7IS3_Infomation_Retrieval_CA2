During the conversation they touched on the state of and prospects for Russian-U.S. military cooperation. The increase in the intensity of ties in this sphere is indicated by the fact that last year there were 17 major events related to establishing cooperation between the two states' armed forces and another 26 are scheduled for the coming year. At the U.S. senators' request Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told them about the features of Russia's new military doctrine. In particular he stressed that it is no coincidence that there is no reference in the "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation Military Doctrine" to Russia not being the first to use nuclear weapons. First, the corresponding U.S., British, and French documents contain no such provision. Second, such a pledge on our part did not enable nuclear weapons to be regarded as a means of averting war and a factor for deterring a potential aggressor. The Russian defense minister described Russia's attitude to the "Partnership for Peace" idea mooted by the United States by saying the following: "We are ready to support the idea insofar as it considers the security interests of all states without exception" and if it is based on an all-Europe rather than a bloc system of security. As we see it, Pavel Grachev pointed out, true partnership means developing political dialogue, regular consultations, and reaching agreed positions, and this activity may culminate in coordinated practical actions. Russia is ready for that kind of cooperation. During the meeting they also discussed questions of cooperation in nuclear disarmament and housing construction for servicemen, in particular servicemen from the troops being withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states. There was also a detailed discussion of Ukrainian and North Korean nuclear policy and Russia's view of these problems. Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation Armed Forces; Andrey Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense minister; and, on the U.S. side, Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, took part in the conversation. It is somewhat symbolic that on the same day the Russian and U.S. defense ministers had their first conversation over the direct telephone line connecting the offices of the heads of the two countries' military departments. Henceforth it will be easier and quicker to resolve urgent "burning" problems. Another step has been taken toward developing military cooperation.
