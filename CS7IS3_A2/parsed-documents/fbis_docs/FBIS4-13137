FBIS4-13137 "drnes074_m_94010" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 JORDAN Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support `Chain of Pressure' Seen JN1604083494 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 16 Apr 94 pp 1, 25 JN1604083494 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Editorial: "False and Rejected Allegations!"] [Text] Following the fedayeen operations carried out by Palestinian citizens inside the "green line" in 'Afula and Hadera in reply to the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, the leaders of Israel have begun to utter threats and level accusations indiscriminately. The most recent threats were uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who accused Jordan of allowing the free movement of Hamas [the Islamic Resistance Movement] on Jordanian territory. They also said that the official Hamas spokesman claimed responsibility for the 'Afula and Hadera operations! It is true that a media official sympathizing with Hamas has boastfully claimed responsibility for these operations. However, the real announcement about this responsibility came first from loudspeakers in the Abu-Khudayr Mosque and other mosques in Gaza. Thus, Israel's allegations that Jordan allows freedom of movement for Hamas--only because a media official claimed responsibility for the two operations--are false and rejected allegations. The threats uttered by the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister are only one link in the chain of pressure and blackmail pursued by the Israeli leadership whenever it feels distressed and encircled. It is known to both us and Israel that Hamas has no political or military organization, nor do its members or sympathizers carry out activities of a military nature, outside occupied Palestine. The whole story is that certain sympathizers in the Arab countries and other countries express support for, and sympathy with, Hamas in the occupied territories. Moreover, those who carried out the 'Afula and Hadera operations were Palestinians from the occupied territories; they carried out the two operations inside Israel despite the cordon and siege imposed on the occupied territories. Jordan, which has rejected such threats in the past and which rejects them today, will not accept this tone by the Israeli leadership, and will not yield to any pressure or blackmail from any party whatsoever. Jordan also believes that the Israeli leadership should realize that its procrastination concerning the peace process, its failure to recognize the Palestinian people's legitimate rights, and its failure to withdraw from the occupied territories are the reason and driving force for all acts of violence. This leadership should be aware that a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace would guarantee regional stability and entrench security. Threats and insistence on both occupation and aggression will only yield more bloodshed, victims, and violence.
