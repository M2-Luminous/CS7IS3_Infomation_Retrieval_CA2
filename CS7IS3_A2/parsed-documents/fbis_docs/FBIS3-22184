The quantity of suspended particle matter (SPM), commonly known as dust particles, has registered a 50 percent increase in the past seven months, while the sulphur dioxide content in the air has shot up by 100 percent in the same period. In addition, 36 lakh kg of organic fluid is discharged from various sources daily, spelling disaster for the crops in the vicinity. The state environment secretary, Mr. J. S. Maini, in his keynote address at a workshop organised by the pollution board here recently, had referred to the substantial increase in air-related diseases among the locals. He had warned that this might assume alarming proportions if allowed to grow unchecked. Pollution is at times so acute in the residential colonies on Batala road that a white sheet left in the open often turns black overnight as the suspended particles settle down. Amritsar now comes a close second to Ludhiana in the pollution chart released by the board every week. The city recorded 840 and 640 microgram normal cubic metre of suspended particles against the permissible limit of 200 microgram normal cubic metre.
