They point out that the handling of the case will not be affected by opinions of relevant experts invited by the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). Mainland legal experts invited by the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) told XINHUA today that the Hangzhou city procuratorial department is delving into the case that occurred on the Qiandao Lake on March 31. The case will be handed over to the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court after the investigations. The mainland legal experts had made detailed explanations to SEF officials and relatives of the Taiwan victims on the case and on how the case was disclosed by the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau when they first arrived in Hangzhou, capital of the province. He Ting, a legal expert from the criminal case investigation bureau under the Ministry of Public Security, said that mainland legal experts had spent half a day briefing the visitors on the case and the investigations. A 40-minute video program and more than 100 slides were shown during the briefing. Later, the SEF officials and the experts invited by SEF were led to the burnt boat "Hairui" on Qiandao Lake in Chunan County. They carefully examined the boat and also took a look at the tools of crime and the snatched goods and money as well as the region of water where the crime took place. He noted that detailed briefings have been made to the SEF officials and the Taiwan experts while the procuratorial department is still making investigations into the case and the case is yet to be tried by the court. Mainland legal experts said that they believe the SEF officials and Taiwan experts should be satisfied if they start from the viewpoint of seeking the truth of the case, because they now know what they wanted to know and have seen what wanted to see. They added, however, that if the SEF officials and Taiwan experts still show doubts about the tools of crime and the booty, or still deny the conclusion the mainland legal departments made through profound investigations, then they are not seeking the truth in a scientific way. The mainland legal experts said that they have noted that there were quite a few guesses, presumptions or even rumors being spread outside China when the case was being investigated. They said it is understandable that some people had doubts and misunderstandings on some issues at that time and it is reasonable that the SEF officials and Taiwan experts may have reached different conclusions on some minor issues of the case now, and thus are raising questions on them. But it will be a vain effort to place obstacles to the development of relations across the Taiwan Straits through "politicizing" the boat fire case or fueling "doubts" by misusing the mainland's sincerity or the materials and details of the case offered by the mainland, since the facts are now very clear and evidence conclusive, mainland legal experts stressed. The mission of the SEF representatives is thus over, and they are expected to leave Hangzhou by plane tomorrow to return to Taibei [Taipei] via Hong Kong.
