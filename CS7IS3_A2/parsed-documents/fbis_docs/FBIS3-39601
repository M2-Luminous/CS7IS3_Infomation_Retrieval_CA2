It has become known that as recently as in December 1993, the Investment Bank AG offered option bonds for the Czech energy concern CEZ, to which Temelin also belongs. This transaction was based on speculations about sizable profits if the state-owned U.S. Eximbank should guarantee loans worth billions for the completion of the Temelin power plant. The Investment Bank AG confirmed the existence of such option bonds during the weekend. In addition, the information bulletin of the Federation of Self-Employed Businessmen No. 212 dated 7 February 1994 leveled the allegation that Bank Austria will assume a sizable portion of the credit guaranteed by the Eximbank. Chancellor Vranitzky was reportedly briefed by the manager of Bank Austria, Gerhard Randa. The information bulletin reads: "His (Vranitzky's) protest letter to the U.S. Senate is being dismissed as `Balkan-like behavior' in Washington because it is no secret there that Vranitzky has known for months about plans concerning a credit guarantee and that Bank Austria is playing a major role in this respect." Vranitzky told APA [Austria Press Agency] on Saturday [12 February] that he did not know Bank Austria wants to assume part of the loan for Temelin. He also denied reports he was briefed by manager Gerhard Randa. The chancellor also stated he would be very surprised if reports about Bank Austria's participation were correct. The city of Vienna owns approximately 53.1 percent of the bank, the government owns 23.7 percent, the Wiener Staedtische insurance company owns 10 percent, and other shareholders own the rest. In a radio interview on Saturday, the general manager of Bank Austria, Rene Alfons Haiden, denied reports about alleged credits by his institute. He confirmed that an international consortium approached his institute on this matter, but that Bank Austria rejected any participation. Asked about the option bonds, Haiden stated that if this information should be true, this would have consequences. [passage omitted]
