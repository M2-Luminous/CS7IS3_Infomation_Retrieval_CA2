Late Wednesday morning, the Kurds -- who met yesterday with the European commissioner responsible for external relations -- are due to hold talks with members of the European Parliament, then give a news conference. Afterward, without having held a demonstration, they are scheduled to leave Belgian territory. Some already left yesterday, though. Louis Tobback was satisfied with this outcome: "I listened to the explanations and demands of the Kurdish representatives here in Brussels. These questions fall under the scope of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I personally am responsible for public order. I am happy we have found some common ground, and I have no reason to fear that the agreements we reached will not be respected." Otherwise, however, the interior minister stuck to his previous statements. From his point of view, according to the information gathered by the Gendarmerie and the National Security Service, there are serious reasons to believe that the events in Brussels are not spontaneous. The presence of several agitators, including the Turkish nationalist movement called Grey Wolves, had been established. Nonetheless, Louis Tobback says the information at his disposal calls for discretion, but he is prepared to pass it on to Parliament. According to our sources, the Gendarmerie and National Security Service think they noticed "personnel" with close links to the Turkish Embassy (or its consulates) at the riot sites. These persons supposedly "guided" the crowds, sometimes pushing them onto the streets, sometimes persuading them to return home. On the Kurdish side, as Louis Tobback confirmed, the police also noticed a strong presence of members of extreme left-wing Belgian groups. Furthermore, it would seem that in 1993, and to an even greater extent in 1992, the famous Grey Wolves actually received subsidies from both the cultural administration and the administration of social affairs of the French-speaking Community! This fact was confirmed Tuesday by the cabinets of Minister Robert Collignon and Minister Magda De Galan, who at the time were in charge of granting the subsidy in question. The reaction of a dumbfounded Louis Tobback was as follows: "Surely it is not true? In the French-speaking community? Ah!" Then, in a humorous tone, he said: "Because the national government would not do such a thing." Admittedly, the subsidy awarded in 1993 was virtually symbolic: 90,000 Belgian francs [BFr], transferred to the Turkish Cultural Association, a nonprofit association located in Rue Josaphat. This association represents the orthodox wing of the Grey Wolves, which has always remained faithful to Colonel Alparslan Turkes. However, the subsidy the year before was at least double this amount. This BFr90,000 subsidy in 1993 was the subject of veritable reports -- all the more so since it was called into question when the French-speaking community learned, in the course of an inspection, that the promised work had not been carried out properly. As a result, the association had to complete work on a grammar school, as well as work involving training and integration. The De Galan cabinet confirmed that the integration appeared not to have taken place as it should have according to the concern of the association. So why was it not simply withdrawn? Because the inspectors were supposedly uncertain that the association was a front for the Grey Wolves -- even though this is a fact of which the members of the association make no secret.
