According to Chao Chih-yuan, vice minister of national defense, the institute, in order to continue its capability to conduct research and development in defense industry, will retain the core defense science and technology personnel. To some sectors of the public who are often skeptical of whether weapons and equipment developed by the institute with lavish funding can meet the basic defense needs, the elimination of superfluous and retention of primary personnel in the institute's upcoming staffing streamlining will, at least, save expenditure on nonessential personnel and avoid foolish waste. However, others are apprehensive that the measure to drastically reduce defense science and technology personnel may undermine the defense industry's foundation built with hard work and affect the country's future capability to develop defense industry. The Chungshan Science Institute's personnel reduction plan will be carried over a period of four years beginning from 1995. The number of current 18,000 staff members will be reduced to about 9,000, including 7,000 for the headquarters, 900 for the aviation research institute, and 1,300 for the systems manufacturing center, while the 5,000-member aviation development center will be transferred to the Hanhsiang Company and will no longer belong to the Chungshany Science Institute.
