Robaina's visit is at the invitation of Salman Khursheed, minister of state for external affairs, who visited Cuba last November. On that occasion, Khursheed conveyed to his Cuban counterpart India's interest in entering spheres such as biotechnology, fishing, and the sugar industry. This nation of over 800 million inhabitants has a high level of scientific-technical development and great trade, and it exerts a marked influence in the region. Before arriving in India, Robaina made a 24-hour visit to Cambodia, where he was received by Cambodia's Foreign Affairs Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut. During Robaina's visit, the two leaders agreed to put political and economic relations on the same level, and coincided in seeking new forms of cooperation for mutual benefit. Robaina arrived in Cambodia at a time when Cambodia is increasingly seeking to incorporate itself into the region as it tries to find a negotiated solution to the conflict in that nation -- through a program of national reconciliation signed in Paris last November. Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will meet with his counterpart Dinesh Singh and with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He will also tour the Indira Gandhi Memorial. On Saturday, Robaina will be in Malaysia, where he is expected to have meetings with important businessmen, after which he will leave for Vietnam, the last stop of this tour through Asia.
