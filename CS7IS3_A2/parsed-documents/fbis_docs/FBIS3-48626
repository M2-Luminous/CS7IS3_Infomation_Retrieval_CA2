(NTT) on Thursday [27 January] denied a newspaper report that it is planning to tie up with American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT and T) and Apple Computer Inc. in the fields of multimedia communications and miniature personal computers with telecommunications functions. "No talks are under way between NTT and the two U.S. companies on the reported tie-up plans," said a spokesman for the domestic telecommunications giant. NTT announced Wednesday it will acquire a stake in General Magic Inc., a California-based multimedia software development house, in a move to develop multimedia technology. Among main investors in General Magic, which was founded in May 1990, are American Telephone and Telegraph Co., (AT and T), Apple Computer Inc., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major business daily, reported in a front-page article Thursday that NTT is considering teaming up directly with AT and T and Apple. NTT and AT and T are expected to set up a joint venture to launch multimedia communications services in Japan that is likely to offer advanced electronic mail services similar to those to be supplied by AT and T in the United States from this summer, the daily said. In order to commercialize new businesses involving advanced telecom services and miniature personal computers with telecom functions in Japan, NTT thinks it essential to introduce techniques for software development from leading U.S. firms, according to the newspaper. In the area of miniature personal computers, a subsidiary called NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc. (NTT Docomo) is planning to link up with Apple on interface technology linking such gadgets with pocket pagers, the daily said. NTT Docomo will develop modem cards with paging functions to incorporate them in Apple's Newton miniature personal computers with telecom functions, it said.
