As we have said on several occasions, this solidarity assistance does not solve our problems; it is, however, a gesture of enormous human value, which our people appreciate. I think it only fair to point out that this time the U.S. Customs authorities in Laredo did not give the caravan as hard a time as they did last year; although one piece of equipment was stopped, no particular desire to obstruct the passage of the caravan was observed. In the same way that we do not economize on words criticizing hostile actions against our country on the part of the profuse [profusa] U.S. Administration, we point out this fact, which in essence also constitutes a change from preceding years. Other interpretations of this conduct on the part of Laredo Customs could be made, without there being a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It appears evident that as the conviction that these are not times for blockades and that such museum pieces of symbolism do no one any good gains ground in U.S. political and business sectors, it has little by little been turning into a de facto presence and a call to be realistic. Nor can the fact that, for some time, not a few administration officials have not been in favor of the embargo -- as they call it in North America -- be (?omitted from) the analysis. This U.S-Cuba Friendship Caravan, whose activists arrive this afternoon and will later travel to several provinces to symbolically present the shipment arriving next week, has also contributed to the determination to open the blockade progressively. It is obvious that such a political decision on the part of the Clinton administration will not be adopted tomorrow. However, the price -- also political -- of not taking these factors into account could become significant.
