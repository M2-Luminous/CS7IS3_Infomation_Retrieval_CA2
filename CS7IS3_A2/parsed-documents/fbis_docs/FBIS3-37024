The REUTER story quotes President Kravchuk as saying that he sees no alternative to a UN-sanctioned air strike and makes a conclusion about the president's altered position on this issue. In fact, though, as the full transcript of Mr. Kravchuk's replies testifies, the Ukrainian president confirmed the correspondent's assumption about coincidence of opinions on the subject held by Ukraine's and Russia's presidents, who are against the bombardment. Replying to a question about who should make the air strike decision, NATO or the UN Security Council, President Kravchuk said quite unambiguously that it should be made by the UN Security Council since it would be a decision on a forceful interference. President Kravchuk further said that he was aware that a variant of developments was possible with bloodshed and massacre which there would be no other way to stop but make such a decision. [sentence as heard] But such a decision must be made by the world community, not just one nation, the Ukrainian president said.
