Interfax learned this today from Yuriy Ushakov, the director of the European Cooperation Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry. The North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation will hold its routine session on the level of foreign ministers in Istanbul next Friday and Saturday. The session will be attended by the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev. On Thursday the foreign ministers of NATO countries will have a conference there. As Ushakov said, "Russia stands for strengthening the Council and for gradually transforming it into an independent agency for multilateral politico-military consultations connected with the CSCE." According to him, at the session of the Council the foreign ministers will adopt a joint statement reflecting their attitude to the pressing issues of European and world politics. In Istanbul we'll underscore our willingness to promptly begin to work out the possible agreement between Russia and NATO on the basis of suggestions [as received] Russia's Defence Minister, Pavel Grachev, outlined in Brussels on May 25," Ushakov said.
