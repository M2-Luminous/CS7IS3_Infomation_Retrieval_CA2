Is this decline unavoidable, or does the current government have the will to react? Do we have the capacity to change this situation? [Alphandery] I do not agree with this view of a decline. I think it is quite the opposite. Look at Africa: France helped mobilize the Bretton Woods institutions when the countries of the CFA [African Financial Community] area broke down completely, and it allocated considerable resources to cancel the debt of 25-billion francs [Fr]. We are making a major effort in Asia, as you will see at the next annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank, of which France holds the presidency. For example, we played a decisive role in bringing Vietnam back onto the international stage. In addition, France has maintained the high level of aid it provides to developing countries. On the American continent, French companies are making inroads through direct investments, and we are set to double our share in the capital of the Interamerican Development Bank. We have major investments in East Europe and Russia, a point which I will return to. Thus, our foreign policy under [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, and especially our foreign economic policy, is very active, much more so than in recent years. The situation is not like before World War I, but our country still holds some sway and we certainly have not collapsed, since we are the world's fourth largest exporter. [Vigneron] How do you see Europe's economic future compared with that of our major American and Asian competitors? Is there a way for European industry to increase its competitiveness other than through relocation? [Alphandery] We must be careful not to base our view of Europe's future on the depressed situation from which we are just emerging. Structurally speaking, our continent has major advantages. For decades now, Europe has accumulated a formidable stock of physical and financial capital. Moreover, it has unrivaled human resources. Who, apart from the Americans, can pride themselves on such a dense network of high-performance universities, educational establishments, and research bodies? Of course, Europe has its problems, but we are trying to resolve them. This is presently the case with our attempts to find a more flexible labor structure, which lies at the heart of European thinking, irrespective of the different ideas some countries may have. It is also true that our secondary education is perhaps not as suited as it should be to the requirements of the modern world. Another problem is the ponderousness of our administrative structures. However, I believe our structural strengths outweigh our weaknesses. Europe must not fear the dynamism of Asia, quite the contrary. All the better if Asia is developing, as there are major markets there for our industry. [Vigneron] In these conditions, why do you defend the idea of a social clause, which will not solve the situation of extreme social poverty in the Third World and whose possible effectiveness looks very limited? Is this not rather a hypocritical way of protecting ourselves from competition from poor nations? [Alphandery] We got our message across very clearly at the G-7 summit on employment in Detroit. The way in which I argued for the clause proved that there is no underlying protectionism, so much so that the Americans adopted it. It is in no way an attempt to prevent developing countries from benefiting from a comparative advantage, that is certainly not the aim. What we are saying is that there are situations that are morally unacceptable -- I am thinking of child labor or forced labor -- and which concern human rights. We wanted to obtain the possibility of discussing this issue of social standards as soon as possible in the framework of the future World Trade Organization (WTO). The Marrakesh plan clearly lays the ground for this. [Vigneron] Do you think, like the Americans, that the OECD should play a more active role in managing major international problems? [Alphandery] First, I would like to say that the OECD has done its job well. The G-7 summit has moreover assigned it important studies, such as that on the labor situation, which was very much appreciated, and, more recently, a study on obstacles to growth. The OECD is therefore performing its role well. In addition, it receives little criticism. The organization is well-managed and I can see no reason to change a winning team. That is why I would like Jean-Claude Paye to continue in his job. In any event, he has the support of France and many other countries. [Vigneron] How far along are we with the studies on employment that are to be presented at the next G-7 summit in Naples? [Alphandery] The Detroit summit on employment was something of a first, since traditionally the G-7 meetings have been devoted to financial and monetary issues. This initiative by the United States concluded with a very interesting result. Of course, there is no single answer to the unemployment problem, but there were points of agreement. For example, everyone agreed that unemployment is as much a structural as an economic problem, and that small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] are a valuable source of jobs. Similarly, everyone agreed on the need for flexibility in the labor market. The policy of vainly forging ahead by increasing budget deficits was unanimously rejected. In short, the discussion was considered sufficiently in-depth to justify a follow-up at the Naples summit. [Vigneron] Is there a good level of coordination within the G-7? [Alphandery] Yes, rather good. The G-7 managed to put out some important messages. The proof of this is that Japan announced a number of recovery plans, and Europe continued to cut interest rates. This proves that the voice of the G-7 was listened to and that this forum of coordination is far from being useless. I stress the word "forum," because the G-7 is not an institution and France refuses any moves toward making it one. [Vigneron] Let us move on to consider Europe. Has Franco German rapprochement made any progress and, after the latest German interest rate cuts, do you feel completely in step with Bundesbank monetary policy? [Alphandery] The important thing, and I would like to emphasize this, is that Europe is continuing to cut short rates despite the rise in Americans interest rates. Yesterday, the [Bank of France's] Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rates. The two cuts in German interest rates in the space of a single week are also welcome. Naturally, this creates a favorable climate across Europe. Why? Because the basic economic conditions are favorable for monetary relaxation. We are therefore on the right tracks, despite the recent rise in U.S. long-term interest rates. Looking beyond that, the central problem is medium-term cooperation, and especially French-German cooperation. The fact that we decided last summer to present all our convergence programs and develop them on the basis of similar inflation and budget deficit hypotheses was a major factor for the stability of Europe and the European Monetary System in particular. If ever a signal was clearly perceived by the international community, this was it. It is based on the extremely simple idea that economic convergence is a precondition for monetary convergence. [Vigneron] What are the concrete signs of this convergence? [Alphandery] First and foremost, both the French and German economies are recovering at quite similar rates: German growth should be around 1 to 1.5 percent this year, while we are forecasting 1.4 percent for France. We have similar aims in terms of budget deficit. There is also another point that is very positive, particularly for the smooth introduction of the second phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]: Germany and France will consecutively assume the presidency of the European Union [EU]. Moreover, within the scope of the Franco-German Economic and Financial Council, I intend to propose to my German counterpart, Theo Waigel, a continuous and joint program to ensure that the action taken by the German presidency will be continued by the French presidency. This is a very beneficial coincidence for European construction. [Vigneron] With the entry, next year, of four new members and the prospect of further EU enlargement to include East European countries by the year 2000, how do you see Europe's institutional and monetary future? Is the nature of the EU not going to change, and is a multispeed Europe not unavoidable? [Alphandery] I am convinced that enlargement through four new members will enrich the EU. These are high-income countries and they will be net creditors. The enrichment will be both literal and figurative! Of course, this enlargement must go hand-in-hand with a deepening of the EU. I will see to this personally since, in the first quarter of 1995, I will be the first president of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers for the new, 16-strong Europe. As for what you call the two-speed Europe, it would be impossible to have different speeds because Europe is based on the principle of equality between states. However, for technical reasons, the Maastricht Treaty itself provides for a variable calendar for Europe. Depending on the degree to which the convergence criteria are met, some countries will be ready for EMU before others. It is wise to ask everyone to meet the convergence criteria and to let everyone do so at their own rate. [Vigneron] Do you not think that the five or six states that will be capable of forming a monetary union will adopt economic measures that will further distance them from the other states? [Alphandery] I do not think so. It would, on the contrary, be a major factor of attraction. When the other countries see that the states that have already achieved monetary union are greatly benefiting from this, they will make even more of an effort to speed up their integration. They will be stimulated by this. [Vigneron] Compared with the measures taken since 1989 by previous governments, does France now have a new policy with regard to the East European countries in transition? In a way, do you not have the feeling that France has missed out on an historic, political, and above all economic opportunity to renew ties, given its past influence in this region of the world? [Alphandery] I will say, first, that foreign policy does not fluctuate according to the whim of governments. Diplomacy is often marked by continuity. However, there have been a number of notable shifts in our policy with regard to Central and East Europe. In particular, there is our will to implement concrete projects that are more immediately noticeable to the people and more directly profitable to the emergence of an economic fabric of private SMEs that will create future employment in these countries. On this last point, I do not agree with your analysis: Many of the officials with whom I have contacts in these countries have expressed their satisfaction at what we are doing. For example, at the beginning of last week, in St. Petersburg, I met with the Russian prime minister and the town's mayor and I saw for myself how much they appreciate France's involvement, both on its own initiative and in association with the international community, as part of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] and the G-7, to ensure development in Russia and other countries. France has mobilized considerable resources and is one of the largest contributors to development in East Europe. The figures prove it: From 1990 to 1993 inclusive, France contributed Fr63.6 billion to help finance East European countries, in the form of direct, bilateral, or EU aid (Fr16.6 billion); export credits (Fr11 billion); and debt restructuring (Fr36 billion for the French share). This considerable effort has made France the fourth largest contributor of aid to Russia (behind Germany, the United States, and Japan) and the second for aid to Central and East Europe (behind Germany but ahead of the United States and Japan). We are also the fourth largest investor in the whole area (behind Germany, the United States, and Italy, but ahead of Japan). As you can see, we are firmly established among the leaders. We are also very well represented by French companies. Look at St. Petersburg: Credit Lyonnais has offices there, and the Banque Nationale de Paris. [Vigneron] France is the second largest foreign investor in St. Petersburg, behind Spain. [Alphandery] I suggested to Mr. Sobchak (Anatoliy Sobtchak, the mayor of St. Petersburg) that the St. Petersburg region should benefit as a priority from the EBRD venture capital fund that we have backed to the tune of Fr120 million. France is present, and this presence is appreciated. My Hungarian counterpart told me that recently, as did the Romanian president during his recent visit to Paris. Do not forget that France also has obligations toward other areas of the world, like Africa. [Vigneron] You recently attended the meeting of the CFA area ministers. Do you expect a favorable context to develop that would give an economic impetus to Africa? [Alphandery] Let us remain prudent. The devaluation of the CFA franc was a very delicate operation. For the time being, everything is going well: Inflation remains under control, most of the countries have signed an agreement with the IMF, and there has been no social explosion. However, the battle has not yet been won. We must remain vigilant. In particular, we must maintain wage levels, broaden the tax base, and generally ensure that there are no divergent policies within the zone. If the operation succeeds, it will create the conditions for renewed competitiveness and, as a result, the well-being of the African people--whose purchasing power has been severely dented by the national deficits and financial asphyxiation--has been improved. The countries of the CFA area must now return to growth so that they can find the room for maneuver enabling them to implement the structural reforms that are so vital for development. [Vigneron] Over the last 30 years, France has been closely involved in the economic policy of the countries of black Africa. Is not their failure to adjust--which resulted in the devaluation--first and foremost France's failure? [Alphandery] No, not at all. The real problem was the deterioration in the terms of trade during the second half of the eighties. The sudden drop in market prices for certain types of raw material almost ruined a number of African countries. It is true that this situation could have been resolved by devaluing the CFA franc at an earlier stage. However, the African countries hesitated for a long time before they made this difficult decision. [Vigneron] France at last appears to have taken an interest in the Asian markets. Do you think that the COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade] guarantees will make it possible for us to increase our economic presence, which is currently judged insufficient in this area of strong growth? [Alphandery] Asia is a very diverse area with many opportunities for our companies, but it is also an area of high risk and intense competition. I therefore think that it is a good sign that 40 percent of COFACE's 1993 pledges and 25 percent of its actual guarantees cover Asia. Our presence in Asia can never be high enough, but the results are there: For example, our exports to Asia are growing rapidly and were up 15 percent in 1993. That means that jobs are being created or saved in France. [Vigneron] But what about relocations? [Alphandery] Relocation works both ways. You also have capital from all over the world investing in France. I cannot repeat enough that, in 1992, France was on a par with Britain and outperformed any other country in attracting direct foreign investments. That just shows how attractive France is and proves that we are an open country. [Vigneron] Are you developing a specific policy with regard to the four Asian tigers [Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan]? [Alphandery] You know, our trade deficit with those four countries as a whole is positive. The only one with which we have a trade deficit is Taiwan. The success we had in Korea with the high-speed train proves how well we are performing. In these countries, our aim is also to increase sales of financial services. Our financial system is very competitive and is one of our main strengths. We make the best use of our strengths. During the GATT negotiations, along with my U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, I laid much emphasis on the liberalization of the financial markets, especially in Asia. We will continue to push this point because negotiations are to resume in this area. [Vigneron] You are president of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank [ADB]. France will host the bank's annual meeting in Nice in early May. What are your expectations? [Alphandery] We expect 2,500 delegates, 1,000 of whom are bankers. The ADB is a development bank that is working very well, to such an extent that it is to double its capital from $24 billion to $48 billion. In Nice, the extraordinary economic development in this region of the world will be confirmed. However, it will also be a forum for making new contacts. In this respect, I believe that the fact we are welcoming a large number of Asian business leaders to France will be an unprecedented opportunity for French companies to lay the ground for future relations.
