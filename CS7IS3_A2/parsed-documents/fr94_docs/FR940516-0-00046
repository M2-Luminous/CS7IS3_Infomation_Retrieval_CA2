FR940516-0-00046 FR940516-0-00013 5. FP controls apply to Iran and Syria for computers controlled by 4A03A or 4A94F (i.e., computers with a CTP of 6 Mtops or greater). See §785.4(d)(1) of this subchapter. List of Items Controlled Note 1: 4A03 includes vector processors, array processors, digital signal processors, logic processors, and equipment for ``image enhancement'' or ``signal processing''. Note 2: The control status of the ``digital computers'' or related equipment described in 4A03 is governed by the control status of other equipment or systems provided: a. The ``digital computers'' or related equipment are essential for the operation of the other equipment or systems; b. The ``digital computers'' or related equipment are not a ``principal element'' of the other equipment or systems; and N.B. 1: The control status of ``signal processing'' or ``image enhancement'' equipment specially designed for other equipment with functions limited to those required for the other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment even if it exceeds the ``principal element'' criterion. N.B. 2: For the control status of ``digital computers'' or related equipment for telecommunications equipment, see the telecommunications entries in Category 5. c. The technology for the ``digital computers'' and related equipment is governed by 4E. ``Digital computers'', ``assemblies'', and related equipment therefor, as follows, and specially designed components therefor: a. Designed or modified for ``fault tolerance''; Note: For the purposes of 4A03.a, ``digital computers'' and related equipment are not considered to be designed or modified for ``fault tolerance'', if they use: 1. Error detection or correction algorithms in ``main storage''; 2. The interconnection of two ``digital computers'' so that, if the active central processing unit fails, an idling but mirroring central processing unit can continue the system's functioning; 3. The interconnection of two central processing units by data channels or by use of shared storage to permit one central processing unit to perform other work until the second central processing unit fails, at which time the first central processing unit takes over in order to continue the system's functioning; or 4. The synchronization of two central processing units by ``software'' so that one central processing unit recognizes when the other central processing unit fails and recovers tasks from the failing unit. b. ``Digital computers'' having a ``composite theoretical performance'' (``CTP'') exceeding 260 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops); c. ``Assemblies'' specially designed or modified to be capable of enhancing performance by aggregation of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') so that the ``CTP'' of the aggregation exceeds the limit in 4A03.b; Note 1: 4A03.c applies only to ``assemblies'' and programmable interconnections not exceeding the limits in 4A03.b, when shipped as unintegrated ``assemblies''. It does not apply to ``assemblies'' inherently limited by nature of their design for use as related equipment controlled by 4A03.d to 4A03.f. Note 2: 4A03.c does not control ``assemblies'' specially designed for a product or family of products whose maximum configuration does not exceed the limits of 4A03.b. d. Graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors exceeding a ``3&hyph;D Vector Rate'' of 1,600,000; e. Equipment performing analog-to-digital conversions exceeding the limits in 3A01.a.5; f. Equipment containing ``terminal interface equipment'' exceeding the limits in 5A02.c; Note: For the purposes of 4A03.f, ``terminal interface equipment'' includes ``local area network'' interfaces, modems and other communications interfaces. ``Local area network'' interfaces are evaluated as ``network access controllers''. g. Equipment, specially designed to provide for the external interconnection of ``digital computers'' or associated equipment, that allows communications at data rates exceeding 80 Mbytes/s. Note: 4A03.g does not control internal interconnection equipment (e.g., backplanes, buses) or passive interconnection equipment. 37. In Category 4 (Computers), ECCN 4A94F is revised to read as follows: 4A94F Computers, ``assemblies'' and related equipment not controlled by 4A01, 4A02, or 4A03, and specially designed components therefor. Requirements Validated License Required: SZ, Iran, Syria, South African military and police Unit: Computers and peripherals in number; parts and accessories in $ value Reason for Control: FP GLV: $0 GCT: No GFW: No List of Items Controlled a. Electronic computers and related equipment, and ``assemblies'' and specially designed components therefor, rated for operation at an ambient temperature above 343 K (70 ○C), but not above 358 K (85 ○C);
