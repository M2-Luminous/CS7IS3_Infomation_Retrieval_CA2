In an exclusive interview with MENA in Tunis, where he is attending the meetings of the OAU Ministerial Council, Abu-Salih said that at times this relationship becomes strained or tense. This is the case now, when it has reached a "saddening" level, but we must do everything possible to maintain this relationship at an appropriate level. The Sudanese minister stressed that the issues under dispute between the two countries, including Hala'ib, are quite simple; finding a solution to this issue will be much simpler than anyone expects. Abu-Salih criticized the media in the two countries, saying that the media should be positive instead of indulging in vituperations that do not serve the two countries' interest. He said that the current tension between Egypt and Sudan was caused by the two countries' foreign ministers failure to hold a meeting as scheduled. He underlined the need to hold this meeting in Khartoum "to demonstrate the Sudanese Government's stand to the Sudanese public." He expressed full confidence that he and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa will work together to resolve all the disputes between the two countries. He stressed the need for confidence between the two countries and for this not to be hampered by "some simple events, such as when Khartoum Province took over some houses that belong to Egyptians there." He said that the image of the Sudanese Government must be changed. Speaking about the Hala'ib problem, Abu-Salih said: We do not want to complicate this problem, because the relationship between Egypt and Sudan is too great to allow this issue to move from a "bilateral framework into international forums."
