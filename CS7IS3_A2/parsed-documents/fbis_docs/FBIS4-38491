He did not think that former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy's signature collection campaign for early presidential elections would be a success. The official believed that even if Rutskoy's supporters collect the one million signatures required to hold a referendum on the issue, neither the State Duma nor the Constitutional Court would have a constitutional case to call a referendum. Speaking on the recent meeting of the Accord in the Name of Russia council he said that friction between Rutskoy and Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, members of the council, was to be expected. Still, he thought it possible that even though Zyuganov was a much more intelligent statement than Rutskoy, he might ally with the latter temporarily in order to change the government. The official said it was strange that former foreign trade minister Sergey Glazyev, a Democratic party deputy in the Duma, had joined a grouping whose goal was to kindle the fires of discontent rather than looking for a constructive alternative to what the government was doing.
