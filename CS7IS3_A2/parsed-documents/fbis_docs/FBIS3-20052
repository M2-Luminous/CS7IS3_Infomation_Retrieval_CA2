According to a joint statement by the city and the police headquarters on Friday, Mayor Gerhard Widder imposed the prohibition in the interest of public security on account of the experiences with actions of Kurdish groups. Nevertheless, the city and the police expect Kurdish actions in Mannheim during the weekend. According to the city, a Kurd gave notice of a demonstration and a mourning procession to commemorate the two Turkish women who set themselves on fire last Monday in order to protest against the situation of the Kurds in Turkey and who died of their injuries. The man who filed the notification had expected 10,000 to 20,000 demonstrators.
