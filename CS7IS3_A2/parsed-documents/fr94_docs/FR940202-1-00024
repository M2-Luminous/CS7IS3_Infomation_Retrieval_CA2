FR940202-1-00024 FR940202-1-00011 For example, our regulations currently require State Medicaid agencies to perform a review of diagnosis and trauma codes to identify injuries for which TPL exist. At the same time we require States to perform data matches with the State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to identify TPL injuries resulting from car accidents. These two matches replicate some of the data. An example of this scenario was presented to HCFA by a midwestern State, which has performed the DMV data match while also performing the required diagnosis and trauma code editing. The DMV match resulted in 9,000 case leads and, of those, 107 cases had TPL. Of those 107 cases, the State had already identified 100 through trauma code editing. The seven new cases yielded a return of $3,623 but the cost to Medicaid of the DMV match was $37,785. A large portion of those costs were reimbursed by HCFA in matching administrative funding, and in retrospect, we recognize that Federal and State funds could have been better spent. By allowing the State a waiver of the DMV data match, HCFA would allow the State to operate its TPL program in a more efficient and cost-effective manner and thus save tax dollars. Under existing regulations, there is no provision for waiver of this activity as long as a State is able to perform the match. Another example that involves a nonproductive effort has been presented by a southern State. The State has reported on its attempt to identify TPL through a quarterly data match with Workers' Compensation. The State averages 96 leads per match. Out of these leads, an average of 89 percent are denied by the carrier or Medicaid never receives a claim, 8 percent of the claims are under the threshold amount for pursuit of cost-effective recovery, and 1 percent are already known to the State. This leaves 2 percent of leads that can be pursued, at an average recovery of $319.18 per claim. The State has not realized any collections for this effort. The cost to the State is approximately 4 to 5 man-days per quarter, plus significant systems expenses. Therefore, performing this data match does not seem to be cost-effective, and it seems to exceed our statutory mandate of performing a ``reasonable effort'' to identify TPL. This State also performs trauma code editing which serves to identify recipients injured on the job. Relief from regulatory requirements would come in the form of a waiver. The State would submit a formal request to the HCFA regional office (RO). The State would be required to provide documentation that demonstrates that the cost of the required activity exceeds the TPL recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity which is being performed by the State. Documentation to support the waiver request could include past claims recovery data that demonstrate the administrative expenses involved in meeting that particular requirement, or a State analysis that documents a cost-effective alternative that accomplishes the same task. HCFA's ROs would consider the individual merits of each waiver request and would grant or deny the waiver request based on cost-effectiveness and State alternatives presented. We would issue separate guidelines for developing and evaluating waiver requests for the new waivers. We currently have cost-effectiveness guidelines in place to govern our existing cost-avoidance waiver process. These guidelines were developed by a national work group comprised of HCFA Central Office (CO) and RO staff, whose purpose was to make the guidelines comprehensive and to ensure consistent application throughout the country. They are found in section 3904.2 of the State Medicaid Manual. We would issue similar guidelines to review waivers resulting from this proposed rule. Sources of data would most likely include claims processing tabulations, State expenditure reports, and savings data from the TPL recovery units and the HCFA Form 64.9a report. CO staff also would provide clarification to RO staff as needed through our regular teleconferences. Consultation on specific waiver requests would be provided routinely, as is currently done in the State plan amendment process, cost-avoidance waivers, trauma code edit waivers, and State TPL action plan submissions. As with our current waiver provisions, ROs would be required to report approvals and disapprovals to CO on an ongoing basis. When changes in waiver status occur, CO also would be notified.
