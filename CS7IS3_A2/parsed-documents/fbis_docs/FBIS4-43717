He wants a solution that leaves national taxation systems more or less untouched, but also makes it impossible to avoid the duty to pay tax on the interest one earns on one's savings. Those EU countries that already have tax control systems should retain them and place their data at the disposal of countries that have systems of deducting tax at the source. In these latter countries, tax should also be deducted from the citizens of other EU countries living there. EU financial institutions would be obliged to keep back the minimum tax to be paid. In this way, Waigel wants to avoid a split in the capital market. As has been the case so far, investors from third countries (non-EU nationals) would be exempt from this tax so as not to disturb the flow of capital into the EU. Bank secrecy would be preserved wherever it exists. Every member country should decide by itself whether the tax on interest is to be included in income tax, or whether it will exist as a separate measure. It should be possible to pay voluntary sums of tax to protect smaller investments. A number of OECD countries have already established rules on the collection of tax on interest rates. Waigel considers it unlikely that there will be an escape of capital sums to exotic tax havens as in the Caribbean or Middle East. He also sees no danger to stock markets, national economies, or currencies. [passage omitted]
