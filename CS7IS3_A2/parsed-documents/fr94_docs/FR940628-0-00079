The introductory text of §195.304(b) is revised to read as follows: §195.304 Testing of components. * * * * * (b) A component, other than pipe, that is the only item being replaced or added to the pipeline system need not be hydrostatically tested under paragraph (a) of this section if the manufacturer certifies that either_ * * * * * 21. Section 195.406 is amended by republishing the introductory text of paragraph (a) and revising paragraph (a)(1) to read as follows: §195.406 Maximum operating pressure. (a) Except for surge pressures and other variations from normal operations, no operator may operate a pipeline at a pressure that exceeds any of the following: (1) The internal design pressure of the pipe determined in accordance with §195.106. However, for steel pipe in pipelines being converted under §195.5, if one or more factors of the design formula (§195.106) are unknown, one of the following pressures is to be used as design pressure: (i) Eighty percent of the first test pressure that produces yield under section N5.0 of Appendix N of ASME B31.8, reduced by the appropriate factors in §§195.106 (a) and (e); or (ii) If the pipe is 323.8 mm (123/4 in) or less outside diameter and is not tested to yield under this paragraph, 1379 kPa (200 psig). * * * * * 22. Section 195.412(a) is revised to read as follows: §195.412 Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under navigable waters. (a) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each calendar year, inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Methods of inspection include walking, driving, flying or other appropriate means of traversing the right-of-way. * * * * * 23. Section 195.416 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraph (h) as paragraph (i) and adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows: §195.416 External corrosion control. (a) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, conduct tests on each buried, in contact with the ground, or submerged pipeline facility in its pipeline system that is under cathodic protection to determine whether the protection is adequate. * * * * * (h) The strength of the pipe, based on actual remaining wall thickness, for paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section may be determined by the procedure in ASME B31G manual for Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines or by the procedure developed by AGA/Battelle_A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG disk). Application of the procedure in the ASME B31G manual or the AGA/Battelle Modified Criterion is applicable to corroded regions (not penetrating the pipe wall) in existing steel pipelines in accordance with limitations set out in the respective procedures. * * * * * Issued in Washington, DC, on June 9, 1994.
