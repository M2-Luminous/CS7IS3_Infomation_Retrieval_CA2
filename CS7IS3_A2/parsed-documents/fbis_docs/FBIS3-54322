[Begin recording] [Correspondent] The fourth session of the ECO Council of Foreign Ministers has opened in Tehran with the presence of more than ten delegations from the member countries. Mr. Foreign Minister, could you briefly explain what issues have so far been discussed in the meeting, and what is the expected outcome of this consular [as heard] meeting? [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. As you know, ten countries have participated at high level -- mostly at the level of foreign ministers -- in this very meeting. In this meeting we will review what the Council of Deputies [deputy ministers] have discussed and the different committees and commissions during last year, before the third foreign ministers' meeting. And these foreign ministers' meetings have been held in Iran, in Pakistan, in Turkey, in different Central Asian countries, and the Caucasus. We have had many committees and commissions. And those committees and commissions they have made many decisions. We have to approve all these decisions. And this is the final approval. According to the Izmir Treaty, the main decisions should be made in the Council of Ministers, which consists mainly of the foreign ministers of these countries. We do hope that we can adopt a timetable for next year and all projects that we are going to fulfill in different countries in connection with the ECO. [Correspondent] When and where will the next session of the ECO foreign ministers be held? [Velayati] Usually, the interval between the ministerial meetings is one year. So, we expect that the next ministerial meeting will be held one year from now, after one year. But, as far as the venue of the meeting is concerned, I have to say that this decision should made during this session. [Correspondent] Thank you very much. [end recording]
