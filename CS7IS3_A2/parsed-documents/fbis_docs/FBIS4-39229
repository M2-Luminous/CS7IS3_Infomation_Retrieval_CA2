There has been no talk of this, and nobody has even had such a thought, so the press services of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the FCS have declared. Moreover, "Vympel" does not exist as such. Following the special group's transfer to the MVD, the "Vega" special subunit was created on its basis. Work is now being conducted within the FCS itself to create its own operational administration. The FCS Press Service does not possess any more detailed information at present.
