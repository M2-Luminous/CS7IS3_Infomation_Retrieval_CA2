From Cairo this report by our correspondent to the talks, 'Umar Zaydani: [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The Civilian Committee concluded its work, and an agreement is now being drafted before it is presented to Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th for ratification. A short while ago, Dr. Sha'th spoke to us: [Sha'th] The Civilian Committee yesterday worked late into the night, until 0300, and completed all its work. However, the papers on which initital agreement was reached have to be ratified by me and General Shahaq, who is in Israel and is expected back at 1200. The two sides may be able to finalize agreement on the transfer of all civilian powers this afternoon, after they introduce the necessary amendments. The Legal Committee is moving very slowly, with the jurisdiction [al-Wilayah] problem being the main sticking point. As for the Civilian Committee, it registered some progress this morning. I think it should be possbile for us to deal with some papers that have been pending since the past week, and thus move to finalize subjects on which agreement is possible, in the hope of addressing the tougher issues, like the jurisdiction. [Zaydani] Nabil Sha'th says the Civilian Committee is addressing some details, including the entry of the Palestinian police force, the withdrawal of the Israeli Defense Force, and the crossings between Israel and Gaza and Jericho. [Sha'th] Some of the papers have failed to address certain details, like the entry of the Palestinian police and the Israeli withdrawal, road zoning, and the crossings between Israel and Gaza. I think these points may be finalized this evening. [Zaydani] On the water issue, Dr. Sha'th said the Palestinians will have exclusive control of water in Gaza and Jericho. Water for the settlements will be brought over from Israel, Nabil Sha'th says. [Sha'th] The water in Gaza and Jericho will be fully under Palestinian control. The drilling of new wells and maintenance of existing wells will also fall under the authority of the Palestinians. Israel will continue to bring water from Israel to the settlements and also to Gaza; we will be charged only the cost of the water that we will get from Israel. The water bound for the settlements will transit land under our sovereignty. The Israeli (Makarot) company will continue to supply the settlements with water. The settlement consumption of water will not exceed the present ceiling. These are the fundamental points. The details will be announced when we sign the paper. [Zaydani] Thus water and its control -- one of the stubborn problems that have blocked the path of the negotiations over the past few days -- is now out of the way. There remain problems to be worked out by the Legal Committee, like the legal jurisdiction in the self-rule areas. The Legal Committee is making progress. The Security Committee's two subcommittees will draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinian detainees. [end recording]
