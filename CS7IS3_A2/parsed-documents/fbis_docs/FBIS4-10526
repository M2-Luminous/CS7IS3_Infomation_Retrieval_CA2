In a letter to the general director of the weekly HAITI EN MARCHE, Dejoie assails the president as audacious. He writes: It seems odd that I can be accused of being a traitor -- unless this accusation comes from a mentally ill, malicious, racist, and embittered Haitian jealous of my democratic stands in favor of the Haitian people. Louis Dejoie II explains that he is not seeking revenge and has not raised a destructive weapon against Haitian brothers, political clans, or social strata but has always preached national reconciliation. Dejoie says he is the victim of a plot against him hatched by the lavalasians. A lavalas brigade from Miami is allegedly already in Port-au-Prince for the purpose of assassinating Minister Dejoie. That would be something! he exclaims, in this letter to the general director of HAITI EN MARCHE.
