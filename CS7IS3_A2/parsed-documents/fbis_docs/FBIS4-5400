Hata, also deputy prime minister who is thought to be one of the most likely candidates to succeed Hosokawa, was speaking at the 25th trilateral commission plenary meeting held in Tokyo. "There is no need for Japan to hold an election now," he told the audience, saying that even Diet deliberations have not begun on the 1994 budget. Hata, who leads Shinseito, warned the new electoral system for the House of Representatives enacted in January may be scrapped if the next general election is held under the current multiseat electoral system. The new electoral system combines single-seat districts and proportional representation seats. But a new electoral map has not been drafted yet. "There are some Diet members who say an election under the current electoral system would be more advantageous for them," he said, adding that such assertion may gain power in the political unrest. Hata also said whatever kind of a new administration comes about, there will be no policy changes that conflict with Hosokawa's reform drive. The foreign minister said it will not be clear until next Monday whether he can go to Morocco to attend a ministerial meeting from April 12 to 15 to sign the final agreement on the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. During the gathering, Hata is expected to discuss with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on resumption of bilateral framework trade talks.
