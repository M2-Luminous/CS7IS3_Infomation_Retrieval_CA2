Trklja: "Tarle: For Us, Krajina Is Zanzibar"] [Text] What are the chances for 300,000 Serbs expelled from Croatia to return to their homes, if there are any chances at all? The Association of Refugees and Exiles in Yugoslavia has sent a letter to United Nations General Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali in which the refugees and exiles request that he help facilitate their return to their homes. Zvonko Tarle, secretary of the association, commenting on this new request and on real possibilities for such an initiative, points out that dilemmas exist concerning the resolution of the refugee problem. Namely, the issue of refugees can be resolved by means of so-called humanitarian relocation or return of refugees. This association is opposed to the relocation of the population and insists on the creation of the conditions for the return of the people to their own homes. Tarle says that Serbs from Croatian towns do not feel that the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] is their own mother state, that they did not fight for it, and that, on the other hand, Yugoslavia, where they have found a temporary residence, does nothing about their return to Croatia. "For many Serbs from the cities, Krajina is just like Zanzibar. This is understandable, because for someone who had lived in Zagreb or Rijeka, Knin or Glina are rather remote. We cannot obtain a passport because the authorities send us to the RSK offices. Yugoslavia sacrificed 300,000 Serbs from Croatia for the legalization of the RSK, and none of us want to live there," Tarle says. The return of Serbs to Croatia is an issue of exceptional importance because, as Tarle says, Serbs would become participants in political life there. "Tudjman wants the Croats to return to the RSK. Recently a delegation even went to Butrus-Ghali to insist on this, and no one ever mentioned this issue to the officials on our behalf," secretary of the Association of Refugees and Exiles says. "Refugees from Bosnia have similar problems," Tarle says, adding: "These people who fled to Yugoslavia are not army deserters. They simply did not want to participate in the bloody civil war. At the same time they do not want to join some single-nationality state of Karadzic's, they want to return to the Bosnia they once knew and in which they lived. The majority of refugees from Croatia, about 80 percent, came with the first wave in 1991. Many got used to life here, but they want to be able to travel to Croatia and want arrangements for their return to be made. We do not have specific data on the number of refugees who wish to return to their homes, but we have conducted polls which indicate that the majority favor such an option." "For example, all 7,000 exiles from Dubrovnik wish to return there, and it is the same with the 10,000 Serbs from Rijeka, and at least 60 percent of the 30,000 Serbs from Osijek want to return to their homes," Zvonko Tarle points out. "Certain differences exist among the refugees from Croatia. Refugees of the former Yugoslav Army officer type who lived there for 10 to 15 years should be distinguished from the Serbs whose families had lived there for 200 to 300 years and whose roots are there," Tarle says. Zvonko Tarle warns that the Croatian assembly will soon, maybe even today, pass the law on the expropriation of the property of people who fled. Thus, the property of all the Serbs who left Croatia will actually be taken away. Even before this law, the practice of transforming the Serbian people into a minority had been underway in Croatia. Namely, if a Serb in Croatia obtains citizenship papers he becomes a citizen of that state and his status, instead of that of a people, becomes that of an ethnic minority. "All of this is well-known," Tarle says, "but Yugoslavia up to now did not insist on these issues anywhere in the world and did not do anything in order to protect the rights of Serbs in Croatia. This is how it was also in Slovenia. Yugoslavia did not show by any gesture that it was interested in its citizens and their property, and former Prime Minister Panic even recognized Slovenia," Tarle says. Answering the question whether it is not too early to speak about a return to Croatia while the war is still going on and in circumstances when Serbian churches, like the one in Karlovac, continue to be demolished, Tarle says that the association does not support the return of refugees and exiles but the creation of conditions for their return. In his opinion, there will be no final peace in this territory as long as all the Serbs do not return to Croatia and the Croats to the republic of Srpska. He believes that the most recent explosion and destruction of the church in Karlovac was not an act of the Croatian Government but of Croatian extremists. "Such acts are not in the interest of the government there, and it condemns them. Even Cardinal Kuharic, who recently invited Serbian priests to return to Croatia, condemned such an act of vandalism. Metropolitan Jovan remains in Ljubljana and is not even thinking of going to Zagreb, although I think that he would be safe in Zagreb, and the people there would protect him with even tanks if that were necessary," Tarle say.
