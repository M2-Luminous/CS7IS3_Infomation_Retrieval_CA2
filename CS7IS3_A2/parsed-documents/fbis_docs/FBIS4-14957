The observers' presence there, he remarked, is futile because, when the new stage of confrontation began, they not only failed to raise their voice over the escalation of the conflict but did not even issue a statement in response to it. According to Shevardnadze, no peace will be achieved in Abkhazia unless there is real Russian support in securing a peaceful settlement of the conflict. This most acute headache suffered by the Georgian president has been augmented by yet another: Elections to the representative organ of South Ossetia -- the State Assembly -- have been held. According to provisional figures, there was a 70-percent turnout; 21 of the 36 seats have been taken, 17 of them by Communist Party deputies. Fifteen candidates, including current State Assembly Chairman Lyudvig Chibirov, will take part in repeat elections on 10 April, as they failed to win the requisite number of votes. Official Tbilisi has reacted to the holding of these elections in a sharly negative way, regarding them as unlawful. The South Ossetian autonomous formation was abolished by the Georgian Supreme Council back in December 1990, in the wake of which ethnic conflict broke out in the region. Commenting on the elections, Vazha Khachapuridze, chief state counsellor-coordinator for the leader of Georgia on questions of defense and national security, stated that they are an unlawful attempt to detach Shida Kartli -- as the Georgian side calls this region -- from the Republic of Georgia.
