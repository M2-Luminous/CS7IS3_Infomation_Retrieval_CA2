In connection with this the head of the Israeli Government noted in particular: "I am looking forward to my visit to Russia. It will be my first visit to Moscow, and these will be my first meetings with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. I have already met Foreign Minister Kozyrev several times, and in my view, he is a very intelligent and businesslike person. I have also met with other figures from the upper echelons of the Russian Government. I intend to discuss a number of questions concerning bilateral relations in the sphere of the economy, trade, and agriculture. During my visit certain agreements may be signed. In addition I will be going to St. Petersburg -- the native city of my mother and her family." Touching on the problems of the Near East settlement, Y. Rabin especially stressed that "Russia, as one of the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference, could help to create conditions facilitating direct talks between ourselves and other participants in the conflict. Peace cannot be imposed, but the cosponsors can help to bring it nearer." [last sentence omitted in later "Nighttime Edition" of newspaper] Dwelling on Israeli-Russian relations, Yitzhaq Rabin noted: "Russia is a large country. Many Israeli citizens were born in Russia, so that Russian culture has had a huge influence on Israel. This applies to music, literature, and poetry. Many new immigrants, arriving here from Russia, brought with them their extensive abilities in the most varied spheres. I can state with confidence that Israel has numerous and deep roots in Russia."
