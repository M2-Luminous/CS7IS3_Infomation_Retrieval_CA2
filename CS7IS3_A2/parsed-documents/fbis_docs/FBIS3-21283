Unless something unforeseen happens, the budget this year will be presented on or before 28 February. Before it, the traditional financial survey will be presented. Due to the accusations levied in the report that the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) had presented, Manmohan Singh, and not others, had submitted his resignation. This resignation had created an atmosphere of uncertainty. The prime minister, by rejecting it, had removed this fog of uncertainty. Whether Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was right or wrong in doing so is not appropriate for discussion here. We have to limit our discussion here to inflation and other economic issues. The Congress (I) could not reduce prices of commodities within 100 days as it promised in its election manifesto. Instead, the prices increased. As for the present fiscal year, prices of coal and steel increased. This increase was affected by the government itself and did so by saying that their production costs had increased. The wages for laborers had to be increased. Almost a similar reason was given for increasing railway fares and cargo rates. Except for one time, the rate of inflation averaged 8.5 percent. If the finance minister wants to reduced budget deficit, which is his greatest challenge at this time, he must reduce inflation rate and prices of commodities. We cannot say that nature is not helping the finance minister. Like the last five years, there were good rains this year also. More than 180 million tons of grains were produced. Production of oil seeds always cause concern, however, this year their production was satisfactory to an extent. Saurashtra, where we have good yield of peanuts, could not produce as good a peanut harvest as expected because of natural catastrophes. Despite the good grains harvest and satisfactory oil seeds production, the prices of grains and oil seeds have increased. Even more troubling is the increase in pulses prices. In a country like India, be one rich or poor, pulses are the main source of proteins. Last year, pulses were around 15-16, and now arhar pulse, the most popular of the pulses, costs 23 rupees per kilogram. The same is true about mung, urd, and other pulses. The combination of these reasons has increased the cost of living by 10.7 percent and the wholesale price index has gone up by 9 percent. The increase in inflation during this fiscal year will force the finance minister to seriously rethink his policies about prices and control in other areas. He has to keep in mind that there was no such thing as the Gulf war this year which could help an average citizen to understand the reason for price increase and excuse him for it. The government did lift control over the lubricants, however this could not have affected the inflation rate to rise 10-11 percent. What is the reason for it? The finance minister has to think about it. There was a rumor that the finance ministry was increasing petroleum prices to help reduce the cost of subsidies. However, there were elections in five states. Perhaps, that is why the finance ministry had to drop the idea of increasing petroleum prices. If we look at the price indicators of the first half before December 1993, we will find that there was an increase of prices of almost all the listed items. The most significant aspect was the increase in electricity rates. The prices of fuel were also up. All these affect the common people. One reason for the increase in electricity rates is the widespread theft of electric power. The government of the Electricity Board is not able to stop it. This theft usually occurs where electricity lines pass through slums where they pirate electricity by connecting illegally. When the question of taken action against these arises, the electricity department is told to be quiet and do not do anything.' [sentence as published] The leaders tell them, "It is where we will get our votes from." In other category are those rich people who damage their meters. This question is related to ethics and should be corrected at that level. The consumers and the corrupt electricity department employees work together in stealing electricity this way. The price indicator last year was 231, and it has increased to more than 240 this year. The prices of grains increased by 8.8 percent, prices of pulses by 40 percent, and electricity rates by 37 percent. The rise prices of oil seeds was the least, a record of half percent. Sugar prices increased by about 30 percent. Other increases were: cloth 10 percent, steal by percent, and chemical products about 5 percent. Measures should be taken to stop additional increases, only then will the inflation be checked. It is not impossible to do that. There was good agricultural production in 1992-93 and receipt were also good. Because of the additional agricultural production of 180 million, receipts were high again. By the middle of 1994, the government warehouses will be full with these collected grains. In some parts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Punjab, the cotton crop was badly destroyed by disease. That led to the recent increase in cotton prices. Still, no demand was made to import cotton. This means that what was produced will meet the need of our country. It is true that there has been some reduction in the production of sugar. Compared to the 1992-93 production of 13.4 million tons, this year the production was only 10.6 million tons, and this reduction has affected increase in its prices. It is estimated that the production of sugar will reach 11 million tons. The challenge the finance minister has to meet while writing the 1994-95 budget will require help from gods. This help should be in the form of increased agricultural production. At the same time, there should a sizeable increase in industrial production. Chemical fertilizers and electric power must he provided to farmers and industrialists at subsidized rates. If it is not done then clearly the industrialists and farmers will not be able to do their job lacking these basic needs of production. If the rates of fertilizers and electricity increase, they will not have the purchasing power to meet their needs, and this will finally result in four-fold increase in prices.
