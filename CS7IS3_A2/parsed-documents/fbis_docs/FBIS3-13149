Last year the Pentagon decided to ban direct military procurement through commercial channels and compel all countries receiving military aid to place their orders through U.S. Army components. The decision was made in the wake of the Rami Dotan affair in a bid to improve U.S. control over the use of aid funds. Israel objected to the amendment of the regulations, claiming it will increase costs and complicate military procurement. Israel's supporters in Congress exerted heavy pressure and managed to put off the enforcement of the new regulations until June 1994. Rabin will now try to get another reprieve, and will ask the administration to take Israel's unique needs into consideration. The prime minister will say Israel is prepared to make its purchases through military channels, if in special cases it is allowed to buy military equipment directly from the manufacturers. Rabin's visit in the United States will mainly be devoted to the peace process, and security issues will not feature prominently in his meeting with President Bill Clinton. [passage omitted]
