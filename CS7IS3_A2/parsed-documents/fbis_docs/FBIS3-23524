Kurguzov] [Text] In the late 1970's the U.S. military-political leadership concluded there was a need to form a specially trained Armed Forces contingent for emergency use in areas of "vital national interests" with the appearance of crisis situations there. Formations and units assigned to it from the Armed Services were supposed to have high combat readiness and strategic and operational mobility and be capable of performing combat missions in any region of the world as applied to specific situations. That conclusion was preceded by an in-depth analysis of prospects for development of the world military-political situation, above all in areas of the Near and Middle East -- sources of oil production and areas strategically important to the United States -- and also Southeast Asia. In this connection, in July 1977 the U.S. Secretary of Defense prepared and submitted a special document to Congress entitled "PRM (Presidential Review Memorandum)-10." Along with an analysis of the world military-political situation, it contained a substantiation of the need for establishing a "Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force." In the course of a thorough study and discussion of this problem, the U.S. Congress approved proposals submitted by the Secretary of Defense and decided to finance a program for establishing a Rapid Deployment Force, [RDF],[.sup]1[/] which President J. Carter announced on 1 October 1979. Development of the optimum version of an RDF structure as well as of forms and methods of its combat employment began simultaneously on staffs of the Armed Services. In the first phase this work was headed by the Army Staff, inasmuch as it was believed that the ground component would play the key role in a future RDF. Korea, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf initially were included in the RDF operational mission area. But important world events which occurred in subsequent years, including the Islamic revolution in Iran, beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, introduction of Soviet troops to Afghanistan and a sharp exacerbation of relations between Israel and neighboring Arab states forced the U.S. military-political leadership to partially revise the missions and geographic regions of responsibility of the RDF being established, while retaining its overall organizational development concept. Thus, in this period the entire Near East and Northeast Africa were included additionally in the RDF operational mission area. In March 1980 the Defense Department officially announced formation of RDF Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base [AFB] (Florida) and appointment of a commander in chief. Its operational-strategic purpose remained the same--readiness for emergency movement and independent operations in various regions of the world to defend U.S. "vital interests". At that time the RDF effective combat strength numbered around 290,000 persons. Its basis consisted of four divisions (airborne, air assault, mechanized and Marine), two separate brigades (antitank helicopter and Marine), five tactical air wings, three carrier battle groups and three amphibious groups as well as combat and logistic support units and subunits. Views on the RDF role and missions underwent certain changes with the Reagan Administration's arrival in power. As of 1 October 1981 the RDF commander in chief was directly subordinated to the U.S. Armed Forces JCS and the RDF itself was redesignated the RDJTF. The commander-in-chief and staff of this force element were made responsible for drawing up plans for employing the RDF in Southwest Asia and organizing and conducting its operational and combat training. As of 1 January 1983 the RDJTF was given the status of a U.S. Armed Forces unified command designated the unified Central Command -- CENTCOM (headquarters at MacDill AFB). CENTCOM's geographic region of responsibility was retained, but two strategic bomber squadrons of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command, which existed at that time, and in 1966 also the 7th and 10th light infantry divisions were added to the RDF makeup. In the period of reorganization of U.S. Armed Forces unified and specified commands in 1987, the ground, sea and air components of the RDF were removed from operational subordination of CENTCOM. At the same time a conclusion was drawn about the need to train RDF basic components for operations in essentially all regions of the world, now in support of commanders in chief of unified commands in forward areas. In terms of operational structure, the U.S. Armed Forces presently have been placed in nine unified commands and one specified command (with rights of a unified command). The unified commands are classified according to the presence of geographic zones of responsibility and functional tasking, and all are operationally subordinate to the president through the secretary of defense. Five unified commands perform functions of operational command and control of U.S. Armed Forces groupings in forward areas in peacetime and with the appearance of crisis situations there, fulfilling the key role in implementing the concept of U.S. "forward presence," carried out to protect U.S. national interests on a global and regional scale. In this connection, operational plans for RDF employment are drawn up by their staffs directly in forward areas and approved by the JCS. The annual report of the U.S. Secretary of Defense to Congress cites geographic areas of responsibility of these five unified commands, which include the following regions: - Atlantic Ocean area--Atlantic Ocean (west of 17� east longitude), Caribbean Sea, Pacific Ocean area (east of 92� west longitude), excluding South America; - Northeast Africa and Southwest Asia, including the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea; - European area--Europe (including Eastern European countries), Great Britain and Ireland, Mediterranean Sea waters, a portion of the territory of the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria) and the African continent (less Northeast Africa); - Pacific Ocean area--Pacific Ocean (except for waters included in the area of responsibility of the unified Atlantic Command), Indian Ocean, Japan, Korea, China and other countries of Southeastern Asia; - Central and South America area--Central and South America (excluding Mexico). Territories of states of the former USSR, Canada, Mexico and the continental United States are not included in areas of responsibility of unified commands. The following are primary missions of unified commands in forward areas: - monitoring the military-political situation, conducting reconnaissance, security and defense of U.S. military and civilian installations; - operational direction, training, and combat and logistic support of U.S. troops (forces stationed in their areas of responsibility on a permanent or temporary basis); - planning and immediate direction (in case of a crisis) of operational deployment and combat employment of Armed Forces groupings (including RDF components) and support of operational coordination with allied forces; - evacuating U.S. citizens from zones of military conflicts or natural disasters; - fulfilling functions of U.S. Armed Forces representation in states and international organizations within the area of responsibility and directing measures for giving military aid to friendly countries. In the estimate of U.S. military experts, this geostrategic allocation ensures continuous monitoring of the development of the world military-political situation by the U.S. leadership, and if necessary enables influencing the situation in its own interests on an emergency basis by a show of military might or the direct use of armed forces. The list of RDF functional missions was expanded considerably in the early 1990's in connection with cardinal changes in the world military-political situation and the beginning of reorganization and partial reduction of the U.S. Armed Forces. In accordance with a new national military strategy adopted in 1992, the RDF began to be viewed as a "contingency force," with its primary specific purpose remaining unchanged. During its existence, the U.S. RDF repeatedly has been involved in performing missions in the course of U.S. Armed Forces operations in forward areas. Operation Just Cause (Panama, 1989), Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Southwest Asia, 1990-1991) and Restore Hope (Somalia, 1992-1993) are among the largest of them. In 1992, during measures which began in the United States to implement a new national military strategy, the U.S. command updated RDF missions and effective combat strength and specified new requirements for its strategic mobility. This was covered widely in official U.S. Defense Department sources and in the U.S. military press. In accordance with the "base forces" concept, which is the basis of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development for the next 5-7 years, the RDF is viewed as a special operational-strategic component intended for emergency response to possible changes in the military-political situation in individual regions of the world in order to protect national interests of the United States and its allies. Guidance documents emphasize that the following are primary RDF missions: Readiness for emergency movement to any region of the world; comprehensive support to allies and pro-American regimes by building up military presence, by a show of force, and if necessary also by conducting combat operations; protection (security and defense) and evacuation of U.S. citizens and installations in crisis areas. Along with this, the following have been specified as new, additional RDF missions at the present time: Stopping proliferation of mass destruction weapons in Third World countries, combating international terrorism and the drug trade, and performing "peacemaking missions" along UN lines. U.S. Armed Forces groupings in overseas theaters are viewed as a base for deploying a forward echelon and then also the main body of the RDF. An important feature of the present stage of U.S. military organizational development is the fact that the U.S. command does not view the RDF as an operational-strategic or operational command with a permanent makeup. A number of U.S. military publications emphasize that the most combat-ready, mobile units stationed on a permanent basis in the continental United States -- the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps, seven wings of the Air Force Tactical Air Command, and the 1st Marine Division -- are the basis of the RDF. In the opinion of General C. Powell, Chairman of the JCS, this force should be oriented toward use above all in those areas where a permanent U.S. military presence is limited for political, economic or other reasons. The U.S. military-political leadership includes above all the Near and Middle East, Africa, and the Central and South American area among such regions. At the same time, employing the RDF in any other region that is strategically important to the United States also is not precluded. Using other Armed Forces components for emergency response to crisis situations in various regions of the world also is envisaged. Thus, based on experience of military conflicts and of U.S. Armed Forces operations as well as a number of operational-strategic exercises, the following may be involved in operations as part of the RDF (see figure): Headquarters 3rd Army, XVIII Airborne Corps (six divisions), a Special Forces Group and two Ranger battalions of the Army; Headquarters 9th Air Force and ten air wings of the Air Force Tactical Air Command; up to three carrier battle groups and three amphibious groups, a Marine expeditionary division and expeditionary brigade, five squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft and a squadron of Navy depot ships. If necessary, strategic bombers and submarines armed with conventional weapons may be included in it additionally. There can be a total of up to 300,000 servicemen, 700-750 tanks, around 1,000 guns, mortars and MLRS, over 800 combat aircraft and up to 40 combatant ships in the RDF with this operational makeup. Strategic deployment of the RDF in crisis areas has to be supported by forces of the Air Force Military Airlift Command and the Navy Military Sealift Command with the involvement (if necessary) of aircraft and vessels of civilian companies. In accordance with the "base forces" concept, different options are envisaged for establishing and building up RDF groupings in centers of tension. Their makeup will be determined by the U.S. Armed Forces commander in chief in the strategic area based on the degree of threat to U.S. interests, the level of conflict and the minimum required number of forces and assets for localizing it in a short time. A buildup can be accomplished by movements of troops from the continental United States earmarked for reinforcing an Armed Forces grouping in a given area and by using forces and assets directly from the RDF makeup. According to views of the U.S. command, features of physical-geographic conditions and operational preparation of forward areas and the diversity of possible RDF operational missions dictate the need for the presence in it of highly mobile units of diverse makeup from all the Armed Services. Thus, the following are assigned to the main complement of Army forces and assets earmarked for operations as part of the RDF: Headquarters, 3rd Army (Fort McPherson, Georgia), which is the main body for operational command and control of the RDF Army component; Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps (Fort Bragg, North Carolina); 82nd Airborne Division (Fort Bragg); 101st Air Assault Division (Fort Campbell, Kentucky); 24th Mechanized Division (Fort Stewart, Georgia); 1st Cavalry (Armored) Division (Fort Hood, Texas); 7th Light Infantry Division (Fort Ord, California); 10th Light Infantry Division (Fort Drum, New York), units and subunits of field artillery, air defense, Army aviation, and combat and logistic support from the corps makeup, as well as attached units. In addition, depending on the region where operational missions are being performed, the RDF may include a Special Forces Group, Ranger subunits, and psychological operations, intelligence and EW, and combat and logistic support units. Each division making up the XVIII Airborne Corps (airborne, air assault, light infantry, mechanized and armored) presently has its own table of organization structure and is earmarked for performing specific combat missions. But composite task forces of a mixed makeup may be established under certain conditions based on units of these divisions, reinforced by Special Forces and Marine subunits, as was the case in Panama and during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. That approach ensures expansion of these units' functional missions, especially during operations under special conditions (on coastal axes, in a city, in the jungle, in a desert and so on). The Army component of the RDF may have a total of 100,000-120,000 persons, up to 650 tanks, over 800 guns, mortars and MLRS, over 1,500 ATGM systems, around 670 air defense weapons and over 1,100 helicopters (including around 540 attack helicopters). Based on available strategic movement assets and the experience of deployment in the period of the Persian Gulf military conflict, the following strategic mobility standards have been established for XVIII Airborne Corps formations: A "light" division is airlifted to any forward zone in 12 days and a brigade from its makeup in 4 days; a simultaneous combination movement (by air and sea) of two "heavy" divisions is accomplished in 30 days. Deployment of XVIII Airborne Corps with a full complement of units of corps subordination in any overseas theater must be completed in 75 days. U.S. experts emphasize that prepositioned stockpiles of weapons, military vehicles and supplies in potential conflict areas as well as forces and assets for supporting the accelerated movement of troops there are of special significance in questions of improving RDF strategic mobility. In connection with this, the U.S. military budget provides annual appropriations for resolving such problems. The 82nd Airborne Division is considered the most combat-ready formation of the U.S. Army. Its units and subunits are intended for operations in the RDF forward echelon, and so the following operational standards have been established for them: - all personnel are assembled in 2 hours (each serviceman in the division is obligated to have a portable beeper constantly on his person); - one division brigade is on alert duty in 18-hour readiness for moving to any region of the world; - an airborne battalion is assigned by schedule from this brigade with readiness of its companies for movement set at 2, 4 and 6 hours respectively; - one division airborne company is constantly on alert duty at Pope AFB in 15-minute readiness (after receipt of a signal) for loading on C-130 military transport aircraft. Special rigging subunits are attached to the division whose primary mission is to ensure accelerated preparation for the assault landing and loading of weapons and supplies into aircraft. Essentially all division personnel have taken part in combat operations during various U.S. Armed Forces operations and have a high level of professional training. Special attention is attached to paratroop training. Combat subunits make parachute jumps weekly and division staff officers (as well as those on the XVIII Airborne Corps staff) do so 1-2 times a month. All jumps are made with personal weapons and full gear, and over half at night and under extreme conditions. Possibilities of creating a separate light armored cavalry regiment as a separate unit of XVIII Airborne Corps are being studied. It is assumed that this unit will be the 2nd Separate Armored Cavalry Regiment, brought back from the FRG in 1992 and in a stage of reorganization at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Three light reconnaissance battalions, an Army aviation battalion, air defense battery and mortar company may make up the basis of the regiment's organizational structure. In addition, it will include a combat engineer company and NBC company as well as a logistic support battalion. The proposed numerical strength of the regiment is around 4,000. Initially it will be equipped with multipurpose Hummer motor vehicles and OH-58D reconnaissance helicopters, and in the future with light tanks, new-generation combat reconnaissance vehicles and Comanche helicopters being created. The U.S. military press has mentioned repeatedly that strategic bomber and tactical air wings of 9th Air Force (Headquarters at Shaw AFB, South Carolina) are the basis of the RDF Air Force component. Units of different air components are represented in the 9th Air Force structure, which ensures its effective combat employment in low- and medium-intensity conflicts in essentially all overseas theaters. According to data of AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, its order of battle includes ten air wings: Two strategic bomber (42nd and 416th), six fighter (1st, 31st, 33rd, 56th, 347th and 363rd) and two composite (4th and 23rd). An option is being examined for disbanding three wings in the process of implementing the overall program for reducing the numerical and effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces. The 9th Air Force inventory presently includes 15 B-52 strategic bombers, 610 F-15, F-16 and A-10 combat aircraft of tactical aviation, 85 KC-135 and KC-10 tanker aircraft and 50 C-130 tactical transport aircraft. The 9th Air Force organizational structure provides for strategic movement of RDF first echelon components to forward areas, their air cover in the course of operational deployment, and close air support in conducting operations. The question now being discussed about the possibility of establishing a composite air-land formation based on the 23rd Composite Air Wing and 82nd Airborne Division and capable of operating independently in any theaters deserves attention in this regard. It is proposed that the 23rd Composite Air Wing will include squadrons of C-130 transport aircraft (10-12), A-10 attack aircraft (24), F-16 tactical fighters (24), as well as combat support aircraft. Within a theater this wing will be able to carry out the airlift and landing of up to two battalions of 82nd Airborne Division and in addition provide close air support of division units in performing the combat mission. The U.S. command's approach to assigning forces and assets from the Navy to the RDF is very characteristic. It is determined by national naval strategy presently in effect which provides for the constant presence of groupings of U.S. naval forces in strategic regions most important to the United States -- in the Atlantic (Second Fleet), Mediterranean (Sixth Fleet), Indian Ocean and Western Pacific (Seventh Fleet), and Central and Eastern Pacific (Third Fleet). In connection with this, the makeup of the RDF grouping established with the appearance of a crisis in one of the forward areas will include naval components which are in immediate proximity to the center of conflict, and if necessary also moved in from adjacent areas. Activity of the U.S. Navy composite task force performing combat missions in the Persian Gulf is most indicative in this respect. It has been operating there since the time of the war against Iraq. Its makeup increased from 8 to 20 combatant ships in different stages of the escalation of tension in the region. There are 1-2 carrier battle groups and an amphibious group (with a Marine expeditionary battalion aboard) constantly present in it (by rotation). Ships of this task force took part in delivering air and cruise missile strikes against Iraq during the U.S. Armed Forces Operation Desert Sting (January 1993), and they delivered the missile strike against Baghdad on 26 June 1993. According to press reports, the type makeup of a carrier battle group may include 6-11 ships (including one carrier), 1-2 guided missile cruisers, 2-3 guided missile destroyers and frigates, 1-3 destroyers and frigates and 1-2 nuclear powered multipurpose submarines (SSN's). The type makeup of deck-based aviation of a carrier battle group includes over 80 combat aircraft and helicopters, of which 34-40 are nuclear weapon platforms. In some cases a missile battle group may be established and used instead of a carrier battle group. It can have 5-8 ships, including up to 2 guided missile cruisers, 3-5 destroyers and frigates and an SSN. Arming missile battle group ships with Tomahawk cruise missiles, intended for delivering precision strikes against shore targets and forces of surface ships, gives them the capability of effectively supporting ground troops operating on coastal axes, and in some areas performing some of the missions assigned to a carrier battle group. A ship striking force (3-4 ships) may include a guided missile cruiser and 2-3 destroyers armed both with antiship cruise missiles as well as with Tomahawk cruise missiles for firing against ground targets. An amphibious group, intended for moving and landing amphibious assault forces, includes from 3 to 8 landing ships for various purposes, including one helicopter carrier or amphibious assault ship. Under ordinary conditions, one Marine expeditionary battalion is accommodated aboard ships of one group. A Marine expeditionary division with an overall numerical strength of up to 50,000 persons is capable of operating as part of the RDF both independently as well as together with naval ship forces, ground troops and air forces. It includes a Marine division, reinforcing units and subunits and an air wing. The Marine expeditionary division can be landed in 3-5 days on a beachhead up to 30 km wide and up to 40 km deep. A Marine expeditionary brigade numbering 10,000-16,000 persons consists of a regimental landing team, composite air group and brigade service support group. The Marine expeditionary brigade can be landed on a beachhead 7-10 km wide and up to 15 km deep, and the overall time for landing its first echelon is up to 3 days. A Marine expeditionary battalion numbering up to 2,500 persons includes a battalion landing team, composite helicopter squadron and battalion service support group. It lands on a beachhead 1.5 km wide and up to 5 km deep. Assault subunits of the battalion landing team are landed in an hour and the entire battalion landing team in 4-6 hours. Squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft (each with eight P-3C Orions) are employed as part of the RDF both independently as well as in coordination with naval ship forces for conducting visual reconnaissance and SIGINT collection, hunting and killing submarines and laying mines. The 1st Marine Division (Camp Pendleton, California) and 7th Marine Brigade (Twentynine Palms, California) are earmarked for operations as part of the RDF. With the appearance of a crisis in Southwest Asia, the forward echelon of 1st Marine Division and 7th Marine Brigade will be airlifted to the conflict area and draw weapons and military equipment from depot ships of 2nd Squadron based at Diego Garcia Island, in the Indian Ocean. Stockpiles of weapons have been established on depot ships for a Marine expeditionary brigade and an Army brigade, as well as stockpiles of supplies for supporting their operations for 30 days. In the assessments of Pentagon representatives, a priority direction of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development in the next few years will be comprehensive development of means of strategic movements. Within the framework of accomplishing this task it is planned to implement programs to create new C-17 transport aircraft capable of delivering large combat equipment to combat operations areas and to outfit U.S. Air Force military transport aviation with them. Simultaneously, by the end of 1997 it is planned to bring the overall number of depot ships in forward areas to 34 (including 13 with Marine armament and 21 with heavy equipment for the Army). U.S. military experts believe that implementation of these plans will permit a significant reduction in existing standards for strategic deployment of the RDF in overseas theaters by the year 2,000. The U.S. command is giving heightened attention to questions of RDF technical outfitting and operational and combat training. In particular, RDF formations and units are being outfitted with modern weapons and vehicles and being manned by the best trained and most experienced servicemen, who as a rule have combat experience. In accordance with the global direction of RDF training, subunits from its makeup periodically take part in operational measures (exercises, ground reconnaissance, inspections) in potential military conflict areas -- Europe, Central and South America, the Near and Middle East, and Africa. Integrated RDF exercises are held regularly in the continental United States. Their training background conforms to particular exacerbations of the military-political situation in various regions of the world. According to foreign military press reports, despite reduced appropriations for military purposes, the United States continues to work actively to create new and modernize existing models of weapons, military vehicles and means of logistic support for troops. Thus, tests of a new tank to be supplied to "light" formations of the RDF presently are being conducted on a competitive basis. The following are the main tactical and technical specifications for it: Crew of four, combat weight not over 20 tons, air-transportability, possibility of being parachute-landed, armament consisting of a 105-mm gun and two machineguns (7.62-mm and 12.7-mm), computerized fire control system, and top speed of at least 70 km/hr. Great importance also is attached to outfitting units and subunits with qualitatively new intelligence and EW assets, night vision devices, devices for determining coordinates, and highly mobile computer-based C[.sup]3[/] systems. This equipment is being created with consideration of requirements placed on the RDF such as high strategic mobility and probability of use in theaters of military operations with difficult physical-geographic conditions and poorly developed infrastructure. The U.S. command gives special attention to questions of developing forms and methods of RDF combat employment. During 1991-1992 the Army Training and Doctrine Command completed development of a new concept of combat employment of general purpose forces and their most combat-ready element, the RDF. It was titled "Air-Land Operations." Articles presently are being published in Defense Department central publications in which its basic provisions are being actively studied and discussed. The concept represents the aggregate of U.S. Army and Air Force leadership views on the nature and methods of operations by U.S. General Purpose Forces throughout the spectrum of possible military conflicts and wars of modern times, and under special conditions of peacetime. Assessments of prospects for development of the world military-political situation and U.S. Armed Forces organizational development for the next decade as well as an analysis of the experience of their combat operations against Iraq and involvement in other local conflicts of recent years have been made its basis. The essence of the new concept is as follows. The U.S. Armed Forces command proceeds from the assumption that, with the disintegration of the USSR, a large-scale military conflict in Europe with classic combat employment of large U.S. Armed Forces groupings is unlikely. At the same time, there is an increasing possibility of regional changes in the military-political situation in Third World countries which may create a potential threat to U.S. national interests. To eliminate this threat, the full arsenal of means must be used immediately, from political and economic pressure to direct armed intervention using the full might of the Armed Forces. The RDF's role grows considerably under those conditions. It becomes a very important tool of the U.S. leadership for prompt pressure on potential enemies. It can be moved in part or in its main makeup to any region of the world in compressed time periods, with the appearance of an emergency situation there. One of the chief requirements being placed on the U.S. RDF at the present time is its readiness to localize any military conflict back in the initial stage, in order to prevent its escalation and development into a large-scale armed clash fraught with heavy human and material losses for the United States. It is possible to attain this goal only with close interworking of the Army with the Air Force and Navy and under certain conditions also with U.S. allies. Based on this, future air-land operations in forward areas as a rule will be "joint" (involving different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces) and "combined" (involving allies). Operational groupings of forces will be established for their conduct. Depending on the content of combat missions, they may include components of tactical and military transport aviation, the Navy and Special Forces along with Army units. Developers of the concept emphasize that all C[.sup]3[/]I systems (above all space systems), airlift and sealift assets, and reserves of weapons, military vehicles and logistic support assets prepositioned in forward areas; and if necessary components of regular Armed Forces and of the organized Reserve, should be used in support of the RDF. Their operations will be subordinated to a unified goal -- ensure successful conduct of the operation by the RDF main body in the shortest possible time and with minimum losses and material costs for the United States. Where missions are performed by the RDF together with allies, the activity of the U.S. command should be directed toward their comprehensive support above all with deep interdiction of the enemy by air and missile strikes, but not with U.S. troops, which "should not substitute for or duplicate the allies without extreme need." A fundamentally new provision in views of the U.S. Armed Forces command is the possibility of employing the RDF in the absence of a state of war (military conflict), but in the presence of factual preconditions for its outbreak. Such actions may include the following: Assisting friendly governments; combating international terrorism and "contingency operations," including freeing hostages, evacuating American citizens, helping to give humanitarian assistance, and fighting the drug trade; a show of military force; limited strikes and raiding (sabotage) operations; and other operational measures aimed at maintaining economic and social stability in U.S. interests. Many foreign sources note that such aspects of the U.S. RDF as high combat readiness, strategic and operational mobility, technical outfitting, teamwork and coordination of staffs and troops, and a high level of professional training of all personnel are achieved, above all, through the U.S. military-political leadership's heightened attention toward RDF organizational development and training. According to many indicators, these forces are versatile and capable of operating in any regions of the world independently or with allies. A distinguishing feature of the RDF is considered to be the precisely adjusted system of operational-strategic command and control of all its components in the absence of a regular command and control structure. In the opinion of the U.S. military-political leadership, existing approaches to U.S. RDF organizational development can ensure the presence of a powerful tool of pressure in any region of the world, even with a further reduction in the numerical and effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces.
