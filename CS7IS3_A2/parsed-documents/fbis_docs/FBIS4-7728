In the area of the village of Trebesevo on Monday the local command of the troops loyal to Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic ordered four Moslem troops to be shot after they abandoned their positions, the sources said. The Moslem offensive is aimed at Cajnice, Foca and Rogatici, and the heaviest fighting on Monday took place in the area of the villages of Podkozarje and Oglecevo. Moslem troops began an offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic in the second half of March, after they signed an agreement with Bosnian Croats on setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia.
