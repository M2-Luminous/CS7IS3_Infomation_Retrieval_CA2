Prokofyeva, S. Chekalin, V. Belousov, identified by caption] [Text] [Prokofyeva over shot of garbage dump] It is a golden fall in the Baltic region -- the smell of the sea and autumn leaves. Except for here, that is. This is the infamous garbage dump near Kaliningrad. My colleague Stanislav Chekalin reported on it back in the days of perestroyka. And that old footage in no way differs from today's. In recent times an increase in intestinal illnesses has been noted in Kaliningrad. Local experts and experts brought in from Moscow believe that the garbage dump is largely responsible for this. [Unnamed interviewee] The water from the Pregel river is the reason for the outbreak of illnesses. Untreated effluent not only from this garbage dump but also from the entire municipal sewage network, and most importantly of all particles from pulp and paper plants, are discarded into the river. [T. Grunicheva, Kaliningrad's chief hygienist, identified by caption] Documentation was sent to the prosecutor's office. A lot of documentation, whole volumes of it. But all we got was a terse reply -- just a few lines -- telling us that given the absence of a corpus delicti the matter was being returned to us. [V. Cheburayev, representative from Russia's State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, identified by caption] There is no material evidence of a crime. What they mean is that our laws do not work. Our most fundamental principle is the principle that the polluter should be made to pay -- but it doesn't work anywhere. [Chekalin] It's true. The laws do not work, and nor do the purification facilities, whose construction began back in the socialist era a quarter of a century ago under the requirements of the International Convention of the Baltic Countries. Hundreds of millions of rubles went to waste in every sense of the word -- the construction projects were never finished. The Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision and the municipal administration have worked out and approved a program to protect Kaliningrad's population against epidemics.
