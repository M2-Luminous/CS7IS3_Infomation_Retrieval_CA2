Claudio Veiga, secretary of state for employment, has just resigned. This brings to three the number of ministers who have resigned from Prime Minister Carlos Veiga's cabinet. This spate of resignations is reportedly linked to influence peddling within the party, the Movement for Democracy. It came to power following the January 1991 parliamentary elections which ended the 17-year rule of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde [Parti Africain de l'Independance en Guinee- Bissau et au Cap Vert].
