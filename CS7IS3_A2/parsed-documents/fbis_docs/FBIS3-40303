[Budisa] From the comments of those who prepared the Geneva declaration it is obvious that much work had been done on the Croat-Serb agreement. We were not surprised by the agreement; it is a consequence of the continuity of Croatian policies toward Belgrade and Milosevic. We have always pointed out that Croatia must pull out of Milosevic's embrace because it brings us nothing good, while it is gradually getting Serbia out of international isolation. We believe that technical rather than political negotiations should be held with Serbia, until the time they recognize Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina within their integral borders. Until that happens, agreements such as the Geneva one will be harmful for Croatia, and beneficial for Milosevic's regime. The worst thing is that these agreements always come about when Milosevic's regime is under intensified international isolation. This agreement was reached at the moment of most serious talk about air strikes on Serb military targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There was even talk of more drastic sanctions. [Vurusic] How would you account for President Tudjman's actions? [Budisa] The question is if the Croatian president can still manage to pull out of the embrace he was caught in during the famous negotiations in Karadjordjevo. If Dr. Tudjman were to try to do so, who knows what would emerge concerning the talks he and Milosevic held before, especially concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, this agreement has been reached at a time the West is facing a redefinition of its positions concerning the events in the former Yugoslavia, which was prompted by the changes in Russia. I think that the new western plan for Bosnia, which even the French are inclined toward, will reduce the possibility of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I do not see what the new plan could contain apart from recognition of integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and giving up on ethnic states in Bosnia. Croatia must adjust to the concept supported by the international community, rather than stubbornly insisting on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and finding common grounds with Milosevic. [Vurusic] Do you think that Milosevic is in a way blackmailing Dr. Tudjman? [Budisa] I do not know about that, but if we were to turn our back on Milosevic completely, the contents of all the former talks between Tudjman and Milosevic would probably be revealed. [Vurusic] Radovan Karadzic has recently said that Serbia profits more from the agreement, while opening the Office in Serbia makes Croatia equal with the so-called Krajina and the Serb Republic. [Budisa] Croatia's mistake is consenting to open the Office before the FRY has recognized us within our borders. When there is such an agreement, the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] will do its best to mend and regulate the Croat-Serb relations. Until then, we believe that Serbia must be left under all the sanctions and have the status of aggressor. We in the HSLS do not want to give interviews even to the democratic -- provisionally described as independent -- Serb papers. [Vurusic] The Geneva agreement will reflect on Croat-Muslim relations. [Budisa] Although those involved deny it, the declaration certainly makes our relations with the Muslims difficult. If it were an agreement on recognition of the borders, there could be talk of a significant step toward the Serb recognition of Bosnia- Herzegovina within its borders, but since this has been avoided in the declaration, I am afraid this is another mistake Croatian diplomacy has made. [Vurusic] What do you consider positive in the Geneva declaration? [Budisa] Perhaps just this -- even the HSLS was attacked about the recent meeting of the Croatian and Serbian intellectuals in the Mimara [art gallery in Zagreb], although we had nothing to do with it. It is interesting to see the critics of the meeting silent now. The declaration could cause some sobering. It is evident that the agreement does not refer to the Security Council Resolution 871, but the UN Charter and the documents of the CSCE, the organization that the FRY is not a member of!? What does it mean for such country to sign such an agreement? [Vurusic] It seems that the reactions of the West are mostly constrained, even negative. [Budisa] The West, faced with the breakthrough of Greater Russian nationalism, which has become spokesman of the Russian parliament, and bearing in mind the danger of a new eastern block being founded on the nationalist-Orthodox basis, is in a position to support the principle on the borders being unchangeable more firmly than before. I think that the West is giving up on Bosnia- Herzegovina being a union of three states, and that Croatia must adjust to that and base its foreign policy on that principle. I think that the West has sobered after the changes in Russia, and that it realizes that the precedent of allowing the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a recognized member of the international community, could bring about events of unprecedented scope in the countries of the former Soviet Union. [Vurusic] Yesterday Croatia officially expressed the wish to be included in the Partnership for Peace, some kind of a antechamber to membership in NATO. [Budisa] We welcome that intention. It has been done in a rather hesitant way, late, and probably due to the impression that, with the Croat-Serb agreement, we have gotten into the area of Russian politics. The fact that Churkin was preparing the Geneva agreement is no accident. With the application for the Partnership for Peace Croatia is expressing the wish to pull out of the Balkan embrace. President Tudjman himself realizes that he has gotten too deeply involved in the relations with the countries that separate us from the West. I think that this initiative is late. The HSLS proposed a long time ago, and included the proposal in the program, that Croatia apply for membership in NATO. [Vurusic] Is there a possibility of Croatia becoming a subject of ridicule because of this agreement, as it has granted amnesty to its aggressor? [Budisa] Indeed, it seems to me that Croatian politics is losing credibility, and that with such an agreement we are losing the reputation and national dignity, while in return we gain nothing. I would therefore agree with your statement. Croatian politics got entangled the moment it started making arrangements with the aggressor. Such moves truly insult the Croat national dignity and endanger the international community's main positive achievement -- the political and economic isolation of Serbia, which is now being questioned. Moreover, the Muslim doubts concerning the benevolence of this agreement are provoked. The former animosity between the Serbs and Croats has been brought to the boil, and now that it has fulfilled its purpose, by questioning the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina, this projected hatred should be brought down to a normal level. I am afraid of the agreement being presented as an act of the Croat-Serb solidarity in the face of the alleged danger of Islamic fundamentalism. I still believe that the Muslims are our allies -- not "natural" ones, but that they have become our allies through a combination of historical circumstances and the fact that Serbia is the aggressor -- both against Croatia and Bosnia. [Vurusic] Why does Dr. Tudjman keep negotiating with Milosevic, despite the fact that Milosevic has several times proved that he does not abide by what he signs? [Budisa] Because President Tudjman is captured by the concept of rearranging the former old Yugoslavia in completely different historical circumstances. He has pointed out several times that there is no solution to the Croat issue without an arrangement with Belgrade, and that our interest is the encompassing of the Croat ethnic territories. This is in itself neither correct nor wrong outside the historical context. Macek [Croatian signatory of the 1939 agreement founding the Bannat of Croatia] also acted upon these bases, and this is how he partly succeeded. However, in these historical circumstances of Yugoslavia disintegrating and parts of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina being occupied this approach has lead to cooperation with the aggressor and the war with the Muslims. [Vurusic] Do you think that Tudjman is trying to find his Dragisa Cvetkovic [prime minister of Yugoslavia, co-signatory of the 1939 agreement mentioned above] in Milosevic? [Budisa] Today, unlike in 1939, there is no prince Pavle in Serbia. Why Dr. Tudjman persists in acting this way despite the fact that Milosevic has evidently cheated him several times is a question you will have to ask him. I no longer understand it. [Vurusic] The key question raised by the Croat-Serb agreement is whether Milosevic has given up on the concept of Greater Serbia. [Budisa] I am certain he has not. I think that the key to integrating our occupied areas is in the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If Croatian politics were to concentrate on that as one of its main tasks, then there would be fewer negative consequences of this agreement, and in the future they would completely disappear. If the Croatian politics continues to aspire toward Herzeg-Bosna being annexed to Croatia, then the question arises how we will retrieve our occupied areas. There is constant talk that the two thirds of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina who will be left outside the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna will be equal in all respects. If this is really true, why should a separate republic be created for only one third of the Croats in Bosnia, when it is precisely the founding of such republic that questions the equality of the Croats who are left outside its borders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Vurusic] What organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina do you propose? [Budisa] The Croats, as the least populous in Bosnia- Herzegovina, should have parity authority, while the territorial division should also be based on the observance of the ethnic principles, but not on creating separate states. Why would Bosnia- Herzegovina not be decentralized, divided into a certain number of counties? The advice of the Bosnia-Herzegovina bishops and the messages from the Pope should be accepted. [Vurusic] Western commentators mostly think that the Geneva agreement has definitely divided Bosnia. [Budisa] Yes, many have interpreted it that way. However, since the West, under the pressure of the political changes in Russia, is changing its attitude on Bosnia, I am more optimistic about the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina than I was several months ago. The tragedy is that Tudjman does not see what is going on and that he is letting Milosevic have his way. Croatia is still not so badly off; it has the international credibility that is still incomparable with Milosevic's. Valentic's [Croatian prime minister] measures have yielded positive effects. Serbia has nothing to lose, and now it is dragging us into games in which we have a great deal to lose. [Vurusic] The Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and the Serb Republic have recently signed an agreement. In your opinion, does that make the situation in Bosnia easier or more difficult? [Budisa] This is just one of the many papers. I think that Sarajevo has given up on the initial idea according to which the Serbs could separate from the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina after two years. Bosnia-Herzegovina can be preserved if three of the four factors support it: the Muslims, the Croats, and the international community. I think that a great number of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in favor of preserving it, even those in Herzegovina. Croatia, on the other hand, is behaving as if the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina depends on Karadzic. [Vurusic] There have been some significant personnel changes in Herceg-Bosna lately: after General Ante Roso, Vice Vukojevic also arrived in Herzegovina. What is your comment on that? [Budisa] I see the arrival of Ante Roso differently from that of Vice Vukojevic. When he arrived in Herzeg-Bosna, Ante Roso was no longer a general of the Croatian Army, while Vice Vukojevic put on the uniform of the brigadier of the Croat Defense Council while still a Parliament representative and president of the Committee for Selection and Nomination. It seems as if some of our politicians are competing in who is going to make more political mistakes. [Vurusic] Does the HSLS intend to start a discussion of the Geneva declaration in parliament? [Budisa] We can not remain silent, though I do not know what will be on the agenda of the next parliament session. The HSLS can start many actions and initiatives, but there is less chance of the Croatian authorities changing some elements of its policies if it is suggested by the liberal party. We are forced to place our ideas through the members of the party in power who are close to us. On the other hand, the representatives of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] are, due to party discipline, often simply forced to vote against the HSLS proposals. [Vurusic] Will you ask President Tudjman to make additional explanations, will you perhaps demand someone's resignation, since you have stated that the declaration was "an attack on the vital national interests and the national dignity"? [Budisa] I am not sure we will not raise such questions, too. A strong reaction at the HDZ moves is demanded of us, but people forget the balance of power in parliament. We are aware of the fact that major political decisions and changes may result from the conflict within the HDZ, and not only from the Parliament discussion between the opposition and the party in power. [Vurusic] Do you think that the Croats support the Geneva declaration? [Budisa] I think that it is difficult to find a Croat who would privately support an agreement that offends our national dignity. The HSLS has not issued any slander against any people; there are no chauvinists and primitive people in the party, and we are not saying that there should be no negotiations with the Serbs and with Serbia, but the basis for that is well known -- the recognition of the borders and the reintegration of the occupied areas in the constitutional and legal system of Croatia. However, I am appalled at the HDZ masochism, at the consent to forget Vukovar, Petrinja, Okucani, Drnis, Baranja, all the destruction and all the atrocities done to us. I am afraid that we are slowly sliding into the position that was imposed on the Croats in the former Yugoslavia. I am afraid that the Croat national feeling will again be limited to what the Serbs mind about the manifestations of Croatianness. I am afraid that it will be our realist-politicians who will adjust to the Serb "oversensitivity" to Croatianness, that we will again have to be careful about not "offending" the Serbs with our Croatianness. After all they have done to us, from Vukovar to Dubrovnik, I am afraid that the present Croatian policies will lead to the situation in which we will no longer be allowed to talk about these crimes so that the Serbs do not get angry with us, or proclaim us nationalists. We can therefore again find ourselves in the position in which we will be as Croat as the Serbs will bear or allow. I am afraid that there will be some people in Croatia who will become accustomed to it, and who will adjust their speech and behavior to what I call national defeat. I fear that such people could again become representatives of professed Croat political interests, in the name of the so-called realist politics. I am prepared to go to Knin and make peace with the Serbs, but only after they recognize Croatia within its borders. What do Pejnovic's [deputy president of the Serb National Party] statements about the resolution of the Serb issue in Croatia depending on the observance of all the Serb options mean? Does that include the Chetnik ones? The Serb issue can not be resolved from the Ustasha positions, and Croatia must not respect the Chetnik positions. I hope that this is clear. We are not in such an unfavorable political and economic situation as Serbia and the so-called Krajina are. We should not be in a hurry and we should not have to curry favor with them. We have no reason to enter rash and insufficiently defined arrangements. [Vurusic] What is the HSLS comment on the continuation of the conflict within the HDZ, from the Second HDZ Congress until the present, which culminated in the open argument between Manolic [president of the Chamber of Counties] and Susak [defense minister], and the announcement of [parliament chairman] Stipe Mesic's resignation? [Budisa] As a rule, we do not comment on what goes on in other parties. The HDZ has recently accused the opposition of destabilizing Croatia, and we are witnessing the opposing positions within the very top of the HDZ. Their internal polemics are more irreconcilable than those between the opposition and the authorities, which is truly destabilizing the Croatian state. At his recent meeting with heads of counties, President Tudjman appealed for a united stand on the Croatian state politics, and we in fact do not know what it is. The defense minister has completely different opinions and positions on many key state and national issues from those of the president of the Chamber of Counties and Representatives. I therefore must ask what the Croatian state politics is and what concept it is that we should all unite about. [Vurusic] Lately there has been talk of factions within the HSLS, and even of your having submitted your resignation as party president. Is that correct? [Budisa] I have not submitted my resignation. At the Lower Council session we discussed personnel issues, which involved many people from the party leadership. The opinion prevailed that the continuity of the party should be preserved in the personnel issues as well, which means that I will run for president of the party at the next HSLS congress. I do not know who my opposing candidates will be. For the time being, there are seven candidates for deputy party president. There will be many candidates for certain positions, but, unlike in the HDZ, it can not happen in the HSLS that I dispute and change anyone's candidacy at the congress. [Vurusic] The popularity of your party is decreasing; there have been reproaches that you often did not react the way the strongest opposition party in Croatia should have done. [Budisa] I am certain that the HSLS would currently win more votes than at the last elections. However, our popularity has dropped in relation to the period after the elections. According to the surveys published in the press, however, almost half of the people do not want to declare their opinion. You see, there is a fierce media campaign against us, mainly on Croatian Television, the theme of which is that if we attack the authorities, we also attack Croatia. We are also fighting against the HDZ because we believe that we would conduct the Croatian politics and the Croatian state better, more efficiently, and more successfully than the HDZ. [Vurusic] Will you demand early elections? [Budisa] Not for the time being. Our insistence on elections would certainly postpone them.
