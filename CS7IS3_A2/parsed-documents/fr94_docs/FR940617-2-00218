Where can I get additional information in preparing my pre-application? EPA strongly encourages applicants to carefully read the solicitation notice. Many questions, such as when is the deadline for submitting pre-applications and what activities can be funded under this program, are answered in this solicitation. Nonetheless, if you need more information about this grant program or clarification about specific requirements in this solicitation notice, you may contact the EPA Environmental Education Division in Washington, DC for grant requests of more than $25,000 or your EPA regional office for grant requests of $25,000 or less. A list of the names and telephone numbers of EPA representatives are listed at the end of this notice. In addition, you may contact the National Consortium for Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University of Michigan for general information on current environmental education activities and recent developments in the field ( e.g., information about current in-service teacher education needs and opportunities as well as resources that identify environmental education organizations, curricula, and research). NCEET can also provide you with a list of all environmental education grants awarded by EPA in FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 as well as summaries of those projects completed under the FY 1992 program.
