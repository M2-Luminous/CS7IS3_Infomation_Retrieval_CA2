The loss finds expression primarily in that, when a foreign- funded enterprise or a stock company is set up, assets of a state- owned enterprise are often not evaluated precisely. Consequently, these assets turn, through different channels, into assets of collectives, individuals or foreign investors. A survey conducted last year shows that two-thirds of the 10,000 state-owned businesses establishing joint ventures with overseas firms did not evaluate their state-owned assets. Chinese economists estimate that the loss resulting from lack of evaluation or under-evaluation of state-owned assets when Chinese companies launch joint ventures with overseas firms amounts to 30 billion yuan a year. The loss stemming from lack of evaluation or under-evaluation of state-owned assets when existing enterprises become joint-stock companies is also enormous, they say. An official of the state-owned assets administration said that the unpaid use of state-owned assets to set up profit-making businesses and the existence of large numbers of money-losing state- owned companies also cause serious losses of state-owned assets. He estimated the loss of such assets over the past decade at 500 billion yuan in total. "The loss of tax revenues and the loss of state-owned assets have become two serious problems in China's economic life," he said. The Chinese government has made it clear that the state-owned sector will serve as the mainstay of China's economy in the course of shifting to a market economy, he noted. The state-owned sector is still growing despite the policy of encouraging the common development of multi-economic sectors, he said. For example, the value of state-owned assets climbed 14 percent in 1992 to 3,069.7 billion yuan. The official said that the loss of state-owned assets runs counter to the Chinese government's reform policy. Economists attribute the loss chiefly to the absence of a unified and effective system for managing state-owned assets, ill-defined functions of departments in charge of managing state-owned assets at all levels and loopholes in existing laws and regulations. The Chinese government is now taking a series of measures to stem the loss, they said. The most important measure is to evaluate state-owned assets. Last year 10,000 state-owned enterprises finished evaluating their assets, and another 10,000 will do so this year. China currently has 1,000 accountants' and auditors' offices authorized by the government to evaluate such assets, the official said. He said that when establishing a Sino-foreign joint venture or a joint-stock company, a state-owned enterprise must have an assets evaluation certificate approved by the state-owned assets administration. He said that the standing committee of the national people's congress is drafting a law on state-owned assets and formulating a set of regulations on the supervision and management of assets in state-owned enterprises and another set of regulations on how to assess the increase in the value of state-owned assets. He said that when a state-owned enterprise changes its property rights in the future it must evaluate its assets, define its property rights and clear its debts.
