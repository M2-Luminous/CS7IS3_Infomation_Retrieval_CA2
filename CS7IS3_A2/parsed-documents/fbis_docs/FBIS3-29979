The Institute of Foreign Affairs and Security, headed by Pak Su-kil, analyzes this in a report entitled "Prospect of Changes in North Korea" released on 23 February, and it stresses: "We should strengthen the position of the reformist forces [kaehyok chihyangjok seryoktul] in North Korea so that they can attempt to make drastic changes [kwagamhan pyonhwa] and should cooperate and support North Korea in developing its independent system [chajujogin cheje palchone]." Regarding the possibility of changes in North Korea, which adheres to "socialism of its own style," the report anticipates that North Korea will reform itself starting from superior offices, gradually and partially; will pursue the policy of protecting its system; will hardly reform itself starting from lower offices; will undergo changes after Kim Il-song dies; and will suffer internal disputes after Kim Il-song's death. The report says, in particular, that North Korea will probably concentrate efforts to level the ground internally and externally for consolidating the system of succession by Kim Chong-il and expand strategies for developing its system by opening its economy within a restricted scope, while laying greater emphasis on its chuche-based independent economic policy. The report anticipates: "Kim Chong-il will continuously take measures of treating the military preferentially in order to consolidate the ground of forces on his side, and will keep exporting weapons in secret to solve economic problems." It also expects: While adhering to a confederal system, North Korea will inevitably give more weight to maintaining and developing its system than to the southward revolution because of a durable situation of international reconciliation and cooperation. It is highly possible that North Korea will seek reunification policies, considering South Korea to be a potential coexisting partner, rather than a target to overthrow. The report analyses: North Korea, however, will regard South-North dialogue as a subordinate variable [chongsok pyonsu] of North Korean-U.S. dialogue. It may make rapid progress in South-North dialogue, if necessary, and will finally attempt the resumption of South-North high-level talks. Accordingly, it is possible that North Korea will expand South-North human exchanges within a strategic scope to protect its system. For the time being, however, it is hard to expect home visits and exchanges of letters by separated families, sightseeing tours, and permanent stationing of correspondents because North Korea will not allow any exchange affecting its system. With the prospect of changes in North Korea, the report advises the government to consider disseminating its plan to pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea as a partner after the nuclear issue is resolved, inducing North Korea's opening up in a way of multilateral economic cooperation, helping North Korea participate in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Asia-Pacific region, and strengthening ROK-U.S. cooperative relations so as to make North Korea have an active attitude toward South-North dialogue while negotiating with the United States on the establishment of diplomatic relations.
