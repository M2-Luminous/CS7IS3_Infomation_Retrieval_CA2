FBIS4-37192 "drnes117_r_94001" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 SOUTH ASIA India BJP Reiterates Demand for Nuclear Weapons BJP Reiterates Demand for Nuclear Weapons BK1706005194 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES in English 13 Jun 94 p 17 BK1706005194 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES English BFN [Text] Baroda, June 1, The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] today countered the Prime Ministers "posture" on the issue of nuclear option and asserted that India ought to declare itself as a "nuclear weapon state". BJP president L.K. Advani as well as senior leader A.B. Vajpayee said that while the BJP was all for de-nuclearisation and disarmament the most question was whether this was happening anywhere. "China", Mr Vajpayee said, "has just tested another nuclear device" Iran is on the threshold of the bomb while Pakistan is widely believed to have already made the bomb. "So, where is the de nuclearisation?" Mr Vajpayee said and added: "We can also destroy the bomb. But first we have to make one. We should declare that we are a nuclear weapon state. That declaration itself would suffice." Mr Advani, while talking to news men, said he for one was amused by the Prime Minister's reported remark that the BJP was resorting to one-upmanship on the nuclear option issue. "I would say that it is the Prime Minister who is indulging in one-upmanship by saying that his Government has kept the nuclear option open." The BJP, Mr Advani said, ha been a consistent advocate of India going nuclear. An additional argument in support of this view now stemmed from the sort of attitude being adopted by the US after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its emergence as the only superpower. Mr Vajpayee, touching upon the PM's remarks while delivering his own valedictory address at the BJP session, said it would not suffice for the Prime Minister to say that the nuclear option has been kept open. "You have to move further," he said. Indiscipline flayed: Mr Vajpayee highlighted the need for the party to take all sections alone in its onward march. He also called upon partymen to live up to the party's image by making a break with factionalism and indiscipline. In his customary session-end address, Mr Vajpayee told the National Council members that the contagion of factionalism and indiscipline widely prevalent in the other political parties was threatening the BJP as well. It was for partymen to see this danger. Mr Vajpayee also spoke of the need for the Party to rise to the aspirations of Dalits. "In fact, the Dalits have started rallying behind the BJP in a big way. It is a good development but we are not even aware of it," he said, and called for Dalit conventions in the various States. Mr Vajpayee came down heavily on anti-party activities being resorted to by some. The party should not condone this. No leniency should be showed to those who defy party discipline. He also came down heavily on partymen jostling for position and power.
