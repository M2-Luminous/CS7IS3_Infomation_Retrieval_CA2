He was captured at his farm in Buenaventura, in the municipality of Matamoros, Coahuila. There, one of the many outstanding arrest warrants against the notorious drug trafficker and chief of the ``Los Villalobos'' ring was executed. Thus, the criminal organization was dismantled, with four of its members apparently killed in the shootout; while two others were arrested, and one police officer was wounded. The report from the Federal Highway Police regional commander, Rodolfo de Leon Barranco, described the incidents at the drug trafficker's farm when police from various forces arrived to execute one of the numerous warrants for the arrest of the ``mafioso,'' perpetrator of various crimes in the country's principal northern states. The police chief confirmed the participation of members of the Coahuila Federal Highway and Ports Police detachment in the operation for the capture of Villalobos. The police chief claimed that a confrontation occurred on that site, in which four criminals, members of the ring and guards of Jose Alfonso Villalobos Moreno, were killed. Two others were captured, and a police officer was wounded. He remarked that the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic had coordinated the operation for Villalobos's capture, because it is in charge of the investigation of the ``Los Villalobos'' ring.
