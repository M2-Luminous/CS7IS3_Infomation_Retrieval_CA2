I. Background 2 2 See generally III L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1541&hyph;1570 (2d. ed. 1961); Foshay, Market Activities of Participants in Securities Distributions, 45 U. Va. L. Rev. 907, 907&hyph;926 (1959). Following the 1929 stock market crash and amid public furor concerning financial intermediaries that had engaged in flagrant manipulation in the securities markets, Congress enacted the Exchange Act to put an end to the practices that it found had contributed to the economic problems facing the Nation. 3 In drafting the legislation, Congress determined that the available common law remedies for fraud were inadequate to combat manipulation in the securities markets. 4 Because Congress recognized that market manipulation can assume many forms, it did not define the term in the Exchange Act or elsewhere. Congress intended the Exchange Act to outlaw every ``device used to persuade the public that activity in a security is the reflection of a genuine demand instead of a mirage.'' 5 In a number of provisions, the Commission is given authority to define manipulative practices and adopt rules to proscribe and prevent such conduct. 6 As the Commission has stated: 3 Congressional findings leading to the enactment of the Exchange Act pointed to widespread manipulation and fraud by brokers, dealers, and other members of the financial industry. One of the ``chief evils'' was the operation of ``pools,'' which were agreements among several persons to trade actively in a security, generally to raise the price of a security by concerted activity, in order to sell their holdings at a profit to the public, which is attracted by the activity or by information disseminated about the stock. Report to the Secretary of Commerce, Staff of Senate Committee on Stock Exchange Regulation, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1934); S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1934). See, e.g., Thel, The Original Conception of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 385, 404 (1990); Note, Manipulation of Stock Markets Under the Securities Laws, 99 U. Pa. L. Rev. 651, 659&hyph;662 (1951). 4 Prior to enacting the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq., and the Exchange Act, the federal government could only combat securities fraud and manipulation by criminal prosecution for violation of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1341, or for conspiring to violate it, 18 U.S.C. 371. For example, in United States v. Brown, 5 F. Supp. 81 (S.D.N.Y. 1933), aff'd, 79 F.2d 321 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. McCarthy v. United States, 296 U.S. 650 (1935), the court held that manipulative trading through a pool arrangement was fraudulent as a form of misrepresentation and ``unfair dealing'' and thus violated the mail fraud statute. See also Hearings before Comm. on Banking and Currency on Senate Resolutions 56 and 84, 72d Cong., and 97, 73d Cong. (1934); Report of Governor Hughes' Committee on Speculation in Securities and Commodities (June 7, 1909). 5 Stock Exchange Practices, Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, S. Rep. No. 1455, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1934). A fixed definition could impair the ability to address new manipulative devices. But cf. Fischel & Ross, Should the Law Prohibit ``Manipulation'' in Financial Markets?, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 503 (1991). 6 See, e.g., Exchange Act sections 9(a)(6), 10, 15(c), 15 U.S.C. 78i(a)(6), 78j, 78 o (c). When investors and prospective investors see activity, they are entitled to assume that it is real activity. They are also entitled to assume that the prices that they pay and receive are determined by the unimpeded interaction of real supply and real demand so that those prices are the collective marketplace judgment that they purport to be. Manipulations frustrate these expectations. They substitute fiction for fact.␣.␣.␣.␣The vice is that the market has been distorted and made into 'a stage-managed performance.' 7 7 Edward J. Mawod & Co., 46 S.E.C. 865, 871&hyph;872 (1977), aff'd, 591 F.2d 588 (10th Cir. 1979). II. Statutory Provisions This section describes the principal antimanipulation provisions of the Exchange Act, sections 9(a), 10, and 15(c), 8 and the implementation of the concepts underlying those provisions in the regulation of securities offerings. It has long been recognized that securities offerings, which can be affected dramatically by short-term movements in security prices, are susceptible to manipulation. 9 8 15 U.S.C. 78i(a), 78j, and 78 o (c), respectively. 9 See Comment, Market Manipulation and the Securities Exchange Act, 46 Yale L.J. 624, 626 (1937). The provisions of Section 9(a) were designed to ``purge the securities exchanges of those practices which have prevented them from fulfilling their primary function of furnishing open markets for securities where supply and demand may freely meet at prices uninfluenced by manipulation or control.'' 10 Congress explicitly prohibited certain transactions when the purpose was to ``create a false or misleading appearance of active trading'' or a ``false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for an exchange-registered security.'' 11 Congress included a general anti-manipulation provision, Section 9(a)(2), 12 which has been termed the ``heart'' of the Exchange Act. 13 Manipulation under this section requires proof of three elements: 10 S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1934). The title of section 9 is ``Prohibition Against Manipulation of Security Prices.'' 11 15 U.S.C. 78i(a)(1). 12 15 U.S.C. 78i(a)(2). 13 See Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Proposals for Amendments to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 50 (1941). (1) A series of transactions in an exchange-registered security, (2) Creating actual or apparent active trading in such security or raising or depressing the price of such security, (3) For the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others. However, Congress recognized that some forms of market intervention should not be prohibited absolutely and left it to Commission rulemaking to impose necessary or appropriate restrictions on such activities for the protection of the public. 14 14 See, e.g., Exchange Act sections 9(a)(6), (b), and (c), 15 U.S.C. 78i(a)(6), (b), (c).
