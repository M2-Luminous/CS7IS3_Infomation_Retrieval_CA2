The 2p orbitals of boron, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine form valence molecular orbitals (i.e., a valence band) in the compounds. Therefore the K-V X-ray line shapes represent the local (X-ray emitting atom) and partial (2p) electron density of states (DOS) of the compounds. The discrete-variational (DV) Hartree-Fock-Slater (X_a_) calculations of carbon 2p DOS of various carbon compounds have successfully reproduced the measured carbon K-V X-ray line shapes of benzene, C[.sub]60[/],[.sup]1[/] C[.sub]70[/],[.sup]2[/] graphite, and diamond.[.sup]3[/] We then extend these calculations to various boron compounds in the present paper. The boron 2p DOS of various boron compounds (B, B[.sub]4[/]C, BN, B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], B[.sub]6[/]O, BF[.sub]3[/], ...) are calculated by the DV-X_a_ method with a cluster-molecule approximation, where, e.g., B[.sub]12[/] molecule is calculated in place of a solid boron. The calculated B 2p DOS is compared with the measured X-ray emission spectra in the literature, resulting in satisfactory agreement between the calculation and the experiment. References 1. J.
