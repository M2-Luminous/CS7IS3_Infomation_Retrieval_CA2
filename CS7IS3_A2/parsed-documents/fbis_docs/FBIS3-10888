The first letter reached the National Assembly at noon and in it, President Chamorro stated she would not sign -- approve -- the law on tax exemptions on school supplies and medicine for humans approved by the Assembly in mid-February, although she said she would not veto it either. "To sign such a bill would be a violation of the Constitution and the mechanism to pass fiscal legislation which had already been institutionalized," the president said. She added the Executive Branch has the exclusive power to legislate on fiscal matters according to Article 150 of the Constitution. The president also added that "she is analyzing the measures that need to be implemented to compensate for the loss in the collection of taxes." The letter was described as "impertinent and disrespectful" by the members of the Legislative Branch. The Board of Directors, in response, decided to enact the law that same week. The UNO deputies said they supported the Board's decision to order the publication of the aforementioned law. The storm caused by the first letter had not died out when Frank Duarte, the secretary of the Board of Directors, read the second letter, this time against the law on public bids for fishing licenses. In the letter, the president states that by means of presidential decree "she has decided to create a National Fishing and Aquaculture Commission," thereby overstepping the bounds of the commission created for this purpose by the Law on Fishing Bids or Law 165. Many of the deputies considered this to be a "deep crisis" and an "open confrontation" with the Executive Branch. Meanwhile presidency sources downplayed the confrontation by pointing out that there is no such "crisis" between both branches of government. Others, however, described it as the president's "maneuver" prior to the arrival of the IMF delegation. Assembly Will Determine Ways To Respond "Antonio Lacayo is trying to sell the IMF the idea that the National Assembly is to blame for not complying with the guidelines proposed by the IMF," some deputies said. More than 20 deputies spoke rejecting the contents of the letters sent by President Chamorro. "It is a provocation and an attempt to make us take measures by insulting our intelligence," according to Danilo Aguirre, a Sandinist National Liberation Front deputy. Rosales Blames Delaney Aguirre proposed the creation of a special commission that would be in charge of suggesting to the Board of Directors a series of measures that could be taken in view of the "provocation" by the Executive Branch. Roberto Urroz from the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement and Omar Cabezas from the FSLN proposed accelerating the constitutional reform process as a response to "the Executive Branch's disrespect." According to Deputy Cabezas, the measures announced by the president in her second letter are aimed at protecting the "fishing czars." Finally the deputies unanimously decided not to get ahead of themselves and appointed a special commission made up of the members of the Board of Directors of the Economic and Legal Affairs Commission to draft a proposal with the measures that could be taken. Labor Minister Francisco Rosales, who observed the debates and the deputies' reactions closely, said both jokingly and seriously that "these are the crazy acts of Deputy Presidency Minister Tomas Delaney. Rosales said that Delaney "should have resorted to the Supreme Court" so that the Judicial Branch could determine if it is in the National Assembly's power to legislate fiscal matters. Presidency sources said that President Chamorro, who traveled to Chile yesterday, had drafted two more letters that would be sent to the National Assembly today.
