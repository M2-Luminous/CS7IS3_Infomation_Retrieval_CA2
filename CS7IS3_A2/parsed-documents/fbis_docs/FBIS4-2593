The National Research Bureau, which conducted the survey, concluded New Zealanders had now become aware of the importance of trade with Asian countries. Seventy-eight percent of the 600 people surveyed felt Asian tourism was good for New Zealand and 57 percent favored education institutions attracting fee-paying Asian students. However, many New Zealanders are wary of Asian investment and immigration, the survey showed. The result indicated 29 percent welcomed Asian immigration to New Zealand as good for the country, and 25 percent thought Asian investment as good. Thirty-three percent of the people had mixed feelings about the immigration, 25 percent thought it would be neither good nor bad, and 13 percent believed it would be bad for New Zealand. On the Asian investment, 46 percent had mixed feelings, 18 percent opposed it and 11 percent considered it as neither good nor bad. The bureau said people were concerned Asian investment could move ownership and control of businesses overseas, a similar attitude New Zealanders held toward the United States and other countries 20 years ago. The prime reason for people opposing Asian migration came from the fear for the perceived takeover of jobs from New Zealanders.
