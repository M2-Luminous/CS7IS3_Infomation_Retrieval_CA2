How will you maintain your budgetary objectives this year? [Sarkozy] When we came to government, the French economy was in a deep recession. We therefore had to completely reshape the 1993 finance bill which the Socialists had left us and then launch the Balladur loan. This is the gamble we took in announcing a 1.4-percent growth rate for 1994. There were then many observers who thought that we would never achieve that rate. Today most have rallied round and the average growth rate forecast by the economic institutes for this year is 1.4 percent. For several weeks, all the indications have been that the economic machinery is starting up again. Manufacturing production apparently grew by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, even if it stagnated in March. Job offers have increased by 38 percent. Redundancies have fallen by 19 percent. Finally, the most spectacular thing is that, for the first time since 1990, 20,700 more jobs were created than were lost in the first quarter. Who would have thought that was possible just a few months ago? [Couvrat] What is your objective? [Sarkozy] Our objective is twofold. We must fund the government's priorities: the fight against unemployment, which is our absolute priority; security, urban, and regional development policies. But we must also ensure that the aim of reducing public deficits is strictly respected. Because, contrary to the false idea which sometimes circulates, it is the accumulation of public deficits which could jeopardize the emerging growth. Deficits increase long-term interest rates; they are a source of anxiety for the future, whereas we must encourage demand by reassuring it; finally, if the state borrows too much, that is money which private investors will not have. The budgetary limitations will therefore be maintained. Consequently, we must control the deficits. This is a formal request from the prime minister. The 1994 budget deficit will not exceed 301 billion francs [Fr]. And the deficit forecast in the draft 1995 budget will be around Fr275-280 billion. [Couvrat] Will you have to cut into the budgets of some ministries this year to finance the new expenditures which have been announced? [Sarkozy] There are two bad courses of action which can be taken. The first is to set a ceiling on all the budgets, without thinking about the government's priorities, which would deprive it of all credibility. The second consists of spending without counting and without worrying about how to fund it. Here, you find yourself in the situation which we inherited from the Socialists, which led to the worst recession ever since the war. We chose the path of reason. It consists of guaranteeing all new expenditures by economies in public spending. We already did that at the beginning of April. An advance decree made it possible Fr2.2 billion in savings on all ministries, to fund Fr2.2 billion in new expenditures: aid to fishermen, automobile subsidies, safety measures in the schools. Still on the subject of the 1994 budget, we must now finance the other new expenditures: the youth employment subsidy, i.e., between Fr2 and Fr3 billion, and the measures accompanying the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. It should be noted that the new funding allocated to the police, the legal system, regional development, and even the implementation of the military programming law will only take place from 1995 and will be spread out. Moreover, we expect around Fr10 billion in additional fiscal revenue this year compared with the forecasts. [Couvrat] What savings will you make? [Sarkozy] The prime minister has just authorized me to carry out a budget adjustment of Fr7 billion over a base of Fr118 billion. These are current operational funds or subsidies which the ministries will not be able to spend without justifying every franc. Anything which is not vital will be canceled. Everybody must understand that failing to reduce the deficits is running the risk of stifling growth. All the European countries have made the same choice. It should be noted that in our case, we are doing it without increasing the compulsory deductions, unlike the British Government, the only country in the Community whose growth forecasts for 1995 have been lowered after it had to propose a substantial tax increase. [Couvrat] If new savings finance new expenditures, why privatize the AGF [French General Insurance Company] this year? [Sarkozy] We are privatizing the AGF in order to be able to renew the capital of the public enterprises, especially Air France, which should receive Fr10 billion this year, then Fr5 billion in 1995, and another Fr5 billion in 1996. Moreover, I find it difficult to see how the European Commission could prevent us from saving as important an enterprise as Air France, after the efforts which the staff have been asked and have agreed to make. The government's European choices are well-known. That is why we cannot afford to be either weak or naive. [Couvrat] Is the announcement of this budgetary adjustment not intended to reassure our German partners, worried by the loss of control over public spending in France? [Sarkozy] No. The aim is to pursue the economic policy in which we believe. I would like to add that the pace of economic activity is virtually the same on both sides of the Rhine. In France and in Germany, the recovery is being led by foreign trade and investment. As for the efforts made by our partners to balance their accounts, they are naturally worthy of praise. But the action we launched in 1993 was equally spectacular in its efficacy and content. We reduced our deficit by 1.2 percent of GDP! The social security deficit will thus be halved compared with the underlying deficit. Unemployment insurance will generate a surplus this year. As for the budget deficit, it is and will continue to be reduced. Between 1993 and 1995 it will be reduced by Fr65 billion! [Couvrat] The Germans criticize the French Government, above all, because it has increased public debt, with the elimination of the one-month lag in VAT [reimbursement of value-added-tax] in particular, without it appearing in the budget. [Sarkozy] I do not accept that criticism, which, moreover, I have not heard from our German partners. The reimbursement of the one-month VAT lag has enabled thousands of enterprises to survive. This debt to businesses existed already, if not in the state's accounts, at least in the accounts of those who had been waiting for reimbursement for years. In France and in Germany, moreover, everybody has his accounting conventions. For instance, the deficit of the [German] Trust Agency, which funds investments in the East, does not appear in the German public deficit. Who is the most open? The one who reintroduces into the state accounts a debt which ought to have been there, or the one who takes out of the state accounts a debt which is not there? All in all, the French public deficit will amount to 5.4 percent of GDP in 1994 and 4.2 percent in 1995, compared with 5.3 percent and 4.2 percent respectively in Germany. [Couvrat] But what is your answer to the foreign investors who seem to share the anxiety of the German authorities? [Sarkozy] There is no reason to be worried. The deficits will not increase. The government's priorities will be funded. French growth is starting again on a sound basis. We know that there is money in savings accounts and money in businesses. Everything is in place for strong growth to resume. The nervousness of the financial markets depends very largely on a bad analysis of the situation, which means that the U.S. economy and the European economy are treated in the same way. Is there a risk of the recovery in the United States leading to a new increase in inflation? I would refrain from giving a verdict on that. What I do know is that there is no risk of inflation in Europe. And, to say the least, we are not worried about too rapid a recovery. There is no objective reason why the pressure on interest rates in Europe should continue. That is why we are determined to reduce the budget deficit. Advocates of an unlimited deficit must shoulder their responsibilities. They must therefore explain to us how, with public accounts which are not well kept, it would be possible to maintain interest rates; and how, with rising interest rates, the economic recovery could last. A different policy is certainly possible. But I do not think that it would produce better results than the policy implemented over the past year by Edouard Balladur. [Couvrat] Did the increase in household contributions last year not curb the economy too strongly? [Sarkozy] That was one of the great debates at the time. It was explained to us that increasing the CSG [General Social Contribution] was likely to postpone all the prospects of growth. The facts proved us right. I do not regret the fact that we increased the CSG immediately. Because it was a painful operation which cannot constantly be repeated, it is now forcing us to find savings in health insurance. Those who reject that must be prepared to explain to the country that the CSG must be increased again. For the government, matters are clear: There will be no new increase in the CSG. The only path which can be envisaged is that of savings. [Couvrat] Do you regret the fact that you had to adapt your budget policy to the constraints of an excessively restrictive monetary policy? [Sarkozy] It was obviously necessary for us to adapt. There is no good budget policy in absolute terms. A good budget policy must be adapted to the economic situation of the moment. As for monetary policy, I leave it to the theoreticians to decide whether or not it is too restrictive. Finally, interest rates have dropped spectacularly, and the economy is taking off again. This is the essential thing. I therefore do not understand the continuation of the controversy on this subject now. [Couvrat] In 1995, how much room to maneuver will you have for public finances? [Sarkozy] Our room to maneuver will not be great. The recovery is being led by exports and investments, which do not increase the state's main revenue -- VAT. In addition, we will continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis. Moreover, this makes the debate on passive spending on unemployment, which some people would like to turn into active spending for employment, unrealistic. But who would suggest reducing the benefits paid to the unemployed and those who have had to retire early? [Couvrat] When will you succeed in making savings on social security spending? [Sarkozy] We have already done so. We will continue to do so. If we want to maintain the French people's social benefits, we must continue the vital effort to achieve medical control of health spending. It is not emergency services which worry us: The increase in costs in this sphere is consistent with the agreement reached between the social affairs minister and the professionals. On the other hand, spending on drugs increased by 7.2 percent in 1993, which is equivalent to a spontaneous increase of 10 percent, partly disguised by the reduction in reimbursements decided last year. And hospital spending has also increased by 7 percent over 12 months. If we do not want to increase compulsory contributions, we have no other course but to control spending. But we will not succeed in doing that without convincing the professionals concerned: doctors, members of the drug industry, and hospital staff. It is with them that we will succeed. [Couvrat] The prime minister has just suggested a reform of social security funding which, with regard to contributions, would replace methods of funding based on consumption or income. Is this the right time to reduce income tax, as you have promised to do for 1995? [Sarkozy] In 1993, we carried out a first stage in this reduction by returning Fr19 billion to the French people. That was a good initiative. The first reduction of Fr6 billion, which took effect with the first interim tax payment, is not unconnected with the good economic indicators. The remaining amount, in other words Fr13 billion, will be implemented on the final one-third of taxes due. Should we go further? I am convinced that the income tax reform must be continued. But should it be continued as of 1995 or later? The question is this: For what should we use the margins which the new-found growth will give us? This is the heart of the debate. I am listening. I am gathering views. I am listening to the arguments of those like Jacques Barrot or Christian Poncelet, who propose to defer the reform, not to use the room to maneuver which is available for cutting income tax, but rather for reducing social security costs in order to create jobs. I will participate in this debate. This matter has not been decided. The majority will have to debate it. It will be for the government to draw the conclusions when the time for budget adjustments comes, in other words during the summer.
