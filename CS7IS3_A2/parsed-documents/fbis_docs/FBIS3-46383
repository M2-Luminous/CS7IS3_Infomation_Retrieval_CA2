This year, the problem of unfair competition between foreign trade enterprises should be solved. In the future, individuals will be allowed to engage in foreign trade, but this cannot be effected for the time being. The leader said that there is no overheating in foreign trade. As long as the market exists and goods can be sold at a good profit, the more are sold, the better. Reform in the foreign trade system will break monopolies and decentralize management power. In 1988, provincial trade companies received foreign trade powers. In 1990, the problem of unequal competition between localities was solved. In 1994, the problem of unequal competition between enterprises should be solved. Foreign trade should move from monopoly to competition. Export subsidies should be stopped. As a result, China's foreign trade will rank in a more advanced position in the world. Finally, foreign trade will be conducted by business groups, and small foreign trade companies are just transitional forms. Eventually, there will be a number of large corporations, like those in Japan. The leader said that conditions should be created for an export agency system. Foreign trade companies should be gradually turned into productive enterprises with fixed bases. Action should be started from improving the variety of products, and the integration of foreign trade with industrial and agricultural production should be promoted. Some people asked why individuals are not allowed to engage in foreign trade. This may be effected in the future, but this is still impossible for the time being. Joint-stock companies with shares held by workers inside enterprises can be established, because this is an effective way to invigorate state-owned foreign trade enterprises.
