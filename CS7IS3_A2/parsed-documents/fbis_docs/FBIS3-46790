The team found no evidence of a cover-up or connivance at the fraud in its questioning of the two former defense officials Tuesday night, a team spokesman said. Kwon told investigators that he first received a report on the scam from his law officer on July 28, and then from the defense logistics agency director on Aug. 6, which agreed with statements given by others, the spokesman said. Kim said that he did not forward a July 23 report on the scam from his man attached to the Defense Ministry to Minister Kwon because Kwon was supposed to receive the report from his law officer and the Defense Logistics Agency director, which the team spokesman said cleared him of the suspicion that he had hidden the fraud from the defense minister. There is no evidence that the Defense Ministry leadership tried to cover up the case, he said, the swindle involved only French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and his Korean agent, Chu Kwang-yong. Not cleared, however, is Yang Kyu-sok, 45, operations officer of United Shipping Co., who was arrested on charges of issuing a phoney bill of lading to Chu in return for a 5 million-won bribe. Yang is charged with forging a bill of lading issued by Dutch shipping firm shipcraft for shipment of 40,000 rounds of 90mm recoilless rifle ammunition worth 1.3 billion won. On the strength of this forged shipping document, Chu and fuan withdrew payment for the non-existent ammunition from the Korea Exchange Bank's Paris Branch in April 1991.
