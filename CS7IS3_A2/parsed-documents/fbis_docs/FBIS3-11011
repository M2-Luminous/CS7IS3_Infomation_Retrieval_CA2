He allowed us to see one of the huts where he lives, and he told us part of his life story, talking of his infancy, youth, and his adult life. He became sullen when speaking of the love he left behind and when discussing his ideas on what this country could and should be. Subcommander Marcos did all of this in a hamlet where we could not return if we had to; we are still unsure how we got there or precisely where it is located. This allowed us to get to know a pleasant subcommander and learn intimate details of his life. He told us part of his life story and showed us his customs; he recalled he had lived in Monterrey for a year while discussing with us the happy and the sad. He talked about his unknown identity, his "having no future," and, more than anything else, he showed a Marcos, who, as he says, "can die at any moment." Our eagerness to talk with the subcommander did not diminish, and it was only surpassed by our curiosity and desire to know the real Marcos -- the man who hides behind this nom de guerre. With this in mind, we -- reporters from EL NORTE and a photographer -- went to this encounter, which was perhaps a frustrated encounter. Outfitted with a rented jeep, a can of gasoline, blankets, and food, we departed for San Cristobal de las Casas en route to Ocosingo. From there we went to the hamlet of San Miguel, where we arrived at 0715 on Sunday, 6 March. A long line of journalists and reporters grabbed our attention and perhaps even dismayed us a bit. Eventually, patience gave way to impatience. Some reporters gave up and left. Nevertheless, about 40 reporters remained behind, and we were among them. At almost 1500, two Indians ran into the hamlet. They asked for the reporters from EL NORTE and REFORMA. Only we were included, and the others excluded. Not even the foreign reporters were taken into account, including those from THE NEW YORK TIMES, as well as those from the domestic press, as well as reporters from Spain, France, and Canada. Only reporters from EL NORTE and REFORMA would be taken to see Marcos. The order was to wait until the rest of the reporters departed. We had to wait until 2230 on Sunday. There were two failed attempts to enter the jungle, but the third time was the charm. When we first came upon him, he was outlined in a silhouette. We noticed the smoke of his pipe and his height, for he stood taller than the others who surrounded him. This was how we met Marcos: He emerged from darkness. "Well, get ready. No questions right now, but if you would like, we can talk and wait for questions to come up... Come on then; I am going to take you," said the subcommander, who flirted with a female reporter from a magazine who had joined the group. He proceeded in a red pickup truck, remaining in the constant guard of heavily armed soldiers. Three of them were women, while three others were men who carefully searched us and our jeep. We advanced in almost complete darkness. The jeep bounced the entire way until we arrived at a small house. We were then asked to leave the vehicle, and from here we were led by a female soldier into a hut. The warning was clear: "Make no reference to the names of any hamlets or the amount of time it took you to travel here, and do not mention any specific markings along the way. If you want to take photographs of people, you must wait for them to cover their faces." We slept there on Sunday. The following day, Monday, 7 March, we waited until 1500. At that time, the subcommander arrived with his guards. He had come to pick us up. The man who startled the Mexican political system and surprised the world, decided right then to drive EL NORTE's jeep and asked one of the reporters and a photographer to ride in the truck. I was asked to accompany him. I now had a "chauffeur" and a revolutionary. He found it difficult to shift gears and accelerate the car in second gear and was very careful when he drove. Despite this, the vehicle got stuck, and we were only able to extricate it by pushing it out. We had to go through three EZLN checkpoints, and at each one we were examined more carefully than the previous occasion. We were also warned about deactivated land mines along the side of the road. During the drive, the subcommander said something strange and out of place. He said: "I lived in Monterrey." Somewhat confused, I asked him very respectfully: Sir, did you really live in Monterrey? What part? He grabbed his pipe filled with vanilla-smelling tobacco and answered over the jeep's noise: "Yes, I lived in Monterrey for almost a year. I lived near Felix U. Gomez. What I liked most about the place was the mountainous region. I worked in the outskirts of Monterrey, near Santa Catarina selling secondhand clothes. I was a secondhand clothes dealer. I only sold native clothes, nothing imported," he stipulated. "I also lived in the public washrooms of the Truckers Union located in Avenida Colon. Those were extremely filthy washrooms. I would also use the washrooms of the cinemas located in the same avenue. I was always around there." He commented that the mountainous regions are quite special because over there they do not like charlatans. "I am going to give you a hint so that you can identify me. I played second string for the Rayados [not further specified]. I was what you could call a reserve player. I played right field. It was beautiful to fly in the outfield," he commented. "Beer is very popular there," he added, "from Monterrey I went to Veracruz where I sold fish." He recalled that in Maderos Avenue, there was a restaurant that specialized in preparing goat meat with a very special flavor. He interrupts his comments to say that a Nuevo Mexico group had written him asking him to rescue that state. Later on, he commented about the traditions of the inhabitants and all the arrangements involved in getting married, like the gifts and the first time the couple meet on the wedding day. He finally parks the jeep and tells us to get out. We walk for a short while until we reach the top of a hill where we enter a shack where there were several other EZLN members. We decided to rest, and the subcommander did likewise. A short time later, we began the interview with another reporter. Sitting in the hut surrounded by the other EZLN members, he commented that so far there had been no accord, negotiation, or agreement between the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. The subcommander promised another interview later. He ate by himself and later departed but not before saying that he would return in the morning to take us to a party commemorating Women's Day. On 8 Tuesday, he entered the hut very early in the morning amid the sounds of crickets and birds. We had beans, rice, and coffee for breakfast at 0700. There are no refreshments, television, or any other entertainment, only poverty. Silvestre and Arturo, two Zapatists, broke the early morning stillness with two of their ballads: "I am an insurgent soldier, seeking a revolution I move along. And they all want to fight together as militia men... Without much to brag about, without any rest, they left their homes, they left their loved ones. I am an insurgent soldier, seeking a revolution I move along." The subcommander returns at noon accompanied by several men and women, a part of the revolution that did not reached Chiapas. He drove our jeep again, and we reached a distant town after driving for a long time, while an airplane overflew the region. The sound of chickens, birds, and abundant vegetation gave way to three other EZLN checkpoints. We finally reached the town where arrangements for the party were still being made and the subcommander was responsible for bringing flowers. He softened his stance and proceeded to tell about his entry into the Indian world and later the EZLN. "We arrived in the jungle in 1983, nearly 11 years ago. It was a very small group, only five." The EZLN emerged with peasants tired of living like that. The original five arrived from the city, fed up with the legal forms of struggle, failure, and limitations, let alone the failure of the 1970's guerrillas. "This group set up camp in the jungle and started to adapt themselves to the environment to survive. Those were hardy days. It was necessary to extract food, dwellings, medicines, everything, from the jungle. There was no other way, and the villagers were not supporting us." Seated on a school desk, he told about how they learned to survive first and then spread their ideas without religious interference. His eyes are light and honey colored. His beard is gray and his dark brown straight hair shows out from under his ski mask. A tobacco smell surrounds him. He says: "The Indians had just had an experience with a group from the north, the northerners, I think they were called -- popular politics, Maoist proletarian inclinations. They infiltrated the movement and tried to gain access to the communities' structures but were thrown out. They included Hugo Andres Araujo and Salinas' brother, Raul, but they were taken out also." Marcos joked openly and appeared to be sincere during his interview with EL NORTE. Lunchtime came, and we were served pork with rice and beans. The subcommander ate in his hut. We approached the hut and saw more than 50 heavily armed EZLN soldiers protecting the area. We were allowed to take pictures of Zapatists preparing food. In the background we saw Marcos' wooden hut, roofed with zinc and straw, with ventilation portholes and a guarded door. His bathroom has no massaging tub or any luxurious features. He only has a latrine and a water tank with a hose attached to pour water. Mud, smells, and barefoot children walking around make up this scene. On the subcommander's invitation we went to a river to bathe. The cold water flowed slowly in the shadows. We dived into the stream, always guarded by a Zapatist. We returned and waited for the party, for which loudspeakers had been installed. A gas tank and a lamp were placed where the dance, to which all the people had been invited, would take place. Later, more than 150 armed Zapatists came down from the mountain led by the subcommander to start the celebration. In the background there were four unarmed women in civilian clothes but with their faces covered by shawls. Capt. Benito announced the beginning of the cultural program, which featured songs, speeches, and military formations. The Zapatist anthem opened the celebration: "Zapatist fighters, the horizon is already in sight. The road will bring down those coming from behind. Let's march forward so we can win the fight because our homeland needs the efforts of the Zapatists. Men, women, and children, we will always make our effort with peasants, workers, and all the people. We must set the example and stick to our slogan. We will defend the homeland and die for freedom. Our history says that exploitation will come to an end. Our people will fight for freedom." The party concluded with Subcommander Marco's departure in the darkness. He promised that he would be back on Wednesday 9 March for an exclusive interview with EL NORTE. He arrived after breakfast. He was reminded that, for the time being, we did not want to hear about the movement but about the man behind the ski mask and the lives of some Indians who had fought. "No, not that. I cannot say anything personal now. Maybe later. Let us start somewhere else," said the subcommander seated under the roof of a hut whose corners were guarded by three armed men and three armed women.
