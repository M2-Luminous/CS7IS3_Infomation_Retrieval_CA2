FR941107-0-00045 FR941107-0-00016 Authority: 47 U.S.C. Sections 154, 301, 302, 303, and 332, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 24.204 is amended by revising the introductory text of paragraph (f), and by adding a new sentence at the end of paragraph (f)(3)(i), to read as follows: ยง24.204 Cellular eligibility. * * * * * (f) Cellular Divestiture. Parties holding controlling or attributable ownership interests in cellular licenses may be a party to a broadband PCS application (i.e., have a controlling or attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant), and such PCS applicant will be eligible for more than one 10 MHz broadband PCS license and/or MHz PCS license(s) pursuant to the divestiture procedures set forth in paragraphs (f) (1) through (3) of this section; Provided, however, that these divestiture procedures shall be available only to: parties with controlling or attributable ownership interests in cellular licenses where the CGSA(s) covers 20 percent or less of the PCS service area population; and parties with non-controlling attributable interests in cellular licenses, regardless of the degree to which the CGSA(s) covers the PCS service area population. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``non-controlling attributable interest'' is one in which the holder has less than a fifty (50) percent voting interest and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty (50) percent or greater voting interest. * * * * * (3) * * * (i) * * * The trustee must divest the property within six months from grant of license. * * * * * 3. Section 24.238 is revised to read as follows: ยง24.238 Emission limits. (a) On any frequency outside a licensee's frequency block, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. (b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. (c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's frequency block edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits. (d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the transmitter power. (e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.
