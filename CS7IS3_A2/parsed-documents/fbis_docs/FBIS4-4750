In view of remaining structural problems, it will be difficult for the economy to recover rapidly in the immediate future but there is no danger any longer of its plunging into a double-dip recession, Kumagai told a regular press conference. Corporate capital spending is still slack but personal spending has begun "clearly" picking up, he said. Kumagai said he expects auto sales to lead an expected economic recovery. March auto sales fell 3.7 percent from a year before -- but this was an improvement from an 8.4 percent drop in February. Kumagai said a coming ministerial gathering in Marrakech, Morocco, for the signing of the global trade pact may provide "the best opportunity" to open the way for a breakthrough in the stalled trade talks with the United States. Ministers from Japan, the U.S. and other member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will meet in Marrakech later this month to ratify the Uruguay Round pact concluded in December. Kumagai said he has yet to decide whether or not he will go to Marrakech, citing a tight parliamentary schedule.
