The start of the cargo spaceship originally scheduled for March 19, was delayed for three days due to heavy snowfalls in the area of the launching site. The snow drifts were up to six meters high, a spokesman for the flight control center told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday adding that the fire which occurred at the Baykonur cosmodrome on March 7 had nothing to do with the delay of the launch. The cargo spaceship "Progress M-22" has become the 1101st space object launched into orbit from the Baykonur cosmodrome since the beginning of the space era -- October 4, 1957.
