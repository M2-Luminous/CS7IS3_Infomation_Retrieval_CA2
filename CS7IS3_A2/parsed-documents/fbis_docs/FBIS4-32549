The meeting, which took place in the Belweder Palace, was relayed live via satellite by all 12 regional TV stations carrying Polonia 1 programs, the NTW editorial office reported on 26 June. According to NTW, such relay and its scope occurred for the first time in the history of commercial television in Poland. As it transpires from a communique sent to PAP, viewers across the whole country could ask the president questions directly thanks to special telephone links. Lech Walesa answered questions posed before and during the program for about 35 minutes. The questions concerned diverse issues, among other things, local government elections and plans for the presidential election campaign, foreign policy, and Poland's participation in NATO. Questions were also asked about the president's attitude to the death penalty and the judiciary, in general. Asked why such conversation was not carried by public television, which belongs to both the rulers and the ruled, Lech Walesa replied that he had never refused participation in public television programs but that he had never received an invitation. He also said that it would be ideal to make available those frequencies currently owned by the military to all interested broadcasters and let the harsh market rules decide on selection. He said, however, that the Army needs time and the necessary equipment to make these frequencies gradually available. Asked if, besides the National Radio and TV Broadcasting Council [KRRiTV], there should be an institution controlling the press, the president replied that he is an opponent of political control in a democratic state and that, in any case, the press carries so many virtually scandalous reports that to deny them he would have to bring several court cases every day, the NTW statement reads. [Warsaw Third Program Radio Network in Polish at 0900 GMT on 26 June adds that NTW "has been broadcasting without a franchise" and "belongs to Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 Television Network"]
