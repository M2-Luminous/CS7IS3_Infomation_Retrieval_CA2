The ceremony, presided over by Vice President Li Yuan-zu on behalf of President Li Teng-hui was witnessed by more than 100 guests, including National Defense Minister Sun Chen and Admiral Liu Ho-chien, chief of the general staff. "The purpose of strengthening our military power is for defense, not offense. It is for sustaining peace, not for provoking war," Li said. Construction of the warship, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted Ching dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990. The first frigate went into service last May and the last one is scheduled to begin service by October 1999. The eight 4,200-ton frigates, which will eventually cost the Navy more than NT [new Taiwan] $40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are to replace part of the Navy's aging fleet. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the ROC Navy had 24 destroyers and nine frigates as of the end of 1992. Taiwan also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy 16 Lafayette-class frigates from France. With a maximum speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour, each of the frigates will be armed with locally-manufactured Hsiung-feng ship- to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, anti submarine torpedoes, and a Phalanx weapons system built by the General Dynamics Corp. of the United States.
