As the top administrative official at Sisde, Italy's civilian espionage service, 51-year-old Broccoletti, who is going on trial with his former boss Riccardo Malpica and five others, held the purse-strings and decided what was spent where under the interior minister's and the prime minister's guidance. Malpica was arrested on October 29 last year after testimony from Broccoletti claiming that interior ministers over the last ten years, including Scalfaro during his spell at the ministry from 1983-87, should receive the blame for any financial misdeeds in secret service funding. The charges claim that Malpica, Broccoletti and others stashed away at least 40 million dollars through front companies and a travel agency to accounts in Italy and San Marino and elsewhere, buying real estate, yachts and other property in Italy and South America. Later unconfirmed figures claimed that even larger sums may be involved. The investigations into the illicit use of secret funds began in 1992 and were shelved late that year, according to Broccoletti's allegations because a cover-up had been organised by Scalfaro and outgoing Interior Minister Nicola Mancino. Broccoletti was finally placed in preventive custody on June 25 last year, and other top officials were placed in detention over the next few weeks. They were all released as the investigations continued. Then, at the end of October, Broccoletti was called in for further questioning and submitted a dossier formulating his charges against his former political bosses. The following day, he fled to Montecarlo as the prosecutors once again denied his cover-up allegations. He was arrested in Montecarlo on November 2 and extradited to Italy on January 5 and, on January 6, again claimed there had been a meeting between Scalfaro, Mancino and others to organise a cover-up, an allegation that was once more denied categorically by Scalfaro's office. A list of witnesses filed with the court here today indicated all the prime ministers who served from 1984 to the present day, all the interior ministers who served from June 13 1978 to the present day, and all the Sisde chiefs from April 27 1984 to the present day. Other witnesses on the list include members of the judiciary, bank officials and executives, and others who had dealings with Sisde and its funds. The prime ministers to be cited are, in chronological order, Bettino Craxi, Amintore Fanfani, Giovanni Goria, Ciriaco De Mita, Giulio Andreotti, Giuliano Amato, and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi; the interior ministers, Virginio Rognoni, Amintore Fanfani, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Antonio Gava, Vincenzo Scotti, and Nicola Mancino. According to Broccoletti's lawyers, the prime ministers should be called for their role deciding areas of competence as to the management of the secret funds and the criteria applied for sharing them, deciding on bonus payments and so on. Similar points were made as regards the interior ministers and the ex-Sisde chiefs whom Broccoletti wants to see on the witness stand.
