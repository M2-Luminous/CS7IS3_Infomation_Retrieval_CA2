FR941122-1-00058 FR941122-1-00015 B. Objectives The Commission proposes changes to its rules for the 800 MHz SMR service that are intended to promote the growth of both traditional local SMR service and emerging wide-area SMR services, and to enhance the ability of all SMR providers to compete in the larger commercial mobile services market. Specifically, the Commission seeks to designate a block of contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band for licensing to wide-area systems to enable them to use innovative wideband technologies and compete more effectively against Personal Communications Services and cellular, which also use contiguous spectrum. The Commission proposes to license non-contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band on a local basis to provide opportunities for smaller SMR systems that seek to provide local niche services. It also seeks to encourage more efficient use of spectrum in congested areas and to accommodate technologically advanced systems. Finally, the Further Notice seeks to establish a new licensing mechanism for the 800 MHz SMR service that will significantly streamline the processing of applications, reducing the administrative burden for both applicants and the Commission. C. Legal Basis The proposed action is authorized under the Budget Act, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, title VI, Section 6002, and Sections 2(a), 3(n), 4(i), 302, 303(g), 303(r), 309(i), 309(j), 332(a), 332(c), and 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 152(a), 153(n), 154(i), 302, 303(g), 303(r), 309(i), 309(j), 332(a), 332(c) and 332(d), as amended. D. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements Under the proposal contained in the Further Notice, SMR licensees who obtain MTA-based licenses may be required to report information regarding location of their facilities and coverage of their service areas. SMR applicants seeking treatment as ``designated entities'' may also be subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements to demonstrate compliance with our competitive bidding rules. E. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules None. F. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved The Further Notice potentially affects numerous small entities already operating 800 MHz SMR systems on frequencies that would be designated for licensing on a wide-area bases. The Further Notice of proposed Rule making tentatively concludes that existing licensees on these frequencies should be allowed to continue operating under their existing authorizations, but also seeks to encourage voluntary frequency transfers or other arrangements to allow for efficient spectrum use. The competitive bidding proposals contained in the Further Notice also could affect small entities seeking initial licenses in the 800 MHz SMR service. The Further Notice proposes special provisions in the Commission's auction rules to benefit ``designated entity'' applicants, including small businesses. After evaluating comments filed in response to the Further Notice, the Commission will examine further the impact of all rule changes on small entities and set forth its findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
