The public docket supporting this action is available for public inspection in Room ET G&hyph;102 at the above address from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division, (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7335. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces an opportunity to participant in negoatiations for an enforceable consent agreement for: ETBE (Docket No. 42052Q/42179) and TAME (Docket No. 42052Q/42180). I. Background Requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;1671q, along with reports of adverse human health effects associated with the use of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in winter-blend gasoline, have contributed to the need for health effects testing of ETBE and TAME. MTBE, ETBE and TAME are fuel oxygenates which may be used to satisfy the following requirements under the CAA. Under section 211(m) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7545, states which have certain nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide (CO) must require that any gasoline sold or dispensed to ultimate consumers in a specified portion of the nonattainment area be blended, during wintertime, to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight (or applicable percentage to meet the national primary air quality standard for CO by the established attainment date). Under section 211(k), reformulated gasoline must be used in nine major metropolitan areas designated as ozone nonattainment areas as well as various nonattainment ``opt-in'' areas by 1995 and the oxygen content of this gasoline must be equal to or exceed 2 percent by weight. See Final Rule, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716). In addition, a proposed regulation would require that at least 30 percent of the oxygen content in reformulated gasoline come from renewable oxygenates, which would include ETBE (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Regulation of Fuels and Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline, December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68343)). Recently there have been reports from the State of Alaska and several areas in the lower 48 of adverse human effects associated with the use of MTBE in winter-blend gasoline. See Assessment of Potential Health Risks of Gasoline Oxygenated with MTBE, Office of Research and Development, U.S. EPA, November 1993. EPA believes that additional health effects test data on fuel oxygenates are needed to allow government agencies and industry to compare the health risks associated with the use of these substances to augment or substitute for MTBE as a fuel oxygenate. For this reason, researchers and policy makers from EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) and Office of Research and Development (ORD) initiated a conference with the State of Alaska, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the chemical and petroleum industries in Research Triangle Park, NC on December 7-8, 1993 to discuss research on the health effects of and human exposure to fuel oxygenates. One of the products of this meeting was a research project proposal to conduct toxicity testing to develop a broad base of health effects data on ETBE and TAME. The research proposal was developed to expedite the process of identifying data needs on these substances. The research proposal recommends testing of ETBE and TAME for the following endpoints: 1st Tier genotoxicity 90&hyph;day inhalation subchronic Neurotoxicity (Functional observational battery, neuropathology, motor activity) Developmental toxicity Reproductive effects Pharmacokinetics II. Testing Program EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) administers the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the TSCA section 4 testing program. Under TSCA section 4, 15 U.S.C. 2603, EPA may require, in specific circumstances, that chemical manufacturers and processors provide to EPA test data that can be used to assess the impact on human health and the environment from exposure to such chemicals. In addition to imposing section 4 testing requirements by rulemaking, OPPT has developed an enforceable consent agreement (ECA) process for obtaining needed testing often with less time and resources and more flexibility than under a test rule. See 40 CFR part 790. Finally, industry may conduct voluntary testing of specific chemicals in anticipation of data needs. In a memorandum dated March 1, 1994, EPA's OAR requested OPPT to inquire regarding the likelihood that industry would develop a voluntary testing program for ETBE and TAME. In the absence of such a voluntary commitment, OAR requested that OPPT use its authority under TSCA to require such testing. OPPT sent out a form letter dated March 1, 1994 to approximately 45 chemical and petroleum companies. The letter described the December 7, 1993 meeting and enclosed a copy of the research proposal developed at that meeting, and sought to establish a dialogue with industry regarding the testing of ETBE and TAME. Subsequently, OPPT elected to pursue the testing of ETBE and TAME through the ECA process. The purpose of the meeting on May 9, 1994 is to initiate negotiations for the development of an ECA for the testing of ETBE and TAME. If an ECA approach does not appear feasible, EPA will initiate rulemaking under section 4 of TSCA to require the development of data on ETBE and TAME. EPA is adding ETBE and TAME to the Master Testing List (MTL), which sets priorities for OPPT's testing agenda, because EPA considers testing of these substances to be a high priority. EPA has been using the MTL since 1990 to set the Agency's testing agenda and communicate it to the public. III.
