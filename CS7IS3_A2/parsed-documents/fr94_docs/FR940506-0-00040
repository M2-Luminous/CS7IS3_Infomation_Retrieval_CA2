FR940506-0-00040 FR940506-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 28 CFR Part 0 Redelegation of Functions; Delegation of Authority to Drug Enforcement Administration Official AGENCY: Department of Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Under delegated authority, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Justice, is amending the appendix to the Justice Department regulations to redelegate certain functions and authority which were vested in the Attorney General by the Controlled Substances Act and subsequently delegated to the Administrator. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie C. Gallagher, Associate Chief Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537. Telephone number: (202) 307&hyph;8010. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 801 set seq.) establishes a detailed regulatory scheme governing the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances and listed chemicals. The CSA requires that every person who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance or who manufactures, distributes, exports or imports certain listed chemicals must obtain a registration from DEA. An application for such registration may be denied or a registration revoked pursuant to specific provisions of the CSA. The Attorney General has delegated her functions under the CSA to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. See 21 U.S.C. 871(a) and 28 CFR 0.100(b). Regulations implementing the CSA empower the Administrator, for example, to issue final orders to deny applications for registration or revoke registrations, to schedule controlled substances, to designate chemicals as listed chemicals and to establish quotas. The Attorney General has also authorized the Administrator to redelegate any of his functions under the CSA to any of his subordinates. See 28 CFR 0.104. To further enhance the administration of the CSA and its attendant regulations, the Administrator is redelegating to the Deputy Administrator the authority to exercise all necessary functions under 21 CFR part 1300 which have not already been redelegated in subpart R of 28 CFR 0.104. This redelegation will empower the Deputy Administrator, among other things, to issue final orders relating to the suspension, denial or revocation of registration, scheduling actions, designation of chemicals as listed chemicals, establishment of production quotas for certain controlled substances, and to grant or deny waivers of CSA regulations relating to registrants. This redelegation will include the authority to exercise all regulatory functions which may be delegated to the Administrator in the future pursuant to subsequent amendments to 21 CFR part 1300 and not otherwise specifically assigned or reserved by the Administrator. The Administrator certifies that this action will have no impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, this is not a significant regulatory action since it relates only to the organization of functions within DEA. Accordingly, it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget and does not require certification under Executive Order 12778. This action has been analyzed in accordance with Executive Order 12616. It has been determined that this matter has no federalism implications which would warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. List of Sections in 28 CFR Part 0 Authority delegations (Government Agencies), Organization and functions (Government Agencies). For the reasons set forth above, and pursuant to the authority vested in the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration by 28 CFR 0.100 and 0.104, and 21 U.S.C. 871, title 28, of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 0, appendix to subpart R, Redelegation of Functions, is amended as follows: PART 0_ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 1. The authority citation for part 0 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 515&hyph;519. 2. The Appendix to subpart R is amended as follows: a. Sec. 12 is added to read as follows: Appendix to Subpart R_Redelegation of Functions * * * * * Sec. 12. All other functions . The Deputy Adminstrator is authorized to exercise all necessary functions under 21 CFR Part 1300, except those functions otherwise delegated within this subpart. This will include functions which may be vested in the Administrator in subsequent amendments to 21 CFR Part 1300 and not otherwise specifically assigned or reserved by him. Appendix to Subpart R_[Amended] b. Sec. 7. (a), (g), (i), and (j) shall be amended by inserting the word ``Deputy'' before the word ``Administrator'' each place it appears. Dated: April 29, 1994.
