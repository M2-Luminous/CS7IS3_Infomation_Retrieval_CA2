Security Council on possible sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the State Department announced here today. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a statement at a news briefing, saying that "We have no basis for holding a third round of high level talks with North Korea and we will seek further action in the U.N. Security Council." Gallucci said International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director- General Hans Blix reported to the U.N. Security Council yesterday that the IAEA has now lost the ability to accurately measure nuclear fuel discharged from a nuclear reactor in the DPRK. The IAEA has said that the loss of this technique means that its overall ability to verify the amount of plutonium previously produced by the DPRK has been seriously eroded. "Since the beginning of our negotiations with the North Koreans last June," Gallucci claimed, "We said that satisfactory IAEA safeguards presence during the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor was one essential basis for continuing our dialogue with North Korea." Gallucci today began consultations on future steps including possible sanctions with a South Korean special envoy in Washington. He said he will have trilateral meetings with Japanese representatives and the South Korean special envoy tomorrow. The White House also issued a statement today, saying U.S. President Bill Clinton, in Rome, telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is in Moscow for a visit, about the situation in the DPRK. Yeltsin has proposed an international conference on the DPRK issue. The White House said Clinton told Yeltsin "Such a meeting might be appropriate at some poe need first to return the North Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council." [sentence as received] Clinton and Kim "agreed that the next step is to pursue the issue of sanctions" against the DPRK, the White House said.
