He expressed his hope that Egypt will continue its support for the Somali nation because it will pass through a critical stage in the future after the U.S. and European forces have withdrawn on 21 March. [passage omitted] He addressed a message to General Aidid in which he said that the various factions welcome his participation in the Cairo meeting and his participation in the dialogue under the auspices of President Mubarak. Abshir also expressed the factions' willingness to forget the past and cooperate with him for the sake of the Somali people interest to restore stability, establish a central authority, help Somalia restore its credibility, and renounce violence to find a peaceful and Islamic solution. He stressed the need for Aidid to take this historic opportunity, face the challenge, and prove to the world that the Somalis can rearrange the house from within. He noted that the main obstacle to the implementation of the Addis Ababa Accord lies in the stance of General Aidid himself. Aidid, he said, claims that he controls most of the Somali local and regional councils and administrations, although he does not enjoy a popular consensus and does not form a majority at all. He said the Somali problem now centers on personal interests and a power struggle. He added that Aidid's group, which consists of only three of the 15 factions, have killed approximately 400,000 Somalis either by fire or by preventing food aid from reaching the needy over the last three years. On charges that the United Nations caused the war in Somalia, Abshir said the international organization has exerted effective efforts to find a solution to the Somali problem and provided humanitarian and food aid. He noted that it is General Aidid who is responsible for disseminating these accusations in which Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan support him. Sudan, he said, fears that the U.S. forces may move into south Sudan from the Somali territories. Sudan has invited General Aidid and granted him about a half million dollars to support the tribal war in Somalia. Abshir noted the need for the presence of Arab forces to rebuild Somalia and set up a police force to confront these problems and control the arms of the warring factions.
