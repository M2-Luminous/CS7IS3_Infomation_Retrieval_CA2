"We all agree that we have to form a new cabinet within next week," Social Democratic Party (SDP) secretary general Wataru Kubo told a news conference. The No. 2 man in the largest contingent in the coalition voiced hope that the ruling seven-party union can inaugurate a new cabinet and finish the next premier's major policy speech and a questioning session by representatives from all parties before parliament next week. Kubo also spoke of the need for the new government to open deliberations on the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, in the week beginning April 17. The ruling parties' officials will resume talks on Sunday morning over the selection of a candidate to succeed Hosokawa, who on Friday offered to resign after eight months in office because of controversy over his personal financial deals and stalled Diet budget debate. At Saturday's meeting, the coalition executives continued discussing a proposal for further coordinating basic policies among the partners of the current coalition before setting up a fresh administration, Kubo said. The present coalition, an alliance of seven parties spanning a wide political spectrum, set sail last August after the parties in July hammered out an accord on basic policies to establish a government. The SDP believes the intercoalition agreement should be honored even if the ruling forces move to narrow down their differences on other policy matters, Kubo said. Some coalition parties contend that now that the Hosokawa government's intention to implement anticorruption political reform has been achieved, the next government should be created on the basis of a new policy accord to institute new reforms. This concept could result in forcing the SDP out of the coalition due to its lingering policy differences with other coalition partners. The SDP secretary general, however, said coalition executives are working to pick a possible successor to Hosokawa while maintaining the current framework of the union. Also at Saturday's meeting, the officials of the ruling parties listened to a call from an official of a newly created parliamentary group in the House of Representatives on other ruling forces to join the group. The new group "Reform," consisting of members of Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party, was established Friday after the JNP dissolved its parliamentary affiliation with new party Sakigake (Harbinger). Behind the establishment of the group is Hosokawa's intention to create a new large parliamentary group of current coalition forces as a step toward launching a new party to keep the once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party at bay, political sources said. Each party of the coalition will consider the call from the new parliamentary group on their own, Kubo said. Shinseito and Komeito are expected to join "Reform" next week, while the SDP, Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party will not take part in the parliamentary group, coalition sources said. Shinseito and Komeito are envisioning a new government to be made up of parties with full accords on key policies, such as tax reform and policy toward North Korea, party officials said. The SDP disagrees with their stand, saying the top priority should be how to maintain the seven-party coalition and keep it in power, SDP lawmakers said. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, also vice premier, is emerging as the front-runner for the premiership, coalition sources said. In interviews with news organizations, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP hinted at allying with Shinseito and other parties with which he shares views on Japan-U.S. relations, tax reform and North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. He said the Japanese people want to see an alliance of parties that can execute policy objectives. Asked about the possibility that some senior Shinseito members may ask Watanabe to run for the premiership if he quits the LDP, Watanabe replied, "Ask the Shinseito members."
