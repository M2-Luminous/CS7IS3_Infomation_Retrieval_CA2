Typhoid fever, dysentery, salmonellosis, diphtheria...Tear-stained mothers, sad and somehow unchildlike eyes of little children on transparent emaciated little faces. ``Survive, survive,'' I want to whisper to each one, ``let the fate of that little boy pass you by.'' A month ago, a family infected with diptheria was brought here from the Veselovskiy rayon. The 10-year-old little boy could not be saved. And this is not the oblast's only case of a lethal outcome of diptheria, a disease that was considered conquered forever many years ago. And that's really how it was in our country. And suddenly -- a sharp jump in morbidity this year. According to physician's forecasts, they will not be able to stop it any time soon. It is not a matter of 1 year. And only God knows how many more children's and even adults' lives this contagious disease will take. It seems that nothing foretold the problem in Volgodonsk either. But just as suddenly, 130 persons -- big and small -- ended up on hospital cots with a diagnosis of typhoid fever. Suddenly a landslide of morbidity due to dysentery, salmonellosis, and tularemia began. In the mining city of Gukovo, for example, salmonellosis raged twice this summer. Once the source was the worker's dining room. The other time the kindergarten was the source. About 100 persons became ill with dysentery at the same time in Aksay. Cholera flew into the oblast from India on the wings of a charter commercial run along with Indian beads and leather handbags... And all this happened suddenly? Of course not. Physicians specializing in communicable diseases say with certainty that diptheria was provoked and predetermined 3-4 years ago. The current situation givens them the right to make the fully substantiated announcement that it is a result not of chance but rather the campaign developed in the mass media against vaccinations -- the sole means of guaranteeing immunity against diptheria. It may have been public opinion and intentional or not, but it was completely purposely designed to be negative toward vaccinations. People overloaded with scientific degrees but not physicians spoke in the press and on radio and stated that vaccinations, especially antidiptheria vaccinations, are toxicogenic. ``So why did you keep silent? Why did you not conduct counter-propaganda?'' I asked Oleg Dumbadze, physician specializing in communicable diseases from the oblast public health department. ``And why do we always remain silent about everything?'' he responded to my question with a question. ``Because we thought: They won't find any simpletons who will believe the madness that is being carried over the radio.'' Of course, the problem lies not only in the vaccinations, even though they are without a doubt very important. And to now make them the entire cause is too simple. The plant manufacturing the vaccines remained in Russia, but also diptheria roams the territories adjacent to it -- Ukraine and Byelarus. From there, infected people travel to us. But it is very difficult to receive the vaccine because of the break in economic ties. Another plant remained in Tbilisi. The whole problem is in the total shambles of the socialist health care system -- a system that other civilized countries, as they are now called, have never known. L.S. Sadovskaya, head of the No. 2 infectious disease department of the Rostov City Hospital, told me painfully that even last summer health care organizers from Scotland were in the city. They came to us with experience. Indeed, not one country has yet created a system of monitoring health that is as interconnected, efficient, and maximally inclusive of the population as that recently created in our city. And the Western specialists hurried to wreck it so as to have time to see that it has already ceased to exist. The break of the sanitary-epidemiological oversight from the overall health care system did not play the definitive role in the wave of infections. Today, public health physicians are essentially removed from responsibility for the operation of those enterprises on which people's health depends. Poisoning in the workers' dining room? The mine's director is responsible for it. Typhoid fever in Volgodonsk? A statement from the Vodokanal that infection penetrating the water supply system through rusted pipes is responsible. Of course, the officials in charge of the government's economic functions are responsible for this. But in our day, they find hundreds of reasons to explain similar disruptions. In fact, the oblast administration does not bear responsibility for the situation either. For example, public health physicians informed V.F. Chuba, head of the administration, about the increase in morbidity due to infectious skin diseases and spread of pediculosis. According to current laws, V.F. Chub has the right to send recommendations to places with a request to fix and improve things, which he has done. But nothing more. It is crystal-clear that these noble desires will not be fulfilled; they will vanish in the economic reforms as into a concrete graveyard wall. That's what has already happened with the recommendations to the heads of the rayon and municipal administrations that the extermination of rodents and blood-sucking insects be set up. The former ispolkomy [executive committees] did not make the recommendations but instead mandated that enterprises allocate money for the work each year at all costs. Now that each has obtained economic independence, no resources are found for these ``trifles.'' As a result, tularemia spread by these very rodents and insects has put dozens of people on hospital cots. I have read many inquiries, letters, and recommendations these days and have spoken with many specialists both at the department of public health and at the oblast center of the sanitary-epidemiological oversight. Everyone is doing something. They are all busy. And at the same time they are on guard and ready at a moment's notice to divert the reproach from themselves, citing the work they have done or an article in the law or else explaining the situation in terms of the general economic collapse. And it turns out that there are no guilty parties. But then for whose blame are the children on the hospital cots atoning with their suffering?
