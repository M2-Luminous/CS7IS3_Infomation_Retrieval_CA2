FR941025-0-00013 FR941025-0-00003 Waivers and Miscellaneous Changes The agency is adding a provision expressly setting forth its existing authority to waive any non-statutorily required regulation for good cause. This authority is separate and apart from, and is not meant to limit, the agency's statutorily based authority ( e.g. , under the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992) to waive certain regulations and its inherent authority to decide whether or not to take enforcement actions against violations of its regulations. See Heckler v. Chaney , 470 U.S. 821 (1985). Sections 545.33, 545.35 and 563.93 are being revised to correct internal references. II. Technical Amendment to Service Corporation Rules One of the commenters suggested an additional amendment that OTS believes has merit. As required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 7 the OTS's service corporation regulation, 12 CFR 545.74, requires a Federal savings association to give the OTS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 30 days prior notice before either establishing a new service corporation or engaging in a new activity through an existing service corporation. 8 That same statutory provision exempts Federal savings banks chartered before October 15, 1982. An earlier regulatory amendment inadvertently removed the reference to this exemption. 9 The OTS is taking this opportunity to reinstate the regulatory exemption as it was adopted in April, 1992. 10 7 12 U.S.C. 1828(m). 8 12 CFR 545.74(b)(2). 9 Operating Subsidiaries and Service Corporations Final Rule, 57 FR 48949 (October 29, 1992). 10 Applications Restructuring Final Rule, 57 FR 14340 (April 20, 1992). III. Additional Technical Amendments In addition to the amendments set forth in the proposal, several technical revisions are being made to other OTS regulations. The agency finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt these amendments without public notice and comment because of their purely technical and clarifying nature. First, erroneous cross-references and obsolete titles have been removed from the service corporation regulations. Further erroneous cross-references have been corrected in (1) the hearing rules at section 508.13, (2) section 564.4 of the appraisal rule, and (3) the interest rate risk management procedures at section 563.176. Third, the agency's regulations setting forth procedures to be followed in taking possession of a savings association that has been placed into conservatorship or receivership have been modified. Fourth, the authority citation for part 590 is being corrected. Lastly, a codification correction is being made to the standard conversion regulations, in addition to the proposed amendment to those regulations. IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601), it is certified that this technical regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations, small service corporations or other small entities. It merely revises or removes existing inconsistencies or obsolete regulations. V. Executive Order 12866 The Acting Director has determined that this document is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. VI. Paperwork Reduction Act The recordkeeping requirement contained in this final rule has been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under Control No. 1550&hyph;0083. The recordkeeping requirement contained in this rule is found at 12 CFR 563.170(c). The likely recordkeepers will be well- or adequately-capitalized savings associations who received a CAMEL rating of 1, 2 or 3 in their most recent examinations.
