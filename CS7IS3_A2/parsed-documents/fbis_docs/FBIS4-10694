The recovery of production in the cooperative and small farmer sectors, indispensable for reestablishing the nation's economic equilibrium, is being analyzed in depth at the fifth national ANAP plenum. This meeting, presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and Alfredo Jordan and by ANAP President Orlando Lugo Fonte, is evaluating solutions to the principal difficulties affecting the nonstate sector of Cuba's agriculture. Despite the production potential of the small farmers cooperatives, results last year did not correspond to the amount of land planted and the existing number of animals, and were below expectations. Concerning tubers and vegetables, there was an overall decrease, nationwide, and within these sectors, this (?was more noticeable) in the agricultural-livestock production cooperatives. The fifth pleneum of ANAP's national committee, which is meeting in Guira de Melena Municipality, Havana Province, set forth the main causes of the decrease in agricultural-livestock production. The delegates to the meeting agreed that, in addition to the problems of the weather, shortages and the late delivery of resources, problems of an organizational nature and a failure to make demands also have an effect. The sales on the free market by a number of farmers and the bartering of tubers and other agricultural products for articles of prime necessity are being evaluated in the light of the social disorganization prevailing in Cuba. Several plenum participants came out against this, and the plenum approved strengthening the work of the cooperatives' boards of directors and once again taking up the process of discussing pride and honor on the part of the farmers.
