FR940318-0-00045 FR940318-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Export Administration 15 CFR Parts 773, 778 and 799 [Docket No. 940105&hyph;4005] RIN 0694&hyph;AA69 Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations: Equipment Related to the Production of Chemical Weapons and Warfare Agents, Microorganisms and Toxins; Revision to Australia Group Members AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Export Administration maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which appears in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). This rule amends the CCL by revising Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 1B70 and 1C61. These ECCNs control dual-use items that can be used in the production of chemical and biological weapons (CBW). The changes made by this rule are intended to conform the list of CBW related items controlled by the United States to the lists of items agreed to and adopted by countries participating in the Australia Group (AG). In addition, this rule revises the list of countries participating in the Australia Group (AG) to include Argentina and Hungary, since both countries now participate in the Australia Group. This revision is expected to reduce the number of export license applications that will have to be submitted for items that are being made exempt from the validated license requirements described in the chemical and biological weapons control provisions of the EAR, thereby reducing the paperwork burden on the public. DATES: This rule is effective March 18, 1994. Comments must be received by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sent to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions on foreign policy controls, call Toni Jackson, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4531. For questions of a technical nature on chemical weapon precursors, biological agents, and equipment that can be used to produce chemical and biological weapons agents, call James Seevaratnam, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4777. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background At the June, 1993, meeting of the Australia Group, the delegates made certain technical revisions in the Australia Group's chemical equipment list and agreed to its adoption, subject to approval by their governments. The changes agreed upon at the June, 1993, meeting have been adopted by the member countries and are contained in this interim rule. Many of these changes refine the scope of the technical parameters describing chemical equipment that is controlled for export.
