In the course of this meeting, the esteemed leader offered congratulations to the world Muslims and the proud nation of Iran on the eve of mission of the last of the prophets, Muhammad son of 'Abdallah, may God's peace and salutations be upon him and his scion. His eminence referred to events of 19 Dey 1356 [9 January 1978] as the beginning of a great development, which led to the destruction of the monarchy in Iran, shook America and the reactionary regimes, and established an Islamic government. Ayatollah Khamene'i described each event of the Islamic revolution's 15-year history as a great lesson for the Muslim nation of Iran and said: The independent and liberated Iranian nation is fully aware and is armed with ample valuable experience gained during the war and the life of the Islamic Republic of Iran; thanks to this experience, no power and no government would dare enter the arena of a military conflict against the iron-clenched fist of our nation. The leader of the Islamic revolution drew attention of the Iranian nation to the conspiracy hatched by the enemies of Islam to create discord, to undermine the people's solidarity and unity, and to promote suspicion among the people vis-a-vis the state authorities and the Islamic regime, and added: Today any speech or written words, and any move, which might create doubt among the Iranian nation about its last proud 15 years, the era of his eminence Imam [Khomeyni] -- may God be satisfied with his deeds -- about the performance of the authorities, and about the stances and the course of the revolution, would serve the particular interests of the enemy. Every individual must vigilantly watch for the enemy's conspiracies and enticements. Referring to the pressure exerted on the European governments by America to win their support in the confrontation against Iran, the esteemed leader said: As the ringleader of arrogance, America has pleaded with the European governments to refrain from commercial transactions with Iran and from the sale of commodities, which the Iranian nation needs to rebuild the country, but the big European governments, which enjoy common sense and realize the importance of Iran and its regime, have rejected U.S. demands and ignored its enticement. Referring to the claim that the faith, the sincere sentiments, and the revolutionary fervor of the Iranian nation have subsided, Ayatollah Khamene'i termed the claim as a vague imagination and added: The Iranian nation is a revolutionary nation and will never sever its ties with the revolution. Thanks to divine assistance, this revolution will bring such prosperity to this nation's life and after-life, that it will become an example to other nations. However, the realization of this important matter requires our endeavor, patience, cooperation, solidarity, sympathy, and our ability to recognize the enemy. Ayatollah Khamene'i described the magnification of Iran's internal difficulties as a propaganda ploy employed by the enemy with the objective of creating despondency and despair among the people. In conclusion, stressing the need for confronting the enemy's enticement of doom and gloom, Ayatollah Khamene'i called upon every level of the people to perform their duties properly and sincerely in whatever job they are doing.
