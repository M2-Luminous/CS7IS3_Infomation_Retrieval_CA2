The first removed a number of problems and granted Russia most-favored-nation status in trade with the United States. The second virtually entirely removed all tariffs and duties on trade with Russia -- which is considerably more than most favored nation terms. It has to be admitted that the United States is doing everything to promote rapprochement with Russia. The Clinton administration has taken particularly significant steps in the sphere of attracting private U.S. business to Russia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has allocated special funds to open 17 U.S. business trade centers in Russia. The largest of these are already functioning in Moscow. The rest will be scattered throughout the territory. It should be pointed out that, as one more step, the state has allocated more than $2 billion to guarantee credits and investments by U.S. companies in the Russian economy. Along with the 17 important agreements signed earlier between the United States and Russia, which make it possible to avoid double taxation and create guarantees for state credits, all this ensures a favorable atmosphere for U.S. private business, which has virtually gotten a surety from its government. America is motivated by not just political but also economic interests. In recent years the entire Western world has been experiencing a grave economic slump, and the United States itself has a big deficit in trade with certain countries, including Japan and China. This greatly affects the competitiveness of U.S. companies, which are feverishly seeking additional markets. The huge Russian market is of extraordinary interest to them. It is also a known fact that each additional $1 billion in U.S. exports creates 20,000 new jobs. When approximately 7 percent of Americans are unemployed, this factor is also of by no means minor significance. I would also point out another fact: In endeavoring to push forward onto the Russian market, America takes into account the fact of increased competition in the world economy. Under conditions of the growing influence of the European Union and other international economic organizations in which the United States retains a significant role, Russia, which is on the Eurasian continent, is a very convenient base for strengthening the positions of U.S. private business in this region. Therefore it turns out that from an economic viewpoint America has an interest in ensuring that Russia is a reliable economic partner -- only not a weak one but a reliable and strong one. This is pure economic reality. At the same time America is concerned, above all, for its own economic security. It understands that the solution to internal U.S. problems lies outside its borders -- in the world economy, where such an important partner as Russia has now emerged. At the same time most of the U.S. Administration's efforts are aimed at present at creating the infrastructure to strengthen business ties between the two countries. Private U.S. business is still somewhat cautious about developing them. Even so, U.S. companies are in first place in terms of the number of joint ventures in Russia. U.S. firms are also ahead of their competitors in terms of the number of offices in Russia. These are the "pioneers" of U.S. business, who might develop business at any moment but are refraining at present, waiting to see how events develop in Russia in the future. If we look at Russian reality from this viewpoint, we should acknowledge that things here are far from favorable at present. This is, of course, connected with the fact that the elimination of the foreign trade monopoly has brought out onto the world market a large number of new agents who do not coordinate their actions and who have their own quotas for sales of a particular product. Competition has arisen among Russian contracting parties proper in such important export sectors as oil, gas, mineral fertilizers, and a number of others where Russia could earn currency. On the one hand, the elimination of the foreign trade monopoly is a positive phenomenon, but because of organizational mistakes, we have to a considerable extent obtained a negative result instead of a positive effect. On the whole, the country's currency revenues have proved not as substantial as was intended. A considerable part of the proceeds from trade ended up abroad, and our exporters were not interested in transferring money to the Russian economy. Only now, since the president signed the edict on currency-export controls, has the situation begun to change for the better. I would particularly like to emphasize that we should not have any illusions about trade and economic ties between Russia and the United States. If U.S. companies do not gain at least some advantage, they will not come here. If the U.S. state does not gain at least some economic advantage, it will not invest in the Russian economy. It is pointless to hope that money will be spent just because Russia needs help. The market system can work on the basis of political priorities only thanks to budget funds, which in the United States are under the rigid control of Congress. Account must also be taken of the fact that, whenever the United States allocates funds to support a particular country, it supports, above all, its own companies which will help this country. That is, up to 80 percent of the total sum will be realized through U.S. private business, and just 20 percent of the aid will directly reach projects on our country's territory.
