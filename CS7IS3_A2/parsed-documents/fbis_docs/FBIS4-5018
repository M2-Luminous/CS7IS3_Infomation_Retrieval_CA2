FBIS4-5018 "dreas067__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-067-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX North Korea Missiles Reported Redeployed To Target PRC Missiles Reported Redeployed To Target PRC OW0704051994 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0704051994 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [By correspondent Katsuhiro Kuroda] [Text] Seoul, 6 Apr -- An informed source in Seoul revealed information on 6 April that he obtained from a Chinese military source in Beijing. According to the information, North Korea has recently redeployed some of its ground-to-ground missile units to target China. According to the information, DPRK border guards along the border between North Korea and China have recently fired upon North Koreans trying to flee to China, killing some Chinese, and Beijing has expressed its displeasure over the casualties. The Chinese military source did not given details about which North Korean missile units have been redeployed to target China. According to a missile deployment chart in North Korea that SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained in Seoul, the launch pads for "Nodong"-1 and "Daepodong"-1 missiles are deployed in eastern coastal areas while launch pads for other North Korean missiles are located in Chungkangjin (Chagang Province) near the North Korea-China border, Chulsan in western coastal areas (North Pyongan), and in Changsankon (South Hwanghae). Scud-C missiles, with a range of 500 km, would not be able to hit Beijing if fired from those launch pads, but industrial areas in China's three northern provinces would be within their range. Nodong-1 missiles with a range of more than 1,000 km are able to hit Beijing. The Chinese military source expressed distrust of North Korea, saying, "like Vietnam, North Korea is unpredictable and we do not know for sure what it is going to do." This comment shows that in military affairs, the Chinese military is placing more importance on the lessons it learned from the China-Vietnam war in the 1970's, when its forces suffered a bitter defeat, than on the Korean war in the 1950's which paved the way for the blood-tied relationship between North Korea and China. As a result China, though ostensibly friendly to North Korea, is guarding against the country. However, North Korea is believed to be far more distrustful of China than China is of North Korea. DPRK reporters have said repeatedly and publicly in Panmunjom: "We do not know what attitude China will take toward North Korea in the end. China is not a nation we can trust to the last." North Korea is believed to be preparing for the time when its relations with China worsen in the light of what happened with the former Soviet Union, which played a key role in founding the Kim Il-song regime, but then abandoned Pyongyang when its domestic circumstances changed. Commenting on the information that "North Korea has redeployed missiles to aim them at China," an informed source in Seoul said: "North Korea is deepening its international isolation and feeling a sense of crisis arising from this. North Korea's action represents `its resolve and determination' to maintain its system." The same source also speculated that the recent North Korean action may be aimed primarily at using the military to solidify its system. Leaders from both Japan and South Korea have visited Beijing in the hope of asking Chinese leaders to persuade North Korea to resolve the nuclear issue based on the friendly relations China is believed to maintain with North Korea. The information that "North Korea has redeployed missiles and targeted China" reveals North Korea's distrust of China. Chinese leaders have frequently said, "China has a limited role to play on North Korea." This new information and that remark repeated by Chinese leaders are combining to grab attention.
