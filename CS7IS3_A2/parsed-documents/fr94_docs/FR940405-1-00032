FR940405-1-00032 FR940405-1-00011 Costs of Incarceration Fee vs. Costs of Imprisonment Fine Two commenters pointed out the correlation between this fee assessment and the costs of imprisonment fine imposed by the sentencing judge pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (USSG) section 5E1.2(i). U.S.S.G. 5E1.2(i). One commenter believed that the fee assessment in the proposed rule was the responsibility of the sentencing judge, the other commenter questioned whether proposed rule §505.2(c) vitiates the application of U.S.S.G. §5E1.2(i). A third commenter noted that the Third Circuit has held that the absence of an authorizing statute in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 renders §5E1.2(i) invalid. See United States v. Spiropoulos, 976 F.2d 155 (3d Cir. 1992); But see United States v. Hagmann, 950 F.2d 175, 186&hyph;87 (5th Cir. 1991) (§5E1.2 upheld against 5th Amendment Due Process challenge), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 108 (1992); United States v. Turner, 998 F.2d 534 (7th Cir 1993) (expressly disagreeing with Spiropoulos ); United States v. Doyan, 909 F.2d 412 (10th Cir. 1990) (§5E1.2 upheld against Equal Protection challenge). While the two provisions are analogous in their end result, they are not analogous in origin or intent. The amount assessed under U.S.S.G. §5E1.2(i) is a fine, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, and is meant to be punitive in nature as part of an inmate's overall sentence. In contrast, the cost assessed under the proposed rule is a fee, pursuant to the plain language of a federal statute, and is meant to recoup the administrative costs of confinement and improve institutional programs. Furthermore, inmates will be assessed only one amount for their costs of confinement. They will either be assessed a fine under §5E1.2, or a fee under the proposed rule if the sentencing judge did not assess or waive the fine under §5E1.2. Two commenters disagreed with the fact that under the proposed rule §505.1, revocation of parole or supervised release is treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may be imposed. However, this interpretation is reasonable because in each instance, the offender's conduct results in a distinct incarceration period and an additional expense to the Attorney General for the cost of the confinement. Constitutionality of the Fee and Consequences of Non-Payment One commenter challenged the constitutionality of the proposed rule, citing an Eight Circuit case, Hankins v. Finnel, 964 F.2d 853 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 635 (1992). However, that case, involving a Missouri statute concerning the recoupment of costs-of-confinement, was decided narrowly upon Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and federal law preemption grounds; it did not involve the constitutionality of Missouri's entire cost-of-confinement program, or such programs in general. The rule is a matter of internal department management. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 0 Authority delegations (Government agencies), Government employees, Organization and functions (Government agencies), Whistleblowing. Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in the Attorney General by law, including 5 U.S.C. 301 and 28 U.S.C. 509&hyph;510, part 0 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 0_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 28 CFR part 0 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 515&hyph;519. 2. In subpart Q, a new §0.96c is added to read as follows: §0.96c Costs of incarceration. (a) The Attorney General is authorized to establish and collect a fee to cover the cost of one year of incarceration. These provisions apply to any person who is convicted in a United States District Court and committed to the custody of the Attorney General, and who begins service of sentence on or after May 5, 1994. For the purposes of this subpart, revocation of parole or supervised release shall be treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may be imposed. (b) The fee to cover the costs of incarceration shall be calculated by dividing the number representing the obligation encountered in Bureau of Prisons facilities (excluding activation costs) by the number of inmate-days incurred for the year, and by then multiplying the quotient by 365. The resulting figure represents the average cost to the Bureau for confining an inmate for one year. (c) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons is delegated the authority to collect the fee to cover the cost of incarceration from inmates committed to the custody of the Attorney General and to promulgate all regulations concerning the collection of the fee. (d) The Director shall review and determine the amount of the fee not less than annually in accordance with the formula set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director shall publish each year's fee as a Notice in the Federal Register . Dated: March 24, 1994. Janet Reno, Attorney General.
