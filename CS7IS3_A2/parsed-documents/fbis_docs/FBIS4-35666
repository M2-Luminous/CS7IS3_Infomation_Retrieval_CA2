Denying a claim by the British Foreign Office on the distribution of forged documents by an Iranian diplomat regarding British activities and stance on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said: British policies on events in Bosnian-Herzegovina are so obvious that there is no need to divulge them to international public opinion and the world's Muslims. He added: British Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg's views and the raising of groundless allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran come at a time when known international terrorists -- such as the Hypocrites [Mojahedin Khalq Organization] -- while being active in Britain, make use of that country's facilities and resources for the propagation of terrorism. Concluding, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said: It is a source of great regret that Britain embarked on installing listening devices in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy contrary to international law, and in response to its illegal act resorts to the reiteration of its futile allegations against Iran.
