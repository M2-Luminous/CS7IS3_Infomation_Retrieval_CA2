The communique said the vessel, which was sighted fishing 160 miles off the coast of San Julian Friday morning, was initially identified as the Hin Van Sing, but on closer inspection the Navy noticed that the ship's name was different from the one painted on its lifeboats. Suspecting that the boat was poaching, the corvette ordered it to stop so it could be inspected. The fishing boat ignored the command and took off in a northeasterly direction toward the Falkland Islands, with the corvette in hot pursuit, prompting the gunfire. The fishing boat was reportedly hit in the hull, and was losing fuel as the Argentine Navy continued to trail it. The vessel was expected to be forcibly intercepted and boarded Saturday. An agency for several fishing vessels from Taiwan in Argentina, however, said Saturday that, based on information it received from an Argentina naval base in the southern part of Argentina, it had determined the fishing boat was Korean. The Taiwan Tuna Fishery Association also said that no fishing boat registered with the association is operating off the Argentine coast, nor is any boat named the Hin Van Sing registered with it. Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry in Taipei said ROC [Republic of China] officials stationed near San Julian would investigate the incident. The government will offer necessary legal assistance and medical care for boat crew members, ministry officials said. They also called on Taiwan fishing boats to adhere to international laws when fishing away from Taiwan.
