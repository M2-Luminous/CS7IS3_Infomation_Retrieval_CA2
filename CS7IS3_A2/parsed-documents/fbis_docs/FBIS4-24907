The two presidents agreed to have experts further study the issue and make recommendations. According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Clinton today also gave a phone call to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is visiting Moscow, to discuss the situation in the Korean peninsula. The contacts between the presidents notably occurred after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report to the U.N. Security Council earlier that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has made it impossible for international inspectors to determine whether spent nuclear fuel was diverted to a secret weapons program in 1989. Pyongyang denied such a report the same day, arguing that its operation to discharge the spent fuel from a five megawatt nuclear power reactor is being done in a manner that will maintain the ability to take measurements later. It accused the IAEA of attempting to internationalize and politicalize a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political purpose." According to a statement issued by the U.S. State Department in Washington today, the U.S. has already begun consultations with its allies and the U.N. Security Council on sanctions against DPRK. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the DPRK Embassy in Austria announced in Vienna today that DPRK has proposed to the IAEA that it can carry out a sample test on the disputed nuclear power reactor in Yongbyon. However, Lothar Wedekind, a spokesman for IAEA, said he knew nothing about it when asked if he was informed of the proposal. He added that the IAEA has never got a clear picture of the whole nuclear program of DPRK. But DPRK Ambassador to Austria Kim Kwang-sop insisted that the refueling of the nuclear power reactor is only a technical issue.
