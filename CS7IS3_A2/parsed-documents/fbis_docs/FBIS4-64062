Boris Yeltsin's particular attention to the special services, especially after the well-known October events, is a conspicuous sign. The top state official's visits to the head offices first of the Foreign Intelligence Service and now of the FCS prove that all the persistent talk about upcoming transformations at the special services that are allegedly designed finally to lay to rest the very memory of the KGB is nothing more than idle speculation. Another side to the top level contacts with the FIS and the FCS is that the president is undoubtedly placing increasing emphasis on career specialists and minimizing the prospects for the emergence of "aliens," such as Ye. Savostyanov, who is said to be considering resigning, at these offices. Another possibility is that the presidential staff was swift to react to Gennadiy Zyuganov's eloquence at the 9 May meeting outside the Lubyanka buildings, where he called on KGB officers to make their choice. Those on high are also making their choice, which is why it is hardly a coincidence that speculation has mounted about high-ranking "old-timers" gaining clout in the FCS leadership, particularly General Stepashin, FCS first deputy chief, and Colonel General Safronov, who rose from the KGB ranks to the very top. They claim that none other than Safronov is in charge of the entire service's operational management, whereas Stepashin has to put up with rather ceremonial functions. As a matter of fact, the first FCS chief, N. Glushko, is still in service, however inconspicuous his current presence might be. Well, intelligence is too important a business to be entrusted to amateurs.
