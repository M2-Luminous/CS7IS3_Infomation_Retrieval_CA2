[passage omitted] The UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman, said they were interpreting the term "control" in a broad sense. "Troops do not have to stand beside each gun. But certainly we have a clear indication of where they are (...) whether they've been used (and) moved. Those are the sorts of ways of controlling them," he told journalists on Monday. [passage omitted] An important meeting of Serb and Bosnian army chiefs, called by UNPROFOR, was expected to take place at Sarajevo airport on Tuesday morning.
