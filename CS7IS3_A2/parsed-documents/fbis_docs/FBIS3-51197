Guzman was nominated for this position by Gustavo Tablada, who minutes before resigned as parliamentary president during an extended ovation. Marcia Quezada, third secretary, also resigned amid acknowledgement from the deputies present. A total of 56 deputies attended the afternoon session, while the rest of those who have made a commitment to rejoin the Assembly watched the voting from the hallways. Tablada made a brief speech, limiting himself to saying that he was fulfilling his commitment by occupying his seat in the parliament. Tablada's proposal was supported by the chief of the Sandinist bloc, Sergio Ramirez. The Sandinist parliamentarian affirmed that "a very clear message is being sent that with our support for Luis Humberto Guzman we will work toward a consensus. Ramirez said: "The UDC [Christian Democratic Union] took a brave step by breaking a taboo deeply embedded in this nation's unfortunate political culture." Ramirez added: "Tablada's step is equally brave." Other parliamentarians joined in to support the candidacy of Guzman, who was unanimously elected National Assembly president. Immediately after the election Guzman approached Tablada and greeted him. Armando Zambrana received similar support and was elected third secretary of the Board of Directors. Internal Legislation Reformed Guzman began his first speech as president of the National Assembly by blaming the liberal-conservatives for the 150 years of retardation in our country. "The idea of exacerbating the crisis (through a campaign for a constituent assembly) is absolutely immoral and crazy," the new National Assembly president said forcefully. After the 1990 change in government, "a change in the political regimen can no longer be postponed in accordance with the exigencies of peace, democracy, and development," Guzman said. We need an active and legitimate parliament, the UDC leader said. He called on the rest of the deputies, who were absent yesterday, to return to their parliamentary duties on 25 January, when sessions are scheduled to resume. After the swearing-in ceremony, the deputies voted on reforms of internal legislation as established in a Justice Commission document, the discussion of had been pending from the previous legislative session. Six articles were reformed. The reforms establish that members of the Board of Directors should office for one year, while allowing for the possibility of reelection. The Assembly president's duties are set out in the reformed articles, which also state that the Board of Directors will determine the session's agenda by a majority vote. Ambassadors Call for Normalcy Roberto Urroz, secretary general of the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, who attended the morning swearing-in ceremony, said his party did not take part in the voting because the Board of Directors should have been more representative. But, he said, this will not prevent the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement] and the PSD [Social Democratic Party] from joining the regular sessions later on. "We hope more well-meaning deputies will start passing laws to benefit the people," U.S. Ambassador John Maisto told BARRICADA. The ambassador was forced to withdraw before the sessions ended because of health problems. Maisto said he felt "optimistic" about events in the Assembly and described as "positive" the steps being taken by the parties which have announced their return to the National Assembly. Papal Nuncio Paolo Giglio said he was optimistic about the deputies' participation in the opening session. "I hope the rest follow suit," the Vatican's representative said. Chilean Ambassador Gaston Illanes said the ceremony was one of great importance and noted that hopes are now focused on complete normalization of the country. The complete participation by the diplomatic corps was an important sign of the international community's support for the stabilization process implemented at the National Assembly, several invited guests said. Yesterday the National Assembly hall was not large enough.
