FR940217-1-00142 FR940217-1-00017 Furthermore, the number of uninspected passenger vessels is constantly changing since a boat used as a charterboat one day may be used for the owner's recreational purposes on another day. When operating as a charterboat, the boat comes under the regulations for uninspected commercial vessels in 46 CFR subchapter C. When used strictly for recreational purposes with no paying passengers on board, the boat comes under the regulations in 33 CFR subchapter S. Although there are about 65,000 persons licensed to operate uninspected passenger vessels in the U.S., the Coast Guard believes that less than half of these licensed persons are actively employed as vessel operators. This proposed rule would only apply to those vessels that operate more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 3 statutory miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes. Consistent with a comment received to the NPRM, the Coast Guard believes that approximately 12,000 charterboats would be affected by this proposed rule. EPIRB regulations would only affect those vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) from the coastline of the Great Lakes. Therefore, if half of the uninspected vessels operate in rivers, inland lakes, bays, or sounds, or within 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) of the coastline of the Great Lakes, about 15,000 uninspected passenger vessels would remain as being potentially affected by an EPIRB rule under the authority in 46 U.S.C. 4102(e). This number is fairly consistent with an estimate by the association of charterboat operators in one of its letters, that 12,000 charterboats would be affected by the rules proposed in the NPRM. Coast Guard used the association's 12,000 vessel estimate in assessing the potential effects of the rules proposed in this notice. The draft evaluation uses a cost estimate of $1350 for Category 1 406 MHz Satellite EPIRBs, and $1150 for Category 2 406 MHz Satellite EPIRBS. A set of visual distress signals would cost most vessels about $20. The draft Evaluation estimates that about 1200 charterboats would not qualify for the EPIRB carriage exemption, and would have to purchase a 406 MGz Satellite EPIRB. It also estimates that another 1200 vessels would have to purchase VHF&hyph;FM marine radios at $400 each in order to qualify for the EPIRB exemption within Sea Area A1. In addition, an estimated 8500 uninspected vessels would be required to carry visual distress signals for the first time. The estimated present value cost of the proposed regulations to the industry, is about $3 million over 10 years. The number of lives that may be saved through mandatory EPIRB and visual distress signal requirements cannot be accurately predicted. However, economic research indicates that $2.5 million per statistical life saved is a reasonable estimate of people's willingness to pay for safety. The saving of only two lives in ten years would justify the cost of these rules. In addition to the saving of lives, primary benefits of the regulations include more timely notification to the authorities that a casualty has occurred and more accurate identification of the object of the search and the search area, which should contribute to large savings of money for the Coast Guard and other organizations involved in a search. This rule, in effect, shifts some of the cost burden for search and rescue from the Coast Guard to owners and operators of uninspected vessels. Many unsuccessful searches for overdue vessels have cost millions of dollars before being abandoned. In contrast, a number of searches for pleasure, charter, and fishing vessels have been expedited by EPIRBs carried voluntarily. The savings to the government as a result of elimination or significant reduction of only three or four large-scale searches would justify the cost of these rules, even without considering the lives that may be saved by more timely location of vessels in distress. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
