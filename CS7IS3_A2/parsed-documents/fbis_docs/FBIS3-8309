Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Bosnian Muslim counterpart Irfan Ljubijankic informed the chief diplomats of Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) that the Croat-Muslim agreement was "open to the Serbs, too." Representatives of the Bosnian Croats, Muslims and the Republic of Croatia signed in Washington on Tuesday, under strong pressure from the U.S. Administration, a preliminary agreement on a federation of the two peoples in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent confederation with neighbouring Croatia. The U.S. peace negotiator for the former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg, who attended the session of the Central European Initiative, set out that there was no reason to believe that the Serbs were not ready for a peaceful solution, and underscored that no lasting solution was possible without the Serb side.
