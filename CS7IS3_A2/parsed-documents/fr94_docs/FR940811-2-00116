Participants will review and discuss the various regulatory and technical aspects of the issue. Specific presentations will cover, for example, the original intent of 10 CFR 60 and 960, the technical basis for the 1,000-year containment criterion, computational and conceptual problems posed by highly heterogeneous materials, and the Department of Energy's (DOE) proposed program approach to ground-water travel time. Round-table discussions involving Board members, presenters, and other participants and a period for questions and comments from the audience will end each day's activities. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created in the 1987 amendments act to evaluate the technical and scientific activities in the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site characterization, storage, and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the DOE for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning October 25, 1994.
