But that is what seems to have taken place. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov was able to bring representatives of the warring sides to the negotiating table in Moscow, and they found a common language. Now, the appropriate agreement is expected to be signed on Monday [4 April], in the presence of Russian and UN officials. Andrey Kozyrev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a special interview for our program, explains what exactly has been achieved over the past few days. [video shows Andrey Kozyrev speaking to unseen interviewer] [Begin Kozyrev recording] Agreement has been reached on, firstly, a cease-fire and no resumption of shooting, which is extraordinarily important and of course a condition for talks to switch from the language of the gun to that of political settlement. Secondly, there is agreement on a complete return by refugees. Thank God, a formula has been found that conforms to international standards. I do not want this to be famous last words, but the formula corresponds to the UN's approach. The essence of this approach is that everyone can return, with the exception of a very small group of people who could possibly be accused of direct participation in and guilt for military crimes, and so forth. I think that this will be the first step in further progress toward an Abkhazia settlement. The second step could be establishment of economic links and solutions to a whole range of other issues, such as confidence- building, and so forth. And of course, of course, at some stage the question of status and all these legal issues is bound to arise. If you look at the agreement you will see that Russia is involved not only diplomatically. We will retain our presence and participation. A whole range of UN organizations will be actively involved in resolving these issues, but I want to stress once again that, of course, people can only be convinced by their own consciences and their responsibility before their nations.
