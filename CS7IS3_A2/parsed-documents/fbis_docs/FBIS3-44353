The bank will replenish its reserves of foreign currencies to cope with the possibility of rising demands for foreign currencies in the future, said Wang Xuebing, the newly appointed president of the bank which issues FECs. The withdrawal of FECs from the economy is a task with wide- ranging impact, Wang said on Wednesday. The People's Bank of China has announced that the country will no longer issue FECs. Existing FECs can be used temporarily and will be gradually withdrawn by the banks. The discontinuance of FECs was one of the measures China was expected to launch next year to extend reform of the country's foreign exchange control system. Wang Qiren, the bank's chairman of the board, said the central government has placed great expectations on the Bank of China and expects the bank to aid the establishment of the new exchange system in the socialist market economy. The bank specializes in foreign exchange and foreign trade business, and will continue to be a State-designated foreign exchange bank under the new system. The bank's president said all banks should treat foreign exchange reform as a top priority next year. "We should have a high sense of social responsibility to the task," Wang said. "These duties must be performed well." The bank's head office has established a special group to strengthen the bank's work on the foreign exchange control system. Some of the bank's departments have also organized special divisions to do preparatory work. The president said the bank's head office will make efforts to map out detailed management regulations and send them to local branches in the near future. To ensure the Bank of China's smooth operation under the new system, its head office summoned local bank officials responsible for accounting, settlement and foreign exchange savings to Beijing for a two-day training course. The classes began today. These officials will immediately return to their branches to teach local staffs. In another development, it was announced the China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre will open in Shanghai during the first half of 1994. It will be the largest and most advanced marketplace for trading foreign currency in the country. The outfitting of the foreign exchange trading centre is now in full swing. The centre's computerized trading system will be connected to six major cities throughout the country on January 1. According to local banking sources, the government-sponsored trading centre will mainly provide services to banks in the trading and settlement of hard currencies.
