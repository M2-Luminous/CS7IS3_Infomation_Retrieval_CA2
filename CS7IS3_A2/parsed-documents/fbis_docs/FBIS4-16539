They were formulated at the talks between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which have just ended here. These agreements will lay a foundation for the forthcoming multilateral meeting in Pale between the Bosnian Serb leadership, the UN representatives, and the Russian president's Special Envoy Vitaliy Churkin. The Russian foreign minister announced that the meeting would take place today [17 April]. The meeting is to define clearly the boundaries of a security zone in Gorazde, to solve the questions of demilitarization of this zone and of the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb troops, to draw up conditions for observing a cease-fire between the Serb and the Muslim sides on all lines of contact in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those attending the meeting will also have to agree on ways to ensure freedom of movement for all servicemen from the UN forces, who are now blockaded for various reasons by local Serbian authorities.
