Asked in a survey that could lead to the creation of a company within two years, this question again seems reasonable given the launch of the market in multichip modules (MCM's) which consist of several very complex bare chips assembled onto the same substrate (for use in military, aeronautical, computing, and telecommunication applications). Chips on Tape More Reliable Chips mounted on tape can be tested before they are assembled in the module and thus, even in short production runs, present a considerable financial advantage over bare chips connected by wires or beads (flip-chips) whose faults can only be detected after assembly. According to certain experts, tests on modules containing the most complex chips can result in a reject rate of up to 30 percent. For complex MCM's, assembling the chips onto tape also has the advantage of reducing the limitations placed on the connection pitch by the wire method (currently used for most applications) and without seriously affecting the chip design. Karel Kurzweil, in charge of microassembly technologies at Bull, explains: "The dimples for the connection of the chips on the tape are in the same locations as the pins for wire soldering, whereas bead connection over the whole area of the chip means that designers have to redefine the entire mounting process." Until now, and despite these advantages, the manufacturers of sophisticated electronic systems have snubbed TAB technology. Tape-mounted chips require expertise in a large number of manufacturing processes (tape preparation, putting the dimples on the wafers, mounting the chips on the tape, and assembling the TAB chips on the substrate) and thus require large scale manufacture to amortize all the machinery needed. The difference between the requirements of potential users and the requirements of TAB technology therefore dissuaded many outfitters. It is probable, on the other hand, that the creation of a more flexible structure, such as that envisaged by the general arms directorate [DGA], which would handle the assembly of chips on tape at a reasonable cost even for small and medium production runs, would interest MCM manufacturers. The participants in the DGA's project know that the cost of the service proposed will be the decisive factor. Mr. Kurzweil, the Bull representative in the DGA project, said: "In the TAB process, the large number of tools needed to produce the tape is one of the drawbacks of the technology for short production runs. You should reckon on between 30,000 to 80,000 French francs-worth [Fr] of equipment for each production series." However, he assured us: "We are currently trying to reduce these costs." Will Euro-TAB Packaging Become a Reality? Dassault Electronique and Bull have been commissioned by the DGA's electronics and computing technical department [STEI] to study the contribution that could be made by TAB technology to military electronic systems. The two microelectronics specialists, assisted by other partners in the fields of silicon and tape, will have to produce prototypes to prove the economic viability of this type of component. At the same time, the STEI has surveyed potential users (military and civil) to determine what their future requirements in terms of TAB components will be. The results of the survey will be published in the second quarter of this year. According to Roland Even, manager of the STEI project, between Fr5 million and Fr10 million will be invested in these studies. If the results of these evaluations and the survey are favorable, an industrial structure, christened Euro TAB packaging could be created within two years. It will specialize in the supply of tape bonded chips to civil and military outfitters for small and medium-term production runs. The structure will in particular take charge of tape design and control, the production of the dimpling on the silicon wafers, the assembly of the chips on the tape, and their testing and burn-in. Systems manufacturers will then be responsible for assembling the chips onto the substrate. Roland Even was reluctant to disclose precise details of how this potential company will be structured financially, but he said that it will accept production runs ranging from just a few chips to several thousand, and will initially employ several dozen people.
