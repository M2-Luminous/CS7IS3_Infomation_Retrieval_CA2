Officials of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations said that so far assemblies of 22 prefectures and 274 cities, towns and villages have passed resolutions or issued statements to that effect since September. They said that more assemblies are intending to move likewise to urge the government to put an end to poaching in territorial waters by fishermen from such countries as South Korea and China. The officials said Japanese fishing communities are suffering greatly from losses of revenue due to the government's lax enforcement. Japan declared a 200-nautical-mile exclusion zone in 1977, but does not apply it in the case of South Korea and China, with which it has territorial disputes. South Korean and Chinese fishermen have taken advantage of this, trawling for crabs, squid and flatfish as close as 12 nautical miles off the coast, they said. They ignore regulations that Japanese fishermen must abide by and use methods that damage maritime resources, officials said.
