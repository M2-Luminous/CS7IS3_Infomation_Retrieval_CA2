The deputy is You Yuzhuo. Clad in a green side-buttoned coat with black cloud-pattern neckband, he attends meetings by day, and reads documents, writes suggestions or prepares speeches by night. You is the only representative of Hezhen nationality, one of the smallest ethnic groups in China. All the 55 minority nationalities in China have their own deputies to the NPC, who add up to 439 among a total of 2,980. The Hui people, who scatter throughout the country and rank second only to Zhuang in terms of population, have 66 deputies, taking the first place; and 29 ethnic groups with small populations each have one deputy. At a recent discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work report, you was the first to speak. He said, "the government work report says reform and opening up is a driving force for development. Changes of the Hezhen nationality in recent years have borne this out." Hezhen has always been the smallest ethnic group in China. Mainly inhabiting banks of the Heilongjiang, Songhua and Usuri rivers in northeast China, Hezhen people used to live on fishing, dwelled in cellars and were clad in fish skin. When New China was founded in 1949, Hezhen stood at the brink of extinction with a population of only 300. Though Hezhen people still engage in fisheries, modern fishing gears and motor boats have replaced fish forks. In addition, some Hezhens engage in farming and industries. Its population has jumped to over 4,000. "The biggest change is a wider horizon for the Hezhen people, brought about by reform and the open policy," You noted. "Hezhens did not know what market was in the past. Today, they have opened shops and hotels and even set up a Hezhen-cuisine restaurant in Russia," he added. You was the first teacher of Hezhen nationality and now serves as the principal of a rural primary school. His talks show that he is not only familiar with his people and home town, but also has a good understanding of state affairs. Asked how he gets all the information he needs as a deputy, he said he subscribes to a dozen newspapers and magazines and keeps watching TV news programs of both central and local TV stations. Moreover, the general office of the NPC Standing Committee and relevant departments of Heilongjiang Province and Tongjiang City mail him documents, draft laws and decrees and decisions of standing committees of people's congresses at various levels. Since he was elected deputy to NPC last year, You have participated in three inspection tours. He is known for his "bold airing of views." When the local township government withheld teachers' wages for four months last year, You reported the case to the city government, which solved the problem soon. Just before coming to Beijing to attend the current NPC session, you solicited opinions in local villages, townships and Tongjiang City. He plans to put forward suggestions on constructing local railways and improving educational conditions for Hezhen people. As a teacher, You regards education as the hope for his people. His wife, three daughters, and two sons-in-law are also teachers.
