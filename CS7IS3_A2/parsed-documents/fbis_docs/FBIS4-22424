A party with significant strength that demands the return of the Baltic area to the "empire" is not really desired in the Baltic countries. In Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania people know all too well that among leading circles in Russia there are those for whom it is difficult to approve of the independence of the three republics. After all, they were a part of Russia since the Great Northern War at the beginning of the 1700's with the exception of a short period of independence between the World Wars. Indignation and concern were aroused last summer by the staff exercise carried out by the Russian Northwest Group of Forces, the former Baltic Military District, having the theme of a renewed occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This provocative exercise is a subplot like the repeatedly alleged submarine violations of Swedish territorial waters, in the new Swedish book by Harry Winter, Operation Narva, which portrays an attempt to seize the Baltic countries back for Russia. The secret project is organized behind the back of the political leadership by the KGB of the former Soviet Union, now the Security Ministry (which Yeltsin ordered reorganized last Christmas) and its foreign intelligence wing, which is subordinated directly to the president (and whose head, Yevgeniy Primakov, warned in November that any decision by NATO to accept the countries of East Europe as members would lead to countermeasures by Moscow) and the military intelligence organization GRU. In the book the provocation bringing Russian armed forces back into the Baltic countries is planned through having KGB agents disguised as local ultrapatriotic groups undertake terrorism against the Russian minority living in those countries, which would give the Russian armed forces a reason to go to the aid of their countrymen. The Swedes are tied in through the fact that the KGB organized a wave of robberies of the weapons depots of the Swedish defense forces and the evidence was supposed to point to the oppressors of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia. The weapon thefts were successful, but the conspiracy in the Baltic countries failed, and the former KGB and GRU plotters were imprisoned. A Prophecy? Has Winter written a prophecy, the basis for which is found not only in Zhirinovskiy's election victory but also in the new Russian military doctrine that was approved at the beginning of last November? In it the infringement of the legitimate interests of citizens of the Russian Federation in other countries is regarded as a military danger. At the same time it considers it possible to maintain troops outside its borders if the interests of the Russian Federation so demand. Harry Winter's tale is not necessarily credible, but it is interesting in combining a lot of facts with the fiction. The pseudonym Harry Winter, under which the book was written, is well known in Sweden. The three-part novel Operation Garbo telling about an attack on Sweden contemplated by the Soviet Union was published in the years 1988-91. The book became a best-seller because the person behind the pseudonym was known to be very knowledgeable about what was said in the book. Harry Winter was said to be a joint pseudonym for retired Colonel Bo Hugemark, the journalist Lars Richardson (now an aide to Prime Minister Carl Bildt), and a researcher who is now working in the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Ingemar Doerfer. Operation Narva, however, is primarily Hugemark's handiwork. The popularity of Operation Garbo was increased by the fact that the books are to a certain extent romans a clef. Several of their characters were modeled more or less in the image of actual persons operating in Swedish domestic politics.
