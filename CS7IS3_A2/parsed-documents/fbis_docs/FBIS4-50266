The Russian Government said in a statement that it was satisfied with the steps taken by Georgia and Abkhazia to ensure peace in the region. The statement also said peacekeeping troops from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will be deployed in the security zone to be established under the agreement. The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to return home. The Russian Government expressed the hope that both sides would fulfil their own obligations and that it was willing to promote, together with the United Nations, a comprehensive solution to the conflict in the region. Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old military conflict between government forces and Abkhazian separatists, who last year drove the Georgian troops out of the region on the Black Sea coast.
