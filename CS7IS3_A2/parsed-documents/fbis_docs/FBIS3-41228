One courier was Colombian national Sandra Liliana Angel Gutierrez, the current companion of the drug trafficker just arrested in Mexico. Others were her compatriots Areli Cacho, Nora Martinez Pelaez, Alejandro and Luis Alberto Gutierrez Flores, Marisol N., Marco N., and Andrea N. These persons frequently visited Ecuador and brought in dollars attached to their bodies. On other occasions the money was carried in suitcases. To pass through customs without being checked, police officers Hugo Jativa and Wilson Salgado, as well as customs appraiser Victor Hugo Valdiviezo, worked with the gang. Another method for bringing in drug money was the use of express delivery services like DHL, EMS, and World Courier. The police report also says that another method they used was bank transfers, whose final destination was Bogota. From there, the foreign currency was sent to Ipiales, where exchange trader Gerardo Villota (currently a fugitive and closely connected with the criminal organization), exchanged these funds for Colombian pesos and deposited them in one of the many bank accounts opened by Modesto Polo Perez, who was arrested here on 28 December. Those pesos were withdrawn in amounts that did not violate the legal limits set by Colombia, and were then converted into sucres and brought to Quito to be used to buy checks in dollars and to purchase assets and real estate, vehicles, and commercial property. As the police have already reported, it is estimated that over $2.5 million entered Ecuador, particularly during the last two of the seven years during which the Montenegro Freire family has lived in this city. This amount does not include the money deposited in numerous bank accounts. These accounts have been frozen and are now being investigated to determine the financial movements of the Azteca criminal organization.
