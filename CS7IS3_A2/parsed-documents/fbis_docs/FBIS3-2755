Faced with many difficulties in reform in the new year, the party finds itself with many different opinions which it has to address urgently, so it has made necessary preparations for a grand meeting in March, and therefore news about convening the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have come from the party. CPC Central Committee Plans to Convene Fourth Plenary Session in Early March On 3 February, the CPC Central Committee General Office telephoned various ministries, commissions, and offices under the central authorities, the party committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and various arms of service and the party committees of major military regions, telling them that the CPC Central Committee planned to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, that various party committees should usher in the plenary session with actual work results, and that they would be kept informed of the exact date of the session. Ding Guangen, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, disclosed during a meeting with party and government leaders from Guangdong on 5 February that the Central Committee planned to convene the Fourth Plenary Session on 5 March or so, and that the session would last for three or four days. A newsletter from the CPC Central Committee, dated 5 February, disclosed that Jiang Zemin said when meeting non-party celebrities that the CPC Central Committee planned to convene the Fourth Plenary Session to strengthen understanding, unify thinking, and standardize action regarding some important issues at this time. He earnestly hoped non-party persons could offer ideas, proposals, and criticisms concerning the current work by the Central Committee, for non-party persons have a unique understanding of many conditions. Hu Jintao: Usher in the Fourth Plenary Session With Consensus The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee also disclosed that the theme at the Fourth Plenary Session is to further foster consensus and standardize action on maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; to unify thinking on how to expedite the building of the socialist market economy, and on how to establish an integral and open market system which is characterized by orderly competition; and to summarize work in strengthening construction of leading party groups of various levels and the work in self-construction of party members, in particular, the issue of the recent anticorruption drive within the party will be addressed and new arrangements will be made. In addition, the session will also have to examine the topics to be discussed and adopted by the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress. Hu Jintao said at a work meeting of the Secretariat in early February: The party's essential work must be to get rid of interference from controversies on nonessential topics within the party; and it is necessary to usher in the Fourth Plenary Session with unified understanding, unified thinking, and standardized action. People are waiting to see if the Fourth Plenary Session can solve the contradictions and difficulties faced by the party.
