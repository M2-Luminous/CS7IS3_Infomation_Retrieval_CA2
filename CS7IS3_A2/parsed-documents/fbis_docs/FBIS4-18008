According to Lukyanenko, the current alignment of forces in Ukraine provides no grounds for illusions. The nine years of national democrats' activities did not change much -- the people are scared by the nomenklatura. Some time ago, there was hope that the democrats would unite during the presidential elections and nominate one candidate, namely [former Defense Minister] Kostyantyn Morozov. However this time Levko Lukyanenko voiced his reservations against General Morozov. He believes that the nomenklatura throughout Ukraine will rise as one man against this candidate, as it happened in the Artemivskyy constituency No.1 during the spring legislative elections. Incidentally, Kostyantyn Morozov himself does not believe that he had irrevocably lost the legislative elections. Both he and his team demand that the results of the elections in that constituency be declared invalid. They have handed over to the Central Electoral Committee an appropriate motion and a number of documents testifying to numerous violations of the electoral law. However, the general is waging the war for the restoration of justice without any party's assistance. He tends to underline this because, according to him, it is still unclear what political forces fought against him in the electoral district. General Morozov pointed out that he would treat the proposal to take part in presidential elections only provided that it is backed by all democratic forces. This would be an important step toward consolidation of democrats, while the election itself would either bring about a victory or the forming of a powerful opposition. Thus far, democrats have only demonstrated unity in ignoring presidential elections. According to Levko Lukyanenko, the democrats will launch a campaign against Leonid Kuchma, Oleksandr Morozov, and Petro Symonenko, rather than back any one candidate. Worldwide Coordinating Council Chairman Ivan Drach does not rule out that we will have to choose between Moroz and Kuchma. It should be pointed out that Drach did not take part in either legislative or any other elections this time, and is not going to do this. He explains that he has enough possibilities to be heard, while preference should be given to young politicians. This is just: New times demand new people. Meanwhile, higher echelons demonstrate a wish to preserve the status quo. Perhaps this is why Oles Shevchenko, Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] deputy chairman, asked the reporters to be patient, refrain from discussing the presidential election and wait until 25 April. Other symptomatic news: We were not invited to attend the URP congress scheduled to start on 23 April. Rumors have it that the congress will be held behind closed doors and not all the members of the URP leadership know where. This is hard to believe. It will be even harder to believe in what will be said at the news conference on the results of the congress.
