The agreements reached in Washington have already yielded the first effects -- first of all, on the fields in central Bosnia, Herzegovina, and other regions mostly populated by Bosniaks and Croats. One of the results of the Washington agreement is this Assembly session, which is competent to verify the agreements and consistently implement them. Many and partly contradictory assessments have already been made about the agreement by domestic and world politicians, journalists, and other observers. These assessments range from the extremely positive and optimistic, which see the agreements as an historic turning point in the solving of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, to the negative and pessimistic, which see the agreement as just one more paper that will not bring any essential change to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think that at this moment one should not waste much time or effort on seeking and assessing attributes by which the agreements will be qualified. Put simply, with this agreement, a very important step has been made toward a permanent and just solution to the situation in which our country finds itself. A realistic concept has been defined and certain prerequisites for implementing it have been ensured. However, it will be possible to assess objectively the significance and value of the work done in Washington only when the full effects of the agreement are seen. It is not the time for euphoria or pessimism, but for extremely serious, responsible, and intensive work on implementing the agreement and seeking the solutions for those questions that the agreements have left open. There are many valid reasons for reaching the agreements and I will present only several of the most important ones. First, these agreements represent a basis for the speedy establishment of peace and the normalization of the situation, above all in those regions populated mostly by the Bosniak and Croatian people and open the door to the so-called Serbian side; they therefore present the possibility of a permanent and just political solution for the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, these agreements represent a defeat for the strategy of the Serbian aggressor, who in fact reckoned on the rift between the Bosniaks and the Croats and who profited most from the incitement of the conflict. By overcoming the conflict, reaching the agreements and implementing them, one creates an extremely important strategic balance, which significantly reduces the room for maneuver of the extremist and aggressive Serbian nationalism, thereby rendering the project of a Greater Serbia historically without prospects. Third, [words indistinct] a significant step toward annulling the consequences of ethnic cleansing, because by adopting them one creates the political and legal prerequisites for the return of the refugees and displaced people to their homes, and by implementing them one ensures the realistic conditions for this. Fourth, in realizing these agreements one relatively quickly opens the road for forming links with the Western world, above all through the status of associate member of the European Union, if we manage this, and with NATO within the Partnership for Peace. One does not need much political wisdom or knowledge to appreciate the importance of this prospect, so the chance should not be missed. Fifth, the war devastation has had catastrophic consequences and the removal or recovery of these requires huge resources. Without the help of the developed world, the process of renewal, reconstruction, and development is almost unimaginable. The concluded agreements and their implementation will render much more realistic our chances to receive the justly expected help. Finally, these agreements have been fully endorsed by the United States, the European Union, and many countries and international organizations. This support is not only of a theoretical and verbal nature, but expresses a readiness to guarantee the agreements and to support their implementation with concrete measures and instruments, including the appropriate arrangements with the peacekeeping forces. We therefore have the right to expect from the international community, and above all the United States, to do what is necessary to implement the project made with their support and help. Therefore, these are some of the more important reasons and goals that we had in mind when we concluded the Washington Agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, allow me briefly to say something about some sections that go to make up the package of agreements, that is, the constitutional project of the federation, the preliminary agreement on the principles of the future confederation, the arrangement concerning the right of the Republic of Croatia to cross the Neum commune and the same right of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina concerning the lease of the port of Ploce, as well as the military agreement concluded in Split, which is an integral part of the package. Regarding the constitutional project for establishing the federation, this project obviously represents the most acceptable answer to the question: How should the state be organized according to the needs of the citizens and people who live in this region? Relations within the federation are founded on the full equality of the Bosniak and Croatian peoples and the equality of all citizens. The organization of the federal and cantonal authorities consistently expresses these principles. The duties of the federation are adequately defined and provide the absolutely necessary level of political and economic integration for the existence and functioning of the federal state. At the same time, a high degree of decentralization and the transfer of numerous powers of the state to the federal units and cantons, and the appropriate solutions on determining territories of the federal units have instantly eliminated all reasons for conflicts and clashes, save pretensions for conquest and separating parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The cantons as federal units are not defined exclusively according to the ethnic principle, because this is simply impossible in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course there will be cantons in which the Bosniaks or the Croats will make up 80 percent and cantons where this ratio will be almost 50-50 percent. In either case, both the Bosniaks and the Croats are constituent nations, which means that a Croat or a Bosniak cannot be in a minority in any part of the federation, regardless of the number of members of that nation in a particular region. Therefore, the cantons are not to be considered exclusively national territories of either nation. Every federal unit is joint, as is the federation. Regarding the constitutional project of the federation, there was full unanimity and I think that the act of adopting and promulgating the constitution will be [word indistinct]. Regarding the adoption of the constitution and the realization of provisional solutions, I will make some proposals later. Regarding the preliminary agreement on the principles of the future confederation, I think that these principles have been defined in such a way that they completely guarantee the respect of all the state attributes of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the Republic of Croatia. The federation will not lose any of its characteristics regarding its sovereignty with the conclusion of the confederal agreement. On the other hand, both the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, within the confederal relationship, are creating wide and firm prerequisites for the achievement of capital, economic, defense, and other interests. Neither side is going into this confederal relationship blind. On the contrary, it has been envisaged that specific relations in every sphere be defined by separate agreements. The confederation is simply an expression of the real interests of the people and citizens, two states, and only as such can it be created and survive. In this context is also the arrangement concerning the regime of crossing parts of the [Neum) commune, which is identical to the right of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the regime of crossing the territory of the Republic of Croatia to the port of Ploce. This arrangement is of mutual interest and represents an expression of mutual understanding and confidence building. The principle of reciprocity has in this case been fully respected, too. Finally, regarding the military agreement, one should state that it is already being implemented according to a set pace, and that the results so far achieved are within expectations. Contacts are being held at the highest military level at which answers are successfully being found to the majority of outstanding issues. (?Of course), the final success of the full implementation of the military agreement depends to a great extent on steps to be taken in the sphere of politics. We must bear this in mind all the time when we hold political talks and make political decisions. Therefore, in general, the agreements concluded represent a sound basis and an important step toward final, lasting, and just solutions. Although certain positive effects are already being felt, one must nevertheless bear in mind that their implementation is yet to come. This is a very (?responsible) and very complex and delicate job. [words indistinct] psychological, emotional barriers, calming of passions, and (?extremism) of all kinds. This is not a call to forget or forgive. Crimes, regardless of who has committed them, cannot and must not be forgotten, nor can the perpetrators remain unpunished. Our future is not and cannot be made of only memories of crimes and injustice. Hating crime and criminals is understandable, but hating entire nations is a crime in itself. The peoples on this territory have always been able to and wanted to live together; this is our future. I am not implying just the Bosniaks and Croats alone, but the Serbs as well. On this basis, there is an open invitation for the Serbs to join the agreement and live in the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina like other peoples under the same conditions and with the same rights. In any case, we will know how to respect those members of the Serbian nation who did not side with the perpetrators of crimes, especially those who actively contributed to the struggle against the aggression, the struggle for joint freedom and a joint state. They will most certainly not be second-class citizens, nor will members of all the other peoples. (?In) the democratic society that we want to build, there is no place for second-class citizens. Esteemed deputies, although agreement has already been reached on the essential issues, we are still facing numerous decisions that will be neither simple nor easy to make. Not because some people here want disagreements, but simply because the answers that need to be found are not simple and easy. I think that the very act of adopting and promulgating the constitution of a federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the most important, represents the easiest part of the work, considering the consent that has already been achieved. However, our aim is not only to adopt the constitution, but also to implement it quickly, consistently, and fully. To achieve this we urgently need to find and synchronize a certain number of legal, organizational, and staff solutions that must promptly follow the adoption of the constitution. The transitional solutions include tight but (?manageable) deadlines if an agreement on some essential issues is reached in advance. Therefore, I consider important the proposal that within the discussion on the constitutional project we bring into line the views and opinions on those issues that need to be decided upon the adoption of the constitution. This is not some kind of political condition, but simply a practical approach to the realization of the established concept. The transitional provisions envisage that the Assembly elect a transitional president and vice president of the federation and appoint a government immediately after the adoption of the constitution. The setting up of cantonal bodies is envisaged to take place within 30 days. The countdown to these deadlines will start with the adoption of the constitution and it would not be good if we found ourselves in a situation where these deadlines had not been met. Therefore, I consider it important that the Assembly hold a continuous session so that solutions on which the realization of the constitution depend in this transitional period are found and synchronized, and that we then adopt the constitution. Of course, a different order of moves is possible. This will finally be decided by the Assembly. Whatever the decision, we rightly believe that the all the participants in the work of the Assembly will be profoundly aware of our responsibility before our peoples, our citizens, the international community, God and the people, as it is commonly said. Therefore, I appeal to you on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to (?support) and endorse the agreements that have been reached, and to invest all your energy in implementing them consistently and efficiently. Thank you. [applause]
