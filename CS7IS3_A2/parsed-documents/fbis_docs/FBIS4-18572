Atun noted that, as stressed by the UN secretary general in his report, the negotiations should be continued with patience for the problems to be solved. He added that the Greek Cypriots should respond in kind to the goodwill shown by the Turkish Cypriots, regarding the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Assessing the report submitted by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council, Atun said that certain points in the report displayed a realistic approach while others manifested an unacceptable one. He described as a realistic approach the inclusion of the Turkish Cypriot concerns and the pronouncement that the negotiations will continue despite Greek Cypriot announcements to the contrary. Atun added, however, that accepting the "nondocument" of 21 March as a basis despite all the Turkish Cypriot warnings and objections is unacceptable. He stated that the United Nations should renounce this erroneous stand which encourages the rigid and intransigent attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, which actually never accepted the CBM's, and which enables it to run away from the negotiating table. Pointing out that the United Nations should quit insisting that the "nondocument", which tears the CBM's apart, be the basis of an agreement, Atun further asked the United Nations to take into consideration the hostile activities of the Greek Cypriot administration, which exacerbate the lack of trust between the two communities, its armament efforts, provocations, and negative statements regarding the CBM's. He said that excluding from the report negative stands that contradict the spirit of the CBM's was a deficiency. Atun further stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side is insistent on continuing the talks and remaining at the negotiating table despite all these facts.
