The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying in his New Year address: "Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are the imperishable, glorious traditions of our revolution and our banner of victory." It goes on: Single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the most durable and mighty one centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The single-hearted unity is, first of all, the source of the powerful strength which makes it possible to dynamically advance the cause of socialism holding the illustrious leader in high esteem with loyalty. In our country today all the people are holding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in high esteem with faith and sense of obligation and vigorously advancing with the conviction of victory and optimism that we will win certainly because he is leading us. The whole party, all the people and the entire Army move as one under the unitary leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the revolutionary work system of unconditionally implementing the idea and lines of the leader has been established in the whole party and the whole of society. Thanks to the unbreakable unity of the leader and the people in one mind the socialism of our own style has inexhaustible might to make a victorious advance, breaking through rigorous ordeals and trials. Single-hearted unity of our ranks around the illustrious leader is also a powerful weapon in braving all the challenges and obstructive moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries and firmly defending the cause of socialism of our own style and a mighty motive force for the development and prosperity of the country. When a grave situation was created in the way of our revolution last year, our people and the officers and men of the People's Army decisively shattered the challenge and aggression moves of the enemy and effected a great upswing in socialist construction, united firmly behind the illustrious leader, holding a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle in the other hand, thus fully demonstrating the dignity of the country and the heroic stamina of our people. The might of the single-hearted unity of our ranks around the illustrious leader firmly convinces our people that they can defend and accomplish the cause of socialism of our own style, not wavering in any storm. In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan great difficulties and obstacles were laid in economic construction owing to the unexpected international events and the acute situation created in our country. But our people, upholding the slogan that when the party is determined, we can do anything, pushed on with the socialist construction and increased the economic independence of the country and its might in every way. This proud victory was a great demonstration of our single-hearted unity. Our party put forward the militant tasks to secure a new base for reaching higher levels of socialism by carrying through the revolutionary economic strategy of the party in the period of three-year adjustment. The victorious advance and accomplishment of the cause of socialism of our own style depend on how to defend single-hearted unity, the banner of great victory in our revolution. Our people are not a people who will abandon the banner of faith, the banner of single-hearted unity they have already upheld, no matter what others may say, and not a people who will take another road, yielding to any pressure or threat.
