Then they hastily called a news conference at their headquarters in Via del Plebiscito. There were the AD [Democratic Alliance] men, behind a green crescent-shaped table, under the Alliance symbol, the great red, white, and green clover leaf. Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe Ayala, Willer Bordon, Paolo Battistuzzi, Giorgio Benvenuto, Giovanna Melandri, Giancarlo Giglio, Pietro Scoppola, Giorgio Bogi, and Bartolo Ciccardini all looked grim. Their faces were stern and they were very reluctant to talk. So much so that they immediately made it clear: "No questions..., this is a delicate situation...." They limited themselves to a document that said it all about the alliance's present condition. The two pages issued an appeal to the progressive forces and set four conditions. What are their goals? A government program that will continue from what [Prime Minister] Ciampi has done; a candidate for the premiership; a commitment to establishing a single parliamentary group; and a reassessment of candidates, so that voters can be offered 60 percent new faces. The affiliation of the candidates is a major problem. The document states that they must not be chosen on the basis of party allegiance: "We will not accept any predetermined sharing out of quotas to parties and movements. The single-candidate system demands that candidates be fit in with the individual constituencies. We will not give up our principles in exchange for a few additional seats. The choice of candidates must lead to a major renewal." This means "yes" to men and women from ordinary society, workers, professional people, and citizens who "want to enter politics for the first time." And "no" to choices made on the basis of "party needs." This urgent appeal did not seek a split, however. The AD's representatives would not specify anything explicitly, having sworn themselves to silence. But the document says it all. "The AD's political and ethical position within the progressive area is not in question." The aim of the initiative was not to divide but to prevent "the democratic forces from exposing themselves to yet another defeat." According to the AD, the progressive alignment still lacks many things. It needs "a government program capable of creating confidence and credibility with regard to the progressive forces' ability to restore the country's economy to health, in continuity with the work done by Ciampi." And the AD regards the naming of a candidate to the premiership and his team as an important step. Moreover, Adornato's team criticized the lack "of commitment to joint action in parliament." "These are all things," according to the document, which was read out solemnly, "that are demanded by the spirit of the referendum and that the citizens are entitled to expect in order to know where the progressive forces want to lead the country. Unless these things are specified, the rationale of the alliance cannot fail to be reduced to a disappointing performance." The AD says that such a hard stance among allies is justified by their common aim -- to defeat the right, "its attitude, and its political blueprint." What can be set against this "danger"? Not the "ideological left," the AD says. That "is not the right medicine for governing the country."
