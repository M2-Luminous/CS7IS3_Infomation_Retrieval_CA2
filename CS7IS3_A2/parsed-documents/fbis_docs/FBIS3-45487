Telephone calls to Taiwan jumped from some 80,000 per month early last year to more than 120,000 by the year-end. Altogether, 1.305 million calls to Taiwan were made in 1993, up 41 percent over the 1992 figure, according to Li Zhenqun, director of the Xiamen Posts and Telecommunications Bureau. He said 1.18 million articles of mail were shipped to Taiwan last year, an increase of 37.8 percent compared with 1992. It takes only three days for mail to reach the other side, he added. Xiamen was the first mainland city to open posts and telecommunications contacts with Taiwan, in 1984. The official attributed the increase in communication to the booming business being done by Taiwan businessmen with the Chinese mainland and the growing numbers of visits by Taiwanese to their ancestral homes on the mainland. He also gave credit to the fact that more and more people in Xiamen are acquiring telephones at home, which makes calls easier.
