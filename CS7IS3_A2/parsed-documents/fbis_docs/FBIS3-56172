He pointed out that "this is the product of work of the Armenian propaganda machine." The Armenian party, the minister said, strives to suppress the spirit of the Azerbaijani army while simultaneously trying to raise the spirit of its own army. Gasanov again accused the Armenian party of attempts to solve the Karabakh conflict by coercive methods.
