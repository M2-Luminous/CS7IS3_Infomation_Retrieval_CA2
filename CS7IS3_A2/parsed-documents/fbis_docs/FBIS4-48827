[Mufamadi] Good evening, Leslie. [Mashokwe] From being harassed, jailed, and being detained by the police -- to chief of the police -- how is that transformation? [Mufamadi] Leslie, I am not chief of the police; I'm Minister of Safety and Security? [Mashokwe] Political master of the police force? [Mufamadi] Okay, well, what you are referring to are things that happened in the past. It was in a context where the police were enforcing the law. The law happened to have been unpopular. We now have a government of national unity whose existence reflects the will of the masses of our people in the country and therefore is going to bring about popular laws which will need to be enforced. [Mashokwe] That transformation, how does it touch your heart? Does it mean anything to you? Is it just a transformation? [Mufamadi] Well, it's not a question of heart. It's a question of us having agreed that we need to resolve all the problems which we had in this country, through peaceful means, and I think we have reached a stage now where we all have to confirm our commitment to a new South Africa, a South Africa which is going to be at peace with itself, and there is a role for the police in the shaping up of that South Africa. [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, what we have witnessed here is a change of political masters. The police force then enforced the laws of the day, the National Party laws that you say were unpopular. Are they still going to continue to be servants of the political masters? [Mufamadi] Well, the constitution lays down standards according to which policing is going to take place. Policemen and women are expected to be professional in their outlook. They are expected to be inspired and motivated by the ethic of serving the nation, of serving the community. They are expected to be professional. Now, all this will be done as part of upholding the constitution of the land, and it means, therefore, because these standards, these provisions, are laid down in the Constitution, policemen and women are no longer going to be abused by political parties. [Mashokwe] How do you demarcate the boundaries? When are they going to be professional, or are they going... [brief break in transmission] [Mufamadi] Well, I think what we have established is a commitment to change, a commitment to be part of the process of change and ensuring that they as policemen and women are not going to be victims of this process of change, which means that from the beginning, processes of consultation are going to be put into motion. That will include what the Constitution refers to as police community forums, and this professionalization that we are talking about, in essence it means being responsive to the needs and requirements that are articulated by the community. The community should be able to set policing priorities. The community, through its elected representatives who would be serving in those forums, should be able to say: We are the consumers of this service, and therefore this is the sort of quality of service we are demanding. [Mashokwe] What about the scourge of the ISD [Internal Stability Division]? What the ANC then said was that they were bad policemen. What is going to happen to them? And add to that the fact that we want to know whether we are still going to have security forces, intelligence people like the FBI's and CIA's? [Mufamadi] Well I think we need to put it this way -- that the Internal Stability Division was charged with the responsibility of public order policing. The new government of national unity thinks that there was a lot wrong in the way they were trained -- there was this militaristic culture which obtained within the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] -- which lent itself to excessive use of force, which needs to be changed. That does not take away the need for public order policing, but it means that they need to be trained differently. They have to continue to maintain law and order, to do public order policing, but in a manner which conforms to the standards that I have referred to earlier -- impartiality, service orientated and, therefore, user friendly. [Mashokwe] Intelligence? [Mufamadi] Well it depends on what you mean by intelligence -- I guess a good detective? [Mashokwe] No, no, the type of thing we had in the past, Mr. Mufamadi, where people would be woken up at night, the telephone being tapped and.... [Mufamadi, interrupting] Well, waking people at night is not called intelligence, but basically intelligence means if I'm investigating a case I must be able to gather all the relevant information which will lead to me making sure that justice takes its course. It means that I must be able to say this is a suspect, he or she must be tried in a open court of law, and the court will make its own finding. [Mashokwe] Okay, let's talk about demilitarization and professionalization of the SAPS [South African Police Service]: Changing name ranks from lieutenant to some new name does not change anything in actual fact. Why concentrate on name changing? [Mufamadi] Now I'm saying -- you see this ranking system that exists now --- it's a military ranking system -- general so and so, colonel so and so, and brigadier so and so, and so on. It is necessary for us to look for appropriate ranking systems for the police, and it's not as if they don't exist. They are there, but leaving aside the question of ranking, when we talk about demilitarization we are saying essentially that there is a need for consultation and accountability, both within the South African Police Service as well as between the South African Police Service and the community at large. Now this militaristic culture we are referring to was a top-bottom approach, an approach which says: Because you are my subordinate, we think the police force...[pauses] Within the police service you cannot come up with creative ideas which are going to be taken on board in order to enrich policing in the country. We think that must go. We don't want unquestioning loyalty. We want loyalty which is based on people feeling that they are part of the system because there are channels of communication which allowed them to make a constructive input. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mufamadi, thanks for your time and for talking to us.
