Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to swap part of the foreign debt for environment protection and measures against poverty.. Yoshiyama said: "A direct relationship exists between poverty, environmental damage, and sustainable development which must be considered in any international relations that are based on solidarity and shared responsibility." Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to pardon part of the poor countries' foreign debt so as to restore economic well-being and assist development compatible with sustainability. Yoshiyama made these remarks during a "Sustainable Development and Economic Growth in Ibero-America" entrepreneurial meeting. This meeting was part of the 22d AICO [Ibero-American Association of Chambers of Commerce] executive board meeting between 2 and 4 May. Yoshiyama, who delivered the main lecture, admitted that human rights, the removal of poverty, tariff agreements, the protection of intellectual property, and the protection of the environment are among the most important and universally relevant issues. The ruling party congressman emphasized the significance of a common strategy among the regional countries to cope with the problem of universal environment protection. Yoshiyama also asked for a change in attitudes and practices, specially by developed countries, and the transfer of the technology needed by developing countries to protect their environments. He said he wants costs and benefits of sustainable development to be equally shared at the international level. Yoshiyama wants large-scale education policies to make people aware of the importance of the environmental issue. He announced that a National Environment Authority would be established within the next few weeks. This National Environment Authority will guide and coordinate environmental policies. Marc Dourojeanni, Inter-American Development Bank environment division chief, hailed this announcement and offered a donation of $2 million toward this National Environment Authority. Yoshiyama explained that the new Constitution includes, among the human rights, the right to a balanced environment that favors the development of life. He added that the CCD is working on this. To the surprise and approval of the large number of participants at the AICO meeting, Yoshiyama said: "I want to announce that within the next few weeks the Peruvian Congress will vote on a bill to establish a National Environment Authority." Yoshiyama emphasized: "In response to the concern of public and private organizations, the National Environment Authority will guide and coordinate environment policies and control the sustainable use of our natural resources. It will also guide actions in this area." [passage omitted]
