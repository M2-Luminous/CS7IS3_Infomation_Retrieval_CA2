"Taiwan was once known for its exports of low-end products...but with rising wages and costs, those days are gone forever. Today, only high-quality products can provide Taiwan enterprises with new niches," Sheu said at the opening of the second annual "Celebration of Excellence" product fair. The five-day fair, sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, features 625 high-quality products manufactured by 336 companies. A screening committee has awarded 194 of the products the "Symbol of Excellence." Eight companies, including Philips, a semiconductor producer and two bike manufacturers, won the top honors awarded by the ministry during a ceremony Friday night. The award, dubbed the "Gold National Award of Excellence," is part of the government's effort to help local enterprises polish the image of their products. The winners of the gold award were each given NT$2 million (US$757,575) in cash. Winners include Kuannan Enterprise, United Microelectronics Corp., Giant Co., Merida Co. and Philips Taiwan. Sixteen other firms won silver awards. Vice Premier Hsu Li-the and Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang attended the award ceremony at the Taipei World Trade Center.
