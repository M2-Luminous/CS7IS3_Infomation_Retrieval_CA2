Above all, this situation is due to the fact that the opposition parties are fragmented and apparently have removed themselves to the sidelines of the process of change in which the whole country is involved. These comments were made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez, the minister of government, in an extended conversation which he had with the editors of LOS TIEMPOS during a working breakfast held in La Paz. In the course of the conversation the minister made several statements about the political panorama reflected in the present situation. On this basis he made several predictions about the prospects for the 1997 general elections, which will be held at the end of the constitutional term that began in August 1993. Quiroga flatly denied that his party has any pretensions to long-term dominance in the exercise and projection of political power which the MNR now holds. He rejected accusations of that kind which are often made by opposition groups. He stated that the time for long term political dominance by a single party has passed and cannot be repeated, due to the political progress which the democratic process has made in the national community. In that framework the minister of government pointed out that to keep democracy healthy and to make it possible to continue with the political and institutional development of the country, the country needs to have a strong, capable, and well-organized opposition with which it will be possible to reach effective, cooperative agreements. At the same time such an opposition will assure organized society of an effective role in checking on the performance of government bodies. In that sense Quiroga stated that the government of President Sanchez de Lozada has observed with concern how the opposition parties, principally consisting of the Nationalist Democratic Action Party (ADN) and the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left], presently appear to have "lost their way" in terms of their political position. They even appear to be markedly disorganized internally. In his view these are aspects which cannot in any way be considered positive developments for the development of the democratic system in the country. Minister Quiroga said: "The conduct of the leaders of the ADN and the MIR, since Hugo Banzer Suarez and Jaime Paz Zamora, their respective leaders, abandoned them, following the last municipal elections, makes them look like the `tail end' of the CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland party]. This is only a regional party, without any significance at the national level. It is not in a position, nor is it able to play the role of leader of the opposition." He noted that, in this situation, the government coalition, with the MNR as its central axis, has gained control of 65 percent of the municipal councils in the country following the most recent local elections. This shows that the alliance established in August 1993, with each one of its components retaining its own, ideological position and participating separately in the election campaign, has good prospects for continuing to control the national administration even beyond 1997.
