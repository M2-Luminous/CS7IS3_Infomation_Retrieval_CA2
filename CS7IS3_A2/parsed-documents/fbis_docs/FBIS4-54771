The RB is formed by the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Liberal Social Union (LSU), Christian Social Union (KSU), Greens Party (SZ), Zemedelska strana [Agrarian Party] (ZS), Farmers' Movement (HZ) and Czech Women's Union (CSZ). During the Monday meeting, the RB Caucus and RB Coordination Council agreed that the practise of rotating RB chairman once a month hindered serious work, Grulich said, adding that this was why a three-strong Executive Council was formed, including Grulich (CSSD) as its chairman, Radek Navratil (LSU) and Marta Bartonova (CSZ). Two members of the Council will be rotated once every six months, Grulich said.
