Answering a question from ITAR-TASS about the significance of the forthcoming signing of an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union, Yeltsin stressed that this document "signifies the unblocking of Russia." He noted that there really had been discrimination against Russia, and Europe would be the first to "unblock this situation." The Russian president recalled with regret that the United States' discriminatory measures against Russia were still in force. Among other things, the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment still applies.
