FR940523-0-00030 FR940523-0-00011 Office of Foreign Assets Control 31 CFR Part 500 Foreign Assets Control Regulations; Unblocking of Certain Bank Transfers Involving Vietnam AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: As an additional step in the normalization of relations with Vietnam, the Treasury Department is amending the Foreign Assets Control Regulations to authorize United States banking institutions to unblock certain funds which came into their possession or control through wire transfer instructions or check remittances received after December 31, 1989, in which Vietnam or a Vietnamese national has or has had an interest. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven I. Pinter, Chief of Licensing (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2480), or William B. Hoffman, Chief Counsel (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2410), Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220.

Background Effective February 3, 1994, the Office of Foreign Assets Control authorized new transactions involving property in which Vietnam or its nationals have an interest, effectively lifting the embargo against that country for all new transactions. Property blocked at that time, however, remained blocked. The Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 500 (the ``Regulations''), are being amended to add ยง500.579, which authorizes banking institutions subject to U.S. jurisdiction to unblock and return to the remitter certain funds that came into their possession or control through wire transfer instructions or check remittances received after December 31, 1989. This general license does not authorize the unblocking of funds in which Vietnam or a Vietnamese national has an interest that were blocked as of February 3, 1994, other than wire transfers and check remittances blocked after December 31, 1989, which are not being returned to the Government of Vietnam or persons in Vietnam. Nor does it affect enforcement actions involving prior violations of the Regulations. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
