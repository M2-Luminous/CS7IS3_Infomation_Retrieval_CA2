The outcome of a five-year power struggle within the ruling Kuomintang [KMT] was known this year. The faction in power guided and completed an inner-party power redistribution; the KMT consolidated the superiority it has enjoyed in local governments in the elections for "county magistrates and city mayors." During the year, though Taiwan somewhat relaxed the restrictions in its policy on cross-Strait two-way exchanges and put forward a "concept on promoting cross-Strait information exchange," the dispute over the one-China policy resurfaced and cast a new shadow over the development of cross-Strait relations because the Taiwan authorities increased the publicity of the concept of "giving priority to Taiwan" at home and vigorously conducted so-called "return-to-the- United Nations" activities abroad. After Taiwan held elections for "Legislative Yuan members for the second term of office" at the end of 1992, the situation became was unstable for awhile in January 1993, with disputes revolving around whether "Executive Yuan Premier" Hao Po-tsun should resign when "Legislative Yuan members" for the next term of office were elected. Later, Hao Po-tsun quietly resigned seeing as he could not get support from the KMT Central Committee. The persistent power struggle and internecine strife among high-level KMT officials in the five years following the death of Jiang Jingguo [Chiang Ching- kuo] were brought to a temporary close with the resignation of Hao Po-tsun. It also signaled the end of an era in which high-level KMT officials of the older generation who followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan had been in power. The KMT's "14th national party congress," which had been postponed for a year so, opened in August. Just when the congress was on the verge of a breakup, it completed a reluctant consolidation and reorganization of the KMT. At the meeting, the KMT created for the first time the positions of four vice chairmen; Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui] was reelected KMT chairman. The ruling faction completed the redistribution of leadership powers within the KMT through the "14th national party congress"; the new term of the KMT Central Committee boasted that "the KMT -- a 100-year-old shop -- has been transformed" and has the capital to "start anew." However, factional struggles within the KMT are still very intense and complicated; the KMT Central Committee cannot obtain a unanimous approval of its domestic and foreign policies by those inside the party; the race for power, contradictions between people who are natives of Taiwan and people who come from provinces other than Taiwan, differences in understanding and concepts, and other deep- rooted contradictions within the party are still looking for an opportunity to erupt. During the period of the "14th national party congress," a faction -- "the New KMT Alliance" -- within the KMT quit the party, established a new party, and actively took part in the campaign for "county magistrate and city mayoral" elections to be held at the end of the year. This year [1993], the public has become even more wary of the ties between Taiwan authorities and the business sector, and some people have tried to restrain the KMT with slogans like: "fight against money politics" and "fight against special privileges." Against this background, the "Legislative Yuan" adopted the "Act of Publicizing Personnel's Property," known as the "Sunshine Act," in mid-1993, despite opposition from the KMT- controlled executive branch. After the "public personnel" publicized their property one group after another, people on Taiwan have found that those who owned property ranging from 10 million new Taiwan dollars [NT] to several billion NT dollars are all high- ranking officials or "parliamentarians." The act has heightened people's awareness of Taiwan authorities' "money politics." During Taiwan's quadrennial election of "county magistrates and mayors," which began in mid-November and ended on 27 December, 77 candidates of the KMT, the Democratic Progress Party [DPP], and the New KMT Alliance Party, as well as independent candidates, vied for 23 seats. Since the DPP had overbearingly vowed to "become the ruling party within three years," the KMT regarded the election as a "campaign to defend the local political powers" and mobilized all KMT members to support the KMT candidates. In an unprecedented move, the KMT chairman and executive officials went all out to voice their support for candidates in districts within their jurisdictions. On the other hand, the DPP also considered the election as the first step "toward becoming the ruling party." During the election, instead of loudly advocating "Taiwan independence" as it did in the past, it repeatedly underscored its social welfare policies. The three-month-old New Party continued to advocate "opposition against money politics and special privileges," and used the election to test how big a space in which it could develop between the KMT and the DPP. The election process was replete with vicious attacks between candidates, lavish banquets, and "wanton bombings" with propagandistic materials. There was also endless violence and rumors of bribery. Although the KMT was able to keep the majority seats during the election, the total votes it acquired fell below 50 percent for the first time, and so it is likely that in the future it will face increasingly stronger challenges to its ruling status. The two sides have made some headway in their business talks this year. They made a historic step forward in their relations with the signing of five agreements during the world-renowned talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu], which took place in Singapore in April. For the sake that the agreements reached in the talks can be fully implemented, Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] have had three follow-up working consultations in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei [Taipei] during the second half of the year, and they reached common understandings in principle on relevant issues. ARATS representatives had the understanding and support from all walks of life in Taiwan during their consultative meeting held in Taiwan. With the new headway which the two associations have achieved in their liaison and cooperation, cross-Strait business consultations will continue. After the talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu, the Taiwan authorities have continued spreading the fallacy that "the talks demonstrate the roles of the two sides as equal political entities," and their endeavor of "developing international space" has also gone astray as indicated by their clamor to "return to the United Nations." However, because of the opposition of the international community and the Chinese people as a whole, their attempts to create "one country, two seats" and "two Chinas," were woefully defeated because they disregard the one China principle. In November, the official which the Taiwan authorities sent to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference in Seattle continued to slip on the way to create "two Chinas" by proposing the so-called "policy of two Chinas at the present stage," and his proposal was strongly criticized by media at home and abroad. Taiwan will elect "county and city assemblymen" and "township and town magistrates" in January next year, and also the "Taiwan governor" and "mayors of Taibei and Gaoxiong [Kaohsiung]" at the end of the year. The new redistribution of political power in Taiwan will certainly give rise to even more fierce fights within the KMT and between the KMT and other political parties in Taiwan. In 1994, power struggle will still be the theme within Taiwan's political arena and the development of cross-Strait relations will continue to be the focus of attention inside and outside the island.
