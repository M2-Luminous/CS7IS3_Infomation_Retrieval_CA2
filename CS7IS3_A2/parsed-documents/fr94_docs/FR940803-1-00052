(ii) Ability to recognize emergency conditions such as an operating pressure exceeding the limitations of §195.406(b) and to recognize emergency conditions such as those in §195.402(e) including release of carbon dioxide. (iii) Training for paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii) of this section shall, where feasible, utilize simulated pipeline emergencies. (5) Reaction to abnormal and emergency conditions: (i) Ability to react appropriately to an abnormal operating condition or to a condition exceeding design limitations in a manner that restores the normal operating condition or prevents the development of an emergency condition. (ii) Ability to react appropriately to an emergency condition to control or mitigate the potential for personal injury, death, property damage, and environmental damage.

At intervals not exceeding 7 months, but at least twice each calendar year, an operator shall review the performance of any personnel involved in an accident (reportable or nonreportable event under §195.50) that resulted in an explosion, fire, unintentional release of liquid, personal injury or death, property damage to the operator or others, or damage to the environment or that is a violation of the operator's procedures under §195.402. Among other such events are abnormal operating conditions or emergency conditions set out §§195.511(d)(3) and (d)(4). Within 2 months after a competency review, the operator shall: (a) Evaluate the effectiveness of qualification training, testing, and refresher training required by this subpart; and (b) Identify and implement appropriate revisions, if any, in the qualification program to improve the competency of operator personnel in order to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents. §195.519 Recordkeeping. (a) For personnel qualified to perform covered functions, the operator shall prepare and maintain written or computerized records and dates of: (1) The general and specific training elements of §192.511 which the person has satisfactorily completed; (2) The results of the testing required by §195.513 indicating the person has demonstrated successful performance; and (3) The refresher training required by §195.515 which the person has received. (b) Each operator shall sign and date the following certification, and include it among the records for each qualified person. ``I certify that on this date [insert name of person] is [qualified or qualified administratively] to perform the specified covered function(s) by the training and testing required under 49 CFR Part 195, Subpart G, as demonstrated by the accompanying record(s) prepared for that person in accordance with §195.519.'' (c) The records shall be retained for at least 3 years after a person ceases to be employed by the operator in a capacity that requires qualification under this subpart. §195.521 Compliance dates.
