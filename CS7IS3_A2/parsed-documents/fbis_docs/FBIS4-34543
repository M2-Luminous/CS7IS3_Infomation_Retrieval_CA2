According to the article, Lula says that if Brazil had implemented a good agrarian reform there would not have been land occupation; good agrarian reform must begin with a survey to determine the amount of unproductive land in each county and grant subsidized credit, technical assistance, transportation, and a guaranteed minimum price for produce. The article adds that Lula believes the Landless People's Movement has done important things in Brazil and that land occupied by the landless farmers produces more than the average property. The article reports Cardoso as believing that, within the framework of production and the creation of jobs, agrarian reform is a priority; that more should be done and less should be said, particularly because such a reform must be complemented by irrigation projects, electricity to rural areas, agricultural credit, and technical assistance. He says his "administration plans to irrigate 1.5 million hectares per year," and "the landless farmers are victims of an unfair concentration of land and the PT's radicalism, which prevented the approval during the 1988 Constituent Assembly of a modern and fair agrarian reform." Quercia says: "Agrarian reform is an essential aspect of my government plan; we will create agricultural colonies and towns with a good transportation system nearby. Federal government land as well as expropriated land will be used to settle the landless farmers. Some 16,000 families are registered in the Landless People's Movement. This is not too much, and their problem can be solved fast. Therefore, politicization of the movement is irrelevant because the problem is solved if the landless farmers are given land." Amin says: "An agricultural policy is a priority, and the agrarian reform its result, but the requirements of such a reform change in accordance with the region of the country in which the reform is to be implemented. The main basis of this policy is financing, which the farmer will pay for in grain. In the north, northeast, and central-west regions the government must implement settlement programs on unproductive land." The article adds that in Amin's opinion, "the Landless People's Movement is a result of the government decision to expropriate land only after it is occupied, thus making people who want land -- not only the landless farmers -- participate in the occupations. This is why the movement ended up being linked to the PT and the Sole Workers Center, which believe the government only implements agrarian reform under pressure." Brizola says: "A settlement program has always been a priority for us. The Constitution only defines land as being productive or unproductive. The issue, however, is more complex and other aspects of it must be considered. If a lot of land is used only for speculation, the government should expropriate it and pay for it with agrarian debt certificates. The Landless People's Movement has been manipulated for political-electoral reasons by some PT groups and by some priests."
