In Belgium, the regions and the communities actually have real powers. The essential thing is to manage to run the government efficiently. This constraint -- or this ambition -- is exactly the same as that involved in organizing Europe. This head of government is so convinced of this that most of the diplomats are saying that he will succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission. Officially, he is not a candidate. However, he is the favorite of France and Germany. His vision of Europe is one of a pragmatic government which takes action to correct extreme diversity via carefully identified unifying elements. [LES ECHOS] You played a major role in the rise of Belgian federalism. How does a prime minister, a man of power, judge its strengths and weaknesses? [Dehaene] For 15 years I was very closely involved in the reform of the Belgian state, convinced that we could develop a policy which was more in line with the particular features of each region and community. This process began in the seventies, after the preliminary implementation of a number of language laws. The options for an eventual Belgian federation were then potentially integrated. Our success was due to the stages we undertook. In 1970, we created separate Parliaments comprising national members of Parliament who had two separate duties. In 1980, we set up regional and community governments with their own administrations and budgets. Initially, they were put together within the context of national power. In 1988, the new phase transferred many more powers and resources to the regions and communities. As of the next elections, this will be the final phase: Each region or community will have its own Parliament. In 20 years, we have moved from a unitary system to a federal organization, as used in Switzerland, Germany, and the United States. We did this through political agreements passed with special majorities, and this never led to any bloody fighting. I am convinced that this is an evolution which will eventually be achieved in several European countries. In Spain, there are 16 different regions having differing powers. Italy is debating the same issues now that it is forming a government. In Germany, the Laender are asking for more powers. All this is not just the mere application of the principle of subsidiarity. I never saw this better expressed than at the Edinburgh summit, where the issue was to avoid too much centralization at European level. As European unity grows, there is a need for a stronger link with the basic identity and a search for ones roots. In many countries, this is the nation. However, in several countries, the nation concept was born in the 19th century by driving back deeper fundamental links that will now have to be reassessed. To use a cliche, we need unity in diversity. Europe needs unity to get the most out of its own potential capacities, while at the same time avoiding to become a uniform melting pot. Belgium is a forerunner as far as federal matters are concerned. Sublimating diversity necessarily implies forms of nationalism which will lead to racism if there is no European unity to counterbalance this tendency. The Yugoslav crisis is exactly that. [LES ECHOS] Can one imagine a federal Europe which even the French and British find satisfactory? [Dehaene] I am wary of labels. I think that Europe must be given a structure while at the same time avoiding the struggle for labels. In certain strategic areas there must be enough coherence for Europe to operate as it is. I am convinced that we never would have reached a GATT agreement if trade issues had not been defined, since the time of the Treaty of Rome, as falling within the authority of the Community. If the Twelve had negotiated separately, we never could have concluded the negotiations. We must therefore put the authority at the level where it should be. In certain cases, the national or regional dimension is more efficient. [LES ECHOS] Over the past few years, has too much priority been given to harmonization? [Dehaene] Europe has fallen somewhat victim to the process of building up the single market; "1992" was a major factor in anticipatory economic dynamics. With the recession, the good times collapsed in an even more visible manner. It must be stressed that the Single Act called for an increase in the number of directives, something which will never be repeated. These European laws were often implemented in an overly detailed and overly centralist manner. Most of the time, this was not the fault of the Commission, but was the result of demands made by certain countries which wanted to safeguard national interests. Afterwards, it is easy to poke fun at it. However, this centralism does not spring from the wishes of the European bodies. [LES ECHOS] In the future will you be favorable toward strengthening the system of European Union [EU] preferences? [Dehaene] In the context of GATT, we reached certain agreements on this matter within the EU. We have to be able to successfully eliminate elements of social and environmental dumping. The constitution of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is an important factor in regulation. The EU must play an active role. We cannot deny it certain protectionist tools which others might be using as well. [LES ECHOS] How do you view France's attitude during these trade negotiations? [Dehaene] The French position contributed a number of factors to the EU strategy. France played an important role on the cultural clause, which was adopted on its behalf by the EC. Conversely, Paris was forced into positions which, in the long term, seem to me to be easier to defend. The situation would have been different if France had operated on its own. All in all, the outcome was better. [LES ECHOS] Should not the member states be given back their role with respect to the Commission? Where does the right institutional balance lie? [Dehaene] This debate will be at the heart of the intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996 on the reform of the institutions. It will take a lot of creativity to find a balance between the various approaches. There is a tendency to mix them up. Some are using the enlargement process as an excuse to demand more decisionmaking powers for large countries, while at the same time pleading for an intergovernmental approach to Europe. Now, this would imply equality between all the governments. Clarification is needed. Subsidiarity requires one to know the different approaches one wants in different areas. If we take the example of trade policy, the element of control lies more at the level of the European Parliament and the Commission, with a specific role for the Council of Ministers. When the intergovernmental aspect dominates, then it is the Council of Ministers which takes precedence. The principle of subsidiarity makes it possible to move forward. In this respect, and with all its weaknesses, the Maastricht Treaty represents progress. Especially if we look at it in terms of a dynamic process. [LES ECHOS] Does this concept not imply at least an element of arbitration, if not the elaboration of a Constitution? [Dehaene] One of the challenges of the years to come is to guarantee this European dynamism by being pragmatic enough to take into account the way in which reality develops. It is clear that such dynamism was evident at one stage. It is also clear that for the time being, in public opinion practically everywhere, there is at least skepticism and, even in some places, a tendency to fold back on oneself: Supposedly Europe no longer has the meaning it had following the end of the Cold War. Admittedly, the environment is different, but then the Community was not a product of the Cold War. And outside the EU, there is tremendous hope. Maybe these outside hopes are excessive, but maybe the internal disappointments are also excessive. We must ponder this paradox of a certain tendency to once again call into question this dynamism at a time when the European element needs strengthening. [LES ECHOS] This skepticism on the part of Europeans is a product of concern about rising unemployment, in particular. What do you consider to be the most interesting aspect of the White Paper in terms of creating jobs? [Dehaene] The merit of the White Paper is that it created a framework of reference for organizing the labor market. Some elements are common to all countries: There is a structural unemployment problem, which is characteristic of Europe. In Belgium, the "global plan for employment and competitiveness" is a specific application of the chapter on employment in the White Paper. We have introduced reforms along the lines of what is happening virtually everywhere in Europe. We must be able to achieve this transformation of the labor market in a manner that avoids calling the European model into question once again. In most countries of the Community, social security is funded to an excessive extent by taxes on employment, by increasing wage costs and, above all, the gap between gross and net salaries. The issue can only be resolved by completely "unraveling" the system providing social protection. Consequently, we must seek alternative sources of financing. However, this choice could lead to distortions if it is done separately in all the member states. Taking up one of the ideas contained in the White Paper, we should use new sources of financing, such as taxes on carbon dioxide emissions. I am in favor of this provided that the fiscal pressure on companies is not increased. A change must be made in the way social security is financed, while the tax burden on an overabundant factor, employment, should be relieved in return. [LES ECHOS] How do you view the dynamics of the present enlargement? [Dehaene] We should have deepened the Community before enlarging it. However, the compromise agreed in Lisbon in June 1992 opened up the way for negotiations with the four candidate countries, before any deepening could take place. This enabled us to break the impasse concerning ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which was blocked at the time. It is rather facile to go over the discussion again today without taking account of the context. Why this prejudice claiming that the four new member states will weaken European dynamism? I have noted a political will on their part that goes beyond mere participation in the single market. In other bodies they play the institutional game to the best of their ability. They must be given their chance. As for Eastern Europe, we should probably proceed with political cooperation at a swifter pace. Association with Western Europe is important. The agreements concluded in the economic sector are also important. However, for the moment, it is premature to set any date. On the other hand, we must establish a timetable and define its stages. [LES ECHOS] In Belgium, as in France, there are those who criticize the strong monetary policy and its rigor. Do you still believe that you will manage to respect the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty? [Dehaene] If we do not manage to achieve monetary union, then sooner or later the single market will be rendered unsound. Devaluation can perhaps be used as a competitive tool only once; using it two or three times is untenable. In order to keep its place in the world, Europe needs the single market. The path mapped out at Maastricht is the only way forward. I am convinced that the decision on the single currency will be political, and not purely mechanical. Just look at the example of the union of the eastern and western German mark. If Helmut Kohl had taken a gradual approach, Germany would definitely not have become unified. I am aware that the policy of monetary stability that Europe has chosen is not an easy option, but it is the only road that will provide us with a healthy structural base. The other path would put us to sleep and lead, sooner or later, to a painful awakening.
