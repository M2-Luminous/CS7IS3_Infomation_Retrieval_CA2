The results of the visit consist in a number of economic pledges undertaken by Japan: Tokyo has promised to give money for Kazakh disarmament measures ($11 million) and announced the opening of two credit lines for Kazakhstan (to a total value of $220 million in the form of yen credits), as well as the possibility of providing $70 million in the future for the development of railroads and $55 million to combat atmospheric pollution at Ekibastuz. In addition, Japan has decided to allocate funds to insure Japanese firms' trading operations in Kazakhstan (a reference, in particular, to Karaganda, where the Japanese are involved in metallurgical projects). The list appears impressive, but the trouble is that the Japanese have given Alma-Ata [Almaty] only what they wanted to and not what Kazakhstan was asking for. Although the Kazakh president spoke hopefully of a series of contacts and talks with representatives of the business world here on a number of major economic projects in the Republic, large-scale Japanese participation in Kazakh economic affairs is perceived at present only as a remote prospect. According to statistics, last year Kazakhstan's trade with Japan amounted to a modest $37 million, and the number of projects in which real Japanese investment is involved is in single figures -- three. The Kazakhstani side's appeals for investment flows to be increased met with understanding in Tokyo, but at the same time the Japanese explained to the guests that it is necessary to improve the investment climate in the Republic, improve legislation, and carry out other routine work. Nazarbayev defined the building of economic "bridges" with Japan as the chief task of his trip. At the same time political aspects were also touched on during the talks -- the situation in the CIS and in Central Asia and relations with Russia. Nazarbayev pointed out at a meeting with reporters that the origins of the present desperately complex situation in the former Soviet republics must be sought in the political mistakes made earlier -- when the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements were being prepared, and during the collapse of the ruble zone. The Kazakh president mentioned this with bitterness, placing the main emphasis on the desire to maintain stability and to see the present reforms to a successful fulfillment. At the same time he emphasized that the Russian reforms' successes are important above all else. "In Russia," Nazarbayev said, "it is necessary to support the reforms and stabilization, not individual politicians. It is important for the whole world that the processes of democratization and economic transformations triumph in Russia." Tokyo tried to establish what the leader of Kazakhstan had in mind when he advanced the concept of creating a Eurasian Union in place of the CIS. It turned out that Nazarbayev had nothing "in mind" -- according to him, it was an idea which had not yet been developed and which was spoken aloud at a meeting with Moscow State University students.
