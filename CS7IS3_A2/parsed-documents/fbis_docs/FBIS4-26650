Wu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told a CPPCC forum marking the 40th anniversary of the five principles that they "embody the ideas of sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit and peace in the new era of international relations." The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar in 1954. Wu noted that in the diversified world the five principles, antagonistic to hegemonism and power politics, have received the sincere support of most countries. He pointed out that China is not only an advocate but also a faithful follower of the principles. "China has never occupied even an inch of any other country's territory, nor has it interfered in any other country's internal affairs," he added. Wu stressed that China will constitute no threat to any state or region, even after it becomes stronger economically. He went on to say that the international situation remains disorderly, and hegemonism and power politics still exist even after the Cold War. As early as in 1974, Wu continued, Deng Xiaoping proposed at a special UN conference that the political and economic relations between countries should be set up on the basis of the five principles. In 1988, Wu said, Deng further proposed that a new type of political and economic world order should be established in accordance with the five principles. "These ideas are becoming the common understanding of more and more countries," he added. Among those attending the forum were Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme and Zhao Puchu, both vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.
