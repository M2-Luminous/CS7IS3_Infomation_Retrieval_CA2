All those who participated at the Geneva event, from the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, and various officials deserve praise for their persuasive role as indeed do the Prime Minister and the external affairs minister. Procrastination followed by resolve is typical of the Indian style but it also has to do with the nature of democratic polity that functions best under pressure. After years of agonising and indeed dithering, India finally spelt out the bottom-line on Kashmir by telling the world what the Pakistani game was all about. The most important point related to the fact that Pakistan was attempting to use a U.N. forum for propaganda purposes despite its clandestine role in sponsoring terrorism. If it was genuinely concerned about the plight of the Kashmiris, it could have taken up India's offer made in January for talks rather than concentrate all its energies on the Geneva meeting. Eventually it took Iran, along with China, Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia and a number of other countries not unfriendly to Pakistan to tell it that such an issue is best handled through bilateral discussions. The congruence of interests in this context among India. Iran and China has portents for the future which Pakistan needs to examine carefully. It is not very clear why Pakistan chose such a desperate course. Perhaps Ms. Bhutto was acting under domestic pressure; perhaps Islamabad misread the signals from Washington. There is more than a grain of truth in the government of India's charge that the United States by its recent utterances on Kashmir is responsible for the sharp deterioration in India-Pakistan relations. But Ms. Bhutto has no one but herself to blame for the distasteful and shrill tone of Pakistani statements last month. By calling Mr. Salman Khursheed a "rented Muslim," they were insulting a Muslim community bigger than their own and in calling India the "sick man of Asia," they ultimately compelled the latter to show the world where the basic cause of the disease lay. For years, India had been unable to utilise properly the mountain of material at its disposal, confirming Pakistan's involvement in the terrorist activities in the Kashmir valley. With the challenge in Geneva, it was able to do so in a convincing fashion, a task no doubt assisted by its willingness to encourage the representatives of various nations to see for themselves the grim realities of the state. Perhaps India felt compelled to act in Geneva because it could have been the beginning of a process that would have seen India being pilloried by the Organisation of Islamic Countries as well as by the U.N. general assembly later this year. By effectively countering the threat of being blamed for the wrong reasons, and by spelling out the limits of what it is willing to offer in Kashmir, India has forestalled such a possibility. Its next move should be to act swiftly to restore normality in the state.
