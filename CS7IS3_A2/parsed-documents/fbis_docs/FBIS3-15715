In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Semenov said that land forces should be slightly trimmed up to make them more mobile and manoeuvrable, better governable and able to perform any task. He said that presently Russian land troops are engaged in various operations in Tajikistan, South Ossetia, the Dniester region of Moldova and other trouble spots in the former Soviet Union. He stressed that they are also fit enough to replace Russian paratroopers in Bosnia. Speaking about the problems facing his troops, Semenov said that the major of them is the lack of finances. It takes 10 to 15 years to develop new types of weapons, but there are no means to finance new programmes, most of which remain on paper. He regretted that the Manevr management and control system which was developed almost 20 years ago has become obsolete but there is nothing new to replace it with. Semenov said that the principle of left-over staffing of land troops which make up almost a half of the Russian army is especially alarming. The system of service on a cotract basis has proven ineffective. "Until the country gets a strong economy, one can hardly hope that skilled volunteers would join the army," he said.
