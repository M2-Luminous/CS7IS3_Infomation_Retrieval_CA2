He described isolationist trends, which in his view are apparent in Russia, as the greatest danger to the relationship between a reformist Russia and West Europe. The Finnish foreign minister noted that the West has been concerned with Russian statements echoing the old philosophy of spheres of influence and said that Russia must comply with international norms and codes of behavior in defending its interests. Minister Haavisto spoke at a defense policy seminar in Helsinki.
