FR940617-1-00047 FR940617-1-00012 The labeling for the alcohol product (Ref. 1) provides directions for use without water rinsing, where water is not readily available, as follows: ``A `palmful' (5 grams) is dispensed in one hand. It is spread on both hands and rubbed into the skin until dry (approximately 1 to 2 minutes). A smaller amount (2.5 grams) is then dispensed into one hand, spread over both hands to wrist, and rubbed into the skin until dry (approximately 30 seconds).'' The agency concurs with these directions and is incorporating them into its proposed directions for use for OTC topical antiseptic drug products, including alcohol, formulated for use without water in this tentative final monograph. See proposed ยง333.455(c) and ยง333.465(c).

Comments on Chlorhexidine Gluconate 11. Several comments requested that the agency include chlorhexidine gluconate as a Category I ingredient in any amended tentative final monograph. The comments submitted references and data to establish general recognition of safety and effectiveness (Ref. 1), and stated that chlorhexidine gluconate solution is recognized in the ``British Pharmacopeia'' (Ref. 2) and is formulated in a wide range of products that have been successfully marketed to a material extent and for a material length of time in other countries. The comments asserted that when formulated in compliance with FDA's current good manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR part 211), chlorhexidine products are safe and effective for use as skin wound cleansers, skin wound protectants, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, surgical hand scrubs, and health-care personnel handwashes. A reply comment argued that chlorhexidine gluconate, currently marketed in the United States under approved new drug applications (NDA's), is not eligible for an OTC drug monograph because the ingredient has not been marketed within this country to a material extent and for a material length of time. The comment added that variations in final formulations may alter the safety and effectiveness of the ingredient. The comment submitted data (Ref. 3) to support this viewpoint and requested that chlorhexidine gluconate be classified in Category II. In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210), chlorhexidine gluconate (4 percent solution) was neither addressed nor categorized as Category I, II, or III. However, subsequent to the tentative final monograph, the agency granted a petition (Ref. 4) and in the Federal Register of March 9, 1979, reopened the administrative record to allow interested persons an opportunity to submit data and information (44 FR 13041). The comments (Ref. 1) and reply comment (Ref. 2) were submitted in response to that notice. However, since that time a majority of the comments on chlorhexidine submitted in response to the notice have been withdrawn (Ref. 5). While the withdrawn comments remain on public display as part of the administrative record, they are no longer being considered in this rulemaking. The agency has reviewed the marketing history of chlorhexidine gluconate and finds that although it has been marketed for professional or hospital use under NDA's, insufficient data remain in the public administrative record for this rulemaking to support general recognition of safety and effectiveness for OTC use. Accordingly, chlorhexidine gluconate 4 percent aqueous solution as a health-care antiseptic is a new drug and is not included in this tentative final monograph.
