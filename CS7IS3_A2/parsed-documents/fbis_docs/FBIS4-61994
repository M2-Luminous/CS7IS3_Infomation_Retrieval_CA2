According to Lakerbaya, about 24 thousand people have returned to the Galski District alone from areas controlled by Georgia. Members of the commission have begun reviewing the registration procedures of the people wishing to return to Abkhazia. They are also discussing legal aspects of the issue. "We demand only one thing: At the time of filling registration papers these people must commit themselves to respect laws of the Republic of Abkhazia and must not take up arms against lawful authorities," Leonid Lakerbaya added. "We know the mood of our population. We are very much alarmed, when the talk turns to a massive inflow of refugees. The Republic cannot accept all people at once, as houses are destroyed, and there is a shortage of food and fuel. We are prepared to accept refugees, but in those settlements, where specific conditions have been created for settling them. We will continue this work, but in stages and without unwarranted hurry," the Abkhazian vice-premier noted. The parties considerably differ on determining the number of refugees who intend to return. For example, the protocol of the expert group session on the question of registration procedures, the number of refugees is shown to be 290 thousand. At the same time it is assumed that 250,000 people must return to Abkhazia from areas controlled by Georgia. The Abkhazian side emphasises that currently there are no more than 120,000 people in Georgia, who were forced to leave Abkhazia, and another 65,000 in Russia. Thus, according to Abkhazian records, the total number of refugees, who would wish to return, does not exceed 185,000. The commission plans to hold its next session on 30 May to discuss the question of determining the extent of losses suffered by refugees and forced migrants.
