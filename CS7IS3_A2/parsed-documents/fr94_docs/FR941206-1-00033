FR941206-1-00033 FR941206-1-00005 State Submissions The final State regulation, containing AVO zones, was due to be submitted to EPA on November 15, 1992. New Jersey submitted an incomplete program on this date. On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of New Jersey that the ETR program was incomplete and sanctions would be implemented under Clean Air Act section 179 if a complete program was not submitted within 18 months. On November 15, 1993, New Jersey submitted a SIP revision request containing the required aspects of the program, including APO/AVO zones and measures to enforce the program. EPA found the submittal complete on December 29, 1993, and thereby stopped the section 179(a)(1) sanction process. II. Analysis The following items are the basis for proposed approval of the SIP revision. The State has met the requirements of section 182(d)(1)(B) by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required program elements. 1. The Average Vehicle Occupancy Section 182(d)(1)(B) requires that the State determine the AVO at the time the SIP revision is submitted. The State has met this requirement. In 1992, AVO was established by a telephone survey, and based on demographic characteristics, the State has been divided into two distinct AVO zones. The urban area zone includes the counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, and part of Passaic (municipalities of Clifton, Paterson, and Passaic), and has an established AVO of 1.22. The AVO of the suburban zone is 1.10 and includes the counties of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Ocean, Somerset, Salem, Sussex, and the remainder of Passaic county. 2. The Target APO Section 182(d)(1)(B) requires that the target APO must be not less than 25 percent above the AVO for the nonattainment area. An approvable SIP revision for this program must include the target APO. The State has fulfilled this requirement by computing target APOs that meet the 25 percent mandate. The suburban zone maintains a single area AVO and APO, but the single urbanized zone has been divided into three distinct target areas. Urban area zones: •Sub-area 1: Urban Core including the Newark central business district, Jersey City central business district, and Hoboken: Target APO = 1.97 •Sub-area 2: Remainder of Hudson County: Target APO = 1.73 •Sub-area 3: The counties of Bergen, Union, the remainder of Essex and the urbanized area of Passaic (municipalities of Clifton, Paterson, Passaic): Target APO = 1.46 These three target zones averaged together produce an increase of 25 percent of the AVO as required by the Clean Air Act. Suburban area zone (area described above): Target APO = 1.38 3. ETR Program Based on the requirements of the Clean Air Act, state or local law must establish ETR requirements for employers with 100 or more employees at a worksite within severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas. In the ETR Guidance issued December 1992, EPA states that automatic coverage of employers of 100 or more should be included in the provision. In addition, states should develop procedures for notifying employers of the ETR requirements. The State of New Jersey has fulfilled these requirements. EPA will allow New Jersey to provide additional time to employers that request an extension. The rule requires employers to comply by 1996 but allows an extension for the penalties for noncompliance until 1997. This is allowed because the Clean Air Act states that employers must comply within four years of program submittal by the State. Since the program was submitted on November 15, 1993, the State may allow employers until November 15, 1997 to comply with the program. The rule specifies that a contract employee is defined as working at a location for a least six months over the course of a year. Employees that work less that six months are not incorporated into the program. The State believes that this is appropriate since an employee that works less than six months at one location is likely to work more than six months at another location. Although in concurrence, EPA is not comfortable with a six month period and would prefer a period of shorter duration. State and/or local laws must require that initial compliance plans ``convincingly demonstrate'' prospective compliance. Approval of the SIP revision depends on the ability of the regulations to ensure that the Clean Air Act requirement to ``convincingly demonstrate'' compliance will be met. This demonstration can take on any of four forms or any combination of these. One option is for a state to include in the SIP evidence that agency resources are available for a plan-by-plan review of employer selected measures to ensure the high quality of compliance plans. A second option is for the regulations in the SIP to contain a convincing minimum set of measures that all employers must implement. These measures will be subject to review and approval by EPA as adequate when the SIP is processed.
