Following the speech of HDZ President Mate Boban concerning the political and security situation and the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the committee declared themselves in favor of a persistent seeking of a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also ordered all the bodies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna to do everything for a successful defense of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna from aggression. The political declaration of the HDZ was also adopted at the session, in which it is stated that "the HDZ is the main and almost the only political force of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina," and that under its leadership, "the Croatian people have managed to defend from the Serb, as well as the Muslim, aggression most of the populated territory, thus gaining the right to the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, which has a vital and strategic importance for the Croatian people." The HDZ supports the "providing of an equal status of the Croats and the other peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, in the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a democratically organized Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna that will guarantee and secure all the rights and freedoms to every citizen," the integral city of Mostar as the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the protection, improvement, and security of all the rights of the Croats as "the precondition for stopping the eviction of the Croats, securing the return of the refugees and displaced persons," and also "the building of firm principles of protecting the Croats who remain outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on a reciprocal basis, regarding the rights of the other two peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Among the decisions listed in the declarations, it was stated that the HDZ will continue to support the ending of the war through political negotiations, the protection of the rights of the Croatian people and just peace, and, in cooperation with the international community, a permanent political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially on the basis of the latest initiative of the European Union and the peace initiative of the president of the Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, on an equal basis for determining the rights of each of the three peoples: Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, especially on the basis of territorial demarcation. The HDZ considers unconditional observance of the international war and humanitarian law, the disclosing and punishment of war crimes, regardless of who the perpetrators are, and the free passage and delivery of humanitarian aid on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be obligations no one can be exempt from. The HDZ will retain its political influence through new forms of organizational solutions and appointments of new people, as well as improving the political unity of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and implementing the tasks contained in the program through political activities.
