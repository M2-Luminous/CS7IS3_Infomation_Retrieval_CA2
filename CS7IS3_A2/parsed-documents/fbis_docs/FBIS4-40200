During the president's visit, the question was discussed with the chief of the space-equipment testing centre Major-General Aleksandr Vinidiktov. According to Vinidiktov, he did not have to convince Boris Yeltsin that the new space project is advisable. The president, who is now touring Russia's eastern regions, was ready to support the idea. The problem of Baykonur is associated with the fact that following the break up of the former Soviet Union, the country's main space centre found itself on the territory of a "foreign country", the newly independent state of Kazakhstan. Russia is now using it under a temporary agreement with Kazakhstan but needs independence for pursuing its own space policy. The Russian space forces and other interested parties are now working to expand the space centre in the northern Plesetsk and looking for a suitable place for a new space centre in southern Russia capable of performing a number of functions which Baykonur alone can handle at present. The Government of Russia has prepared a draft resolution "On the Development of the Cosmodrome in Plesetsk and the Creation of a Space Centre in the Far Eastern Region of the Russian Federation". Svobodny-18, a former military settlement in the far east, is probably the best choice as it has a ramified infrastructure worth several hundreds of billions of rubles and its personnel trained to service combat missile complexes can be easily retrained to launch boosters with space craft. The new space centre would also create new jobs for the Amur-Baykal main line builders and local machine-builders. Ahead of the full-scale development of the new space centre, a space equipment testing centre is already operating at Svobodny as part of the Russian space forces. Its specialists are preparing the launches of the Rokot boosters scheduled for 1996.
