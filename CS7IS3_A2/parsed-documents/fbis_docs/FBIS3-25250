However, this should be kept secret for as long as possible to force acceptance of the alliance's constitutional proposals and motivate foreign financial support. The document was drawn up at a meeting of the alliance's executive committee in Richards Bay on January 10. Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje confirmed the document was authentic, but said it contained only scenarios which had never been adopted by alliance leaders. The January 10 meeting was called specifically to discuss the formation of an electoral alliance, as opposed to a mere negotiating alliance. It was decided against because "the differences in member organisations' policies are too great." The executive considered three options -- participation, non- participation and doing nothing. The third option was shelved. The participation option was split into suboption: winning the election; preventing the ANC [African National Congress] getting a two-thirds majority; and "disrupting the election". All were possible, whether the interim constitution remained in place or was amended to suit the alliance. The second option was to "abstain from participation in the election and secede from the RSA [Republic of South Africa] or create conditions under which it would be impossible to have a free and fair election." It concluded that if members participated in the election individually, rather than as an alliance, "no member would obtain sufficient votes (20 percent) to elect a deputy president or to have a position of power through the number of members elected to the Cabinet, constitutional assembly and other organs of government at regional and/or national level". Support from the Press and international community would be limited; and the alliance's supporters would either vote for the NP [National Party], to prevent the ANC getting a two-thirds majority, or for the ANC, to be on the winning side. It also warned that participation implied the alliance would have to "accept the results of the election and give credibility to the multiparty process." The option of participating with the aim of disrupting the election would depend on the legal implications. However, it would also have "more freedom of movement for actions aimed at resistance. (This option does require further investigation." The document states that should the alliance not participate, but take the option of disruption, "the full power of the government, the ANC and the TEC will be directed against it". The situation regarding the security forces and their attitude to the alliance could also influence the decision. Secession becomes an option only if the country becomes ungovernable and the alliance will have to secure its own position in a situation similar to Angola and Mozambique, the document says. Alternatively it is an option if the alliance becomes a force feared by government and the ANC, who believe it cannot be subjugated by military force. This would make a peaceful secession possible. Factors against an electoral alliance which could contain the ANC majority, or even win the election, included the "political cost for the Inkatha Freedom Party of being associated with the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the CP [Conservative Party] and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]" and Bophuthatswanan independence would have to be sacrificed.
