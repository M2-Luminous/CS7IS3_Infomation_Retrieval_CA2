Wang Xiaofeng, provincial party deputy secretary and provincial executive vice governor, presided over and addressed the meeting. Provincial Vice Governor Chen Suhou made a mobilization speech. In his speech, Wang Xiaofeng pointed out: In recent years, our provincial economy has continuously advanced toward sustained, rapid, and healthy development. However, under the present situation of economic transformation, taking the opportunity of changes in tax and exchange rates and price reform, some enterprises, units, and individual commercial units have arbitrarily increased prices and collected fees. They have also arbitrarily raised prices of daily necessities and service charges. This has enhanced the pressure of inflation and caused higher price increase. In particular, the margin of price increase in our province ranks first in the country. Due to excessive price rises, the burden of the masses has become heavier. Various quarters have a strong reaction against such price hikes. Therefore, curbing price hikes has now become a key to handling relations between development, reform and stability well. Wang Xiaofeng stressed: Under the condition of socialist market economy, relying on market prices alone is not enough. The government still needs to control prices. It is necessary to organically integrate exercising control with lifting controls. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen reform and strengthen macroscopic regulation and control over commodity prices. It is necessary to control prices according to law and establish a supervisory system of the government. It is necessary to stabilize prices through developing production and ensuring supplies. It is necessary to implement measures of microscopic regulation and control by central authorities and to properly control investment and consumption demand, so that we can maintain market stability and speed up the pace of our province's economic development. In his mobilization speech, Chen Suhou pointed out: Carrying out a major investigation of commodity prices is an important measure for strengthening macroscopic regulation and control and promoting healthy economic development. It is an effective form for strengthening supervision and examination of commodity prices under the condition of developing a socialist market economic system. In light of Hainan's practical conditions, the present investigation of commodity prices must grasp well the three integrations. In other words, the major investigation must be integrated with the practice of stopping collecting fees arbitrarily and lightening peasant burden. The major investigation must be integrated with strengthening macroscopic regulation and control and improving the price control system. Inspection, supervision, and coordinated services must be simultaneously grasped, so that temporary relief can be integrated with permanent solutions. It has been learned that the present majort investigation will be carried out in two stages. From the second half of March to 15 April, is propaganda and mobilization stage. Various departments and enterprises must carry out self-investigation and submit their own reports. From 16 April to the end of June will be the key examination, summation, and consolidation stage.
