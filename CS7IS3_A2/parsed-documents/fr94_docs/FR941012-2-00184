Codification of Federal Transit Laws On July 5, 1995, President Clinton signed Public Law 103&hyph;272, which codifies Federal transit laws under title 49, chapter 53 of the United States Code. The enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;272 repeals the FT Act without substantive change, which means that the original meaning of the FT Act provisions are unchanged by this codification, even though the new language in some instances differs from that of the FT Act. The codification includes laws enacted through June 30, 1993. Provisions enacted after that date, and revisions to title 49, chapter 53, will be reflected in subsequent legislation now being drafted in Congress. This Notice accordingly uses the new form of citation followed by the relevant FT Act citation in parentheses. Listed below are the most commonly used citations: ␣ 1Federal Transit Act 149 U.S.C. § 1Subject Section 3 5309 Capital Program. Section 8 5303 Metropolitan Planning Program.
