ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an EIS and notice of scoping meetings. SUMMARY: In accordance with Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and 42 U.S.C. 4321, the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the BLM, Las Cruces District, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third-party contractor on the impacts of the proposed 345kV transmission line project, the Newman to Port-of-Entry project. The proposed project could affect public and private lands in El Paso County in western Texas, and Doña Ana County in southwestern New Mexico. BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; and (3) Notifying interested groups, individuals and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed action, alternatives and significant issues being considered to be distributed to selected parties and available upon request. In this notice, the BLM announces public scoping meetings for the proposed project. Maps and other information will be available at these meetings and the public will have the opportunity to ask questions regarding the proposed project. The public scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations: ␣ 1Date/time 1Location Oct. 26, 1994, 7:00 PM Gadsden High School, 6301 Highway 28 & West Washington, Anthony, New Mexico. Oct. 27, 1994, 7:00 PM Border Patrol Museum, Memorial Library, 4315 Trans Mountain Road, El Paso, Texas. DATES: Written comments on the scope of the EIS for the proposed Newman to Port-of-Entry should be received no later than November 7, 1994. Comments on the project will be accepted throughout the NEPA process. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Juan Padilla, Project Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Las Cruces District Office, 1800 Marquess, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88005, ATTN: Newman to Port-of-Entry Project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Juan Padilla, BLM Project Manager at (505) 525&hyph;4376. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The El Paso Electric Company is proposing to build approximately 45 miles of 345kV transmission line from the Newman Power Plant in western Texas, north of El Paso, to the planned Port-of-Entry Substation in southwestern New Mexico in Santa Teresa, approximately 4 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. A regional environmental study was conducted in 1992. As a result of this study, approximately 100 miles of alternative corridors were identified as being environmentally and technically satisfactory for transmission line development. Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, residential and agricultural impacts, sensitive wildlife and plant species, historical or traditional cultural properties, visual impacts, and electric and magnetic effects. Lands crossed by the alternative study corridors include those under the jurisdiction of the BLM, Fort Bliss Military Reservation, State of New Mexico, and the counties of El Paso (Texas) and Doña Ana (New Mexico). As part of El Paso Electric's 10-year plan, the proposed project is intended to improve the reliability of the electrical system. Construction of the proposed transmission line is anticipated to begin in January 1998 and be in operation by June 1998. The objectives of the EIS and related activities will be to study and assess the potential impacts of the proposed project to various environmental resources including biological (e.g., threatened or endangered species), cultural, land use, visual, socioeconomic, geology, soils, and surface water. Alternatives that will be considered in the EIS include routing/siting locations, no action, and others that are identified through the scoping process. Because the project study area includes the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, the BLM has invited the Department of Defense (Fort Bliss) to be a cooperating agency. A memorandum of agreement is anticipated between El Paso Electric, BLM, and Department of the Army (Fort Bliss). It is anticipated that the EIS process will take 18 months and will include public information/scoping meetings; coordination and involvement with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies; public review and public hearings on the published draft EIS; a published final EIS and a review period; and publication of a record of decision (ROD). Public information and scoping meetings will begin in October 1994. Publication of the ROD is anticipated in April 1996. Dated: September 28, 1994. Linda S.C. Rundell, District Manager.
