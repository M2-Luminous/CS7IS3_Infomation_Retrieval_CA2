"Everything has come to an impasse," Hosokawa told reporters when asked about progress in talks focusing on automobile and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Asked whether he will send International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai to Washington in a last-minute effort to break the impasse, Hosokawa said the situation is still "fluid." He said various moves were possible to break the impasse, suggesting that Kumagai will go to the United States. Senior Japanese and U.S. officials met Tuesday in Washington for yet another round of talks on ways to ensure U.S. access to the Japanese market, but no agreement was reached. The biggest stumbling block, Japanese and U.S. officials said, centers on the issue of "objective criteria" for measuring if the Japanese market is truly open to imports. The U.S. Government has demanded that Japan accept a variety of numerical targets such as import levels to evaluate the openness of its market to foreign goods. Hosokawa told reporters Japan's acceptance of such "objective criteria" is "impossible," adding that the U.S. is also showing no sign of softening its stance. The premier made the remarks after a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and the trade minister at his official residence.
