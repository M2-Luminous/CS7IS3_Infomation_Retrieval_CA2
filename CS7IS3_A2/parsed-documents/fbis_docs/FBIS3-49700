The briefing was attended by Defence Minister Lajos Fur, Parliamentary State Secretary for Defence Rudolf Joo and Army Commander Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz. They cited the new defence legislation as the main reason for the measure. The law, passed by almost unanimous parliament support, rules that the defence minister is the superior of the army commander, and that the armed forces are under permanent civilian control both in peacetime and at war. The merger incurs no extra costs for the Defence Ministry, and might even bring some savings, Fur said in reply to a question. The minister confirmed that senior officers who have completed their 55th year will be retired. Lorincz will be one of them this year. Two generals might be retired in the the first half and four in the second half of the year. Lorincz said he will turn 55 in February, and he is prepared to retire as he fulfilled the army reorganization tasks assigned to him in 1989.
