(j) All authorizations made by a Second Fiduciary regarding investments in a Fund and the fees paid to M&I are subject to an annual reauthorization wherein any such prior authorization referred to in paragraph (i) shall be terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&I of written notice of termination. A form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization described in paragraph (i) above (the Termination Form) with instructions on the use of the form must be supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions for the Termination Form must include the following information: (1) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and (2) Failure to return the Termination Form will result in continued authorization of M&I to engage in the transactions described in paragraph (i) on behalf of the Client Plan. (k) The Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in a particular Fund receives full written disclosure, in a statement separate from the Fund prospectus, of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for secondary services (as defined in Section IV(h) below) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase, accompanied by a copy of the Termination Form, and receives full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise of any increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such fees will be credited as required by paragraph (d) above. (l) In the event that M&I provides an additional secondary service to a Fund for which a fee is charged or there is an increase in the amount of fees paid by the Funds to M&I for any secondary services resulting from a decrease in the number or kind of services performed by M&I for such fees in connection with a previously authorized secondary service, M&I will, at least thirty days in advance of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase, provide written notice to the Second Fiduciary explaining the nature and the amount of the additional service for which a fee will be charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees of the affected Fund. Such notice shall be accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined in Section IV(i) below. (m) On an annual basis, M&I provides the Second Fiduciary of a Client Plan investing in the Funds with: (1) A copy of the current prospectus for the Funds and, upon such fiduciary's request, a copy of the Statement of Additional Information for such Funds which contains a description of all fees paid by the Funds to M&I; (2) A copy of the annual financial disclosure report prepared by M&I which includes information about the Fund portfolios as well as audit findings of an independent auditor within 60 days of the preparation of the report; and (3) Oral or written responses to inquiries of the Second Fiduciary as they arise. (n) All dealings between the Client Plans and the Funds are on a basis no less favorable to the Client Plans than dealings with other shareholders of the Funds. Section III_General Conditions (a) M&I maintains for a period of six years the records necessary to enable the persons described below in paragraph (b) to determine whether the conditions of this exemption have been met, except that (1) a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred if, due to circumstances beyond the control of M&I, the records are lost or destroyed prior to the end of the six-year period, and (2) no party in interest other than M&I shall be subject to the civil penalty that may be assessed under section 502(i) of the Act or to the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code if the records are not maintained or are not available for examination as required by paragraph (b) below.
