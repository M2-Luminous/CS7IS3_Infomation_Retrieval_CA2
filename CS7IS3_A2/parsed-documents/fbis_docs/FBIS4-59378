Israel previously allowed only 99 of 450 members of the third batch through, for reasons that Israel claimed were technical. Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of the Palestinian forces, stated that Israel decided to prevent popular receptions for the Palestinian people to welcome their returning forces. He said an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and the Israeli sides to allow 250 members of the Palestinian police to cross tomorrow morning through the Rafah border post. The forces in Jordan will also enter through the Allenby Bridge. He added that other forces will arrive from Libya, Sudan, and Algeria. They will all gather in Rafah to prepare to enter the autonomy areas in stages following the approval of the Israeli side. [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0601 GMT on 13 May adds the following: "Three hundred Palestinian policemen crossed into the West Bank from Jordan overnight and headed by bus for the Gaza Strip under Israeli army escort, a military spokesman said Friday. ["The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) will join 300 of their comrades who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and Wednesday nights through the Rafah border from Egypt. ["`They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and will probably enter Gaza from the south,' the spokesman said. ["They belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade stationed in Jordan and were driving down the Dead Sea, up through the Negev desert and across west to the Strip. ["The men were armed but without munitions, which were held only by one officer on each of the 10 buses."] ["Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4. ["And 300 more Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the Rafah border because of what PLO officials described as `a big problem', but refused to elaborate. ["Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected to certain names among the 300 and that a major argument ensued."]
