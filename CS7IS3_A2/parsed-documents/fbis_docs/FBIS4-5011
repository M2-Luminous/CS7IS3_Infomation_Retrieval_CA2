President Okuda also pointed out that "If management's options are expanded by the decontrol of financial systems, competition should increase above previous levels and we should witness the creation of innovative services which are peculiar to Japan." In his speech on the 24th [of March], Governor Mieno stated, "The reason why it is difficult for Japanese financial institutions to create financial innovations is that there is a relative lack of a tendency to utilize competitive market principles." When asked for his thoughts on this statement, President Okuda said, "Banks have been restricted by a variety of controls such as licensing systems from the standpoint of protection for depositors and maintenance of confidence and order," in pointing out that regulation by banking authorities prevented the creation of innovative services. Finally, he stated that the "industry would like to enhance the quality of financial services by challenging themselves to offer new services" through such actions as review of bank operations and decontrol of interest rates.
