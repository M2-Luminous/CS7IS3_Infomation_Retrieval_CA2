LSD, an expensive drug sold in very tiny amounts, "was not well known in the region" until this season. It has been seized in "private homes of people involved in drug trafficking," said the head of Mar del Plata's Drug Traffic Division, Superintendent Alejandro Redik. The police officer did not reveal the exact amount of LSD that was seized due to "the court proceedings, at the wishes of the judge handling the case," he explained. "There was a great deal of antidrug activity in January: about 20 arrests, seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and LSD," he said. The constant rise in the drug traffic in Argentina has been shown by "the 30 percent increase in drug seizures" in relation to past years, according to the general superintendent, Horacio Hernandez. "Obviously, if there is more traffic it is because demand and consumption are both up. And if there are more drug seizures, it is reasonable to say that there is also increased police vigilance," both police officers agreed.
