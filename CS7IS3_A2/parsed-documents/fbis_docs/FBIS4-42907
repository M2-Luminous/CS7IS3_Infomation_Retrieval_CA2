Before his departure Stercken said that his intention was to improve the preconditions for normalizing relations between Germany and Iraq. Meanwhile, Hans Stercken has moved on to Jordan's capital, Amman, where he is talking to us on the telephone. Good morning, Mr. Stercken. [Stercken] Good morning, Mr. Labuhn. [Labuhn] Can you tell us something about the detailed discussions that you had with Saddam Husayn? [Stercken] Let me say first of all that I did not go there on behalf of anybody. I accepted a personal invitation and was accompanied by my colleague Dr. (Riedel), who supports a charity for Iraqi children in Munich. As far as the Iraqi side was concerned--and I had the opportunity of talking to virtually all the major politicians of that country--the talks revolved around the country's policy following the [eventual] lifting of the blockade. The future handling of this important position in the Middle East must not be an issue that is discussed by military circles. It is a political question. Neither is it an economic issue to be discussed by the many lobbyists in Baghdad hotels where you can meet businessmen from every corner of the globe who already discuss the policy following the lifting of the embargo. That is not politics. It was for that reason that I wanted to learn from the Iraqis themselves the kind of policy that they believe they (? should) pursue. [Labuhn] What was the reply? [Stercken] I believe that the lesson has been learned. I am saying this quite openly and clearly. I do not believe that any illusions are being cherished, not even concerning the determination of the West not to permit any such operations. Secondly, speculation that such an embargo might bring about political change in the country has not proved correct. I have talked to many people, including some who oppose the regime, who say that solidarity was never greater. If phosphorous is used to burn down wheat crops to complicate the food situation in that country, then one cannot expect the citizens to see that as a contribution toward their political freedom. Furthermore, there are many people who support the realization of Iraq's original intentions, to permit a multiparty system, and to finally change the Constitution as was decided at the end of the 1980's, to set up an electoral system and an electoral law that would also apply to the future state president. All these are things that must be insisted upon now, and interestingly this was discussed with me openly and in great detail. [Labuhn] Can Saddam Husayn's hints at political reforms in the country be taken seriously, Mr. Stercken? Can they be taken seriously, bearing in mind that this dictator has been ruling Iraq ruthlessly for decades? [Stercken] Well, I would dearly like to see Westminster democracy prevail everywhere in the world. But my impression is that politics is always the art of the possible. How do we lead this important factor--for this is one of the most powerful Arab countries--back toward a civilized form of relations with the states in that region, with Turkey, Iran, and Kuwait. What are the factors that would induce change? Only from such changes can there emerge political change, political tolerance. What other options are there? After all, the intention of those businessmen who are already trying to feather their own nests is not to stabilize the situation by means of democracy. In fact, they will achieve the exact opposite. Hence, now is not the time for another quarrel over oil, but for a political dialogue that takes advantage of this hour in which the lessons of history have been learned to promote the development of this country in this spirit. [Labuhn] Do you, Mr. Stercken, call for economic sanctions to be lifted as a precondition for the resumption of political dialogue between Iraq and the international community of states? [Stercken] Well, I will talk about this with all those who have voiced numerous concerns about the UN resolutions. But I will also ask whether it is sensible to do it. For instance, there exists at present a willingness to conclude relevant accords with Kuwait. We really should proceed from the premise that without eliminating the causes of the present tension no development inside the country itself will take place. Too few people, and not only in Europe but also in the United States, are aware of that. When you have dealt with the Arab world for 40 years you realize, for instance, that Saddam Husayn compares his incursion of Kuwait with incursions of Austria and elsewhere--although I should add that I had no intention of discussing this when talking about the future and the past--when he says that that too once belonged together. It is a different mentality. What is more, we did not spend time looking back on these German issues. The issue now is to avoid future conflicts and wars, and to ensure that this takes place on an appropriate and politically acceptable basis. [Labuhn] In other words, you would advocate lifting UN economic sanctions in the foreseeable future. [Stercken] What I advocate is the strictest adherence to the UN accords, namely, once the conditions have been met, then the sanctions should be lifted, but this must be linked to a political concept. We cannot allow this to degenerate into a military, economic, or oil issue. [Labuhn] The Kurds in northern Iraq, Mr. Stercken, live in peace only because they can now live in a UN protected zone, virtually protected by allied troops. Likewise, the Shiites in the south of Iraq cannot be certain of survival. How can these minorities be protected when the aim is the normalization of relations between Iraq and other countries? [Stercken] Well, I was shown the agreements with the Kurds that Barzani had intended to sign. It is interesting to note that Tariq Aziz, the former foreign minister and present deputy prime minister, said that the U.S. secretary of state was totally unaware that following the detailing of this accord, Barzani was invited to the United States where he was told that this would mean an end to all opportunities for cooperation with the United States. All this must be clarified. If this is indeed the case as claimed-- and I will discuss this with Barzani--then I can only say that they are no contribution toward a political solution of these issues. The Kurds do want to remain part of Iraq, and the autonomy treaty that they negotiated with Baghdad--I would say, looked at superficially--is indeed already a great help for the Kurds, and it is something that they agreed with the authorities in Baghdad. The question now is, if there is any doubt about this then guarantees must be given. But surely the path toward a solution should not be blocked in the mistaken assumption that a political change in Baghdad could be brought about in that way. That is discernible nowhere. Even the dissidents--as well as many journalists who made no attempt to disguise their attitude--have told me that in that way no political change could be brought about in Iraq. It must come about through dialogue, and on that point we count especially on the Europeans, saying again and again we count on the Germans, the French, and, interestingly, on the Spaniards. In fact, they seem to have anticipated Schwerin somewhat [sentence as heard]. I really do feel that serious thought should be given to this matter. After all, we do not want victory, but we want peace, reconciliation, and cooperation. [Labuhn] Mr. Stercken, you are among the very few Western politicians who have had a face to face meeting with Saddam Husayn after the Gulf war. What impression did you have of him? [Stercken] Very relaxed, very calm. I believe that the general situation in the country gives him no cause for any great worries. But I told him, do not be deceived, the issue is not just relations with your neighbors. Kaiser William II once spoke of many enemies, much honor, but Kuwait, Syria, Turkey--and then relations with Iran especially--must be added. If no easing, no relaxing of the situation comes about which, in any case, we cannot enforce everywhere by means of manpower but only on the basis of the status quo, and if there is no recipe, then it simply cannot be that [words indistinct] [Labuhn] That was Hans Stercken, CDU deputy and chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee.
