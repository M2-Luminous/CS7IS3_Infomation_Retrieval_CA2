The prime minister reported that Chile and the Czech Republic have completed an agreement to eliminate entrance visas. The Czech prime minister made this comment at the end of a lecture he gave to international affairs experts at the Andres Bello Diplomatic Institute in the Foreign Ministry building. In his lecture the Czech prime minister said he is in Chile because he believes that his nation must not restrict its ties to European countries only. Klaus expressed skepticism about the idea of a great European union, but he said he favors an integration process that admits diversity. He also said that the Czech Government is interested in safeguarding its own identity without, he said, dissolving in coffee like a lump of sugar. In addition, he warned that the Czech Republic does not intend to become a bridge between eastern and western Europe.
