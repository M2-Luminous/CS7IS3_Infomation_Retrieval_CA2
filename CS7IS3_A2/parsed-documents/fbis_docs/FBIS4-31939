We did not make the continuation of the talks conditional on anything, but Croatia yesterday began its blockade of the negotiating process in a bizarre way--with a banal demand to allow five Croatian reporters to attend and cover the Plitvice talks. By substituting form for substance, they set this as the condition for the resumption of the talks. They managed to block the negotiations, as they had decided beforehand. They even proposed a final text of the agreement they wished us to sign in Plitvice, the ISKRA news agency quoted the Krajina foreign minister as saying. We expect international factors to do all in their power so the peace process with Croatia could resume with the aim of achieving a lasting peace, which is in the interest of the Serb people and other members of the international community, Babic said while commenting on the postponement of the talks with Croatia.
