State and National Governments On 8 May 1994, for the first time in more than 25 years, Panamanians will have the opportunity to vote in elections that will be free of military leadership or other denigrating practices. The future of our nation will be determined, to a great extent, by the results of those elections. That is why everyone's participation is so important, and the ceremony that gathers us here today corroborates this. Our country wants a change. Our country demands a responsible government that will make decisions; a government capable of resolving the problems we are currently facing and capable of seeking solutions that will make it possible for the Panamanian people to establish modern and dynamic public institutions in order to strengthen democracy, create jobs, fight corruption, and eradicate poverty. The government and people must advance with wisdom, taking advantage of the historical moment Panama and all of mankind are currently facing, eradicating indifference, corruption, skepticism, and the lack of faith in national goals. We must avoid having to pay the high cost hanging negatively over civic and moral values, which is absolutely necessary to build a solid future for Panamanian society. At present there is a dangerous imbalance in our social life which must be eliminated in order to timely prevent internal commotions that would only broaden and deepen the problems that cause them. This means reducing economic inequality and poverty and at the same time restricting sinecures, special concessions, and privileges to certain groups. It also means joining efforts, developing our ideas, and multiplying our activities to fight unemployment. As we approach the 21st century, Panama must make very serious decisions that will lead the country toward the overall development of its entire potential in order to find once and for all the path leading to an effective solution of the current social, economic, and political problems. 2. Reaffirmation of Democracy Panamanians will not be able to make our democratic convictions a reality unless we express our firm desire and determination to establish and offer a good government organized with order and in accordance with the best techniques and practices of an efficient public administration. We must leave behind the selfish practice of distributing political positions and instead seek the participation and incorporation of the most capable men and women, youths and adults. We need a state in which, with everyone's participation, the government is really and scientifically at the service of the nation. We need an efficient government that will use state properties and resources to the country's benefit. It should adopt firm and timely decisions that should always be implemented technically and honestly, placing national interests above any personal or partisan interests. We need a government that can achieve greater and more defined cooperation among the government branches, where public expenditures are made in a more dynamic way, making the best use of funds and producing enough savings for the public projects and investments required both in the cities and in rural areas to create new jobs and to fight poverty. We need a serious, credible government in which the Panamanian people can participate and place their confidence with the certainty they will receive the replies they demand and need: work, adequate income, education, health, housing, transportation, security, justice, total freedom, and equal opportunities regardless of sex. That requires fiscal discipline and balanced budgets, which are the basis for financial stability. Indian groups will have full participation and will be given priority in government actions, with respect for their traditions, language, and customs. The implementation and respect for international agreements and accords signed and ratified by Panama on the subject of human rights will be a rule of conduct for the government and its officials. 3. Progress and Economic Development World changes and technological advance, the globalization of economy, and the progress of nations demand that power be exercised with responsibility and honesty, not only in the public sector, but in the private sector as well. It is necessary to promote and encourage -- seriously and based on reality -- the investment of national and foreign capital, as well as the consolidation of an informal economy that will encourage and promote medium, small, and micro enterprises, which can generate new activities and jobs. Productivity, efficiency, and producing at maximum capacity in the various economic sectors are essential factors to support the country's economic growth and development. The comparative advantages of our country's geographic position, as well as its interoceanic region with all the existing infrastructure and the already or next to be reverted properties demand a capable, vigorous, strong, honest, and modern government that will take upon itself the urgent national task of productively, immediately, intelligently, and thoroughly exploiting all our advantages to the benefit of Panama and the Panamanians so that unemployment will no longer be the ghost that lingers over the homes of hundreds of thousands of compatriots. A well-sketched plan and permanent actions to reduce unemployment must be implemented immediately so that the benefits and economic activities will really reach all national sectors, giving Panamanians opportunities for a better life. Each and every one of the economic resources must be used for the country and its people's overall development. Therefore, we believe in the urgent need to break the two Panamas scheme that the concentration of economic activity in the interoceanic region has promoted. This is a determining factor in efforts being conducted to reduce unemployment and the levels of poverty and will contribute to finding solutions for the other social problems that also demand attention for the primary sector of the economy, with emphasis on agriculture and livestock, ecology, reforestation, and agro-industries. Those sectors must receive adequate and reasonable protection when justified and when it can contribute to increasing exports. The recognition of the enormous foreign public debt the Panamanian State inherited from previous governments cannot be evaded. Its payment, however, must be subordinated to the country's economic and financial conditions so that the service charges for that debt will not affect Panama's development or the attention of the Panamanian people's urgent, basic, and permanent needs. No Panamanian should feel that his social rights are affected by the payment of the debt. 4. Education for Change The future of Panama depends more and more on our capacity to accept that we are confronting a world that -- without neglecting the cultural aspect -- is becoming more technical and scientific. We must emphasize these aspects and update our science and technology. Strengthening the education of our children and our youth with that criteria is the only solid base for creating citizens that are useful to themselves, their family, their country, and the world. Our best efforts should be committed to attaining national education that will offer both students and teachers all the appropriate instruments that are indispensable for permanent improvement in the technical, professional, scientific, and cultural fields. Actions in the education field should also have the goal of recovering ethical and moral values, national traditions, improving the culture of the Panamanian people, and in teaching new careers, professions, and techniques. The educational reform should take into consideration the recommendations and proposals presented by the teachers themselves in a detailed study they have presented in this respect. Our university system is becoming increasingly distant from the technological and scientific realities of today's world, as well as from the job markets of the present and future. Thus, this all demands a thorough reorganization of its research, scientific, and academic work so that it can comply with its true mission and offer society well-trained personnel, as well as qualified and capable technicians and scientists that will fully join national development. Eradicating illiteracy should go hand in hand with a permanent educational, technical, and professional improvement of the entire population. No Panamanian should be deprived of the right to an education. Public entities such as the IFARHU [Human Resources Education and Training Institute], Inaforp [National Institute for Professional Training], and IPHE [Panamanian Special Rehabilitation Institute] should be strengthened, expanded, and modernized, offering them and promoting the effective use of the resources and facilities necessary for their activities at a national level. Improvements should be made to the existing educational centers for training workers, farmers, and technicians, such as the INA [National Institute of Agriculture] and other professional training schools such as the Professional and Technical Institute. The educational efforts set forth by private enterprise and the church should also be worthy of permanent recognition and support. 5. Women, Children, and Family In their eagerness to find jobs, Panamanian families have gradually separated and children have left school and jeopardize their lives in search of an income to survive. Responsible fatherhood can only be achieved through the individual's full education as a primary cell of the family, which is the main nucleus of society. Such an education can only be accomplished where there is an educational system for that fundamental purpose. The role of women, as well as their full participation in all public and private tasks and duties, should not be underestimated at any level of government activity. National codes and laws will be duly corrected so that every form of discrimination against women will cease. In the area of labor, particularly, job creation plans must be developed to guarantee womens' rights and the principle of equal salary for equal labor. However, what we do for men and women to promote their full development as citizens will be worth nothing if we fail to understand that the Panamanians of the future are our children. It is to them that we will direct our top priorities, ensuring their education and teaching them through examples and values what it is to be good citizens who love their country and universal peace. 6. Opening Ourselves to the World for Our Benefit Panama should play its role in worldwide society without neglecting to obtain benefits for the Panamanian people and meeting their needs and realities. Thus, we must consolidate and expand our international relations, establish a modern and pluralist foreign policy and work on improving our services abroad by, among other things, increasing commercial activities that will generate jobs in and from the Colon Free Zone in a serious, orderly, and responsible manner. Panama must also develop the international oil business and expand port activities and the transshipment and handling of containers and products en route to international markets from Panamanian ports and airports, while supporting the national aeronautical industry as well as promoting tourism and ecological tourism. The national government's central and foremost motivation under my leadership will be the creation of mechanisms that will foster the permanent creation of new jobs, permanent contributions from the international economy's upward trend to the strengthening and broadening of Panama's banking and financial center, as well as the protection and promotion of Panamanian stock companies and international merchant marine, and the creation, among other things, of an international maritime center. 7. A Stable Panama With an Efficient Canal Panama must have a properly organized government through which to play a predominant role in the new international order that has emerged and is in a permanent process of transformation, while guaranteeing the administration, operation, and effective and stable maintenance of the Canal by Panamanians. Thus, it is essential for the state's economic and legal structures to have stable and modern foundations and to be flexible enough to enter into the accelerated process of innovation and privatization which from day to day affects every area of human endeavor and offers new prospects for the creation of jobs. Within this context, the new government must be prepared to redefine Panama's economic and commercial relations with the United States of America, including among its duties as a sovereign country the leasing for fixed periods of facilities or bases in our country, so that we can ensure preferential treatment for Panamanian products and services in U.S. markets and thereby increase employment opportunities for Panama's youths. The promotion in our country of agricultural, cattle breeding, maritime, commercial, craft, and industrial activities as well as the possession of other types of properties, securities, and wealth, are closely tied to the reconfirmation and maintenance of our monetary system and our total freedom of exchange and foreign currency. Therefore, financial and monetary stability is essential to the economy's development, as is Panama's inclusion in NAFTA in a way that will guarantee improved living conditions and jobs for our people and improvements in the worldwide services offered by Panama and its interoceanic canal. 8. Security and Authority The task of eradicating violence, social crime, and all types of national or international organized crime -- including drug trafficking and its addiction -- should rest on a system of equal administration of justice for all, which will act in defense of rights and democratic liberties, and which will not allow any impunity. The principle of authority within the framework of an effective modernization of our legislation will be the guarantee that all citizens will become guards of democracy. We must solve the problems of coexistence while increasing improvement of society. We then need to have a better and more effective cooperation among the branches of public power, as well as a thorough reorganization and modernization of our judiciary, police, prison, and fiscal systems so that the citizen will be a subject and not an object of the same. The Attorney General's Office, specifically, should be purged and reorganized as soon as possible so that it will comply with its tasks in defense of the citizens. We need officials who will comply with the law very strictly and who are efficient in their administrative duties. The administration of justice, based on equality before the law, without detriment to public liberties, and based on the guarantees of due process and inalienable human rights, must not be tolerant of crime or criminals, and it must eradicate the practice of criminal impunity. The Public Force must agree to accept reorganization with truly civilian goals. All of its personnel must have a civilian mentality, inspired and guided in an authentic vocation at the service of society, whose protection and security are its main purposes. In an effort to improve the services of security and public order, it is indispensable to approve a National Police organizational law and reorganize the Police Academy with a scientific and civilian mentality, both for the law enforcing units and the police officers, as well as for the training of PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] officers, the customs officials, and other specialized entities. 9. A State at the Service of the Citizens The Panamanian people are hoping for substantial changes and every day demand a solution to their main needs. That is why the government must assume a clear direction so that public services be truly beneficial for the user, so that we will have such services as electricity, communications, potable water, and efficient health and social security services that are reliable, sufficient, constant, and inexpensive. Transportation services must be guaranteed in an effective manner, so that comfort, timeliness, security, and cost will be the permanent rule. Community services, garbage collection, streets, highways, sports fields, recreation areas for children and adults should be basic priorities of the government's work. A rapid and adequate decentralization of state services that is accompanied by a strengthening of municipal tasks will contribute to guaranteeing the citizens' participation in solving local community problems where the creation of jobs, education, security, health, public hygiene, sports activities, environmental protection, reforestation, the protection of the ecology and renewable resources will also be a task for all. 10. Updating the Future All Panamanians must actively participate in the reorganization of state structures and governmental tasks. The transformations and changes that all Panamanians are hoping for cannot be delayed any longer, and this obligates all of us to acquire the commitment of initiating and developing the actions of a national nature that, within the economic, social, political, and ethical field will become everyday events that will allow us to turn the present into a solid base for the future we want. The definite eradication of the bad practices and corruption that have contributed to the disappointment and frustration of the people, is a task that cannot be delayed any longer nor does it allow us to remain mere spectators of international and national events. The hope for change must be transformed into an instrument of action so that we Panamanians attain our democratic goals of justice and freedom. We define the state to be an institution of services and the government as the entity that renders these services to the community. In the commitment that we have acquired to offer Panamanians an opportunity to a better life, we will give priority to the adequate delivery of the services the state offers the people. This is not an issue of availability of funds. This is a problem of complying with the functions and responsibilities assigned to each entity and government office, and within them to each and every one of the public servants. -- If each one does his duty and public services are rendered in an efficient, reliable, trustworthy, and prompt manner, we will begin to alleviate some of the factors that influence poverty,... -- If children learn in schools... -- If the sick are taken care of and healed at the hospitals,... -- If transportation improves,... -- If electricity, water, and telephone services are cheaper and more efficient,... -- If the ports and airports work better,... -- If the entities of culture and sports offer better services,... -- If garbage is collected and the streets are cleaned,... -- If public security is effective,... -- If the judges enforce the law,... -- If customs inspectors restrict contraband,... -- If the PTJ units fight drugs,... -- If employees receive adequate protection under the labor law and investors are stimulated to take on risks and thus create new job opportunities for the youth,... -- If, in summary, the government fulfills its obligation to render services, it will be because there is a president who makes decisions. This is what I am offering you and what I am planning to be: A president who will make decisions for the benefit of the people. We must do that in the first 100 days of the government. Once the country has surpassed this initial phase of establishing a government that fulfills its functions and makes decision, we will have taken firm steps down the paths of economic growth and social justice. If a government cannot render the basic services that the people need and for which it assigns the necessary resources and for which it has the necessary infrastructure, then this government cannot even try or engage in more complicated tasks. This will be a government that knows how to provide the necessary guidance so that all Panamanians will work hard for the change we want and for making Panama the fatherland of all, a government that will achieve the participation of the community, which is not only necessary but vital for success. In view of all the various problems we have mentioned, it is clear that Panama can no longer continue as is. The Panamanian of today demands a true and urgent change, a profound change in the structures of the state, in the distribution of wealth, in the role of public services, in the responsibility of the politicians, in the allotment of the rights and obligations of all citizens. It demands participation. The answer to this uproar cannot wait any longer and it has a name: It is everyone's plan. Let us begin this path toward progress, doing first the simple things, the others will follow immediately. I invite you all to join efforts and take off so we will reach the superior states of well-being and progress.
