Only six amendments were approved in seven months of work. The constitutional reform work ended today. The reform period was not extended, and no decision was made to start a new constitutional reform next year. Throughout the day today, party leaders negotiated the approval of an amendment proposed by rapporteur Nelson Jobim for the creation of a mechanism to make regular constitutional amendments every 10 years. The leaders reached an agreement on the proposal, but deputies and senators did not respond to their leaders' call, and there was no quorum for approving the amendment. Consequently, the two sessions on the last day of work of the Constituent Congress were used to make speeches lamenting its failure. Former PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader Jose Serra blamed the lawmakers who abstained from participating in the debate because they did not want to commit themselves and lose votes in an electoral year. PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes said that the country is lagging behind history, and that it will have fewer jobs, fewer investment, and less competitiveness. PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who attended the last session, said he will strive for a new reform next year. Since it was installed in October 1993, the Constituent Congress managed to approve only six amendments, which will be promulgated within the next few days.
