Has this blow taught the Serbs to be afraid? [Karadzic] NATO's interference in our crisis is a disaster. NATO is clearly anti-Serbian, and threats directed one-sidedly against us will not lead to peace. No organization is legitimated to supplant the United Nations. [DER SPIEGEL] However, the United Nations has proved to be incapable of dealing with the crisis and has not been able to implement any resolutions. [Karadzic] Then the United Nations must reinforce its troops. Such a mission must not be left to a block pursuing its own interests. NATO, which has long become obsolete since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, has made use of the weakness of the United Nations and is now acting completely on its own. [DER SPIEGEL] But giving the order for an operation still rests with the UN commanders on site. [Karadzic] NATO was determined to shoot also without an order. The Western alliance had the need to do so. Therefore, Boris Yeltsin asked me and President Milosevic to give in. [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not becoming increasingly likely that there will be a new Yalta in the Balkans, with Serbia falling into the Russians' sphere of interests? [Karadzic] The Russian culture, the Russian people and its religion are very close to us. However, when we are pushed under the Russian wing in political terms, this is just the fault of the West. It has proved to be merciless and aggressive toward our people. We are in a situation where one cannot choose one's friends. If Russia offers to protect our rights, we cannot refuse this. [DER SPIEGEL] You have just been to Moscow. Did President Yeltsin promise you any specific help if there was a further escalation between Serbs and NATO? [Karadzic] Of course, Russia will not permit NATO to dominate the Balkans. Nor can Moscow have any interest in letting the conflict spread to Greece, Turkey, or Albania. By the way -- we can defend ourselves. [DER SPIEGEL] President Yeltsin has suggested a peace conference with the big five: the United States, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. Would you participate in such a conference and sign a peace plan worked out there? [Karadzic] This conference would have to be prepared well. All three sides would have to make sacrifices. The final outcome should be an international peace treaty similar to the one of Versailles in 1919 that sets down the new borders. [DER SPIEGEL] And what should these borders be like? [Karadzic] Our idea was the formation of a Muslim state in Bosnia with 33.3 percent of the territory. This is enough to survive. There are smaller states. We wanted to exchange territories with Croatia. As a result, the Serbs would not have gotten everything and the Croats would not have lost everything. [DER SPIEGEL] In the meantime, an agreement between Bosnian Muslims and Croats has been achieved, who want to form a joint federation and then plan to establish a confederation with Croatia. Will the Bosnian Serbs join this model? [Karadzic] Only political illiterates could expect us to do that. We lived in the so-called Croatian-Muslim state in World War II. At that time hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed under German protection under German protection. For us there can only be an independent Serbian state in Bosnia or the unification of the Bosnian Serbs with all other Serbs in one state. Anything else would be unnatural.
