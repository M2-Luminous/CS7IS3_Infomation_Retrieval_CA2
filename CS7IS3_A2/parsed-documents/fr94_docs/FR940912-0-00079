FR940912-0-00079 FR940912-0-00018 7. The Commission amended §64.1510(b) to remove the requirement that carriers inform subscribers billed for collect or presubscribed information services that 900 number blocking is available upon request since that fact could confuse subscribers because 900 number blocking would not block collect calls or most presubscribed services, which are typically offered through 800 numbers. The Commission also modified slightly the terminology used in the rule to reflect more clearly the type of calls it was designed to cover. Thus, the amended rule deletes the term ``interstate tariffed collect information services'' and instead refers to ``interstate information services provided on a collect basis.'' To ensure consistency, Sections 64.1507(c) and 64.1511(a) were also amended to incorporate this changed terminology. Ordering Clauses 8.

Section 64.1501 is revised to read as follows: §64.1501 Definitions. (a) Pay-per-call service means any service: (1) In which any person provides or purports to provide: (i) Audio information or audio entertainment produced or packaged by such person; (ii) Access to simultaneous voice conversation services; or (iii) Any service, including the provision of a product, the charges for which are assessed on the basis of the completion of the call; (2) For which the caller pays a per-call or per-time-interval charge that is greater than, or in addition to, the charge for transmission of the call; and (3) Which is accessed through use of a 900 number; (4) Provided, however, such term does not include directory services provided by a common carrier or its affiliate or by a local exchange carrier or its affiliate, or any service the charge for which is tariffed, or any service for which users are assessed charges only after entering into a presubscription or comparable arrangement with the provider of such service. (b) Presubscription or comparable arrangement means a contractual agreement in which: (1) The service provider clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer all material terms and conditions associated with the use of the service, including the service provider's name and address, a business telephone number which the consumer may use to obtain additional information or to register a complaint, and the rates for the service; (2) The service provider agrees to notify the consumer of any future rate changes; (3) The consumer agrees to use the service on the terms and conditions disclosed by the service provider; (4) The service provider requires the use of an identification number or other means to prevent unauthorized access to the service by nonsubscribers; and (5) Provided, however, that disclosure of a credit or charge card number, along with authorization to bill that number, made during the course of a call to an information service shall constitute a presubscription or comparable arrangement if the credit or charge card is subject to the dispute resolution procedures of the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Billing Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.
