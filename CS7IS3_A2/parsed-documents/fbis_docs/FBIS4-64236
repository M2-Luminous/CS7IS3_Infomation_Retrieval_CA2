He is proud to have created "about 4,000 jobs" with his companies. Abel Matutes, a 52-year-old Ibizan, married with four children, left his job as European commissioner for transport and energy on Wednesday [27 April] after handing in his resignation to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Since yesterday, he is now merely the People's Party "number one" for the European Parliament [EP] elections. He returns from Brussels with some 40 decorations of the highest order, awarded to him, as he explains with satisfaction, by many other countries for his contribution to international cooperation and the defense of democracy in countries as far away as Chile and the Philippines. [de Azua] Are these elections bound to focus on the corruption scandals? [Matutes] That is not my wish, and I hope they will not. The People's Party can win them outright through its own programs and by the fact that the best men and women are on our side, although the corruption issue will inevitably have an effect and will form a backcloth to the elections. [de Azua] Will the People's Party win the elections because it is better than ever, or because the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party [PSOE] is at its lowest-ever ebb? [Matutes] The result of any election can always be put down to a little of both, and always combines the merits of one party with the faults of the other. It is true that, at the moment, the PSOE has reached rock bottom, but it is also true that the People's Party is putting itself forward as a reliable and coherent alternative, with modern programs and in obvious harmony with the actions of neighboring governments. All this is being done under the clear and brilliant leadership of [People's Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar who currently enjoys undoubted popular support. [de Azua] Could the apparent paralysis of the European plan not increase the abstention rate? How do you intend getting more people to vote? [Matutes] The process of European construction has always slowed down in times of recession. Economic crisis always leads to "Europessimism" and "Eurosclerosis." The idea I am going to defend vigorously is that we need a strong Spain and a strong Europe. The People's Party today represents modernity and convergence with Europe. For as long as we contribute actively to European construction, we will be able to defend Spain's vital interests without any complexes. People must come to vote because, if they do not, they will have no right to complain about the representatives they find themselves lumbered with. [de Azua] What sets you apart from the Socialists when it comes to representing the interests of the Spanish people? [Matutes] There are basic aspects of European construction that are subject to state policy, and in this respect there are no major differences. However, the current government's policy is not bringing us into line with the rest of Europe -- quite the reverse: It is increasing the distance between us and Europe. As a party from the same political family that is in government in most European countries, we are the best placed to bring about this convergence and to defend Spain's vital interests. [de Azua] But there has been a great deal of consensus where European construction is concerned, and perhaps the voter can see no clear difference between the People's Party's project and that of the PSOE. [Matutes] I must stress that we cannot base our action solely on a romantic idea of European construction. We must take Spain's interests into account and defend them. In this way, in the long term, we can prevent the Spanish people from feeling overly frustrated. [de Azua] Is the appointment of Celia Villalobos as your number two an attempt to compensate for your lack of popularity? [Matutes] Naturally, I do not claim to be able to compete in the beauty stakes with the lovely Celia, and her appointment seems to me to have been very well received. However, even before it was known that she was to occupy such a high position, I was very high in the personality polls, with an especially good rating for my political profile and several points ahead of the Socialist Party. If Celia and the other candidates score highly in the popularity ratings, so much the better.
