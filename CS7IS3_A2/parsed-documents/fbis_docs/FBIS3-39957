But the Spanish demands for a large quota have not been rejected, and clear signals from the meeting indicate that at today's negotiating meeting with Trade Minister Grete Knudsen the EU will try to find out how far Norway is willing to go. Yesterday evening the trade minister was disappointed that there has still been no clarification from the EU. "There is nothing special in the fact that things are moving so slowly in the final spurt, but I had hoped that the fisheries position would be ready by the time we arrived in Brussels," she said. If Knudsen firmly rejects demands for increased EU quotas the EU will be forced to decide what concrete demands should be pushed in the negotiations next weekend. If the other EU countries either are unable to force Spain onto the retreat, or choose to back a demand for a little fish at least, the scene will have been set for a crisis in the negotiations. "I think that Norway will have to expect that the EU will make strong demands on Norway in the fisheries field," Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos told AFTENPOSTEN. Poos said that Norway's stance that it does not have a single fish to give away has given rise to strong reactions from some of the EU countries. At the meeting Poos stressed that the EU must take account of the Norwegian demands, chiefly those to do with the country's northernmost regions which are particularly dependent on fishing. "But Norway cannot expect the EU not to demand access to Norwegian waters," Poos said. But he believes that Norway is in a good negotiating position bearing mind the fact that several EU countries do not want to give Norway full access to the EU market from day one of membership. "You can do a trade off market access against quotas," he proposed. A major problem for the EU countries' attempts to hammer out a common fisheries stance is the fact that Spain -- supported by Portugal -- does not want the EU concept of relative stability to apply to an EU with 16 members. Relative stability means that quota allocation occurs on the basis of historical rights. Spain has claimed that with new countries in the EU a new situation arises which means that all quota allocations must be renegotiated. Such a demand is unacceptable to a number of EU countries, including Denmark. At yesterday's meeting on fish Spain reiterated its demands for 7,000 tonnes of cod for itself and a so-called solidarity quota of 11,000 tonnes. Spain and Portugal are also opposed to the idea that Norway will have better access to the EU's waters than they themselves have achieved. They will not have full access until 2003. France and Ireland are standing firm on their demand that Norway be denied full market access. Here Spain is proposing that Norway adopt voluntary limits on exports. It is likely that there will be limits to how much progress can be made in the round of direct negotiations with the applicant countries which begins today. Norway thinks that it is realistic to expect to tie up the energy protocol, the declaration of the principle of public access to information, and questions to do with the position of the Lapps. But these are mere bagatelles against the heavyweight areas which will have to wait until the weekend. The trade minister said yesterday that Norway still has the goal of negotiating in parallel with the other Nordic countries. But Norway thinks that achieving a good agreement is more important than the danger that Norway could fall behind a little. Late last night the EU countries took a break from the fisheries discussion and tackled agricultral and regional issues. In this latter area the Commission has proposed that a new so-called objective region classification be created -- 1(A) -- for the Nordic countries. They in their turn have asked to receive structural support under today's Objective 1 region classification -- something to which Spain, among others, is opposed. The new objective region classification aims to meet the applicants' demands that account be taken of their special circumstances.
