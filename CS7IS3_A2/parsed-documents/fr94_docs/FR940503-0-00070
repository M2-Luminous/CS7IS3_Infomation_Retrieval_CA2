FR940503-0-00070 FR940503-0-00022 II. Eligibility To Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents Section 651 of the 1992 HCD Act provides in relevant part, ``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of a covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy in the housing␣*␣*␣*.'' (Emphasis added.) With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,'' the Department believes that in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section 8 units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors 3 ), or to the section 8 units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of such project, but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were designed primarily for seniors. The preamble frequently uses the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially assisted projects whose section 8 units will be covered by this interim rule . 3 As used in this preamble, the term ``seniors'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. It is important to note that the statutory system of preferences provided by subtitle D is only available to projects which qualify as ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' The Department points out that many projects which have section 8 assistance are not ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families'' (as defined in Section I.A. of the preamble, which follows), and may not elect the subtitle D statutory system of preferences. A. Covered Section 8 Housing Project: Section 659 Subtitle D and these regulations define ``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that: (1) was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983; (2) is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and (3) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families. 1. Projects That are Newly Constructed or Substantially Rehabilitated Pursuant to Assistance Provided Under Section 8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in Effect Before October 1, 1983. The Department administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing. However, the system of preferences under subtitle D does not apply to all these programs. The programs to which subtitle D applies are: (1) The section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880; (2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; (3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883; (4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and (5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886. 4 4 The ``Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart A) involves only existing housing. However, the ``Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-owned Projects'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves substantially rehabilitated housing, in addition to existing housing. Accordingly, this rule would amend subpart C of 24 CFR part 886, but only for projects involving substantially rehabilitated housing. Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which are not covered by the preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act. Under section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act, an owner of a project (or portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program, or Section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly families in accordance with the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was developed. Accordingly, under this interim rule, the subtitle D statutory system of preferences does not apply to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three programs. 5 The Department emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner understand the type of assistance a project receives to determine eligibility under subtitle D and these regulations. 5 Although in this regard, the Department is aware of no Section 221(d)(3) BMIR projects or Section 236 projects with Section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance. As such, by its terms, ``covered section 8 housing'' does not seem to encompass the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program or the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program. Project owners should note that the following types of projects or assistance would NOT be covered by this interim rule: _Section 202 housing projects, _Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing projects, _Section 221(d)(4) retirement service centers (because such projects have FHA mortgage insurance but no section 8 assistance), _Section 236 housing projects, _Housing projects with contracts for section 8 loan management set aside (unless the projects also have contracts for section 8 assistance involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation, in which case the units could be covered),
