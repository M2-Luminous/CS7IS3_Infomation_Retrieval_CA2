The first case under investigation is the alleged summary execution of seven guerrilla members in the Ocosingo marketplace. Their guerrilla's bodies were found tied up with a single shot to the back of the head. The commission is also working on the case of 14 people traveling in a minibus who were reportedly killed in a 2 January clash near the Rancho Nuevo barracks, approximately 12 km from San Cristobal. Some of the bodies showed a shot to the head. The commission is also investigating the deaths of four civilians reportedly shot by the Army two days later at the same place. Regarding missing person cases, information indicates that out of 349 reported cases, 142 people remain unaccounted for. The committee said it interviewed 127 prisoners and ascertained the injuries sustained at the time of their arrest. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Board of Nongovernmental Human Rights Organizations, which is headquartered in San Cristobal de las Casas, said it had received 45 testimonies from people who are not involved in the conflict -- mostly Indians -- who were "mistreated" by the military and accused of being members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The Defense Ministry announced that 20 armed, masked men yesterday held up two UNHCR representatives -- Isabelle Mariel Raeber, a Swiss citizen, and William Calderon, a Mexican -- taking their money and credit cards, on the highway to the conflict area.
