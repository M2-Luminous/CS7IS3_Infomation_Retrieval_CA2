This is the surprising result arrived at by Norwegian meteorologists when they tried to measure air pollution which is spread across borders. Russia receives three times as much sulfur dioxide and nitric oxide from Western Europe than it exports to the West. In June the states of Europe will sign a protocol on sulfur emissions in Oslo. In the context of this meeting the Meteorological Institute has compiled figures for cross-border emissions which contradict the picture of Russia as the big environmental threat. It is true that the country's industry is highly polluting, but because the wind mainly blows from the southwest to the northeast most of Russia's dirt lands in Russia. If we look at the balance between Sweden and Russia 6,200 tonnes of sulfur and 16,400 tonnes of nitric oxide are transported from Sweden to Russia, while Russian pollution in Sweden amounts to 5,600 tonnes of sulfur and 1,300 tonnes of nitric oxide. Sweden, Norway, and Finland are countries which because of their location receive relatively large quantities of pollutants from Russia. If we look at the EU [European Union] countries they spew forth 118,000 tonnes of sulfur which land in Russia, while we receive only 600 tonnes of sulfur. "The chaos in Russia means that the inhabitants there have lost their balance. As a result they are an easy target for a Western description of the environmental problems which is not particularly balanced. We should not paralyze Russia by simply concentrating on their environmental emissions," said Rune Castberg, a researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute who has specialized in Russia. He predicts that Russia will become much more aggressive on environmental issues too and will demand that the countries of Western Europe clean up their own backyards before criticizing Russia. The sulfur protocol which environment ministers from 28 countries are to sign in Oslo on 13 June contains several new principles. These include the notions that natural vulnerability must be taken as the foundation when it comes to regulating emissions and that countries must work together to a much greater extent to achieve the best results. "The protocol makes it possible for a country like Norway, which to a large extent has only automobiles and ships as sources of nitric oxide emissions, to invest in purification plants on the Kola Peninsula instead. "As a result an overall reduction in emissions can be achieved that is greater than would have been the case if similar amounts of money had been invested in a pool of environmentally sound automobiles which would after all only be replaced in time," Thorstein Dreyer, information chief at the Norwegian Environment Ministry, said.
