The falsity of this is well proved, first of all, by the refutation of Russia. A radio of Russia January 29 said military materials "are being distorted continuously" in South Korea. "There is no contract on paying off the loans with something like military technology," it quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying. This notwithstanding, the puppets are now spreading lies, fully indicating what despicable political swindlers and offscourings without elementary human morality they are. Falsity, fabrication and deception are intrinsic habits of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group wearing the "civilian" veil. It is really foolish to forge "relations" and have dealings with such persons, expecting something from them. Their false propaganda is aimed at inveigling Russia into the frantic anti-DPRK campaign it launched in league with outside forces under the pretext of the non-existent "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. This is not only a political mockery of Russia but an intolerable, undisguised challenge to the DPRK. The Russian radio said "it seems that somebody wants to inveigle Russia into the complicated situation of the Korean peninsula." This is out of due concern. If Russia was embroiled into the situation of the Korean peninsula which has been brought to the brink of war by the reckless moves of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the situation would be rendered all the more complicated. Anybody must not do something obstructive to a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and its peace and peaceful reunification, but do something benefitial to them. The South Korean puppet clique is obviously scheming to label Russia as a war conspirator by inveigling it into the dangerous developments which may lead to a new war on the Korean peninsula. It must give up reckless moves of war and confrontation aimed at slaying the fellow countrymen in the North with the backing of outside forces, and promptly stop fooling and doing harm to others.
