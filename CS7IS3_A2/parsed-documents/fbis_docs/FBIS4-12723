At the same time, police launched an operation to locate any Arabs from the territories within the Green Line and escort them back to their homes. Leaves have already been canceled for all police officers, and training courses closed, with participants being sent back into the field to beef up manpower. The decision to impose the closure was made by Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin following recommendations from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the General Security Service, and the police. The closure went into effect yesterday at 5 p.m. and included, without exception, the Gaza Strip, Judaea, and Samaria. Palestinians from the territories will be barred from entering Israel, including eastern Jerusalem. Police Inspector-General Rafi Peled said the closure would remain in effect until the present wave of terror subsides, and then would only be lifted gradually. "We are going to constantly check ourselves. If the situation deteriorates, we will continue (the closure). If things cool off, we will consider a gradual and controlled lifting of it," Peled said. Last night, police conducted a nationwide search for Palestinians illegally residing in Israel, finding them, and then returning them to the territories. "The country will be empty of Arabs from the territories," Peled said. The IDF also imposed a "regional closure" on Janin, Tulkarm, and Qalqilyah, prohibiting residents from traveling beyond city limits. In addition, Hebron is still considered a closed military area. Security sources have confirmed that a large Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] cell is active in Janin. They stressed that Hamas cells in Ramallah and Hebron were liquidated in the last two months, but that the Janin cell, to which the 'Afula terrorist apparently belonged, is still at large. "We are talking about no more than 12 activists who enjoy the population's support in some areas," they said. Security sources said that the closure is, at this point, "indefinite," but Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Ehud Baraq said it would last several days. Defense Ministry sources said the closure would continue at least until Independence Day. [passage omitted]
