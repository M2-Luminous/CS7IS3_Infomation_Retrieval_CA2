Yesterday, the government approved the program. The strategic economic program of Grzegorz Kolodko, finance minister and deputy prime minister, forecasts that, within three years, rapid economic growth will take place and will bring about an improvement in living conditions. "Negotiation principles of the distribution of the results of labor" were declared as a "fundamental value" of the program. This is supposed to decrease the social cost of the reforms. So a partnershiplike salary system is being proposed through new, collective labor agreements that would be in accordance with standards of the European Union. General decisions will be made during sessions of the Trilateral Commission for Socioeconomic Issues (government-trade unions-employers), whose legal status is to be defined shortly. Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the GDP by about 22 percent by 1997. "Mobilization of domestic savings, foreign investments, and efficient management of state-owned wealth" will be conducive to that end. For the purpose of managing state-owned wealth, an Agency of State Treasury Property is to be established, which will supervise ownership of state-owned enterprises transformed into Commercial Law companies. The National Investment Fund Program is to be continued, but Kolodko's program does not include a single word on reprivatization. A governmental draft law on reimbursements got stuck at the stage of "interministry negotiations." To Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, macroeconomic stabilization is the most important thing. It is linked to the need to reduce the rate of increase of the public debt (so that it does not exceed 60 percent of the GDP by the year 2004) and to reduce the budget deficit (from 4 percent in 1994 to 2-3 percent in 1997).
