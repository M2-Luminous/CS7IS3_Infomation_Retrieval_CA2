A bill on ethnic minorities should be passed, Bogdan says in the paper, adding that reintroduction of small elementary schools with mixed-age classes should be one of the regulations aimed at stopping the declining use of the Ukrainian language. Mixed-age classes were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s, the paper says. Parliament is to resume a discussion on the question of bilingual signs giving community names in Slovak and Hungarian, whose approval is one of the conditions for Slovakia's entry into the Council of Europe, the paper writes. The disagreement over a percentage limit for minorities is the snag that has so far prevented the passage of a bill saying that the existence in communities of minorities of 20 percent or larger justifies the use of dual-language signs. This limit discriminates against Ukrainian, Ruthenian, German, and other small minorities that are most threatened with assimilation, leading to the loss of their national identity and self-awareness, Bogdan says in the paper.
