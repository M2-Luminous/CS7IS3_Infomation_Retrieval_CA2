Qiao Shi, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee chairman; Liu Huaqing, Central Military Commission[CMC] vice chairman; Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign minister; and Liu Huaqiu, deputy foreign minister left in turn for visits to Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, France, and the United States. Meanwhile, Hwang Jang Yop, secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee; Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Narariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen; U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and a U.S. Congressional delegation; Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and foreign minister; Andrei Kozirev, Russian foreign minister; and Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Hasang Hasangnuofu [0761 2718 0761 2718 6179 1133] also paid visits to China. Such a busy lineup of bilateral exchanges within a short span of one month shows China's expanding diplomatic front and that China's increasingly active diplomatic activities are yielding fruitful results. NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi's recent three-nation tour of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, the first visit by a Chinese leader to these three countries for four years, received a warm and high-profile welcome. While in Germany, Qiao Shi expressed the view that China and Germany should approach and handle their bilateral relations from a strategic plane. German Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany and China share a special relationship and could do much together in many spheres. During Qiao Shi's visits to Switerland and Austria, the leaders of these two countries also expressed their willingness to further promote understanding, strengthen cooperation, and develop economic and trade ties with China. Because of its proximity, Southeast Asia has had traditional ties of friendship with China. Recent years have seen a steady growth in exchanges and cooperation between China and some of the Southeast Asian countries on the economic and trade fronts. Thus, strengthening and developing ties of friendship and cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is not only conducive to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region but is in the fundamental interest of the peoples of China and the Southeast Asian countries. China has always attached great importance to its ties of friendship and cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. CMC Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing visited Thailand and Indonesia recently and made a brief stopover in Singapore. During his tour, Liu Huaqing met with the leaders of these countries and explained China's consistent principled stand of hoping to see peace and stability, friendly cooperation, and common development in the Asia- Pacific region. China's sincerity received high acclaim from Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. During his tour of the six African countries of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar, and Mauritius, Qian Qichen reiterated China's policy toward Africa, emphasizing that it is the fundamental point of departure of China's foreign policy to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with African nations and other developing countries. In international and regional affairs, China has many points in common with the African nations. During Qian Qichen's six-nation tour of Africa, all sides expressed the desire to further expand economic and trade cooperation. Qian Qichen noted that economic and trade relations between China and Africa embodied the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance for common development. This shows that China's policy of opening to the outside world is multidirectional and that China not only wants to develop ties of economic and trade cooperation with the developed countries of the West and with its neighbors but also sincerely wishes to develop diverse forms of cooperation based on mutual benefits with the vast numbers of developing countries. Not long after the Chinese and French Governments issued a joint communique on the restoration of the traditional ties of friendship and cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic relations, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen paid an official visit to France and received a warm welcome from the French. The visit marked the beginning of "a new period" in Sino-French relations after a difficult period. China and France are both permanent members of the UN Security Council and both possess nuclear weapons. Thus, an improvement in Sino-French relations is not only conducive to economic and trade cooperation between the two countries but will contribute to world peace and stability. As Qian Qichen said in his recent meeting with Peileifeite [0160 7191 5481 3676], the French prime minister's special envoy, Sino-French relations have played a constructive, stabilizing, and balancing role in the world over the past 30 years. In his opinion, the importance of these relations exceeds the limits of bilateral relations and should be carried forward in the current international situation. While in Paris, Qian Qichen also met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Both sides reiterated that: China and the United States share common interests and assume important responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security and in a wide range of other affairs; there are huge potential and broad prospects for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries; and that it is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries to expand exchanges and cooperation on the economic, trade, and scientific and technological fronts. Both sides also noted that the meeting between Chinese State President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last November represented a good start to bilateral relations. At the end of January, in his meeting with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in Washington, Christopher reiterated that the United States was working hard on developing major ties with China and was willing to continue working hand in hand with the Chinese in bringing bilateral relations onto the road of healthy development as quickly as possible. This favorable situation in China's foreign relations has come about as a result of its efforts to uphold a peaceful foreign policy of maintaining independence and taking the initiative in its own hands; it is also the fruit of its reform and open policy, which has brought about an excellent situation of political stability, unity among the people, and economic development. It shows that China's sincere approach has been increasingly widely understood and that its market, with its immense potential, has become more and more attractive. Looking around, it is only with Britain that we are having a little trouble. We are also willing to develop ties of friendship and cooperation with Britain. Of course we are not going to do so at the expense of principle and sovereignty. We have the desire and the patience and believe that the problem between our two countries will be resolved sooner or later as the trend of the times dictate.
