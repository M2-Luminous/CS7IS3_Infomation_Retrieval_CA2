FR940722-0-00039 FR940722-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Part 3500 [Docket No R&hyph;94&hyph;1653; FR&hyph;3382&hyph;F&hyph;05] RIN 2502&hyph;AG13 Amendments to Regulation X, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Regulation (Subordinate Liens); Technical Amendments AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments. SUMMARY: The Department is publishing technical amendments to clarify the final rule on Amendments to Regulation X, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Regulation (Subordinate Liens), published February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505), and corrected on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14748). EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Grant E. Mitchell, Senior Attorney for RESPA, Office of General Counsel, Room 10252 (202) 708&hyph;1550, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20410&hyph;0500. The TDD number is (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Justification for Final Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary, and not required, because the rule is in the nature of a clarification that reflects the Department's interpretation of existing requirements. Background and Justification for Effective Date On February 10, 1994, the Department issued amendments to its regulations to implement sections 908 and 951 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (Act). That Act expanded the coverage of RESPA to include mortgages secured by subordinate liens, and restated the Department's authority over refinancing transactions. The Department's final rule of February 10, 1994, adopted certain definitions and disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, to minimize the burden on lenders and others in complying with different or conflicting definitions and disclosure requirements for transactions also covered by the TILA. As published, the preamble and the final rule contained material that might have been misleading, so the Department published a correction to clarify certain provisions in the rule (59 FR 14748). The Department has now determined that two additional clarifications of the final rule would be helpful. Because the final rule has an effective date of August 9, 1994, the Department is also making these technical amendments effective on August 9, 1994. A longer period before effectiveness of these amendments would not benefit the public, and coinciding effective dates for the rule and amendments may avoid unnecessary confusion about the rule. Other Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule is in the nature of a clarification that merely reflects the Department's interpretation of existing requirements. Environmental Impact Because this rule clarifies a rule published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505), the finding of no significant impact prepared for that rule remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. This rule merely clarifies the applicable regulatory requirements. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424), in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 3500 Consumer protection, Housing, Mortgages, Real property acquisition, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
