[Begin recording] [Andreou] The U.S. ambassador had not yet been briefed on the talks in Vienna, so he refrained from evaluating their progress. He reiterated that the United States and the United Nations will make every effort to reach an agreement on the CBM's. Commenting on a remark that there is an impression that everything is limited to these efforts, the U.S. ambassador said he is not in a position to say whether more could be done. He said: We are applying a great deal of pressure. If this effort fails, other ways will be considered. If there is a way to implement the measures, we will try to find it. [Addressing Boucher] Are you ready to consider alternative ways and even measures under Chapter 7 of the UN Security Council? [not further specified] [Boucher] We are ready to consider alternate ways. I think it would be immature for me at this point to start addressing what those will be. The effort has not yet failed. [Yennaris] Are there any other ideas floating around, other alternatives? [Boucher] There are all kinds of ideas floating around but we have not settled on any of them. [Andreou] Referring to the Vienna talks, Boucher said we are not seeking ways to prolong the talks but ways to reach an agreement. He added that every negotiation has a point at which you either reach an agreement or turn somewhere else. He concluded: Until then, we will continue trying. [Yennaris] What is the specific aim of the exercise in Vienna? [Boucher] The effort in Vienna is -- even while the report on the last few months of negotiations is being discussed -- to try to make sure that we have explored every possible avenue for reaching an agreement on the basis of the UN proposal.
