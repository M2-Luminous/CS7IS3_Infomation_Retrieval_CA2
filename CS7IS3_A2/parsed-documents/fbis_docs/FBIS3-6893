Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), told a news conference that the results of this year's spring labor offensive should be judged from a more overall perspective. "I doubt the wisdom of picking up only wages and comparing the sizes of their hikes," he said. Wage negotiations in such key industries as steel and electric machinery makers have entered the final stage, with substantially low wage increases agreed or cited thus far. Asked about the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said its recovery will come late this year or early next year. Although some bright signs have started to appear, including the pickup in industrial production, housing starts and personal consumption, there still remain some worrisome factors, such as the slump in the real estate sector and the yen's appreciation, he said. "Transactions in commercial properties remain sluggish, while the worries over a possible spurt of the yen linger. Corporations are still in the middle of cutting labor and facilities," he said. Warning against premature optimism, Hiraiwa also noted the possibility of a downturn of the economy in the spring. "Last year, many people predicted the economy bottomed out in March, but the yen's subsequent rise pulled it down in the April-June period. We cannot deny the possibility this year, too," he said.
