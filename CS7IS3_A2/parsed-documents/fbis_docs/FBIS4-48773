The arms embargo, the last of the United Nations punitive measures against apartheid, was lifted after a unanimous decision at the Security Council meeting in New York yesterday. The council also rescinded a 1984 resolution urging all states to refrain from importing products of South Africa's own arms industry. In an address before the vote South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the move would show that the body had accepted that South Africa had become a democratic country. Mr. Mbeki called for the speedy creation of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in Africa and he asked for help in converting South Africa's military technology to civilian uses. It's expected that South Africa could regain its membership of the United Nations General Assembly as early as next month, after an absence of 20 years.
