FBIS4-7897 "dreeu067__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-067-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Coalition Talks on Senatorial Elections Fail Coalition Talks on Senatorial Elections Fail AU0504192694 Prague CTK in English 1832 GMT 5 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0504192694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 5 (CTK) -- Government coalition party experts today failed to reach any compromise on senatorial elections and will probably not meet again, Radim Spacek from the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) told journalists. He added it was now up to the coalition party leaderships to "define the ground" for further negotiations. Senatorial elections will probably be held along with communal elections in the autumn. The 81-seat Senate, in which one-third of the deputies will be elected every two years, is defined in the Czech Constitution but has not been created yet. The coalition parties are split over the method of electing the senators. The strongest party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus insists on 81 one-mandate constituencies, a proposal criticized by the other coalition parties -- the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), the ODA, and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- which say the ODS wants to ensure for itself dominance of the Senate. They propose the creation of 27 three-mandate constituencies. The opposition parties are opposed to the Senate's very existence. Spacek said that ODS representatives "will discuss any variant of senatorial elections as long as talks are about 81 constituencies."
