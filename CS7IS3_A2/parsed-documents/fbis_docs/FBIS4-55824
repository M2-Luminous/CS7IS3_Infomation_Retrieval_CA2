Majevica front] [Text] Muslim forces, supported by the international forces, are today again attacking Serbian positions on Mt. Majevica with increasing intensity. On two occasions, at 0500 and 0800, NATO planes made a low altitude flyover, a mere 100 meters above the woods, and provoked Serbian defense forces, which did not respond to the provocations. This seems to have been an introduction to yet another attack of the Muslim forces, who, from strongholds in Donje Hrasno, the region of the Stolice transmitter, and Banj Brdo, showered the area with shells of various caliber, at the same time regrouping for infantry assaults. The information service of the republic of Srpska army east Bosnian corps this afternoon announced that the Muslim forces were carrying out an artillery and infantry attack in the area of Jablanica and Piper, north of Lopari. The Muslims from Horozovina -- southeast of Tuzla -- are targeting ambulances and Serbian positions in Banj Brdo with a Broving gun. As we report this, and it is now just after 1400, NATO planes have again begun carrying out provocations on Mt. Majevica [words indistinct] did not cause the Serbian troops to waver in their goal to defend their territory from the latest Muslim aggression.
