Of this, exports amounted to $91.77 billion and imports, $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29 percent respectively over 1992. One of the outstanding characteristics of China's foreign trade in 1993 was the slow growth of exports and rapid increase of imports. Last year, China imported large amounts of raw and semifinished materials, energy, and equipment because of high-speed growth of the domestic economy, large scale investment, and robust demand. As a result, the increase of imports was 21 percentage points higher than that of exports, leaving a deficit of $12.18 billion. According to statistics, last year, imported commodities worth over $1 billion included mainly aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished oil, chemical fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and complete sets of equipment. Wu Yi pointed out: These imported commodities once again show that China is a large open market with great potential. She added that China will strive to strike a rough balance between exports and imports this year by increasing exports rather than reducing imports. Foreign investment in China in 1993 was double that in 1992, and was almost equal to the total amount for the previous 14 years. Last year, China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, with a total contractual value of $110.852 billion; and the actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was $25.759 billion. These figures were 70 percent, 90 percent, and 134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992. The investment scale continually expanded, with an average contracted investment per foreign-funded project reaching $1.33 million, a 12.9-percent increase over the $117.8 million of the previous year. The proportion of technology intensive projects and multinational corporations increased, and the area of investment was rapidly expanding to the hinterland.
