These are the little poems about a Croatian-Muslim federation on 30 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, and about a confederation with Croatia (because more room is needed), and then once again, because of higher interests, pressures will begin for an alliance with the "Serbian Krajinas" (the occupied areas on Croatia) and the so-called republic of Srpska (the occupied areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina), and since all Serbs must live in the same state, it will be necessary to create one market (probably a customs-free one), so that in the end everyone would end up in southern Slav "fraternity and unity." Later on the same thing would also be offered to the Slovenes, to whom such a solution, because of the reduced Yugoslav market, could seem attractive. The same thing applies to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], because of the growing Greek pressures. Alija Izetbegovic also would not reject having all Muslims live in the same state. We are calling upon all Croats in the world (the state-creating ones, because there are a certain number of Croats at home and abroad who have already been wholeheartedly in the services of the pressures against Croatia for a long time now) to do everything in their power in the countries where they live to finally permit the Croatian people to decide for itself on its own fate, without any pressures. That is the inalienable right of every people according to all cultural and legal norms. Why aren't greater pressures being brought against the Serbian aggressor? Why isn't he being forced to return the occupied territories? Why isn't it being made possible for displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes under international protection? Why aren't Croats allowed the possibility of self-defense? Should the aggressor be granted what he has seized? Croatia wanted an alliance with Bosnia-Herzegovina, an alliance with the Muslims (A. Izetbegovic). Neither Alija nor the world wanted one. Today they are forcing us to share the remnant of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory with the Muslims (the expelled ones and the ones the Serbs have yet to expel). We are being driven into the Lebanonization of this region. During these three years the West has done everything possible to bring Croatia to its knees (through the EC, the UN Protection Forces, and in various other ways). Now we are being forced, finally, to commit suicide. We cannot consent to that regardless of the "higher interests of the world at large." Two Yugoslavias really were too much for us. We can talk about alliances, but we have to start with the situation before the aggression. Dear friends and compatriots, do not allow the governments of the countries where you live and where you are taxpayers and voters to push Croatia and the Croatian people again into an abyss from which they will never be able to escape. With regards and thanks, Ante Beljo, director of the Croatian Emigrant Center and administrator of the Croatian Information Center
