He said that with its security in mind, the Czech Republic had to cooperate not only with its neighbours, but with countries where possible cooperation was of both a military and industrial nature, such as Israel, China and other countries. The Czech Defence Ministry had as yet not even considered the thought of possible cooperation with Chile, he said, adding that it was not planning to meet with former dictator Augusto Pinochet, now head of the Chilean ground forces, who arrived in Prague yesterday. Baudys stressed that the visit was private. Baudys was unable to say if the Czech Republic had exported any arms to Chile since 1989.
