In the morning, the Bosnian Serbs' press officer had stated in Pale that the UNHCR officials were no longer authorized to leave the Serbian-held part of Bosnia. UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond stated: "We saw nothing resembling a hostage-taking situation." He added that UNHCR officials had been able to return to Belgrade from Zeppa, in northeast Bosnia, on Thursday. UNHCR officials in Geneva specified that UNHCR had not instructed its staff to leave the Serbian area of Bosnia, as opposed to rumors. On Thursday, three Banja Luka-based HCR officials wanting to leave for Zagreb had been stopped by Serbian forces, who had prevented them from passing because they had not received notification of their departure 48 hours in advance. UNHCR added that this kind of official harassment was not unusual.
