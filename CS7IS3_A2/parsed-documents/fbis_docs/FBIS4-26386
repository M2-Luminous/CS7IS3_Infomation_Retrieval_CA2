As a leading PLA scientific research institute specializing in telecommunications and command automation programs, this institute has scored great successes following three decades of hard work in tackling key problems. Of over 2,000 scientific research projects it completed, 200 were winners of state, army-level Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards, including State Scientific and Technological Advancement Awards and Invention Awards for eight projects. The development and application of these scientific research achievements has helped the PLA upgrade its telecommunications equipment from electronic tubes and transistors to large-scale integrated circuits, resulting in the substantial enhancement of its overall telecommunications level. As far as the PLA's command automation programs are concerned, the completed process from single machine development to a remote on-line and armywide network has provided the PLA with a modern security device in terms of operation command, military training, force management, and information processing. The promotion of the PLA's telecommunications and command automation programs also effectively supports state economic construction, bringing impressive social and economic benefits. In recent years, the application of 218 scientific and technological achievements in state economic development has won high praise from both local governments and the masses.
