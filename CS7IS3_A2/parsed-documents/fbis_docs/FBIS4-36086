In a statement after the meeting, al-'Attas said they discussed the current military escalation in Yemen and Sanaa's defiance of the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution. He said that Sanaa's escalation of the situation in Yemen is manifested through the random shelling of economic installations in the south, such as the oil refinery in Aden that caused big fires to break out in it. This is in addition to the random shelling of residential areas, such as al-Shaykh Duwayl and al-Shaykh 'Uthman neighborhoods. He added that fierce battles are currently taking place because of the offensive, which has been launched by the Sanaa forces against the south. He emphasized that "the people of the south are desperately defending their city." Al-'Attas said that serious developments are currently taking place in Yemen. The first development is the issuance of a Muslim legal edict by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, member of the higher committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is the third party in the government coalition, allowing the killing of children, women, and old people and ruling out a cease-fire in Yemen. Al-'Attas said that this edict expresses Sanaa's insistence to continue the war. He said that the second serious development is Sanaa's refusal to accept the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution, citing flimsy reasons to justify its decision. Al-'Attas affirmed that the Arab League is currently intensifying its contacts and efforts to bring about a cease-fire and stop the bloodshed in Yemen. Answering a question about the extent of international recognition achieved by the "Democratic Republic of Yemen," which was declared in Aden, al-'Attas said that recognition is not the first issue on the agenda. The first issue is stopping the bloodshed. Al-'Attas praised the statement Egypt issued today in support of the efforts to end the war between the north and south in Yemen. Al-'Attas described Egypt as "one of the main countries working to achieve peace and stability in Yemen." Asked about Sanaa's claim that unity was established on the basis of a popular referendum, and therefore, the south has no right to dissolve this unity, al-'Attas said that the unity agreement was concluded by Yemeni leaders and not through a referendum. He added that the parliamentary elections, which took place on 27 April expressed the position of the south which rejects the north's view that it is the principal part and the south is a branch. The Yemeni Socialist Party retained all the seats in the southern constituencies.
