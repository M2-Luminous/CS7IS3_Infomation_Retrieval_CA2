I believe that above all, this visit marks the evolution of the relations between our states by crowning the constant evolution of our exchanges, relations, and contacts in the political and economic fields, thus, the consolidation and furthering of our bilateral relations, as well as our cooperation on the international plane within various international bodies. Second, this visit outlined the political will of the two states to give a new impetus to the furthering of the traditional relations existing between our countries and to our mutual interest to diversify and further those relations on all planes. This will is also expressed by the political document, which we signed today, the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between Romania and the Czech Republic. There is no need for me to detail the traditional, old, abundant, and eminently positive character of the relations between Romania and Czechoslovakia, or the ample history of our friendship relations, our feelings of sympathy and solidarity, which marked the relations between our peoples. There have never been and there are no elements, whatsoever, that could cause discord or disagreement between our countries. On the contrary, during the difficult, hard moments in the history of our nations, the two peoples were always side by side. During our talks we also evoked the time of 1968, the unanimous way in which Romania's people expressed its solidarity with the Czechoslovak people during the Soviet invasion and that of the troops of the Warsaw Pact. Thus, both during our talks and in the treaty we signed, we registered our will to strengthen those traditional relations and to elevate them to a new level within the context of the transformations both our countries are currently undergoing. Together we evoked the international problems currently facing our countries. We assessed as positive the cooperation of our countries within various international bodies, our joint actions and our mutual support and interest to further the processes of general European integration, and our common will to continue to act jointly to promote the general-European integration processes on the political plane, to ensure equal security conditions to all European states, and to achieve economic integration. I believe that President Havel's visit, although short, offered him the opportunity -- as this is his first visit to Romania -- to personally discover, in the talks he held with political and cultural figures, regardless of political orientation, the durable feelings of friendship and solidarity of the Romanians, of the Romanian people, for the Czech people. It is my conviction that this visit marks an important political moment in the history of Romanian-Czech bilateral relations.
