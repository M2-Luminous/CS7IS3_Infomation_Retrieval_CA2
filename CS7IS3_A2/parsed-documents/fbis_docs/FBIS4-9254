FBIS4-9254 "dreeu078__a94034" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 ANNEX Hungary Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Slovak Summit Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Slovak Summit AU2204080594 Budapest MTI in English 1753 GMT 21 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2204080594 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 21 Apr (MTI) -- In recent days, Slovak press reports and officials have hinted at an imminent Hungarian-Slovak prime ministerial meeting, to focus on the two countries' basic treaty. Slovak sources also suggested that they had cancelled the programme. MTI asked Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman if the meeting is on the agenda and what topics would be discussed. "The Hungarian prime minister has never been unwilling to meet his Slovak counterpart and nor is he today," Herman said. "Preparations have been made for the summit but the Slovak side made the event conditional on issuing a joint communique on the topics to be fixed in the basic treaty. The Hungarian side could not accept this," Herman said, adding, "the statement that the summit would have focussed on the basic treaty is misleading." "Prime Minister Peter Boross is prepared to hold talks with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik to give another push to the development of bilateral ties and pave the way for the settlement of conflicts. Hungary, however, cannot accept preconditions and will itself not set preconditions. Hungary is prepared to negotiate even after Slovakia refused to accept the European Union's proposal for a temporary water division regime at a recent meeting between the two ministers of environment," Herman said. "So Hungary regrets that the Slovak side, as they said in an official message to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, does not wish to take part in a working meeting. Hungary's proposal for a foreign ministerial meeting at the opening of a border station still stands," Herman concluded.
