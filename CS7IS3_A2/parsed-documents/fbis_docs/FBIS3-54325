A detailed plan presented by ECO's transportation ministers in Almaty last November is becoming operational now. As Azerbaijan republic and the Central Asian states joined ECO in 1992 following their independence from Soviet rule, the organization has taken big strides in an effort to cooperate with other international organizations. Afghan Foreign Minister Arsala proposed that ECO establish a center for surface transport and transit between member states. Foreign minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov said the joining of the seven new regional countries to the organization makes it all the more capable. He said mutual trust among members was necessary to promote the business ties within the ECO. Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said his government attaches special importance to relations with neighboring countries, while the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Tuleutai I. Suleymenov, proposed the formation of a mercantile development bank of member states this year. The Kazakh foreign minister said his country is to embark on its national development plans this year and looks forward to closer cooperation with ECO. The Kyrgyz official to the fourth ECO foreign ministerial which opened this morning, said his country was keen on supplying member states with electricity. The total power generation in Kyrgyzstan totals 143 billion kilowatts per hour, which he said, is a mere 10 per cent of the vast potential of the country. Tajikistan Foreign Minister Aliyev for his part favoured the setting up of an ECO financial body and said his country will study the suggestions made at the session. Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative, Najmuddin Shaikh, called for strengthening of infrastructural projects in member states. The session was also attended by Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Asymov and Turkmenistan Deputy President Shikhmuradov.
