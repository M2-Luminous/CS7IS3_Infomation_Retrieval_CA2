From 15 to 18 May, Qiao Shi, accompanied by comrades Gao Dezhan, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, and Nie Bichu, inspected Tianjin Steel Tube Company, Tianjin Mini Automobile Plant, Tianjin Forging Press Plant, Changcheng Television Company Limited, Honda Motorcycle Company Limited, and Xiaonanhe Duck Farm in Xiqing District. He also visited the Tianjin Broadcasting and Television Tower. While in Tianjin, Qiao Shi heard work reports made by the municipal party committee and government and held a discussion meeting with the principal leaders of the municipal people's congress standing committee. As Tianjin is the largest open coastal city in north China, Qiao Shi shows great concern for its reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic development. He said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Tianjin has done a good job in making an early start in opening to the outside world. As a result, it has achieved faster and better results in developing its economy. So long as it advances in a pioneering spirit, deepens reform, and opens up wider to the outside world on the basis of its current foundation, Tianjin will achieve better results in development and will be able to play an important role in promoting opening up and economic development in China's northern region. Expressing concern for the implementation of reform measures, he said: The current international situation is developing in a direction favorable to China's development. Domestically, China enjoys social stability and the economy is growing in a sustained way. The general situation is good. We must seize this rare historical opportunity and deepen reform in a down-to-earth way. Since the fourth quarter of last year, big strides in reform have been taken with the introduction of more reform measures. This is absolutely necessary, and the direction is correct. Practice has proved that the results are good. Regarding the implementation of these reform measures, we still have a lot of practical work to do. With regard to the specific problems encountered in the course of deepening reform, we should, after investigations and studies, solve them one by one according to the order of urgency. Only thus can we thoroughly implement reform measures. Leaders at all levels and cadres must understand the strategic significance of the reform measures drawn up by the party Central Committee, and lead the masses of people to vigorously push forward our reform cause. As state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises account for a large part of Tianjin's industry, Qiao Shi seriously inquired about their conditions. He fully affirmed the merit of the Tianjin leadership in attaching importance to deepening the reform of enterprises. He said: To improve state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, leaders must pay attention to these enterprises, strive to solve some crucial problems for them, guide them to compete in the market, and encourage them to deepen reform, to enliven their operating mechanisms, and to raise efficiency. We should encourage enterprises to study and introduce advanced technologies and management experiences. Through reform and studying advanced experiences, enterprises will be able to upgrade the quality and level of their equipment, technology, products, and management. We should enhance the skills of workers through various forms of training. We must strive to reduce enterprises' burden by establishing, step by step, a social insurance system, so as to create a good condition and environment for enterprises to develop. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises will show great vitality in market competition after they truly improve their operating mechanisms and enhance economic efficiency. Turning to agricultural issues, Qiao Shi stressed: China is a huge country with a large population. We must never slacken the production of major farm products such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. At the same time, we should also develop a diversified economy in light of local conditions. In suburban areas, particular attention should be given to the "vegetable basket project." Qiao Shi said: We should regard the surplus labor in rural areas as an important resource and make use of it through different ways. For example, we should organize them to build roads and water conservation facilities. He also said: The development of village and town enterprises and the building of small towns step by step will further change the outlook of China's countryside. At the same time, the surplus labor will have an important role to play in the course of construction. During a discussion meeting with the principal leaders of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao Shi said: Tianjin has done a great deal of work to improve socialist democracy and strengthen the legal system. I hope Tianjin will strengthen studies and do a better job in this regard. He stressed: Strengthening democracy and the legal system is very important to the smooth progress of modernization and the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. People's congresses bear heavy responsibilities in making laws, in exercising supervision, and in doing other fields of work. We must work hard and strive to gradually establish a framework for a legal system for a socialist market economy. People's congresses at all levels should forge close ties with the masses, expand democracy, proceed from fundamental interests of the people and the state, conscientiously exercise their functions, strictly observe laws, and carry out their role fully. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that in the course of making laws, exercising supervision, and doing other work, local people's congresses should vigorously make explorations, sum up new experiences, proceed from reality, and go on playing their role and making innovations. People's congresses at all levels, particularly grass-roots people's congresses, should make constant efforts to strengthen themselves to meet the needs of work. Qiao Shi said: So long as we stick to the central task of economic construction, adhere to the party's basic line, earnestly grasp two links, and effectively develop the economy to raise the people's living standards step by step, we will be able to gradually solve the problems we are experiencing. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, if we conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we will be able to realize the strategic objective of quadrupling our GNP by the end of this century and to lay a sound foundation for development in the next century.
