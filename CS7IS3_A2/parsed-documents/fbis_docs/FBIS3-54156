The Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] sources in Peshawar said that two Scuds were fired by Rabbani forces at Zakhira (dump), a civilian populated area between Charasyab and Logar. This place had been used by the Red Army and the Moscow-installed regimes in Kabul for dumping and storing oil for military purposes. Meanwhile,the Hezb-e Eslami chief, Golboddin Hekmatyar told THE FRONTIER POST on telephone from his strong-hold at Charasyab that his rivals had not so far been able to target his military installations in and around Kabul. He said that the Rabbani-Mas'ud forces were using Shindand base for serial attacks on his positions. He claimed that the Friday [21 Jan] serial bombings by the Rabbani forces on his strong-hold at Charasyab was not affective. He said that the radio and television being run by his party were operative as usual. A newscaster of Hezb radio and television, Ahmed Shah lost his life when a rocket hit the building, housing the Hekmatyar's own electronic media system. Meanwhile, it is learnt that three planes of Gen. Dostam, who is commonly known among the Hezb circles as Haji Dostam, landed at the Charasyab air base on Saturday. It is believed that the planes brought food and other essentials from Mazar-e Sharif. The forces of Gen, Dostam are stationed near Shah Shaheed street and Bala Hisar fort. Both these places are close to the Charasyab. The Hezb sources said that the oil supply to Kabul from Pakistan was continuing. The Afghan planes are seen at Peshawar airport everyday, the sources added. According to independent sources the commander Shura met at Pul-e-Charkhi again on Saturday at the residence of Mullah Saddiq to bring a peace formula acceptable to the both parties. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Hezb-e Eslami has asked all the Afghan banks in Pakistan and elsewhere not to entertain the orders of the Rabbani government. "The money in Afghan banks is not the personal property of Rabbani", said a directive issued by the Hezb to the Afghan bank managers. Hezb sources also said that they were giving tough time to the Rabbani forces in and around Kabul. The sources rejected the government's claim that it had captured the old Microryan. The Afghan embassy spokesman in Islamabad said on Saturday that 22 fighters of Hezb were killed on Friday when the Rabbani forces attacked Charasyab. The Hezb sources, however, rejected the claim. The forces of Gen. Dostam killed 65 fighters of Mas'ud at Microryan on Friday during hand-to-hand fighting, the Hezb source said in Peshawar. Afghan factions fought with rockets and artillery in the capital Kabul on Saturday, scuppering a ceasefire attempt by a group of guerrilla commanders, reports Reuter quoting Afghan sources. Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami party, part of a rebel coordination council, blamed forces loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani for the failure of the ceasefire proposed by a council of Afghan commanders. "The coordination council was keeping peace on Saturday in response to the commanders' council appeal before the other side floured it by rocketing a Hezb-e Eslami base near Charasyab, a Hezb spokesman said in Peshawar.
