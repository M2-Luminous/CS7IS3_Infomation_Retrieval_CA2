He said the Panamanian Government priority is to resolve the country's social problems and emphasized that a large percentage of the 1994 budget has been dedicated to the social sector (education, health, housing, and public works). Minister Mulino said the Panamanian Government feels each country should contribute, taking into account their respective human and material resources, to the establishment of a new hemispheric cooperation phase based on equality, social justice, and reciprocal respect and benefits. The OAS, said Mulino, has been enriched with the protocols of Washington and Managua. The inclusion of extreme poverty as a basic objective for integrated development and the creation of the Inter-American Council for Integrated Development have been decisive steps in the struggle we have initiated and to which we are all committed, the Panamanian minister added. Additionally and as an initiative of this special general assembly, Foreign Minister Mulino added, Panama completely supports the proposal to declare 1994 the year of social integration, with the objective of establishing social integration as a priority of Inter-American cooperation. Minister Jose Raul Mulino also emphasized to the 20th OAS Special General Assembly delegates the importance of the current electoral process in Panama, which is pluralist and free, to the country's democratic consolidation. On 8 May [election day] and 1 September [inauguration day for the elected government], a difficult and complicated transition period will have ended and the elected government will find a country that is active economically and has been institutionally and financially reconstructed, the Panamanian minister reported. He also invited all the OAS delegates to attend the elections as observers and verify Panama's significant democratic advancements.
