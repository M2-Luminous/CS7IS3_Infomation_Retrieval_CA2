Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands his remarks as a lie. Though the traitor is still advertising his "uprightness," the offensive smell is coming from "Chongwadae [presidential office]," the analyst says, and goes on: A few days ago, the president of the Democratic Party of South Korea told a special press conference that Kim Yong-sam was involved in the large-scale sangmudae political fund scandal which has caused quite a stir and urged him to make the case clear. The scandal means that a big part of some 150 billion won earmarked for the project of the transfer of the Sangmudae Military Training Centre of the puppet army in Kwangju flowed into "Chongwadae," "the Democratic Liberal Party" and "the administration." With the opposition party's offensive intensified over the scandal, "Chongwadae" and "the DLP" are now trying hard to hush it up. Kim Yong-sam, the chieftain of corruption, is crying in public for "a thorough investigation into the scandal," while covertly manipulating the prosecution to hush it up. It has been revealed once again that the "civilian" clan including the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "DLP" and "administration" is a gang of robbers. To cap it all, it has been brought to light that the second son of the traitor took 120 million won as a political fund from the Han Yang Business Relief Committee with a promise to "settle the public appeal." With public resentment growing in this regard, "the civilian" regime is trying to shift the blame for the Sangmudae scandal on to "Chongwadae in the Sixth Republic" and the blame for the scandal related to the second son of the traitor on to the former "chief secretary of Chongwadae in charge of rectification." The traitor Kim is a master hand in dodging the blame by shifting it on to others. The "civilian" regime's advertisement about "uprightness" and "liquidation of corruption" has fallen on the ground. The reality shows that the "civilian" regime is more corrupt than the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." The Kim Yong-sam group had better step down from power before it is too late.
