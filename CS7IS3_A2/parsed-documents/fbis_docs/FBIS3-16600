One thing is clear: If the second theory is true, the movement is toward the ousting of the Aliyev regime in Baku. [passage omitted] While hostilities were under way in Karabakh, equally curious events occurred in Moscow yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that a delegation of representatives of the Azerbaijani opposition secretly came here to announce the creation of a Democratic Front and, subsequently, a coalition government or an emergency committee under former president Ayaz Mutalibov (who has been hiding from Aliyev in Moscow). Opposition members think that Azerbaijan is on the verge of collapse. According to their reports, 60 percent of the republic's territory is currently not controlled by the Baku regime, while Aliyev's main opponent, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, has decided to wash his hands of it and has resigned. The opposition, however, plans to put forward their own proposals for overcoming the crisis -- by way of rapprochement with Russia -- and their options for the Karabakh crisis settlement within the framework of a general peace settlement in the Caucasus. According to reports from Azerbaijani sources, Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedov also stayed in Moscow yesterday on a secret mission. Presumably they were busy bargaining about their own political future in the event Aliyev is removed from office. Gyandzha's fall may well become a signal for the coup. So, Aliyev's fate is in the hands of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Or of Moscow.
