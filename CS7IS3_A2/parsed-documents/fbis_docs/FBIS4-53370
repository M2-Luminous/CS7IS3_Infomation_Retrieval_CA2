Mythicizing Birthplace Kim Chong-il has consolidated his position so much that, despite the fact that Kim Il-song is still alive, the present period in North Korea may be called "the Kim Chong-il era." Lately Kim Il-song himself has ordered all North Koreans to be loyal to the Kim Chong-il leadership and in response people have been continually holding various events throughout North Korea to renew their pledges to faithfully uphold the Kim Chong-il leadership. Along with these events, a propaganda campaign has been in progress among the North Korean population to idolize Kim Chong-il, highlighting his leadership capability and his greatness. This campaign for a cult of personality is being waged on the same level as that for Kim Il-song. It was not until Kim Chong-il was named to such key posts as Political Bureau Standing Committee member and member of the Military Affairs Committee at the Sixth WPK Congress in October 1980, thereby securing his mantle as future successor, that the idolatry campaign moved into high gear. Below I will examine the substance of each pattern in the propaganda campaign being waged among the North Korean populace to idolize Kim Chong-il in terms of his "leadership quality and greatness" by looking into specific examples. The idolization of Kim Chong-il began with the falsification of his birthplace. Kim Chong-il was born on 15 February 1942 [date as published] in a small village called (Vatskoy) near the Amur River basin in the Siberian tundra region. But, in the early part of the 1980's, a myth was concocted claiming that Kim Chong-il was "born in a secret camp on Mt. Paektu" and endowed with the spirit of that mountain. The claim that he was born on Mt. Paektu, despite his actual birth in the Soviet Union, is of great significance. Mt. Paektu is known as our nation's holy mountain, as the origin point of our race. It symbolizes the spirit of our nation, cherished by all our people. That is why Kim Il-song refers to Mt. Paektu each time he talks about his revolutionary activities against Japan. He embellishes his achievements with the words "the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu." North Korea fabricated the story that Kim Chong-il was born in a secret camp in the forests of Mt. Paektu that reverberated with the gunshots of the armed struggle against the Japanese. The purpose of this myth was to suggest that he was destined to succeed Kim Il-song and thus produce the propaganda effect of highlighting the legitimacy of his leadership and authority, as well as his image as the leader of not just the North Koreans but of all our nation. To back up the false claim about Kim Chong-il's birthplace, North Korea, beginning in the early 1970's, expanded or remodeled the 30 or more of the revolution's historical battlefields in the Paektu mountains and other places such as Pochonbo, Musan, Samjiyon, and Taehungdan. At the same time, North Korea created various relics to substantiate the myth surrounding his birth--the story that in the middle of the guerrilla war Kim Il-song was waging, Kim Chong-il was born in a "log cabin" in one of the numerous secret camps in the Paektu mountains, and bears the spirit of Mt. Paektu. These symbolic relics, known as "the revolution's historical sites of Paektu secret camps," include the sites of 10 or more secret camps, including "the Changbaek Mountain secret camp," "the Kowon Mountain secret camp," "the Kabaek Mountain secret camp," and "the Sajabong secret camp"; more than 40 log cabins; the more than 200 "camp fire sites" that North Korea claims have been recently uncovered; and thousands of trees bearing slogans. Typical of these symbolic relics supposedly associated with Kim Chong-il in particular are the Paektu Mountain secret camp, in which North Korea claims he spent his childhood, and what they call "Chongilbong" in the Paektu mountains. In this way North Korea fabricated stories about Kim Chong-il's birth and childhood in order to embellish them to the highest possible degree. This fabrication and embellishment is part of the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il without regard to the facts. 2. Process of Change in Titles Since Kim Chong-il came of age, the focus of propaganda has been on his leadership quality and greatness. First of all, the flowery titles preceding his name have changed. At the Sixth Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee in December 1972, North Korea tentatively chose Kim Chong-il as future successor to power. Subsequently, the Seventh Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee in September 1973 named Kim Chong-il as party secretary in charge of organization and propaganda and agitation and as candidate member of the party Political Bureau. From then on North Korea called him "the Party Center," and has used more than 30 titles to describe him for these past 20 years. To be more specific, from September 1973 North Korea used the title "the Party Center" for Kim Chong-il until June 1975, when it designated his birthday as an official holiday and began to call him "the unitary leader." North Korea did not bring Kim Chong-il's name to the forefront, however. Beginning in 1980 Kim Chong-il's titles took on a feature distinctively different from previous ones. From that year on Kim Chong-il's stature rose in terms of his titles by one peg on each succeeding birthday. In most cases, various flowery words describing the perfect features a leader should have were placed before the honorific "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il" to emphasize his greatness. The titles used in those days include: "the Helmsman," "the Supreme Commander," "the Father of the People," and "the Great Guide." Beginning in the early 1990's, titles comparable to those previously reserved for Kim Il-song appeared for Kim Chong-il, suggesting that the latter is at the zenith of power in North Korea. To give some examples of these titles: "the Leader of the Revolution Responsible for the Fate of our People," "the Great Leader," and "the Dear (and Respected) Father." The idolatry campaign under way as part of a scheme to enhance the image of Kim Chong-il's leadership quality and authority includes propaganda about various instructions given during his "on-the-spot guidance" tours as well as tributes to his achievements through studies of his writings. Beginning with his May 1981 visit to the Mt. Myohyang area development project, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il visited major project sites to give what they call "practical guidance," during which he gave various instructions. Beginning in the latter part of the 1980's, the words "on-the-spot guidance," which had theretofore been reserved only for Kim Il-song's inspection tours, began to be used for Kim Chong-il's inspection tours also. Until recently Kim Chong-il conducted more than 60 on-the-spot guidance tours. More than 60 percent of them were concentrated on the light industry sector and public service facilities associated with the people's daily lives. This, it seems, is aimed at highlighting his image as the benevolent "father of the people" who is concerned about improving the living standard of the people. 3. 1,600 Poems Written To illuminate Kim Chong-il's image as "the leader with ideology and theories," North Korea has released or published writings attributed to him and stepped up a campaign to explain these writings through various propaganda media and discussion meetings. For instance, North Korea mobilizes cadres at party cadre training centers and various other organizations--publishing educational, scientific, literary, and art works--throughout the country to organize national seminars to praise the contents of his writings in each field or sends out party cadres and propaganda and agitation functionaries to various organizations and groups at all levels to explain and publicize his writings in the form of question-and-answer study sessions, explanation sessions, and discussion meetings. The main focus of the idolatry campaign centering on his writings is the theme that Kim Chong-il has inherited and developed Kim Il-song's ideology and theories. This puts the spotlight on Kim Chong-il's achievements in party building efforts and in the cause of the revolution. In addition, North Korea is publishing reams of books and literary works paying tribute to Kim Chong-il's "greatness" and his "brilliant achievements" and is popularizing songs praising him in a big way. It is also encouraging ordinary citizens to write poems paying tribute to Kim Chong-il. According to North Korean propaganda, more than 1,600 poems were written for the six-month period between April 1992, the month Kim Chong-il became a marshal, and October 1992. Recently, on the second anniversary of Kim Chong-il's appointment as supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], efforts were being made to write literary works designed to publicize Kim Chong-il's military leadership capability. North Korea is also concentrating its effort on idolizing Kim Chong-il through its education system. Courses on collected materials idolizing Kim Chong-il are given in schools at various levels. A course named "chinhyokkwa" (short form for the course on the history of the dear leader Kim Chong-il's revolutionary activity) has been created in teachers colleges to provide special education regarding him. The following are school subjects at different levels of education designed to idolize Kim Chong-il: At the primary and secondary school levels, students in primary schools are required to take 152 hours of lessons in a four-year period of the course titled "the childhood of the dear master Kim Chong-il". Students in higher middle schools in a six-year period are required to take 112 hours of lessons in the course titled "the revolutionary activities of the dear leader Kim Chong-il" and 110 hours of lessons in the course named "the history of the dear master Kim Chong-il." The contents of textbooks include materials idolizing Kim Chong-il in almost every subject, including the Korean language and mathematics. Thirty four out of the 236 credits in Korean language and Korean literature courses, and 26 of the 169 songs in music textbooks, have something to do with the idolization of Kim Chong-il. In higher education, the History Department of Kim Il-song University used to offer "the history of the revolution course," but the course is now divided into two parts, namely, "the Kim Il-song course" and "the Kim Chong-il course," presumably as part of the effort to highlight Kim Chong-il's greatness. Beginning in 1987, the "Chinhyokkwa" course was created in teachers colleges, including Kim Hyong-chik Teachers College. Only 20 to 50 students from each school are allowed to enroll for the "Chinhyokkwa" each year. The education department of each county people's committee selects students for this course from among discharged KPA soldiers who are sound in ideology and have more than three years of social experience. In the selection process, more weight is given to family background than to ability. The first graduating classes of August 1991 became guidance workers in party or government organizations dealing with organization and guidance or propaganda and agitation or in provincial or county chapters of the Leagues of Socialist Working Youth, whereas ordinary teachers college graduates just became teachers. Graduates of the "Chinhyokkwa" course concentrate their indoctrination efforts on government employees and factory and other workers to idolize Kim Chong-il. 4. 12 Revolution's Historical Sites North Korea is waging a campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il not only through teachers but also by means of various symbolic media. The latter category includes: creation of the revolution's historical sites; fabrication of slogan-bearing trees; publication of collected legends and Kim Chong-il anecdotes; and carved words from Quotations from Kim Chong-il and inscription of his name on the rocks on Mt. Kumgang and other famous mountains. As part of the Kim Chong-il cult, North Korea has fabricated the revolution's historical sites. Beginning with the fabrication in 1982 of "our historical site of the revolution," where Kim Chong-il is said to have grown up, North Korea built 12 historical sites. They are mostly associated with Kim Chong-il's birthplace and the places where Kim Chong-il took refuge during the Korean War, where he camped when he was a student at Kim Il-song University, or where he gave guidance in the countryside. Each year 100,000 to 200,000 people are mobilized to visit these historical sites. Visitors plant commemorative trees as a token of their loyalty to Kim Chong-il and hold meetings to publish songs of loyalty and recite poems. As for slogan-bearing trees (During the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, partisan fighters stripped trees to write slogans on their bark), North Korean propaganda claims that it began to uncover these trees in a big way beginning in May 1987. Recently, slogan-bearing trees have been used actively in Kim Chong-il's image making. North Korea claims that more than 200 such trees have been uncovered that are associated with his "birth." The publication of collected legends is aimed at fabricating legends and anecdotes on a par with those associated with Kim Il-song as part of the effort to offset Kim Chong-il's total lack of "revolutionary experience" similar to the guerrilla warfare waged by Kim Il-song. 5. History Research Center as Fabricator The History Research Institute under the Academy of Social Sciences, the veritable delivery room for campaign materials used in the idolization of Kim Chong-il, is the place where his anecdotes are fabricated. This institute fabricates legends and anecdotes about Kim Chong-il's birth and upbringing. These legends and anecdotes circulate first by word of mouth by functionaries responsible for such publicity, and after a certain interval a full-fledged propaganda campaign is launched through propaganda media. Recently, books on these legends and anecdotes have been compiled. The stories titled Selected Legends of the Paektu Bright Star are full of such absurd stories as: Kim Chong-il "captured the four Taedong River dragons, which used to cause damage to Pyongyang residents, and built the West Sea Mirim Floodgate with them"; "South Korean flood victims cooked two potfuls of steamed rice with a handful of rice out of the relief rice package sent from the North in 1984"; and "a resident in a village of cardboard homes in the suburbs of Seoul planted the rice he had received as a relief item, and one of the rice plants grew into a huge rice-bearing tree, from which he harvested 10 bags of rice." "The Kim Chong-il flower" besides Mt. Chongilbong is considered a major symbol in idolizing Kim Chong-il. It was introduced for the first time on the occasion of his 46th birthday in February 1988. The owner of a Japanese flower garden is said to have succeeded in developing this flower after a long period of experimentation, and presented it as a gift. It is even called the flower of immortality. While publicizing this flower on a grand scale, North Korea encouraged its cultivation and proliferation. In this process North Korea created the Song of the Kim Chong-il Flower and is now engaged in an all-out campaign to popularize the song among its people everywhere, not only in factories and enterprises but even in buses and trains. Singing sessions are being held to explain the words of the song, to memorize them, and to sing it in chorus. As "a symbol of the firm determination of our people to admire and follow our leader, who has accumulated immortal achievements for our times and for the cause of revolution," North Korea has carved words from Quotations from Kim Chong-il and his name on the liffs and rocks of Mt. Paektu, Mt. Kumgang, and other famous mountains as part of the idolatry campaign. It is sending large groups of workers, students, and residents to the places where these carvings were done to organize explanation sessions, meetings on the sands [morae moim], and loyalty meetings to pledge full loyalty to Kim Chong-il. To cite some examples of such carvings: the words "Chongilbong" on Mt. Paektu; on Mt Kumgang, the words "Kim Chong-il, the honor of Korea, the pride of the nation," "Kim Chong-il, chuche-based lodestar," and "Dedicate Mt. Kumgang, the scenic masterpiece, to Kim Chong-il," etc. The propaganda campaign on Kim Chong-il's great successes and achievements is not limited to North Korea, but expands into overseas. The main propaganda formats used in the overseas propaganda campaign on Kim Chong-il since the Sixth WPK Congress in October 1980 are: propaganda through foreign press media; overseas publication and dissemination of writings of Kim Chong-il; naming of foreign roads and buildings after Kim Chong-il; and having pro-North Korean writers publish articles in praise of Kim Chong-il. In addition, various events are organized overseas through pro-North Korean groups to praise Kim Chong-il. The press plays the key role in overseas propaganda campaigns to idolize Kim Chong-il. The following describes the depth of such overseas propaganda campaigns as publicized by North Korea: On 5 December 1989 the North Korean Central Broadcasting Station said that newspapers, magazines, and other publications in 85 countries had printed articles featuring the greatness of Kim Chong-il over a five-year period. And NODONG SINMUN on 9 March 1992 claimed that more than 420 publications in 80 or more countries introduced Kim Chong-il's achievements in honor of his 50th birthday. As the main themes of propaganda conducted through newspapers, broadcasts, and other media, "What kind of person is Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people?" and "His Excellency Kim Chong-il, the source of inspiration for the Korean people" may be mentioned. 6. Over 400 Pieces of Propaganda Literature North Korea is pushing the overseas publication and dissemination of Kim Chong-il's writings on a grand scale. It claims that on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's 50th birthday in February 1992, more than 400 of Kim Chong-il's writings were compiled in book form and tens of millions of them have been published overseas. They include: On Some Questions Arising in Indoctrination in the Chuche Ideology (July 1987) and Let Us March Forward Vigorously on the Road of Socialism and Communism Holding High the Banner of the Anti-Imperialist Struggle! (September 1987), in addition to Selected Works of Kim Chong-il, Vol. I. Pro-North Korean organizations, such as "study groups for research into Comrade Kim Il-song's chuche ideology" and "chuche Ideology research centers" are mobilized to hold forums and seminars on Kim Chong-il's genealogy and other subjects. Some of the roads and buildings in African and Latin American countries have been named after Kim Chong-il. Most of these roads and buildings were constructed with North Korean aid. For instance, Pabo Street in (Koriberton) in Guyana is renamed as "Kim Chong-il Street"; an Indian library building as "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il Library"; and a ninth grade class in the Kudus School in Tunisia as "the Kim Chong-il classroom." Such cases are said to total more than 20. North Korea also has pro-North Korean foreign writers create literary works depicting the greatness of Kim Chong-il and other pieces and publish them on occasions like his birthday. The purpose of the overseas campaigns on Kim Chong-il is not aimed at propaganda effects overseas but rather is intended for the feedback of the "fabricated results" gained through the process of such campaigns and publicize them at home so that they may give the North Koreans the impression that Kim Chong-il is also recognized overseas as a capable leader. One thing that we can not omit in noting the thrust of the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is the false claim that "the South Korean people admire Kim Chong-il." Beginning in 1987, as part of the measures to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership structure, North Korean intermittently published false reports that "the South Korean people" also admire and respect Kim Chong-il. Recently, the frequency of such reports has shown a tendency to rise. In the past North Korea carried such reports mainly through Radio Pyongyang, a propaganda radio beamed to South Korea. But recently domestic news media such as the Central Broadcasting Station--the domestic radio station--and newspapers like NODONG SINMUN and MINJU CHOSON also have been making similar claims. North Korean media claim that contrary to the past, South Korean people in all strata and all walks of life, including intellectuals, workers, artists, and students, now respect and admire Kim Chong-il. North Korean propaganda stresses that South Koreans are saying that "it is fortunate for our nation to have Kim Chong-il as future president"-- a claim designed to drive home to the North Koreans that the South Korean people view Kim Chong-il's succession to power as an accomplished fact. As you see, the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il has been pushed on an extensive scale and in various forms. This phenomenon culminated in unprecedented happenings for all ages and countries, such as Kim Il-song sending a gift of Chinese poems to Kim Chong-il praising his own son and Yi In-mo writing a poem in praise of Kim Chong-il. In the future the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is expected to intensify in conjunction with the consolidation of his leadership.
