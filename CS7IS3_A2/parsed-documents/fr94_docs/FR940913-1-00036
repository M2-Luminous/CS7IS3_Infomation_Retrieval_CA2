FR940913-1-00036 FR940913-1-00013 Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This notice proposes regulations for ATA vessels only. Since this rule affects specific vessels both inside and outside state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. These proposed rules are to enhance certain safety equipment requirements and general operating procedures of ATA vessels and have no significant effect on the environment. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 28 Fire prevention, Fishing vessels, Marine safety, Occupational safety and health, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Seamen.
