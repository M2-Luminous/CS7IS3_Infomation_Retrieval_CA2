The new draft removes the thesis on non-utilization of assessments of the events of August 1991 and September 1993 as factors behind heightened social confrontation from the political section of the first draft. The provision committing parties to the agreement to refrain from amending the Constitution in such a way as to destabilize society is retained. However, the new document does permit conciliatory procedures to draft amendments and additions to the Basic Law in the interests of strengthening human rights and improving the system of power division, local government and the development of federalism. The new document, in contrast to the original, specifies the commitments of state authorities in politics and economics. For instance, the Federation Council and State Duma must, in the short term, pass legislation governing elections, and laws on referendums, parties, the rights of citizens to form associations, and the procedure for holding demonstrations and other public and politically-orientated events. The two parliament chambers are also responsible for the creation of a legislative base to overcome the social and political crisis, including by means of passing a Constitutional Law in the next six months on the government, a Budget Law, Civil and land codes and a number of other acts. In turn, the government is bound by the draft to bring inflation down in 1994 and guarantee financial stabilization. It will attract more investments and create a platform for economic recovery. It will ensure that the principles of social partnership and other aspects of the country's life are applied. Regarding national security, the document contains new provisions on the joint responsibility of the president, the Federation Council, the State Duma and the government to reform the law and order bodies. The draft also recommends that the speakers of both chambers of parliament take an active role in the work of the Russian Security Council and involve representatives of the relevant committees of both chambers in the interdepartmental Security Council commissions. Provisions on accountability for violating the Treaty are have been reworded and amplified: now, according to the document, the Conciliatory Commission of authorized representatives of the president, the government, the chambers of the Federal Assembly, State Duma fractions, the Public Chamber under the president, and trade unions will "ensure that the provisions written into the acting Document are observed." In the original, the Conciliatory Commission had the right to raise the issue of removing the signature of any party to the Accord discovered to have violated the said agreement and may use the mass media as a means of informing the nation of such violations. It may also propose measures concerning the political accountability of such persons "including their dismissal from office or stripping of their deputy's mandate." The document includes a new section on the procedure for signing the Accord, which the working group explains as follows: the Accord is signed by the president, the speakers of both chambers of parliament, the head of government, the leaders of constituent members of the Federation, and by authorized representatives of political parties in the State Duma, the presidential Public Chamber and trade unions "after which the Accord will be open for signature by other parties."
