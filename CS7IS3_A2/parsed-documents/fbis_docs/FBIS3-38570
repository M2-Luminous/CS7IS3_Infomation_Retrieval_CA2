A group of professional people have banded together in what they are calling the National Unity Party. The announcement was made at a press conference called here Thursday [3 February] by Raffaele D'Ambrosio, a doctor and secretary of the new movement; Franz Ciminieri, a literature professor and president of the movement; and Pasquale Ciampa, a criminal lawyer and a member of the group's political office. There are a lot of people in the country who are fed up with the old way of doing politics, the sectarianism and politics treated as entertainment, and who instead believe that politics is meant to be the maximum expression of social and economic requirements, D'Ambrosio said. National Unity has been created as an alternative to those that call themselves "progressive" and as a counter to any kind of separatism, as the real political problem in Italy is the threat of national disunity, he continued. The group's platform will rest upon the defense of the nation against international specualtion, and the refusal of state interference within a framework of social justice, D'Ambrosio went on. On the economic front, National Unity is for the defense of small- and medium-sized private companies and the defense of agriculture as an essential element of the economy. The new party is not nationalistic in a cultural sense, but only insofar as economic needs must be met, D'Ambrosio explained. National Unity intends to appeal to all the forces of the liberal-democratic pole to rediscover politics in terms of national unity and above all, economic unity, he concluded.
