The world public has again been misled, reads the statement. Again referring to a "source close to the Black Sea Fleet headquarters," I read the original, ITAR-TASS circulated misinformation on 19 May as if 1,000 special purpose troops from the Ukrainian armed forces have arrived on the territory of Crimea over the last 24 hours. The same "source" reported the concentration of 300 Ukrainian servicemen in the vicinity of Sevastopol. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service declares that this statement is a provocative lie, evidently aimed at aggravating the political situation on the peninsula, which is tense even without this, to the limit and provoking yet another splash of anti-Ukrainian hysteria. As earlier, the familiar special propaganda methods of the Black Sea Fleet Press Center, which is carrying out open subversive activities on the territory of the sovereign state -- Ukraine, can be seen through these malicious falsehoods. Obviously, there are forces standing behind these vain attempts, who are used to cheap populist tricks of the totalitarianism times, and who use them to slander our state in the eyes of the world public and sow mistrust among the peoples of Ukraine. I would like to remind you that this was a statement by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service.
