He believes this treaty "will enable Georgia to have access to Russian weapons." Sokrat Dzhindzholiya believes the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia can only be signed after a comprehensive settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, which is impossible without defining Abkhazia's political status. "During the recent talks in Geneva, only a first step was made toward the settlement of the conflict," underlined Sokrat Dzhindzholiya. "The threat of renewed fighting still exists, and the question of peacekeeping forces for the conflict zone has been raised. In such conditions, the signing of a treaty with Georgia is fraught with very serious consequences." The chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers said leaders of North Caucasian republics within Russia share his point of view.
