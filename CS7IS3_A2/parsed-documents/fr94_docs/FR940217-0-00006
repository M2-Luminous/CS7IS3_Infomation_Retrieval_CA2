FR940217-0-00006 FR940217-0-00002 (2) Reference V 1(mcg) Limited Accelerate-Stop Distance_Section 4.8 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Increase the reference V 1(mcg) limited accelerate-stop distance by 1000 FT. (3) Takeoff Decision Speed, V 1 _Section 4.7 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Reduce V 1 by the following: Weights below 330,000 LB (150,000 KG): Subtract 4 knots Weights at or above 330,000 LB (150,000 KG): Subtract 3 knots If the resulting V 1 is less than V 1(mcg) , takeoff is permitted with V 1 set equal to V 1(mcg) provided the corrected accelerate-stop distance available exceeds the adjusted reference V 1(mcg) limited accelerate-stop distance from Step 2. (4) Brake Energy Limits_Section 4.7 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Reduce the maximum brake energy speed allowed with all brakes operative by 30 knots. Verify the scheduled V 1 is less than the reduced V MBE . If not, then takeoff weight must be reduced. (5) Landing Field Length_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Multiply `all brakes operative' FAR landing field length by a factor of 1.20. (6) Maximum Quick Turnaround Weight_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: No change from the `all brakes operative' value. Option 3 Once the following adjustments to corrected accelerate-stop distance and V MBE are determined, the takeoff weights should be calculated in the normal fashion (using these adjusted data) to determine the maximum allowable takeoff weight. (1) Corrected Accelerate Stop Distance_Section 4.3 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Use the following table to adjust the corrected accelerate-stop distance. ␣ 1Corrected accel-stop distance (feet) 1Adjusted corrected accel-stop distance (feet) 1Corrected accel-stop distance (feet) 1Adjusted corrected accel-stop distance (feet) 4000 3420 13,000 11,552 5000 4312 14,000 12,470 6000 5206 15,000 13,391 7000 6104 16,000 14,315 8000 7005 17,000 15,241 9000 7908 18,000 16,171 10,000 8815 19,000 17,104 11,000 9724 20,000 18,039 12,000 10,637 Linearly interpolate for accelerate-stop distance values between those shown. (2) Reference V 1(mcg) Limited Accelerate-Stop Distance_Section 4.8 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Increase the reference V 1(mcg) limited accelerate-stop distance by 500 FT. If V 1 is less than V 1(mcg) , takeoff is permitted with V 1 set equal to V 1(mcg) provided the corrected accelerate-stop distance available exceeds this adjusted reference V 1(mcg) limited accelerate-stop distance. (3) Brake Energy Limits_Section 4.7 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Use the following table to adjust the maximum brake energy speed allowed with all brakes operative after correcting for runway slope and wind. ␣ 1All brake op V MBE _KIAS 1Adjusted V MBE _KIAS 1All brake op V MBE _KIAS 1Adjusted V MBE _KIAS 100 84.2 170 141.4 110 92.4 180 149.6 120 100.6 190 157.8 130 108.7 200 166.0 140 116.9 210 174.2 150 125.1 220 182.3 160 133.3 Linearly interpolate for V MBE values between those shown.

(5) Maximum Quick Turnaround Weight_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: No change from the `all brakes operative' value.'' (g) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (h) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (i) The actions shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994; Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0125, dated November 11, 1993; and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51, as of February 18, 1994 (59 FR 5074, February 3, 1994). Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register , 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (j) This amendment becomes effective on February 18, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on February 10, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3581 Filed 2&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
