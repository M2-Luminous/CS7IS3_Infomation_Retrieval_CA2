[passage omitted] Tomorrow, Friday [17 June], Prime Minister Jacques Santer, in his capacity as the person responsible for forming the government, will submit an interim report to the grand duke on the political development following the elections on 12 June, after which the first coalition negotiations are likely to take place as early as Saturday morning, the day after tomorrow. They will be conducted swiftly and completed toward the middle of July. To this end, and in order to prevent any delays, working groups are to be used to deal with various matters if no ordinary meetings can take place next week because of the national holiday in Luxembourg and the European summit meeting on 24 and 25 June on the island of Corfu in which both Prime Minister Jacques Santer and Foreign Minister Jacques Poos will take part.
