[Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] At the request of a section of deputies, the Duma's Committees on International Affairs, Security, and Defense will today report to the lower house on the situation that has developed over the Crimea. A substantial proportion of the Duma's session was taken up with a debate on a draft resolution setting up parliament's own TV and radio service. Diametrically opposed points of view were expressed during the debate. Russia's Choice deputies pointed out the similarity between the new TV and radio service and the former Supreme Soviet's Parliamentary Hour. The Democratic Party, the Communists, the Agrarians, and Liberal Democrats, on the other hand, said that the Duma should refuse outright to grant interviews to the Russian TV and Radio Company and deprive it of Duma accreditation. The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] group walked out en masse during the morning session. Explaining the reasons for this decision, its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said: [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] For six months now the LDPR, the party, its leader, the group and the deputies, the entire State Duma, and the activities of the supreme legislative body have been subjected to a stream of lies and slander. It is not just a question of [words indistinct] Svanidze. We are not bothered by [word indistinct] as a person. It is the position of Russian television and the mass media. The LPDR group cannot put up with this any longer. These are (?unacceptable) lies. So, we will take a range of steps. [end recording] [Vishnevskaya] The first of these measures was the boycott of the Duma session. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's move succeeded, it has to be said. In the absence of a quorum the session was broken off at midday. [Vykhukholev] The meeting of the lower house resumed at 1600. You will hear the details in our next newscast.
