At this meeting the NATO foreign ministers discussed various issues faced by this treaty. One of the most important issues which was discussed was Russia's cooperation with NATO. Based on the final statement of this meeting, NATO's foreign ministers agreed to have closer ties with Russia. However, by announcing their (?definite terms they) rejected some of Russia's demands, including having a special status in return for the West's military coalition. The Russian officials insist on having special relations with NATO which reflect the situation of that country as a major power in the world. To this end Moscow has called for the formation of a consultative system on every issue which comes up urgently. In addition, Moscow has called for cooperation among the members of NATO in the former Warsaw and the Soviet republics. [sentence as heard] This cooperation is carried out in the form of an independent organization which is charged with common politico-military cooperation to stop armed clashes. In return NATO members have announced readiness for unofficial talks with Russia. However, since they do not want all NATO operations to be supervized by Russia they have opposed Moscow's proposal on authorizing Russia to take part in NATO's internal talks. Political analysts believe since Russia knows that the main objective behind participation (?in the) peace plan, which has been brought up by the United States, is to create a security belt around Russia so as to make necessary preparations against Russia's probable danger in case communists come to power again. Although Russia considers this plan as against its national security it is forced to join it to maintain its influence in the East and in the former Soviet republics, for the East European countries have voluntarily joined this plan, and even if Russia opposes it these European countries will not change their decisions. Therefore, Moscow, by taking part in the peace plan, tries to push the programs of this plan toward a direction which does not endanger Russia's interests at least. The NATO foreign ministers too are quite aware of this viewpoint. Hence by accepting some of Russia's demands they oppose those proposals by Moscow which can create problems for the future of the NATO.
