Akchurin: "What Is the Cost of Opium for the People Today?"] [Text] Osh Oblast--A group of police officials from the CIS republics, Central Asian republics primarily, recently traveled across the ocean to visit their American colleagues. They were not simply guests, however, and were attending an international seminar organized by the United States Department of Justice on the war against drugs. The hosts had gone to considerable expense here. And "our people" were curious to find out from them: Why? What is this to you? The answer was completely pragmatic: "It is more beneficial to us," the Americans explained, "to teach you how to properly fight this plague in your own territory, before it comes crashing down on us." The organizers of the seminar were not exaggerating the scope of the danger. Experts have already seized narcotics prepared from "our" drug raw material in Washington and Los Angeles. As far as hemp alone is concerned--known to Americans as "marijuana"--there is enough in the sadly renowned Chu Valley to get millions of people hooked! It is not for naught that the ancient healers of the East believed that a single herb could be both medicine and poison. And there is a great deal of it growing on the slopes of Pamir and Tian-Chan. The opium poppy is widely known, for example. Or the less well-known, inconspicuous grass from which drug specialists have recently become good at quickly and simply extracting narcotics with an almost instantaneous habit-forming effect... For Tajikistan, which has suffered so much, the drug business today constitutes a "second front." And it is still not known which enemy is more terrible. At the very least doctors assert that drugs may be taking more human lives than bullets in the warring republic. Perhaps the saddest thing is the fact that many Tajiks, people from Gornyy Badakhshan in particular, are entirely unaware that they are involved in a deadly trade. After all, they say, they used to smoke opium. But whereas they used to smoke "for pleasure," today they are engaged in the extraction and resale of drugs for one reason only--to make their livelihood. Incidentally, the highest people in the drug business almost never smoke themselves--a clear head is required to achieve their aims. Mafia groups obtain weapons, gold, and foodstuffs in short supply in exchange for drugs. In Khorog they ferry girls and sell children to mujahidin for opium from Afghanistan. In their pursuit of big money, the narcomafia will resort to anything, even including armed conflict. What was a small drug flow stream, alas, is gathering the force of a mud torrent, a very alarming phenomenon, and is pouring through a single mountain corridor--the Khorog-Osh road. Simple mountain dwellers are being dragged into the criminal trade, people who today do not have anything to live on. "The absence of sociopolitical regulation and inability of the central authorities to control the situation in the localities are creating ideal conditions for a prosperous drug trade," states Colonel A. Orozov, head of the National Security Directorate for Osh Oblast. "Afghan peasants are refusing to grow anything except the opium poppy, which affords a fantastic profit. Understanding the danger that is emanating from its neighbors, Iran is prepared to build a virtual `Great Wall of China' along its border, and has allocated millions in appropriations to fight this evil. Military operations have impeded drug passage in the direction of Dushanbe. So there remains only the road to Osh for the marketing of narcotics. Available current-operations data indicate that along the border with Gornyy Badakhshan, eight tonnes of raw opium are awaiting transfer across the Pamirs to Osh." "We must not lose sight of the premises that created the conditions for trade development," Colonel Orozov continues. "Many people in Gornyy Badakhshan have no opportunity to find work." At the June session of the Gornyy Badakhshan Oblast Soviet, one woman--a people's deputy--stated from the floor of the chamber that she had been forced to engage in the resale of narcotics since she was entirely unable to feed her large family. Local residents buy opium at R100 per gram and sell it for R500. In Osh they are "driving up" the price of the dangerous plant to R1,500. This figure is doubled or tripled in the near and far abroad. Osh is being transformed into a powerful drug center. But the men from Khorog openly admit that they have lost the battle with the drug mafia and are now placing all their hopes in collective counteraction on the part of near and far neighbors. Is such counteraction possible? The judgments of our recent past are becoming ever more unflattering. But even our former ideological enemies, now our partners, admit: The Soviet state kept its borders so tightly sealed that passage of the "white product" was virtually reduced to naught. Drugs used to circumvent one-sixth of the Earth's surface. Today the situation has changed. According to Interpol data, Colombian drugs have already blazed a trail to Europe across the vital border of the CIS. And indeed, they have enough problems even as far as their own "home-grown" sources are concerned. At a regional seasonal conference of specialists in the war against the drug mafia and drug trade out of the Central Asian republics held in Dzhambul (Kazakhstan), representatives from Tajikistan asserted that the flow of drugs has increased through their sector of the border. There you get a truck load of food for 10 kilograms of opium. And just try to interfere when transportation of the product across the border is carried out under cover of fire from arms on the other side. The bygone days of protection of Soviet borders was only bad in that all of us together and each of us individually now find ourselves unprepared to defend ourselves against a well organized and experienced enemy--the drug trade. Special subdivisions in Kazakhstan, for example, engaged in patrolling the above-mentioned Chu Valley, are suffering from elementary problems: insufficient supply of binoculars, night-vision devices, handcuffs (!), means of transportation, and fuel. Worst of all is the fact that it is sometimes the law itself that stands in the way of safeguarding the law. Throughout the civilized world there exists the concept of "shipments under surveillance." When they obtain drug-related information, experts in the war against drugs do not rush to catch criminals red-handed. It is important to follow the entire chain of movement of the "white death"--to where it is headed, for whom it is intended. But the procuracy in Kazakhstan prohibits such action, considering it provocative. "As a result we content ourselves with catching the little fish, while the sharks of the drug trade remain lurking in the shadows," admits A. Vyborov, chief of the department for fighting the illegal drug trade of the Kazakhstan Ministry of Internal Affairs. In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, although a national program has been adopted to fight the drug mafia, the lack of qualified cadre and shortages of technical assets and financing remain a serious problem. Perhaps only in the Republic of Uzbekistan have they been able to mobilize force against this phenomenon, where President I. Karimov has long and persistently been addressing from every forum--including the United Nations--the formidable danger of a wave of narcotics across Central Asia. Those who make superficial judgments from afar as to the causes and consequences of the Tajik conflict should now ponder a response to the question: What is the cost of opium for the people today? After all, the Pamirs are far closer to Moscow and the outskirts of the CIS than they are to Los Angeles.
