Moscow does not want to paint a gloomy picture. Foreign Minister Kozyrev, with whom I spoke on Friday, stressed the importance of supporting the strategic partnership with the West, including in resolving the Bosnian problems. Evidently he will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the second half of March - it is unlikely it can be managed earlier - to discuss how that can best be achieved. However, the Foreign Ministry's attitude to the NATO ultimatums is unequivocal. Their time has passed and if they are put forward once again with regard to one or another of the warring sides in Bosnia without consultation with Russia that will be simply a farce. The Kremlin is reacting calmly to the fact that some G-7 caricaturists have returned to the image of the Russian Bear. Both Yeltsin and Kozyrev state with satisfaction: A Bosnian settlement is not possible without Russia. Will their opponents, who earlier demanded the resignation of the head of the Foreign Ministry practically every week, get into parliament? However, nervousness has arisen in relations between Moscow and Washington, which obviously was not prepared for decisive Russian diplomacy. At least, many have formed the impression that the fuss which arose around the Ames couple in the United States was whippped up not in the least because Russia's excessive independence on the Bosnia issue was not to everybody's liking. [Begin Kozyrev recording] It is difficult to get away from the impression that what we're dealing with are attempts by certain circles to provoke a kind of exacerbation, on the one hand, to cast suspicion on Sarajevo, on the other hand -- I have to say, on the whole, that in the United States, and in our country, Russia, too, there are numerous examples of that -- the partnership between the two great powers is not to everybody's liking. Therefore, I think that it is difficult to get away from the impression that it's a provocation we are dealing with. [end recording]
