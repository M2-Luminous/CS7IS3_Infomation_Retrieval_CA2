Kansi is one of the `10 most wanted' people in the United States. This correspondent, who happened to be in Sehwan for a visit, saw a strange, clean-shaven, fair and tall person and recognised him immediately as Aimal Kansi. Pictures of Kansi have appeared on wanted posters all over the world. However, neither this correspondent not Kansi introduced themselves to each other. Between puffs of hashish, the person who stared at the Indus Hotel of Sehwan, where the shrine of Qalandar Lal Shahbaz and a "Kafi" of a Pashtoon Seth (businessman) are situated, said that he was on a visit to the shrine of the Sufi mystic. He said that he was in the transport businesses in Karachi, however, he refused to give his residential address in that city. "The whole world is my home," he said when asked about his permanent abode. Speaking in pidgin Urdu and occasionally in fluent English, Kansi said that his original village was near Zhob in Balochistan but he had spent most of his life in the United States of America and Germany. After the firing incident, the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had recovered an AK-47 assault rifle from an apartment where Kansi used to live with his friends. The FBI report said the rifle was the same as that used in the shooting. The report also stated that Kansi had no criminal record and that his neighbours generally thought him to be a normal person who posed no threat to anyone. The Fairfax Country Police of Virginia and the FBI had issued warrants against Kansi, after the firing, charging with the shooting on January 25 that occurred during the morning rush hour traffic just outside the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Two CIA personnel were killed and three others were injured in the bizarre shooting for which no motive has been established. In February last year a team of the FBI had come to Pakistan and raided, alongwith Pakistani officials, some of the houses of the people who belonged to the Kansi tribe of Quetta in an attempt to arrest the accused. The raids, however, failed as the family informed the officials that Kansi had left for the US a couple of days back. The manhunt for Kansi led to a dead-end. Finally the US authorities placed a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Mir Aimal Kansi. "I was operated upon twice in the States because of excessive drinking. That is why I have given up alcohol," Kansi said, surrounded by some of the Malangs (spiritually intoxicated followers) of Sher Baaz Qalandar, who were sharing [word indistinct] of hashish, Kansi showed me his [word indistinct] and said, "I was, first, comforted with hashish in Germany by my girlfriend and since then I feel that anybody who does not experience the joy of smoking hashish cannot enjoy life." Thick clouds of smoke swirled around his tough face. "This person takes hashish worth Rs [Rupees] 100 daily. said a bearer of the hotel about Kansi, when asked how much, approximately, hashish he took in a day. Kansi also said that his father was an army officer "But now I am all alone." When he was very high Kansi opened up and displayed his feelings. he laughingly requested: "My friends, now I feel very alone. Please made arrangements for my wedding." A servant at the hotel told THE NEWS that the person, we were talking about, did not meet anybody during his week-long stay in Sehwan. "I visit the shine of the Qalandar because I feel a certain peace there. I have hashish and Khang with the Malangs sitting inside the shrine," Kansi said. He, however avoided any other discussion about the United States other than references to his girl-friends and hashish smoking. This correspondent also did not show any eagerness about anything because this could have led to some suspicion or the part of Kansi. Kansi was very impressed by the quality of the hashish available in Sehwan. "If you guys were in Germany with this quality of hashish, I swear, the girls would be crazy about you." After this chance encounter with Kansi, he disappeared from the hotel and the town. Despite efforts by this correspondent to trace him again he was never seen in the vicinity of the town. Aimal Kansi had gone to the US from Pakistan and was working as courier with a private company. A recent report from Bangkok also said that the police's special branch teams had received information from Washington that Kansi, had slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide in the network of guerillas and criminal gangs operating from there. The Thai police, on the information, have circulated wanted posters for the arrest of three men -- Kansi, Mohammad Farooq and Ramsi Ahmad Yusuf. The latter two are suspects in the World Trade Centre bombing case. The wanted posters offer two million US dollars for the information leading the arrest of suspects.
