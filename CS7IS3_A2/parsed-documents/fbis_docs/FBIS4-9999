He stated that in a move to overcome the economic crisis that is weighing heavily on the island, Fidel Castro's administration will not "impose limitations" on the entry of foreign capital. During a news conference Robaina pointed out that "our visit to Uruguay, as the first leg of a tour of the region, seeks to explain to Latin American rulers the reality of the Cuban situation and to announce the opening of our market to foreign capital." Robaina acknowledged that the economic and social deterioration confronting Cuba has obliged its rulers to seek a way out by "implementing an open market policy and accepting that foreign capital--regardless of its origin--can invest in our country free from any constraints." The Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Montevideo on 4 April for a three-day official visit, was received by President Luis Alberto Lacalle at his private residence. They held a 30-minute talk. Robaina said: "We discussed several subjects of Latin American interest, laying special emphasis on the reality that we Cubans are living through at present and on the possibility of enhancing bilateral trade." Trade between Uruguay and Cuba is paralyzed due to the fact that the Castro administration has a $30 million debt with Uruguay that has been outstanding for four years. Robaina offered to repay this debt by "sending medicines and medical equipment" to Uruguay. The young foreign minister said that "the most promising sectors for those investors who are interested in coming to Cuba are tourism, biotechnology, and agriculture." Following his meeting with Lacalle, Robaina had luncheon with Liber Seregni, the leader of the leftist coalition, the Broad Front, and then had a meeting with Cubans residing in Uruguay. The Cuban foreign minister's agenda also includes a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu on 5 April. On the last day of his visit Robaina will deliver a speech before representatives from the 11 countries that make up the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), which is headquartered in Montevideo. Cuban Embassy spokesmen have reported that Robaina's tour, which started in Uruguay, will also include visits to Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay.
