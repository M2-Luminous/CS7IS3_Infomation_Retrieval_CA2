Yesterday the constitutionalists consulted by [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi gave the go-ahead: If he so desires, Gianni Letta can follow him to the Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]. Such a role seems ideally suited to Berlusconi's top adviser, the man who virtually taught him politics and who followed and held meetings with all national leaders. Berlusconi wants him at all costs: He trusts Letta, knows his working timetable (every day from 0800 hours until late in the evening, skipping breakfast in order to make telephone calls) and his total commitment. Letta will work at the Prime Minister's Office together with spokesman Antonio Tajani. They will be flanked by two deputy leaders -- the National Alliance's Giuseppe Tatarella and the League's Roberto Maroni. However, it is not yet clear whether the League will be satisfied with responsibility for the secret services and federalism: It is possible that Maroni (like Claudio Martelli before him) will demand and secure a prominent ministry for himself. It will be a three-headed government, a government led by a businessman who has already revealed his allergy to the slow pace of bureaucracy. A government whose absolute priority is to get rid of all previous ministers and to reshuffle hundreds of bureaucrats and officials, perhaps as many as a thousand. Assuming it goes ahead, this operation will require a task force, a front firing line to deal with the many difficulties, the innumerable traps that exist in the Rome administration. Forza Italia's leader is pondering all this, very anxious about having to use so many newcomers. For instance, he wants to give further thought to his choice of parliamentary group leaders. Until the government is formed, Cesare Previti will lead the Senate group, while it has been decided to appoint a temporary leader to the lower house for a three-month trial period, after which a final decision will be reached. Two names are being mentioned -- Vittorio Dotti, the attorney (though he may be given a government post) and Pietro Di Muccio. The latter has been a senior Senate official and is well acquainted with parliamentary rules. Berlusconi's dream is to appoint his two lawyers to two very prominent posts -- Previti to the Interior Ministry and Dotti to the Justice Ministry. However, the National Alliance seems unenthusiastic and has ruled out the granting of both the Interior and the Justice Ministries to the same party. Forza Italia also plans to assign a key role to political scientist Giuliano Urbani, maybe the Ministry for Relations with Parliament and Institutional Reforms (merging two portfolios), though this post could also go to Francesco D'Onofrio (who is also in the running, albeit unenthusiastically, for one of the four deputy speakerships of the lower house). But Berlusconi's secret trump card is the creation of an economic superministry, by merging the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a position made to measure for Lamberto Dini, Director General of the Bank of Italy. Failing any last-minute surprises, the Foreign Ministry will go to Antonio Martino (Giovanni Spadolini is unlikely to be brought back). One strange fact emerging from remarks by all four representatives of the pole for freedom is that there is one post in the next government that nobody wants -- the Labor Ministry. To meet the promise to find a million new jobs is something that frightens even the "newcomers." We shall see who comes forward. The former Christian democrats of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] have set their sights on two important ministries: the Defense Ministry for Clemente Mastella, who was under secretary for four years, and the Ministry of Posts for Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli. Gianfranco Fini, however, having secured the deputy premiership for his trusted Tatarella, will put forward Publio Fiori for the Health Ministry and Domenico Fisichella for the Education Ministry. The League would like to appoint Deputy for Brescia Vito Gnutti to the Industry Ministry and Giancarlo Pagliarini to the Finance Ministry. (The latter has said: "I will go where I can do a job that I know how to do -- accounting.") But the Finance Ministry could also be given to a Pact member such as Giulio Tremonti if negotiations between the prospective premier and the Popular Party prove successful. No decision has yet been reached on the Family Ministry; until yesterday the candidates were Alberto Michelini and Roberto Formigoni, though it could also go to someone outside parliament if, as seems likely, the Popular Party defers a decision until after its congress. Though Vittorio Sgarbi is rumored to have put himself forward for the Cultural Heritage Ministry, it is not yet clear what role will be played by Liberals Alfredo Biondi and Raffaele Costa. Some would like to appoint Costa deputy lower house speaker, together with the National Alliance's Adriana Poli Bortone (who is already assured of the post), while others take it for granted that Biondi will be appointed chairman of the lower house Foreign Affairs Committee. The pole has made official its nominations for the two deputy speakerships of the Senate: the National Alliance's Romano Misserville and the League's Marcello Staglieno. The lower house and the Senate will have two deputy speakers chosen by the opposition, by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the Popular Party, respectively. All elections in parliament have been deferred until 21 April, while the race for the committee begins at 1600 hours today, and of course those excluded from this first round can still hope for a ministerial post.
