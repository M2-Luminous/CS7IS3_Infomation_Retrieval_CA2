He explained his decision by saying that he undertook this task at the request of the Antall government three years ago, and this period ended with the elections. The foreign minister has accepted his resignation, which will therefore take effect from 5 July. According to the cabinet chief of the foreign minister, a decision of this kind by a leading diplomat is not an extraordinary event in a well-functioning bourgeois democracy. This can even be described as an elegant step. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not aware of any similar move being considered by other diplomats.
