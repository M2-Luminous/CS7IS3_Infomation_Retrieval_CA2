FBIS4-21325 "jptdd018___94083" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 26 April 1994 WEST EUROPE DENMARK Narcotics Roundup for 23 March-10 April Narcotics Roundup for 23 March-10 April 94P20664A 94P20664A CSO [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of narcotics reports from the Danish press from 23 March through 10 April. Police seized drugs, precursor chemicals, and two pistols in a raid on an amphetamines factory in the Zealand Island city of Roskilde on 23 March, following an investigation that began last fall. So far, 11 persons have been arrested. "Many of those charged have especially close ties to known rocker [motorcycle] groups in the Copenhagen area," according to a police official. In previous amphetamines factory cases, members of the Hell's Angels gang, including a former president, often figured prominently. It is generally believed that precursor drugs for Danish amphetamines factories are brought in from Germany and Poland, where they are easily purchased.

A minesweeper is joining the search for hashish dumped overboard by the coastal boat Hela on 3 April as police cutters approached to search the vessel off the south coast of the island of Funen. The search for Kim Julskov Knudsen, age 41, the supposed ringleader and previously convicted drug smuggler, is continuing, according to police. The minesweeper Flyvefisken was tasked to join Navy divers, who have already hauled up over 5,000 kg from the bottom of Helnaes Bay. Authorities plan a thorough search before reopening the waters to sport diving.

He was sentenced in 1987 for acting as a courier of heroin from Pakistan and was imprisoned for five and a half years.

Over 50 grams of amphetamines and 1,270 LSD capsules were found in his residence.

This problem was discussed at a Copenhagen meeting of drug treatment officials, physicians, and police. While no nationwide statistics have been gathered, the chief physician of the Copenhagen Health Department stated, "We suspect that the problem is growing. We are hearing from more treatment institutions that they have an overrepresentation of immigrants." He cited language and cultural isolation among this population group as a main factor, and urged that this be taken into account in organizing prevention and treatment programs.
