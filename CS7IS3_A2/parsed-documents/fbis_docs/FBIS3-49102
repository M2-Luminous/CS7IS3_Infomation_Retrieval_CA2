Where there was once a screen, there is now an altar in front of which Walesa kneels each morning at 7:30 for Mass and Holy Communion. Then he goes back up the dark marble staircase covered by a fake Persian carpet leading directly to his office and to Poland's difficult problems. Today these problems consist primarily in the success of the right-wing nationalist extremists in the Russian elections. This election result has created real concern among the former communist countries of Europe, anxious to receive formal protection from NATO against Russia's new expansionism. To date Clinton has only offered the former satellite countries and Balkan states a vague "peace alliance" plan that does not satisfy their safety requirements when faced with the developments in Moscow. On the other hand, many people in Washington maintain that extending firm guarantees to these countries could mean destabilizing Yeltsin at this difficult time and strengthening the nationalistic tendencies, or else they are simply contrary to expanding U.S. commitment in Europe. All these problems will be discussed and decided upon in Brussels at a 10 January NATO meeting that is acquiring considerable importance for the future of the former communist Europe. Lech Walesa is convinced that the future of his country is being decided upon to some extent. [Gawronksi] Mr. President, do the election results in Russia worry you? [Walesa] Yes, but what worries me primarily is the inertia of Europe, its lack of insight, its imperviousnesss to the warnings, to the threats, that were and are more and more in the air. For some time I have been saying that it is in your interests, not ours, to expand the European Community, and that NATO should be expanded toward the East. Let me explain: There were two opposing blocs, one was the Soviet Union, which has been temporarily dissolved, and the other, the West, which is not getting bigger. What remains is a vacuum and politics does not tolerate vacuums. If Europe and NATO were to decide to gradually expand toward the former communist countries in Europe in the short term, six months at the most, then the field of confrontation would become smaller. Otherwise, we are back to square one: Russia will take the initiative, it will exert economic pressure upon us and other countries that are more important than Poland, such as Ukraine; we will have to give in to compromises, and the former Soviet bloc will be reformed, even if it is no longer a Soviet bloc, and this will lead to confrontation again. Russia already has unreliable politicians who are attempting to bribe NATO and the rest of the world! Now my question is: Why did we dissolve the Soviet Union, Comecon [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the Warsaw Pact. To remain alone and abandoned on a desert island? So, if Europe does not wake up, we will be back to square one in five or six years' time and this frightens me; because I don't know if there will be another person capable of creating a new Solidarity to set things right again. [Gawronski] What should Europe do? [Walesa] Follow the example of Clinton, who opened up to Mexico with the NAFTA accord regardless of the country's level of development: He realized it was in his interest to do so. And it is in Europe's interests to extend itself toward the East, encourage reforms, and invest. I have a theory: The cost of reforms is in proportion to the distance of those that are inspire them [sentence as published]. So you must start with Poland and the other East European countries and then go on to Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. We in Warsaw are giving a warning cry. We find ourselves in a 1939 situation: People thought that the Germans wanted only Danzig, but they changed their minds when the Germans reached Paris. [Gawronski] You were alluding to Poland's entry into NATO. But one of the problems is opposition by Russia. When Yeltsin was in Warsaw some months ago, he seemed to agree, you succeeded in persuading him, but when he returned to Moscow, he changed his mind. Why? [Walesa] He was certainly influenced by his military, but I am sure he would not have changed his mind if the West had not been so lazy and inactive. In my meeting with Yeltsin I threw a ball into the West's court. When Yeltsin saw that the West failed to pick it up, that it did not want to play ball, that it was not interested in expanding toward the East, why should he have committed himself? Therefore I believe the West is to blame, not Yeltsin. [Gawronski] But this bloc you forecast would be rather heterogeneous given the recent elections: Over to the far right in Russia, and with the former communists in power in Poland. [Walesa] You people in the West judge everything according to your views and forget that we have not had political parties or democratic pluralism for 50 years. The former communists won in Poland not because they were communists but because they were more active and more well-prepared, more accustomed to managing power, than the others. They are ready to change their membership card from red to green, and then to blue and yellow and. The real question is: Will they be capable of accomplishing what they have promised? I doubt so, and I think that the parties that identify primarily with the principles that were once those of Solidarity will have the time to prepare themselves, acquire experience, and then chase out the post-communists in the next elections. [Gawronski] So, though you are worried about the results of the Russian elections, one could say that you are not concerned about the Polish ones? [Walesa] Look, I think this is be an unavoidable experience and it is better to experience it now than in 10 years' time. I repeat, those who won are better prepared. They were the only ones who could be better prepared, because they held the monopoly of power in the past and presented themselves united. They moved in a single bloc while the others argued. I would have preferred to deal with others, but I think that neither myself, nor my children will ever see the communists in power in Poland. For the time being we must use them for what they are, to reach our objectives, reconstruction, reforms, while keeping them under control, naturally, to make sure that they do not invert their course and to be sure that they respect pluralism, liberty, and democracy. Before, communism was inevitable, now it can be used even for our purposes. [Gawronski] And what about those who have been defeated, including yourself, how have they reacted to the victory of the former communists? [Walesa] Now one can see that I was right when I said not to come down too heavily on the communists, not to dig up their past, because they would only take their revenge later. I opposed putting the left under too much pressure. Instead I helped it, to prevent it doing the same thing again if the opportunity arose. [Gawronski] The pope, who has always been a reference point for you, has said that there is a basis of truth in communism. [Walesa] Much can be said about the past, but one must recognize the fact that they were times of greater social equilibrium, without such bitter differences in the standard of living. Today there are people who are nostalgic for this past. But we must not be: We must decide. The change will be slow and difficult, but there is no going back. [Gawronski] What political system would you like for your country? [Walesa] I do not like capitalism but nothing better has been invented yet. I would like a humane capitalism, that takes account of the poor, the sick, the destitute, but that also lets the rich live in peace. [Gawronski] Let us talk about yourself a little. The popularity polls are not very good. Are you worried? [Walesa] I am certainly no Miss Poland and neither am I the primate of Poland, who has no political responsibility, which is why, among other things, he no longer appeals to the people. But I think that nobody has done for this country more than I have done. I am working for Poland and nobody can accuse me of having made mistakes. As for the polls, they are biased and are not important. [Gawronski] Now you are a little alone here in Belweder palace. Do you ever finding yourself thinking with nostalgia about the times of Solidarity, your old friends Michnik, Geremek, Mazowiecki, Kuron, and all the people that you have almost no contacts with any more? [Walesa] Certainly, I would like to be 18 or 20, but that is impossible; I would like to go back to the times when everything was simple: One was either for or against communism. But after our victory we did well to split, otherwise today there would be a Solidarity party, a Solidarity parliament, Solidarity laws. In practice we would have reconstructed a monopoly of power under another name. We would have ended up enjoying the taste of power. We would have ended up with an Italian model, with an elite looking after its own interests only, without any links with the grass roots, and in the end the grass-roots would have risen against us. [Gawronski] What concerns you about your country? [Walesa] Certainly not the communists. In all my life I have met only one real Communist, and that was not even in Warsaw among the authorities, but in Danzig at the Lenin shipyards, where a worker was such a Communist that they expelled him from the party. As for the rest, I have faith and hope. An intelligent Jew once said to me: "Don't worry when things are going badly, they can only get better." We find ourselves precisely in such a situation.
