Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who handles agriculture; Anatoliy Chubays at the State Committee for the Management of State Property; and Yuriy Yarov, who is engaged on matters relating to the social protection of the population, will also retain their posts. This information was given in a Vesti telephone interview with Valentin Sergeyev, head of the government's press service. He declined to comment on the fate of Boris Fedorov. However, an INTERFAX correspondent has learned that Boris Fedorov is to remain as finance minister, while the former deputy prime minister Aleksandr Shokhin will be in charge of the economics ministry. This afternoon Boris Fedorov stated he is ready to remain in the government as long as the reform policy is not radically altered. In the event of the reforms continuing, he can guarantee a reduction of inflation to five per cent per month by the end of the year. It seems too that the fate has been decided of another former deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. He has been offered the post of minister of ethnic affairs and regional policy. So far there has been no official information about the fate of the power ministers. Most likely Pavel Grachev, Viktor Yerin, and Andrey Kozyrev will remain in their posts. The head of the government's press service also stated that the new appointments at the top levels of executive authority had been agreed on yesterday at the meeting between Viktor Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin. A presidential decree had also been signed yesterday and it is due to be published tomorrow. The new make-up of the cabinet of ministers shows that Boris Yeltsin has still decided to retain the greater part of Gaydar's government, and it can be expected that the economic reform program begun two years ago will be continued. According to the Russian prime minister, the government has throughout the past few days continued to work normally. Those ministries that have not been subject to a reorganization are engaged on routine work. Preparations are under way within the government apparatus for an enlarged meeting of the government, which is to be held at the start of February. Despite what certain politicians have been saying about the need for the resignation of the prime minister and his government, Viktor Chernomyrdin stated he does not intend to resign and will continue his work in this post with the government that has been formed. There is a possibility, however, that there could be some further consultations. Yeltsin has not yet signed the decree on the new composition of the government, an EKHO MOSKVY correspondent was told an hour ago by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary.
