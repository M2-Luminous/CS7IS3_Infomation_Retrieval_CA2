In this way, the poll revealed that the people take a critical view of the central government bureaucracy. Asked why the government has come under the bureaucracy's control, many respondents cited the "lack of able politicians" as a major reason, while others cited the "unreliability of politicians" as the major reason. Asked about their impression of bureaucrats in the central government, 43 percent of the polled said, "They get jobs in enterprises and government-invested corporations that they have formerly overseen"; 34 percent said, "They have collusive ties with politicians and businesses"; and 28 percent said, "They have a kind of privileged mentality." Thus, many of the polled had a bad impression of the bureaucrats working for the central government. Only less than 20 percent of the surveyed had a good impression of them. Twenty percent of the surveyed said, "They are excellent"; 11 percent said, "They are diligent"; and 3 percent said, "They are fair and clean." Asked who is taking the lead in the government's decisionmaking process, 46 percent of the respondents answered, "The bureaucrats take the lead"; 17 percent answered, "Politicians take the lead"; and 30 percent answered, "We have no position." In this way, nearly 50 percent of the people thought that the government is under the "thumb of bureaucracy." Asked to point out things for which the bureaucrats deserve to be praised highly, 27 percent of the polled said, "They have nothing to be praised highly for." Asked about things for which the bureaucrats deserve to be criticized, 34 percent pointed to "their collusive ties with politicians and businesses." Asked why the bureaucrats have come to wield so great an influence in running the government, 39 percent of the polled indicated the "lack of politicians powerful enough to manage the bureaucrats"; 34 percent pointed to "the lack of a mechanism under which the people keep the bureaucrats in check"; and 33 percent of them said, "The budget compilation is impossible without the bureaucrats." Thus, many of the respondents indicated the politicians' incompetence. Asked to comment on the plan for abolishing the so-called "government committee system" proposed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa ), 54 percent of the surveyed said, "We support the plan" and 20 percent of them said, "We oppose the plan." As reasons for supporting the plan, the respondents said: 1) The plan will make parliamentary deliberations substantial and 2) the plan will make it possible to keep the bureaucrats in check. As reasons for opposing the plan, the respondents said: 1) The plan will further serve to solidify the collusive ties between politicians and bureaucrats and 2) the plan will lead politicians to intervene in administrative authority. Asked to comment on a desirable bureaucracy, nearly 80 percent of the respondents expressed hopes for reforming the bureaucracy one way or another, claiming, "Measures must be taken to reduce their power" or "measures must be taken to lessen their jurisdiction mentality." Meanwhile, 10 percent of the respondents said, "They are good and no measures need to be taken" and 13 percent said, "We have no position." Asked whether the Hata government will be able to reform the bureaucracy, 11 percent of them said, "The Hata government will be able to reform them" and 77 percent of them said, "it will be unable to do that." In this way, the people's expectations of the minority government were found to be slim. Of the respondents, 53 percent said, "The bureaucracy should not be allowed to take jobs in enterprises or government-invested corporations that they have formerly overseen."
