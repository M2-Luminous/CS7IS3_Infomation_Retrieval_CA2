"I told them that if Pakistan stops supporting terrorism, then we could hold elections and the people of Jammu and Kashmir would be able to form their own Government," he said in an interview to THE HINDU after the meeting. "I explained that Pakistan does not raise the issue of human rights in international fora for the sake of human rights, but only wants to internationalise the issue," he said. With the possibility of a Pakistani attempt to introduce a resolution in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, it was important for India to get a sympathetic hearing from the Europeans, and yesterday's meeting appears to have been an important step in this process. "I think they absorbed whatever I said, and they will keep it in mind whatever decision they take on the resolution," Mr. Dinesh Singh said. A meeting with the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. Willy Claes, this morning was also cause for satisfaction. The Belgian Minister reportedly affirmed that India and Pakistan should sort out their problems bilaterally indicating that his country was against internationalising the issue. At yesterday's meeting with the troika, Mr. Singh, who is still frail from his recent illness and finds it difficult to speak for a long time, shook off all traces of tiredness, and made a spirited defence of India's position on Kashmir. He urged the Europeans to think of the human rights of the victims of terrorist action, too. Balanced Approach Kashmir and human rights were bound to figure in the talks, but the Indian side drew some satisfaction from the relatively mild and balanced way in which the Europeans addressed the issues. The Greek Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. T. Pangalos, representing the Presidency of the European Union, said that Europe was concerned about what was happening in Kashmir, and stressed the need for restraint on the part of the security forces. But he balanced this by stating that Europe would continue to urge Pakistan to restrain its support for terrorism. He pointed out that no country, not even in Europe, had a perfect human rights record. The visit to Kashmir by E.U. Ambassadors based in Delhi came in for favourable notice, but Mr. Pangalos urged greater access for non-Governmental organisations. The Minister welcomed the resumption of the dialogue at the Foreign Secretary level between India and Pakistan and urged that efforts be made to see that it continued. India also probed the E.U. on its ideas about the expansion of the U.N. Security Council, a question which is receiving increasing attention in New Delhi. The Indian delegation was informed that there was no clear consensus within the E.U. itself on the form and content of expansion. India made it clear that it would be unhappy if expansion was restricted only to the two current front-runners (Germany and Japan), and pointed out that it would be unwise to rush a decision on the expansion. India Pleased The Indian delegation has been pleased with the outcome of the meeting for several reasons. Firstly, it allowed India to get a hearing at the ministerial level in the E.U. and put forward its views on various issues. Secondly, it also provided the opportunity for a dialogue between the Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, and his counterparts from the Belgian, Greek and German Foreign Ministries. They discussed a number of substantial issues including the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], European restrictions on sale of dual use technology, illegal immigration, terrorism and drug trafficking. The Foreign Secretary or Political Director level talks as they are known were significant for the detail in which two related issues of importance to India, the NPT and dual use technology restrictions were discussed. As far as the NPT was concerned, the Europeans, as expected, urged India to consider signing the Treaty. India has been worried about the E.U. making a list of countries to which the sale of sensitive dual use technology would be banned. The Indian delegation urged that the country should not be put on the list, and said that the Government was willing to certify end use of imports for civlian use. The meeting was not expected to lead to any concrete declarations, but was only meant to carry the process of political consultation forward. It has done this and also laid the steps for further dialogue. The two sides have agreed on regular meetings at the official level on illegal immigration, terrorism, and drug trafficking, an outcome India is pleased with. The first real results of the meeting will, however, be felt only in the weeks and months ahead, as Europe takes positions on the Pakistani resolution on Kashmir in Geneva and similar issues.
