Speaking of the presidential elections on 26 June, Leonid Kravchuk noted that he is personally not against them being held. However, laws on the status of the president, on his powers, on the structure of bodies of power must be adopted first. Leonid Kravchuk stressed that unless these legislative acts are adopted, he will not stand for the post of head of state. He noted, moreover, that if only representative functions are delegated to the president, then, in his opinion, such a head of state is not necessary.
