Another two servicemen died on the evening of 1 June. Private Vladislav Maksakov, who was in charge of a border detail, was blown up by a mine laid by gunmen in the 9th Border Troop Subunit's section. And in Dushanbe, Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy chief of a Tajik Defense Ministry troop service, was killed not far from his home. The investigative commissions of the Russian Border Troops and the Tajik law-enforcement agencies hardly have time to get to the bottom of one tragedy before another occurs. You cannot help noticing that attacks on the military have started to occur most frequently in the rear services and as a result of terrorist and sabotage acts. According to statements by the Tajik law-enforcement agencies, the murders of both Lt. Col. Vladimir Borisenkov of the Russian Border Troops (31 May) and Lt. Col. Yuriy Shkipkin from the Republic's Defense Ministry are criminal offenses. And yet it may be supposed with a high degree of probability that gunmen are implicated here. The opposition has chosen new tactics for waging the struggle. Since the failure of several operations actually on the border and substantial losses of mojahedin they have switched to sabotage and terror. It is perfectly possible that the current stepping up of terrorist activity has been prompted by the successful Russian Border Troop operation carried out in the section covered by the 8th Border Troop Subunit of the Pyandzh border detachment (31 May-1 June) to "squeeze" gunmen out of the Naychi peninsula: Several dozen mojahedin were forced to take to their heels to save themselves after successful joint actions by border troops and servicemen of the Russian 201st Division. Five members of the border troops have fallen victim to terrorism already this year. Aware that they are losing support even among sympathetic strata of the population, the gunmen are acting with special savagery, deviousness, and baseness, but by no means do all manage to get away scot-free. According to the latest ITAR-TASS report, thanks to operational actions carried out by investigations and law-enforcement agencies, an inhabitant of Tajikistan was arrested 1 June on suspicion of murdering Lt. Col. Borisenkov.
