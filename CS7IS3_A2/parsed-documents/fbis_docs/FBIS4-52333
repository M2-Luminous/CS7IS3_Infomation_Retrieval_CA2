FBIS4-52333 "dreas090__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-090-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan MPT Panel Issues Report on Digital Broadcasting MPT Panel Issues Report on Digital Broadcasting Urges Standardization by 1996 942A0165A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Apr 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0165A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] sponsored "Research Council for Broadcast Digitization," a private-sector research council of the Broadcast Administration Bureau director and chaired by Academic Information Center Director Hiroshi Inose, which was conducting a study on next-generation broadcasting systems channeled through satellites, cable, and land-based stations, issued its final draft report on 24 April. The main feature of the report covered provisions for setting standards for various technical features concerning digital broadcasting by fiscal year 1996, thus specifying a timetable for the first stage of digitization. The aim of the timetable is to encourage domestic sources to embark on research and development at an early stage in view of trends in overseas areas. The report provides a course for digitization, while having the potential of rekindling debate on a modification of plans for analog-based high-vision broadcasting. The Research Council for Broadcast Digitization will complete its final report by 27 April. Already in the interim report published in December 1993, the council had recommended the adaptation of digital technology which has the capability of transmitting larger volumes of data than past systems, while the final report is expected to include government implementing plans aimed at the adaptation of digital broadcasting. The final report will introduce the fact that the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is promoting establishment of a standard for digital broadcasting with a target of 1996. The final report will conclude that "There is a need, domestically, to standardize technical aspects of the program by 1996," in order to avoid being left behind by the international community. Transition to digital broadcasting will require several stages and standardizing the technology will be the first step. Broadcasting-related industries fear a drop in sales of current analog-based products and are reluctant to assume a clear-cut stand on the intent to convert to digital broadcasting, but the final report will have the objective of enhancing the desire of manufacturers of communications equipment and domestic appliances to develop digital-technology equipment by specifying a timetable for establishing standards for digitization.
