On March 29, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend PHLX Rules 1001, ``Position Limits'', and 1002,'' ``Exercise Limits,'' 3 to increase the position and exercise limits for foreign currency options (``FCOs'') from 100,000 contracts to 150,000 contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts, based on the previous year's trading volume. 4 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 Position limits impose a ceiling on the number of option contracts in each class on the same side of the market ( i.e., aggregating long calls and short puts or long puts and short calls) that can be held or written by an investor or group of investors acting in concert. Exercise limits prohibit an investor or group of investors acting in concert from exercising more than a specified number of puts or calls in a particular class within five consecutive business days. Throughout this approval order, the terms ``position limits'' or ``limits'' will be used to refer to both position and exercise limits. 4 On July 19, 1994, the PHLX amended its proposal to establish an FCO position limit of 150,000 contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 4,000,000 contracts. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated July 19, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). In addition, the PHLX submitted information concerning the implementation and effective date of the proposal. See Letter from Edith Hallahan, Attorney, Market Surveillance, PHLX, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Options Branch, Division, Commission, dated July 27, 1993 (``July 27 Letter''). On July 26, 1994, the PHLX amended the proposal to provide that FCOs with annual trading volume of 3,500,000 contracts would be eligible for a position limit of 150,000 contracts and to indicate that the PHLX plans a one-time immediate review to implement the higher position limit for FCOs which meet the annual trading volume requirement. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division, Commission, dated July 26, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). On September 22, 1994, the PHLX amended its proposal to revise the effective date of a change to a lower FCO position limit. Specifically, if the PHLX's beginning-of-the-year review of FCO trading volume indicates that the position limit for an FCO must be lowered from 150,000 to 100,000 contracts, the PHLX will promptly advise FCO participants that all series in that FCO will be subject to the lower limit effective the Monday following the mid-month June expiration. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division, Commission, dated September 22, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3'').
