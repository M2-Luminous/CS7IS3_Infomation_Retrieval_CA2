Since establishing the refugee control system aboard the U.S. ship, Comfort, in Kingston Harbor in Jamaica on 15 June, the Coast Guard has intercepted 1,148 Haitians, according to the spokesman. Today, 130 were granted refugee status, while 347 saw their requests rejected and must be repatriated. A group of 170 Haitian boat people were repatriated today. Rothschild Francois reports live: [Francois] As has been observed, the number of Haitian boat people has increased over the past few days. Yesterday, more than 1,000 boat people were intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard and taken to Jamaica where they will be interviewed under the U.S. program of political asylum. A total of 170 boat people were repatriated to Port-au-Prince today aboard the U.S. ship, the Dependable, including dozens of young children. These refugees are mostly from Petit-Goave, Cap-Haitian. They said they took to the sea to escape the misery. [passage omitted] It should be noted that the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince, Stanley Schrager, was on the Port-au-Prince wharf when these refugees were repatriated. Schrager again announced that the United States encourages Haitians to apply for political asylum at the three centers established in Haiti -- in Cap-Haitian, Port-au-Prince, and les Cayes -- rather than risk their lives on the high seas.
