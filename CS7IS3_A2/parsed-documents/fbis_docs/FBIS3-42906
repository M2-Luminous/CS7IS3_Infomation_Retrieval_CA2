This made the January surge of prices and the dizzying upswing in the exchange rate of the dollar all the more surprising for many. Why did this happen? How will events develop in the future? This was the topic of our discussion with Mikhail Belyayev, deputy chairman of the board of Kronbank. [Talskaya] As specialists from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the government view it, the fourth quarter of last year was marked by general financial stabilization. The inflationary flareup that began literally in the initial days of the new year prompts us to suspect that talk about the beginning of recovery was somewhat premature. Why and how did the illusion emerge, which many people came to believe in with relief? [Belyayev] The arguments of those who heralded the beginning of financial stabilization rested on four "pillars": reducing the budget deficit as much as possible; retaining the dollar at a relatively stable level compared to the ruble; allegedly reducing the rate of inflation; and having a positive balance of trade. Even at that time it was clear to specialists that all of this apparent success is merely a screen which conceals the old ills of our economy, and that sooner or later they will make their presence known again. Let us begin with the first argument, this technical parameter that needed to be "run by" the International Monetary Fund. Unfortunately, the greatest possible reduction of the budget deficit was not accomplished by increasing the contractual segment of the budget out of the financial profits of enterprises. Hardly anyone can dispute this, because the numbers indicating a decline in production testify that the slump has already exceeded, in terms of magnitude, the level of America's Great Depression. The revenue side of the budget was generated with taxes which they kept inventing and making harsher. The taxes smothered production completely. Therefore, such "recovery" in the budget cannot by any means be called healthy. It is just like pouring ice on a sick person and registering a reduction in his fever based on purely technical attributes. As far as inflation is concerned, the rate of growth of which fell to 15 percent in November, this happened solely for trend-related reasons: At the end of the year economic activities usually die down; nobody buys anything in particular from anyone, and for this reason prices barely grow. However, tell me whether it is possible to turn a one-time phenomenon, whereby inflation merely took a slight "dip," into a trend and proclaim this the beginning of a turnaround (given that for two years the monthly rate of inflation came to 20-25 or even 30 percent)? January served up an unambiguous answer to this question. The exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was indeed quite stable. However, it was visible to the naked eye that the exchange rate of the dollar was vigorously depressed. This was accomplished through the fourth "pillar." A positive balance of trade was attained, but not at all by increasing commercial deliveries of machinery and equipment to foreign markets. First, this happened as a result of reducing import purchases, and second, due to the peculiar structure of exports (precious metals and precious stones accounted for more than one-half of them). We might say that even silverware was put to use. Even energy sources account for 10-12 percent of our exports. The foreign exchange generated in this manner was passed around on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange and the exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was reined in. [Talskaya] You mentioned a reduction in import purchases. However, wherever you turn we have nothing but imports here--both foodstuffs and manufactured goods. [Belyayev] This is not quite it, these are dirt-cheap goods. I meant reductions in such items as machinery, equipment, raw materials. Instead of one machine tool you can buy a steamship-load of pantyhose or a train-load of Snickers, which is what is happening now. Besides, exotic imported consumer goods are far from abundant in the entire country. Therefore, we may say with certainty that all the machinery was at work in order to present numbers in a favorable political light in time for the December elections. This propaganda technique had nothing to do with real economic analysis. [Talskaya] So, January came.... [Belyayev] Economic laws are as objective as the laws of physics, the laws of nature. They may be suppressed for a period of time, but the time of artificially manipulating them is far from infinite. Such manipulation is permissible and bears fruit if the causes of unfavorable influence on the economy are eliminated at the same time. However, if this does not happen, the compressed spring shoots out all the more forcefully the longer and more brutal the pressure applied to it. The magnitude of the shot was also influenced by the political events of December and the slamming of doors in January. Since oversensitivity to all kinds of political flareups has already been instilled here, the reverberations from the abrupt release of the compressed spring, that is, economic parameters, were stronger. This was primarily reflected in inflation, which is logical. At the beginning of the year economic activities picked up, and all the old ills came to light--the crisis in production, nonpayments, political agitation, the soaring exchange rate of the dollar. The growth of the exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was also predictable from the outset. We must grasp clearly that our currency market is not at all a money market in the classical interpretation but a hoarding-and-speculation market. It is highly sensitive to political changes and prone to panicky attitudes on account of any rumor. This is why at the beginning of the year the dollar once again played its peculiar Russian role of a vehicle for accumulation and hedging one's savings. Factors of a strictly trend-related nature also contributed to the growth of the exchange rate. Perceiving that an upward move in the exchange rate of the dollar was beginning, many banks decided to play for a rise and committed all their spare resources to purchasing dollars. In one week of unprecedented upswing, the dollar appreciated 15 percent, that is, ensured a profit margin for the banks that no banking operation can yield. [Talskaya] If so, why did it subsequently fall? [Belyayev] It could not fail to fall. Panic buying catapulted it upwards way beyond the natural mark, that is, the genuine ratio at which transactions are effected. Besides, the play for a rise by banks was no longer that careless, first, because their resources are finite and they could not generate demand endlessly; second, they began to be afraid of generating demand in principle because they fully understood that the triumphant climb of the exchange rate of the dollar would end soon and that there was the risk of "taking a beating" in sales. A fall in the exchange rate of the dollar was also caused by active currency interventions by the Central Bank of Russia, which has dumped about $1 billion from gold and currency reserves on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange in order to control panic. However, we cannot by any means draw the conclusion that the ruble has strengthened since the exchange rate of the dollar has fallen. The ruble may only strengthen against stocks of merchandise or against inflation if the latter is being reduced as a result of actual economic operations rather than due to trend-related factors. The ratio of the ruble to the dollar in the present-day Russian market is speculative play, nothing more. This should be clearly understood. [Talskaya] The sacramental question: What should be done in order to really strengthen the ruble? [Belyayev] So far we have only been discussing the monetary parameters of the economy. However, it should be understood that real money is derived solely from real stocks of merchandise, from the process of production. This is the foundation of a market economy. Of course, it is better when high-quality goods are produced with great effectiveness. However, qualitative characteristics of production are a secondary issue. If nothing at all is produced, any and all economies or reforms are altogether out of the question. Meanwhile, our reformers have so far introduced only secondary and tertiary categories and attributes of the market, whereas production has been destroyed and perished. [Talskaya] Appeals on the need to normalize production have now become a generality. How is this actually to be ensured? What should the combination of production and financial policies be? [Belyayev] Taxes on production activities should definitely be reduced. Even the volume of the budget deficit may be sacrificed. This is not all that terrible. The budget deficit does make an inflationary impact. However, if production of some merchandise begins, its real value will counter the increase in the money supply. These factors will balance each other out. Production needs centralized and preferential credit. So that the credit will not sink into oblivion through incomprehensible funds run by officials, we may take advantage of the experience of the EEC. When providing financial assistance to developing countries, the EEC also ran into the problem of the embezzlement of credit at the local level. They brought in commercial banks. First, a commercial bank already knows approximately who it can provide for and how much; second, it will see that the credit is paid back. Besides, it should also keep records on the targeted use of credit: As it were, contracts with borrowers envision the use of the funds received for specific types of activities. Of course, even the EEC system for the distribution of centralized credit does not eliminate the issue of bribes. Is this not an issue at present, too? However, in that case there will be at least some hope to get the production process off the ground. If this process does not get underway, nothing at all will. This is all the more so because the process of the movement of money--transferring it from one pocket to another from the bottom up (as we have had in recent years)--is not endless in the absence of the real movement of merchandise, either. At present, the redistribution of profits from trading in pantyhose and Snickers is nearing completion. There is nothing else to be moved from the pockets of 90 percent of the population. Please note that a large proportion of citizens no longer buy anything except basic foodstuffs as they continue to balance at the poverty-line level. Very rich people are buying, but the set of goods they need is specific to them. Therefore, even the appearance of the operation of the economy produced by the movement of money will soon be dispelled. An imitation of reformist actions no longer convinces anyone. Since there is nowhere to retreat, we will apparently have to engage in real economic activities.
