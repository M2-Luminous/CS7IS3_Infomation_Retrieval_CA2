Rice production figures this year are almost the same as those in 1991 -- the year in which central and southern rice fields were devastated by floods. The natural disasters were felt in almost all provinces. Some provinces were ravaged by floods, while others suffered drought or pests. As a result, many provinces, such as Savannakhet, Sayaboury, Saravane, Bolikhamsai, Houa Phan, and Luang Prabang Provinces, are expected to face rice shortages. As for Champassak, Attopeu, Luang Namtha, Vientiane, and Khammouane Provinces, they are expected to be self-sufficient in rice. The Agriculture Ministry also reported that this year the national shortage is expected to be approximately 299,520 metric tons of paddy or 179,712 matric tons of rice. It is estimated that some 350,000 people in the cultivated areas and fallow land destroyed by pests are expected to face rice shortages beginning in the middle of the year.
