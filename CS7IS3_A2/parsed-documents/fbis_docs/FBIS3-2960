Advocated by Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the tree-planting movement has been developed quickly throughout the country. More than 500 million people planted 2.4 billion trees last year. Presently, all the barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan Provinces have been covered with green trees. Both the forest areas and forest reserves of the country have increased over these years. China recently made new plans to promote the afforestation movement. Some 100 counties are designated as key areas to be afforested.
