FBIS4-49563 "drchi089_n_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Bank of China's Private Hard Currency Savings Increase Bank of China's Private Hard Currency Savings Increase OW0705095494 Beijing XINHUA in English 0845 GMT 7 May 94 OW0705095494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China (BOC) announced here today that private savings in foreign exchange in the bank exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April this year. The figure is a net increase of four billion U.S. dollars over the end of 1992, when the total personal foreign exchange deposits in the bank totaled 6.09 billion U.S. dollars. According to BOC spokesman Zhu Chi, the increase in private hard currency savings has averaged 250 million U.S. dollars per month since 1993, compared with an annual growth of one billion U.S. dollars between 1990 and 1991, and 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992. Zhu attributed the eye-catching growth to the increased entry and exit of citizens resulting from the country's expanded policy of opening to the outside world. Remittances from residents' overseas relatives constitute another rich source of foreign money held by those residents on the mainland. However, Zhu noted, the BOC's deposit policies play a positive role in attracting hard currency savings. When the bank began to accept personal deposits in 1984, depositors could not withdraw their money at will. The restriction was removed in 1985, and a 100-percent increase in deposits was witnessed the following year. To encourage personal savings, the bank grants preferential rates for big sums and long-term foreign exchange deposits. As a state bank specializing in foreign currency and foreign trade, the BOC now sets the deposit interest rates on behalf of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. The interest rates closely follow the rates on the international financial market. With the recent rise in the interest rates on the U.S. dollar in world capital markets, the bank has raised the rates accordingly eight times in a row since the start of 1994. At a result, the one-year deposit interest rate for U.S. dollars now stands at 4.3125 percent, as compared with 2.75 percent at the end of last year.
