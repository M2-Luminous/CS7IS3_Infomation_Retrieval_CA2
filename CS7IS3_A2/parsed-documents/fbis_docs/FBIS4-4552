Among them are the automobile, insurance, and government procurement areas that were discussed as priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The annual report has been released every April, but the 1994 report will provide a basis for the Clinton administration to compile a list of nations to be subject to the Super 301 provision it has recently revived. For this reason, the Japanese Government is wary of the 1994 annual report. What is important for now is that Japan should open up its market thoroughly and widely with the ultimate aim of turning Japan into an open-market nation in order to avoid facing criticism from the rest of the industrialized nations, not sanctions from the United States. The Clinton administration's trade strategy to open the markets of its trade partners by using the Super 301 provision as a lever for imposing sanctions has been under much international attack. Now that the Uruguay Round of GATT has just directed that trade disputes should be settled through multilateral, not bilateral, negotiations, the worldwide consensus holds that the Clinton administration's trade strategy runs counter to GATT's rules. In the United States, however, even many self-proclaimed advocates of free trade regard the Super 301 provision as a "nuclear deterrent for the world trade system." Although the Clinton administration believes that Super 301 should not be used recklessly, it believes that the provision can be used as a weapon to open the markets of its trade partners and can contribute to the expansion of world trade. It is remarkable that any nation would point out its partners' trade barriers; even if a nation thinks its market is fully open, its trade partners may believe that its market is closed. If a nation issues warnings on the possibility of imposing sanctions, this is even more remarkable. If the U.S. trade representative finds what it believes are trade barriers in its partners' markets, it should take the issue to GATT for arbitration; this is the logical thing to do. GATT is the only international trade forum that can determine whether such trade barriers actually exist or if they are based on a misunderstanding. The number of Japanese trade barriers cited in the 1994 report is the largest ever. [Ira] Shapiro, adviser to the U.S. trade representative, has stressed, "the amount of Japanese trade barriers are exceptional among the G-7 industrialized nations." The Japanese Government, for its part, has so far worked to open markets in Japan and cannot take at face value the claims by U.S. trade authorities on Japanese trade barriers; however, it is true that ambiguous bureaucratic regulations and exclusionary business practices in Japan still keep the Japanese market closed. Japanese bureaucrats, who have refuted the U.S. trade authorities, cannot confidently say the Japanese market is open wider than the American and European markets. Japan should work out its own way to open up its market instead of opening up reluctantly under threats from the United States. The government is set to map out another package of external economic measures in June. The government should map out a package of the most concrete external economic measures, both in the macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, rather than work out a collection of piecemeal measures to avoid facing U.S. sanctions. To that end, the work of mapping out the package should not be left to bureaucrats, and politicians should make decisions on their own. In any case, Japan's current account surplus is too large. Japan can no longer be suspected by its trade partners of keeping its market closed. The market of the world's top surplus nation should be the most widely open one. Opening the Japanese market is expected to benefit Japanese consumers and serve to improve Japan's economic system.
