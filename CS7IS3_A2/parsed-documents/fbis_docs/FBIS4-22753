Directive No. 31 of the minister of justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which suspended the operation and revoked the registration of all Russian communities in that country, was the reason for the above. This caused an extremely negative reaction in Omsk and spawned a new surge of territorial claims against Kazakhstan. In particular, the article of S. Suprunyuk, chairman of the Duma of the North Kazakhstan Oblast Russian Community entitled "...And Then the Nation Loses" (OMSKOE VREMYA, No. 3, 1994) plays on the historical fact that until 1921, Petropavlovsk was an uyezd seat within Omsk Gubernia, and that until 1936 all of Northern Kazakhstan was a part of the RSFSR with an autonomous status. However, specific facts cited in the newspaper--the breaking up of the republic-wide conference of the Slavic cultural society Lad in Pavlodar and the Cossack circle in Petropavlovsk by the authorities of Kazakhstan, as well as judicial prosecution and the ban on the Russian-language newspapers ZNAMYA SVOBODY, GLAS, and VOZNESENSKIY PROSPEKT in North Kazakhstan Oblast--testify to infringements of the rights of the Russian population in Northern Kazakhstan that have actually occurred. The local oppositional press has published a declaration of the deputy faction Russian Way of the Russian Federation State Duma (Yu. Vlasov, S. Baburin, A. Lukyanov, and others). In particular, the declaration says: "The Russian way in interethnic relations means bringing back the relationship of friendship and fraternity among all peoples populating an ethnically diverse Russia, removing all obstacles to the development of national culture, language, and educational system...Russia as a united, genuinely federated state which consistently translates into life the norms of the Federation Treaty...Russia as the main attracting force for the recreation of a new, voluntary unity of peoples residing in the territory of the erstwhile USSR." Against the background of these events, the formation of the Siberian Cossack Host out of various Cossack societies that recently occurred in Omsk will create an unpredictable and explosive situation in our region; the Host will soon become a component of the Siberian Military District. If emergency measures are not taken, after a certain period of time Omsk and Kurgan Oblasts of Russia, as well as Pavlodar and Northern Kazakhstan Oblasts of Kazakhstan may become the zone of a broad-scale interethnic conflict. As I see it, a way out of the existing situation is found in forming a united economic space out of Omsk, Kurgan, and Tyumen Oblasts of Russia and Northern Kazakhstan Oblast of Kazakhstan, even more so because the Trans-Siberian Main Line that connects Siberia with the central regions of Russia runs through this territory, and in implementing to the full extent Decree No. 205-II by the head of the Omsk Oblast Administration, dated 1 June 1993. In particular, the decree refers to the need to create zones of free crossborder trade in the rayons of Omsk Oblast adjacent to the Republic of Kazakhstan and the establishment of free enterprise zones in Omsk Oblast.
