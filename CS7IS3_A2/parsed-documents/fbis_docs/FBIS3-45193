According to the Tibet Youth Development Foundation, in the past two years, over 300,000 people have contributed to the project, involving one-seventh of the region's total population. By the end of last year, the foundation had raised a total of 600,000 yuan (70,000 U.S. dollars), 200,000 yuan (23,000 U.S. dollars) more than in 1992. Although the project started in Tibet Autonomous Region three years later than in other parts of China, it has made remarkable progress due to support from the local government and people. "What we gain from `Project Hope' is more than just building some schools or helping a large number of school dropouts in Tibet return to school," said He Chongmin, secretary-general of the foundation. "More important, it has created an atmosphere in which every one pays attention to education." In the summer of 1992, when the project started in Tibet, all the regional leaders attended a donation function to show their support. Yangbai, a Tibetan retired road-mender who had been leading a frugal life, donated all the 7,000 yuan (800 U.S. dollars) she saved over the years when she heard of the project. Doje, director of the Transportation Bureau in Xigaze, did not forget to donate 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars) to the project when he was dying. In addition, the project has received aid from other Chinese areas as well as overseas regions. In 1992, Tibet signed an agreement with the China Youth Development Foundation, who pledged to help build at least two primary schools and offered 200,000 yuan (22,000 U.S. dollars) each year to the region. A major corporation in Macao also donated 500,000 yuan (56,000 U.S. dollars) to the project in Tibet. To properly use the money, Tibet has not copied other provinces in carrying out the project. Officials found that it is the huge area and limited number of schools that result in school dropouts. From some remote pasture areas, it takes three days on horseback to reach a school. For education to penetrate into every corner of the broad plateau, the region has put its focus on building more schools, although this consumes more money and energy. By 1995, the region will have set up 22 primary schools. Meanwhile, the Tibet Youth Development Foundation is considering earmarking funds for those students in the interior areas who cannot afford to go to college. Scholarships are also expected to be established in newly-built primary schools to promote teaching quality. So far, eight schools have been built up in Tibet, recruiting more than 1,000 school dropouts.
