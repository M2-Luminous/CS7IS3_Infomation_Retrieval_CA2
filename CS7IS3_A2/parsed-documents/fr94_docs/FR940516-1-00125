FR940516-1-00125 FR940516-1-00006 Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because this rulemaking adversely affects in a material way a sector of the economy, namely manufacturers of small SI engines, particularly the manufacturers who specialize in the production of small handheld engines. Further, EPA believes that an RIA is important for this rule because small SI engines have not previously been regulated. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Copies of the ICR document may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW (PM&hyph;223Y), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. Table 4 provides a listing of this proposed rulemaking's information collection requirements along with the appropriate information collection request (ICR) numbers. The cost of this burden has been incorporated into the cost estimate for this rule. EPA has estimated that the public reporting burden for the collection of information required under this proposed rule would average approximately 6,100 hours annually for a typical engine manufacturer. The hours spent by a manufacturer on information collection activities in any given year would be highly dependent upon manufacturer specific variables, such as the number of engine families, production changes, emission defects, etc. Table 4.

The final rule will contain response to OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.
