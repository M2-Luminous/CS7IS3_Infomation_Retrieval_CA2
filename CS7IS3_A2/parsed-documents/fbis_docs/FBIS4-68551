Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Union of Journalists, who worked in Ostankino as head of the most troublesome service -- that of television programs -- before he arrived in the union, answers the following questions. [Bogdanov] I would like to explain straight away that this statement was adopted on the basis of the results of journalists' hearings which were held under the aegis of the Union of Journalists. Representatives of all television companies, both state and commercial, were invited to participate in them. Unfortunately I was not present at the actual hearings and did not participate in composing the letter. The fact that my signature is on it is a misunderstanding. It remains a secret to me why representatives of the council of leaders of regional television companies did not participate in drawing up the recommendations set forth in the letter. The flood of emotional telegrams from the localities testifies to the differences of opinion which could have been settled at a "roundtable" Let us look truth in the face. The state cannot continue to maintain around 100 television and radio broadcasting companies as it used to in the past. This year the budget for the functioning of television has been halved. There are no guarantees for vital funding for the future either. Consequently, ways of providing for television companies must be sought. Forms of ownership can and should be varied. Naturally television and radio broadcasting companies in our country can be state, public, private, or whatever. Something else is fundamental: How to ensure that journalists from regional and republic television and radio broadcasting companies do not lose control of the situation. We must achieve a situation whereby it is precisely the journalists who become the bosses in their own editorial offices, on television and radio airtime, and on the pages of newspapers and journals. So that they could turn from being hired workers into the owners of television and radio programs and newspaper columns, and so on. And if this is to happen, then they must be ensured the possibility to participate on equal terms in the process of privatization and turning enterprises into joint stock companies. That is why a law is needed. Yes, there is a real danger that television and radio broadcasting companies, particularly regional ones, may be contracted out [angazhirovany], bought lock, stock, and barrel [na kornyu], corrupted, and alienated from journalists' collectives. The Union of Journalists will fight against this. We consider it to be our duty to fight the ugly phenomenon of the parasitic existence, on the body of state television and radio companies, of various commercial structures, which are as a rule run by showmen. They use state television, which is paid for out of the pockets of television viewers, that is, taxpayers, to their own ends: They gain huge capital from advertising and contracting. In these cases journalists have to make bargains with their professional conscience, otherwise they would be left without any work. [Feklyunin] So it works out that a number of television and radio companies, including the largest one, Ostankino, are only symbolically "state" companies, but essentially, as the letter published in IZVESTIYA accurately notes, they are "private carriers using state transportation." [Bogdanov] My viewpoint is that the essence of the problem is not in the name or even in the ownership of the company, but in the content of the airtime. Speaking of commercial television, we do not have to explain what it can be like. The owners of such a television channel naturally do all they possibly can (though within the framework of the law) to get profits. This is perfectly explicable -- it is business. The consumer, the viewer, has the right to acquire this commodity, that is, to watch a program or not. The editorial office collective has the right to sell its output. But there is another kind of television in the world. People's television, serving the people, television as a means of contact with the people, a way of expressing public opinion. In the majority of countries it is financed by the people themselves, the viewers. People pay for using a particular channel. And naturally, those who pay in a certain way control the television, so that its programs do not go beyond the framework of generally recognized morals, and so that it is expressing the viewers' interests. For instance, in Italy there are three RAI channels -- that is the state-national television. And another three have been created by the notorious Berlusconi. Naturally, these channels are of a commercial nature and serve their boss. But Italy's private television has been forced to adapt to the best models of Italian television art in order not to lose viewers. In our country the state apparently allocates funds to maintain the state television and radio broadcasting companies. But after all, this is our money, this is the money of the Russian citizens, the taxpayers. However, we cannot control the way this money is spent or influence the content of the programs. Therein lies the essential difference between our television and foreign television. Unfortunately, Russian television is gradually turning into an arena for games of chance with presenters-brokers manipulating wads of banknotes and expensive prizes, and gaudy advertisements. This irritates viewers. We are also exasperated by the abundance of various preachers from abroad, magicians, soothsayers, and astrologers. After all, who stands to gain from all this charlatanism on the television screen, who earns money from this! There is no country in the world with such a market-style television, in the direct sense of the word, as we have. [Feklyunin] When I was in Japan recently, I watched programs on 12 television channels. And I did not see any scenes of violence, killings, so-called oriental combat, or sex on any of them. I would call Japanese television humane television activity. Although the majority of the companies are nonstate companies, moral monitoring of them by the public is very strict. In Germany, Sweden, and France television is designed to serve the interests of society -- it informs, educates, trains, and entertains. [Bogdanov] I would add that any country which respects its citizens bans base American blockbusters on television, who, thanks to our own television, have become a school of depravity for young people, a school of cruelty, crime, and bad taste. The worst thing is the pernicious influence of such television on our children. It seems to me that it is high time for the complete reform of Russian television. You cannot change anything by half-measures alone. A concept of Russian national television based on the idea of Russia's spiritual rebirth is needed. And all studios and companies, regardless of form of ownership, should build their program policy within the framework of the nationwide concept. We are proposing to declare an open competition for the creation of a law "On Russian Television and Radio." Drafts will have to go through an examination in republic and regional television and radio broadcasting companies before being submitted for discussion by the State Duma. The Russian Union of Journalists is putting forward an initiative: To create a professional television league which would include both employers -- broadcasting television companies -- and producers of products for broadcasting. Such an organization has already been created by the publishers and chief editors of Russian newspapers. A league would help protect the interests of the creative collectives of television and radio broadcasting companies and have an authoritative influence on the elaboration and adoption of the relevant law, elaborate the principles of the privatization of television and radio broadcasting and turning it into joint stock companies, and would have levers with which to control the use of state licenses on television and radio broadcasting. In the first ten days of May, we intend to hold an international conference on the problems of radio and television. We are going to invite leaders of all television and radio companies, including regional ones, to participate. The Union of Journalists plans to ensure that all participants in the conference are received and are given accommodation. An exchange of opinions will help find the sensible path along which Russian television should develop, remembering the main principle: "Do no harm!"
