The agency intends to survey existing methods of disposing of industrial waste as well as newly developing methods of disposal, pursue the commercialization of the latter methods and link the study to the construction of a social infrastructure for disposal of substances that destroy the ozone layer. To be targeted in the survey will be the rotary kiln method currently used in the disposal of industrial waste, the cement kiln method used in conjunction with the manufacture of cement, and the plasma decomposition method being developed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Institute of Industrial Technology. The survey will include a review of issues that should be handled by the government in the future and will involve the effects of disposal methods in terms of whether they are able to dispose of hazardous waste without adversely affecting the ozone layer and an inventory of the number of disposal sites with specialized equipment using the best possible existing technology. Sources at the Comprehensive Air Control Section say, "We hope to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of various methods and expeditiously establish systems for disposal of substances that destroy the ozone layer."
