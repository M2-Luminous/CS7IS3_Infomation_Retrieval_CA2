In an interview, Vilatela explained that the negotiation would take place through the issuance of swaps (debt bonds) so that Mexican businessmen can purchase Cuban enterprises' assets. The Bancomext director, who is accompanying Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his state visit, said the solution to the island's debt with Mexico will be through refinancing the debt. He pointed out that the appropriate institutions in both countries must reach an agreement on refinancing the debt and bond issuance. Up until the end of 1993, Cuba's debt with Mexico was $313.4 million, of which $192.7 million was already overdue. The Cuban debt was refinanced in 1982, 1986, 1989, and 1991, which was the last time. The last refinancing of the debt was declared unfulfilled six months later because of Cuba's economic problems and because the mechanism that was established refinanced the debt for only four years. Luis German Carcoba, president of the Mexican Business Coordinating Council, confirmed the decision to invest in Cuba and added that textile and soft drink projects, among others, are already being implemented. Carcoba, who is also accompanying the Mexican president on his six-hour tour to this nation, said, however, that in the meeting held by the presidents and the trade delegations of Mexico and Cuba, no specific agreements are expected. The Mexican businesses that plan to make investments in Cuba are Grupo Infra de Gases y Equipos, Industrias Unidas de Telefonia de Larga Distancia, and Buffete Industrial, with modernization projects for 20 hotels in this city. Also participating were Cemex, which has a cement plant here; Domeq, which will negotiate the importation of Cuban rum to Mexico; Telecomunicaciones Internacionales de Mexico, founder of Cubacel; Incorporacion Internacional Comercial, which exports Mexican beer; and Grupo Dsc, which is a hotel business.
