FR941222-1-00080 FR941222-1-00008 For SIC 2865, Cyclic Crudes and Intermediates, the Small Business Administration defines small entities as those firms employing less than or equal to 750 employees. Based on this employment cutoff, approximately 61 percent, or 20 of the 33 affected dye and/or pigment manufacturers ( i.e., companies) are considered small entities. Under the listing alternative, which assumes disposal of wastewater treatment sludges/solids in an off-site commercial Subtitle C landfill and management of wastewaters in tanks, 7 of the 33 affected companies are estimated to incur potential significant economic impacts. Four of the 7 companies estimated to incur potential significant economic impacts are small entities. Although small entities are predominant in the affected industry, the proposed listings do not adversely affect small entities to a greater extent than large entities. Under the Agency's Revised Guidelines for Implementing the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Agency is committed to considering regulatory alternatives in rulemakings when there are any estimated economic impacts on small entities. The Agency obtained firm level employment data for the purpose of identifying and evaluating economic impacts on small entities. The statutory requirements of the RCRA program do not provide legal avenues to grant relief from the proposed listings to small entities. Because of statutory restrictions, the Agency is unable to exempt small entities or develop options to reduce economic impacts on small entities. The Agency must identify waste streams for listing without regard to the size of the entity being regulated. However, the possibility of enforceable agreements described previously may ameliorate the impact of listing on small entities. XI. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain any new information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Facilities will have to comply with the existing Subtitle C record keeping and reporting requirements for the newly listed wastestreams. To the extent that this rule imposes any information collection requirements under existing RCRA regulations promulgated in previous rule makings, those requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2050&hyph;120 (ICR no. 1573, Part B Permit Application); 2050&hyph;120 (ICR 1571, General Facility Standards); 2050&hyph;0028 (ICR 261, Notification to Obtain an EPA ID); 2050&hyph;0034 (ICR 262, Part A Permit Application); 2050&hyph;0039 (ICR 801, Hazardous Waste Manifest); 2050&hyph;0035 (ICR 820, Generator Standards); and 2050&hyph;0024 (ICR 976, Biennial Report). Release reporting required as a result of listing wastes as hazardous substances under CERCLA and adjusting the reportable quantities (RQs) has been approved under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq ., and has been assigned OMB control number 2050&hyph;0046 (ICR 1049, Notification of Episodic Release of Oil and Hazardous Substances).
