Tracing the road toward its consolidation in the international arena, we assumed the risk of incurring the hostility of close and remote countries. So what? Unfortunately, there was no turning point in relations between our two countries. The lies and insinuations that were insistently spread by Skopje and Belgrade in the past 50 years did not stop. The various obstacles and barbed wire still exist along the border. Our citizens continue to feel like "white crows" in Skopje, Bitola, and Ohrid. Almost nothing has been done to establish direct railroad communications or modernize the roads between the two countries. The possibilities of intensifying trade-economic cooperation and implementing initiatives related to scientific and cultural exchanges were not fully utilized, and God knows there are such possibilities. It is true that joint efforts are needed to melt the ice that has accumulated in the last 50 years. It also is true that the authorities in Skopje are still loyal to the ideas of Titoism and fear everything Bulgarian, just like a vampire fears the daylight. One cannot expect from them any initiatives or total cooperation. However, what did our representatives do during those 730 days? Did they trace any new paths that could now be widened? They did nothing, or almost nothing at best. Instead, we saw President Zhelev smiling with satisfaction when he was handed a translation of his "fascism" in some "language." We were puzzled when we saw how easily Prime Minister Berov swallowed his unease with the presence of a translator during his talks in Skopje. We also had to suffer the blunder with the commodity credit, which was promised ostensibly by [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev. We blushed when President Kiro Gligorov confused us with his speech in the UN General Assembly, with not a single representative Bulgarian institution expressing its indignation. No one paid any attention to the report of the "Helsinki Watch" on the violations of the minorities' rights in Macedonia. That report mentioned the Albanian, Turkish, Gypsy, Serbian, Muslim, and many other minorities. Only the Bulgarians remained unmentioned. They simply do not exist, they disappeared. The Miladinov brothers, Dame Gruev, Gotse Delchev, and tens of thousands of revival figures would have blushed and burned with shame if they could assume that we will keep silent when it is broadly claimed that there are no Bulgarian elements in Vardar Macedonia. It is high time to take a clear and categorical stand on those failures. Dirty hands or incompetent people could mar both the past and the present. What we probably need is a brief document of approximately 2,000 words, which, after holding a referendum and receiving the general support of the public, could once and for all clarify to the world our position on the Macedonian issue. No one in our country lives in a dream world, nor is anyone striving to change political borders. We only want to protect our glorious past from someone's dirty hands.
