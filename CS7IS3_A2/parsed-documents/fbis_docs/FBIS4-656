Latest reports from Kigali say that the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] have captured some positions of strategic importance in Kigali. Fighting has also been going on between the RPA and the government forces in the northern part of Rwanda. The RPA has liberated Mutara zone completely. The government forces are now fleeing in disarray. In Byumba, the town is besieged by the RPA, ready to flush out the government forces but the operation has been halted by a request from the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], who requested the RPA to hold fire so that the UNAMIR can evacuate its forces that are in Byumba. The current offensive by the RPA in Kigali is primarily intended to reinforce the RPA forces in Kigali who have been under attack by the presidential guard. A representative of the UNAMIR has confirmed that the RPA forces from the north have now linked with the RPA battalion in Kigali and there is no sign of resistance from the Rwandan Government forces.
