He added that they agreed to work together to straighten out bilateral relations. He noted that Minister Musa expressed readiness to meet him in Khartoum. They will agree upon a date later. He said the problem of Hala'ib can be solved through negotiations between the two countries, not through the media. He stressed that Sudan would allow nothing that would harm Egypt's security. Abu-Salih pointed out that Sudan held talks with the rebels in the south to find a solution to the problem, adding that Sudan cannot agree to the right of self-determination for the south. He noted that the Arab states' position on the south is that they are against any attempt to separate it from the north and that they support Sudan's unity and territorial integrity. The Sudanese foreign minister pointed out that resolving the inter-Arab differences requires courage, a strong will, and a mechanism. The Arab League secretary general, he added, proposed a mechanism for resolving these differences and restoring true Arab solidarity. He noted that Sudan wants its relations with all the Arab countries to be normal, so that solidarity can be restored, differences eliminated, and things restored to normal.
