FBIS4-52184 "dreas089_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 North Korea KCNA Denounces Planned Exercise KCNA Denounces Planned Exercise SK0805081094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0805 GMT 8 May 94 SK0805081094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Large-Scale War Gamble Planned by South Korean Puppets"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique Friday announced that a large-scale war exercise called a "joint tactical exercise in the first half of this year" would be staged by the puppet army, navy and air forces from May 9 to 14, according to a radio report from Seoul. The puppet clique plans to launch a three-dimensional "operation" on the ground and in air and sea including combat preparation exercise, chemical, biological and radioactive exercise, movement of armed forces and equipment, take-off and landing exercise on emergency runway, etc., and mobilize even the "homeland defence reserve forces". Bellicose elements of South Korea, in a bid to justify their planned provocative war exercise, make an absurd pretext of "coping with surprise attack by the enemy". The large-scale war exercise aimed at perfecting the attack posture of the puppet army, navy and air forces against the North arouses a precaution of people because it will be staged while stepping up preparations for a war against the North in the wake of the U.S. defense secretary's trip to Seoul. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should ponder over the grave consequences arising from their criminal act of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war with repeated arms buildup and war exercises.
