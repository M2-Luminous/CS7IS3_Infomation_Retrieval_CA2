Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said, "it took a long time since Prime Minister (Morhihiro) Hosokawa announced his intention to resign." "That created concerns and caused troubles for the people." The seven-party coalition agreed on key policy issues last Friday and decided to select Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as its candidate to succeed Hosokawa, two weeks after Hosokawa said he would step down because of a Diet stalemate over his financial impropriety. Hata will be elected new prime minister Monday afternoon. "The coalition should have a serious soul-searching over the political vacuum," Kono told reporters. The LDP chief also blasted the Hosokawa administration, which came to power with a vow to clean up politics, for its failure to restore the credibility of the Japanese politics. "The people's distrust in politics deepened instead," he said. "Mr. Hosokawa was himself not so enthusiastic about clarifying the suspicions" over his past financial deals "and the coalition members clammed up on the issue," Kono said.
