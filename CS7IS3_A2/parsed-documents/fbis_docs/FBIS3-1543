Dhlakama says the idea does not mean the October elections will not be held, stressing that Renamo wants the polls to take place as scheduled. Afonso Dhlakama explains his idea: [Dhlakama] In the first phase of a democratic system in Mozambique, I do not believe that it should be Renamo, Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] or any other party to rule the country alone. Other parties ought to be made to feel at ease. Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, one of the government representatives at the Supervision and Control Commission, has reacted to Dhlakama's suggestion. [Hunguana] I do not know what Mr. Dhlakama means when he says each party should establish such a principle, in addition to the principles enshrined in the Constitution and in the General Peace Accord. Does he want to add any other principle to the Constitution and the Peace Accord? He would better clarify his position. A number of opposition parties favor the establishment of a multiparty forum that would define the principles of a national unity government with a view to establishing them in the Constitution. The Renamo leader said that is not what matters right now. [Dhlakama] I do not think it is very important to have an agreement before elections are held. In fact it could be construed as if we were not ready for elections. It would mean that we would be discussing (?the number of votes) from the onset. It would be a very complicated issue because one could say: I will win and will require so many ministers from this and that party. Asked to give the government's view on a multiparty forum, Hunguana said: [Hunguana] Well, I think they are putting the cart before the horse. We need free and fair elections to establish democracy in this country. We need to have elections that would lead to the creation of a forum where the country's future is debated and defined. By proposing the establishment of such a forum before elections are held, I think they are putting the cart before the horse. Do they want to decide the future of the country for the electorate? That has very little if anything to do with democracy. Teodato Hunguana noted that if Frelimo wins the elections, it would look into the possibility of establishing a national unity government. He said Frelimo will search for every possible solution to ensure peace, stability, democracy, and justice. He questioned, however, whether the other parties would be able to form a national unity government if they win the elections.
