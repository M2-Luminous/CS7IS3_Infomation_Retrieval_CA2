Aliyev's first official visit to Ankara has a hectic schedule, which includes his receiving an honorary degree on international law from Hacettepe University. While in Turkey, Aliyev will sign various economic accords including a protocol to establish a working committee to assess existing border accords and explore the possibilities of signing a new agreement in this area. The last accord, signed in 1921 between Turkey and the ex-Soviet Union, gives Turkey the right of guarantee over the status of Nakhichevan, an Azeri enclave in Armenia bordering Turkey and Iran. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Turkish and Azeri officials said in the past that such an accord was under consideration, but took no steps toward formulating one until recently. Diplomatic sources said the working groups will work on various drafts as well as the "right time" for signing such an accord. Various Turkish officials have said in the past that "Turkey could not stand back and watch in case of an Armenian attack on Nakhichevan." The presence of Shamsaddin Khanbabayev, the president of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, indicates that the issue will have priority in the talks in Ankara. Other issues of priority, diplomatic sources have said, is Turkish aid to Azerbaijan and the diplomatic support it can extend in stopping Armenian violation of Azeri territory. President Suleyman Demirel, who brushed aside protocol to meet Aliyev at the airport, said Turkey considered the "Minsk mechanism" as the appropriate forum to solve the Azeri-Armenian problem. The so called "Minsk group" operates within the context of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and has been seeking a settlement to the Azeri-Armenian conflict. "I believe the problems of Azeris can be solved in a just way which guarantees Azeri territorial integrity," Demirel said. He added that Ankara would continue to support Azerbaijan in international fora on this issue. "But we will not stop at that," the Turkish president said. "When Azerbaijan, as a democratic state, launches its reconstruction, Turkey will continue to be of assistance with all its means.' Aliyev, in turn, expressed his confidence in the CSCE's efforts for ending the Azeri-Armenian conflict. "We have confidence in the Minsk group. We also have confidence in the efforts of major states," Aliyev said. A high-level Turkish diplomat interpreted these words as a sign that Azerbaijan wants the tripartite peace plan--put forward by Turkey, Russia and U.S.--to be brought back to the table. "The plan, which stipulates a ceasefire and Armenian withdrawal from Azeri lands, has long been kept on hold. but the Azeris, worried that a sole Russian initiative would legitimize Armenia's gains, want this or similar initiatives to complement the Minsk process," the diplomat said. Turkey To Approach Aliyev on Human Rights Meanwhile, Turkey will reportedly stress the importance it places on human rights and democratic developments in Azerbaijan during the talks headed by the two presidents. Turkish diplomatic sources have indicated that Turkey feels the jailing of former political leaders and closing down newspapers does not reflect a good image for Baku government. The issue of human rights violations in Azerbaijan had reportedly been put to the Turkish government "at various levels" by a Popular [People's] Front delegation which visited Turkey right before Aliyev. In a move to protest Aliyev's policies, the Azerbaijan Cultural Association refused to meet him during his visit to Turkey although a meeting had been scheduled for this morning. Turkish and Azeri officials have said that "all aspects of ties and regional problems" would be discussed in the talks. But Aliyev's opening remarks that "Azerbaijan was in the process of establishing its own national army to drive the Armenian aggressors out" indicated that possible Turkish assistance in military training would be high on the Azeri agenda. Ankara has been involved in the training of Azeri officers both in Turkey and in Azerbaijan. Aliyev, who will address the Turkish parliament today, is expected to appeal to Turkey for support in ending the Armenian occupation of Azeri soil. The 160 member delegation, which arrived in Ankara's Esenboga Airport in two planes, also includes the head of the Azeri oil company SOCAR, which is part of a consortium for an Azeri oil pipeline project which includes the Turkish pipeline company BOTAS. Turkish officials indicated before the visit that they saw talks with Aliyev as a "good opportunity" to reassess the pipeline project which had been dormant for a while due to Azerbaijan's domestic problems. The presence of BOTAS chairman Hayrettin Uzun in the official talks indicated that the pipeline would be discussed. Aliyev has recently told Amaco, the American Oil Company in the same consortium, that the Azeri parliament will make a decision on the route of the pipeline by March. Ankara wants the Azeri oil to be brought with pipeline via Turkey to the Mediterranean coast and exported to Europe from there.
