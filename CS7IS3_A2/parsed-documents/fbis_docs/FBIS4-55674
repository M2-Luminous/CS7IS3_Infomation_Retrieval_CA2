The formula of the European Union on the division of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was accepted at the ministerial meeting in Geneva, where agreement on a joint strategy towards the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was reached. Under the E.U. formula, 51 percent of the total Bosnia-Herzegovina territory would go to the Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation, agreed in Washington under U.S. pressure, while the Serbs would get the remaining 49 percent. "With regret I conveyed to the cochairmen the conference on former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, the stand that the presented maps seriously encroach upon the vital interests of the Serb people because they have been made to satisfy the Moslem-Croat side and not all three sides," Krajisnik said in a statement to Radio Jagodina. Taking into consideration that the proposed maps encroach upon the integrity of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the fact that they are a poor solution if quality is taken into consideration, it will be, as Krajisnik said, very difficult to arrive to a just solution, i.e. a consensus. The cochairmen promised they would convey the objections voiced by the Serb side to the contact group for Bosnia, Krajisnik said.
