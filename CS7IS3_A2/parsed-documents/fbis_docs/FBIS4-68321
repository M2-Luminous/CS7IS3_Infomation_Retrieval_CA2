But will these disputes lead to the appearance of still another spaceport? We asked leading branch specialists to express themselves on this matter. Boris Ostroumov, deputy general director of the Russian Space Agency. The ITAR-TASS communication carried reproaches directed toward our agency to the effect that the project for the Alpha international orbital station which we approved is completely oriented on Baykonur and that under the prevailing conditions this is complicating its implementation. "Accordingly, for Russia to carry out an independent space policy and ensure guaranteed access to space Russia has been forced...to proceed to the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome." First of all, I wish to be more precise and once again remind: the project for the Alpha international space station has not been finally adopted by all the partners and is being prepared for signature only with great difficulties. Many points are being refined and the interests of Russia are lagging behind. We are even trying not to use the very name Alpha.. The fact that the project is oriented on Baykonur is entirely natural: today it is the sole operational gateway into space with a well-developed infrastructure. For example, the assembly-test facilities constructed for the Buran are outfitted with the most modern apparatus. Baykonur ensures launches of space vehicles into the necessary orbital inclinations. While we are not losing hopes for success in negotiations with the Americans, we have had to exercise still more wisdom and restraint in the dialogue with Kazakhstan. The results of negotiations indicate that despite the efforts of many short-sighted politicians there can be no falling out between our peoples. The establishment of a new cosmodrome in the Far East is an expensive idea. I have already mentioned before that "each stone there will be more expensive than a diamond." In Russia today there are no funds even for ordinary bricks and blocks. The remoteness of the new cosmodrome from manufacturing plants also will transform it into too expensive a facility. In my opinion, today, when preparations are being made for ratification of the documents signed with Kazakhstan, to raise a discussion about an "alternative" variant means to drive a wedge between the covenanting parties. Igor Barmin, general designer of the General Machine Building Design Bureau. The problem of establishing a cosmodrome in the eastern part of the country has a multisided character. Without question, Russia must have its low-latitude cosmodrome not only for implementing space programs, but also for solving problems of defense importance. The choice of a place for the construction of a new spaceport also has its pluses and minuses. It is fortunate that the construction will not be carried out in a barren place but at the base of a military unit already having a quite well-developed infrastructure. Unfortunately, the fulfillment by Russia of its obligations for disarmament has the result that much is experiencing an arbitrary fate. The choice of the place also is fortunate with respect to the allocated falling zones. A shortcoming is the great expenditures related to the remoteness from scientific research institutes, design bureaus and manufacturing plants. However, in my opinion it is incorrect to consider the construction of a new cosmodrome as an alternative variant to the Baykonur cosmodrome. The project for the new cosmodrome can be fully examined only when its tasks have been clearly set forth and the programs for whose solution it will be intended have been defined. Only after serious and thorough working through of all these questions can a decision be made about the stages in its development and the time when it will be established.
