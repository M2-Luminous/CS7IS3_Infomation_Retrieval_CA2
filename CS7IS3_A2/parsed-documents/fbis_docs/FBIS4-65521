This was Achille Occhetto's immediate comment Tuesday [10 May] on the birth of the new government. And in today's L'UNITA he went even further: [President] Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's letter to [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi is "a shocking, extraordinary, and disturbing development." Does that mean that you deny that this government has the democratic legitimacy necessary to govern? "No, we said immediately after the elections that the victorious Right has the entitlement and the duty to govern. But this is a different matter. This government humiliates Italy because of the quality of its ministers; because of the lies and intrigues that dominated the period of its formation, just as in the darkest days of the First Republic; and because at the very moment of its birth it is already violating all the promises that it made to the Italian people." [Franchi] But the Right has won. We might feel prompted to say: Here is the New that you appealed for... [Occhetto] The New? Let us be serious. There have been times when the Right was the New: Fascism was the New with respect to liberal Italy. So the term "new" is a subject of debate. Be that as it may, this is a government of recycled persons. There is even something derisive in what has happened: Riding on the tide of self-righteousness and revanchism, in an atmosphere like that of the Circus Maximus, the Bossis and the Finis have brought to power the rearguard of the forces that held sway during the first phase of the republic. It is a base example of the mere appearance of change. [Franchi] What do you mean? That the people have been victims of an optical illusion, a great deception? [Occhetto] A deception, a deception. After a great campaign against the parties, we find ourselves again with Big Brother looking out at us from every wall. I say this quite frankly: We cannot compete with this huge financial and business power, with a mega-party-cum-firm which wants to render the parties ineffective. [Franchi] Do you not think that you are exaggerating? If I am not mistaken, you were in the forefront of the challenge to the Old Regime. And the election result and the consequent government are the outcome of a new electoral system that was supposed to open the way to alternation... [Occhetto] But this is not the democracy of alternation that we wanted when we promoted the referendums. We are in a republic led by a family business. As an Italian, I feel ashamed of this. Especially when I think about the European Parliament where we poor post-Communists -- universally acknowledged as cultured, intelligent, and civilized -- will appear with this mass of ignoramuses behind us... Some Liberals in the twenties actually liked the Fascist action squads, at least from an aesthetic viewpoint. This time, with people of this sort, there is no danger of committing the same mistake. What democracy of alternation? Here we have a prime minister who in the European elections is standing as a candidate at the top of his lists in five constituencies, knowing that he will have to resign immediately. This is a deception against the voters, an attempt to introduce a system of election by acclaim... [Franchi] I take note of your opinion. I would like to ask: What does an opposition do when it is convinced that the winners pose a threat to democracy? [Occhetto] We will conduct a democratic and constitutional opposition. But we cannot ignore the sinister sickness revealed by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi: It is precisely the existence of this sinister sickness that demands that we be not only the vanguard of a combative opposition but also the champions of a democracy that has reached danger level. [Franchi] I assume you realize the serious implications of what you are saying. [Occhetto] Of course. And I would never have said it unless Scalfaro had taken the serious action that he did. Let us be frank. Either Scalfaro was not in earnest, which I exclude, or his words are set in stone. And these stones must be removed. [Franchi] Pardon me, but I still find it difficult to reconcile two such different approaches to opposition. It is one matter to plan revenge in the next elections, which is what happens in all the Western countries. But it is an entirely different matter to combat the threat of reaction... [Occhetto] I will try to make this clear by means of an example. In Britain the Laborites combat the Conservative governments' economic and social policies by monitoring them and putting forward alternative proposals. And we will do this. But there is a serious additional problem. This government has been born amid the suspicion that it wants to deviate from observance of the fundamental principles of the Constitution. And we intend to act as guardians of these principles. I would like to add that it is not we alone who will be establishing which aspect of our opposition will prevail. A great deal will obviously depend on what the government does. [Franchi] Do you not think that a Left that adopts such a stance will, rightly or wrongly, be accused of being progressive by name but conservative in deed? [Occhetto] Why? I say, on the contrary: Left, wake up; do not close yourself up in your own narrow domain; learn to talk to the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for the Right and who, let us never forget, constitute the virtual majority, [Franchi] Yes, but the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and its progressive allies obtained one-third of the votes. And very few people actually believe in the possibility of their increasing to the extent of becoming a majority. [Occhetto] I do not believe it either. We have crossed our Red Sea. We are still standing. Indeed, we have gained some votes. But we certainly must not imagine that the PDS and the Left can achieve a majority on their own. Not even by taking nonexistent shortcuts... [Franchi] Shortcuts? [Occhetto] Yes, the idea of dissolving, of turning ourselves -- us and the forces close to us -- into a democratic party, that is, of eliminating the "S," the Left, from our name, as though the problem facing the Left were how to constantly escape from itself... Nonsense. Just as it is nonsense to account for everything in terms of a sociology of leadership, though sooner or later the issue will arise of a PDS secretary that does not have behind him the experience of the PCI [Italian Communist Party], if for no other reason than that generations come and go. Just as it is superficial, if not indeed stupid, to believe that the basic issue is one of appeal to the moderates... [Franchi] Do you mean that this issue does not exist? [Occhetto] I accept no criticisms in this regard, even implicit ones. I went to NATO. I went to talk to bankers in the City. The enlightened bourgeoisie voted for us en masse. If I had been told that only a few years ago, I would not have believed it. What I mean is that there certainly is a problem regarding the Left, but that above all there is the problem of the center. [Franchi] And what is that? [Occhetto] It is that there is not a center capable of looking toward the Left with the same vigor and pragmatism with which Berlusconi, also from the center, looked toward the right-wing forces, causing them to communicate with each other. And leading them to victory, thanks to the first-past-the-post system. This, despite the fact that the progressive forces, the Popular Party, and the Pact gained more votes. [Franchi] What do you have in mind to ensure that this dynamic center takes shape? [Occhetto] You are asking too much of me. I already have my problems with the Left. We can, and will, conduct an opposition that is non-demagogic, non-extremist. And we can confederate our forces. Of course, I will not ask the Popular Party to join the confederation of left-wing forces. But I will ask it to create a new rapport with the left-wing forces in order to set Italy on a new track. [Franchi] I almost forgot: What happened to your fling with [League Secretary] Bossi? [Occhetto] What fling... I was well aware that Bossi wanted to use us too to raise the bidding in the government negotiations. But I also knew that Bossi had, and still has, a problem: Part of his voters are threatening to leave him for Forza Italia, while another part could leave him precisely because he has allied with Forza Italia. Be that as it may, Bossi has shouldered a serious responsibility. Without him, who was portrayed as the quintessence of the new, Berlusconi would not now be prime minister.
