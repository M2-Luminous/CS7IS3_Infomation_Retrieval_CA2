This meeting is the continuation of last year's meeting in Bangkok on exploring joint shipping on the Meikong River. The meeting discussed the four countries' draft agreement on joint shipping in the upper reaches of the Meikong River and eight proposals for stepping up development of international shipping on the two rivers. Last night Governor He Zhiqiang and Vice Governor Niu Shaoyao met representatives of the four countries and invited them to a banquet. Governor He Zhiqiang said: Following international economic development, particularly Southeast Asian economic development, the four countries' governments have put on their agenda the issue of navigation on the Lancang and Meikong rivers. These countries have reached a consensus on jointly developing the two rivers. Since the first meeting in Bangkok in May last year, Yunnan has done a great deal of work and fulfilled the duties it has undertaken. He Zhiqiang added: I am very happy that the second meeting is held in Kunming, and I believe this meeting will make a contribution to strengthening the four countries' cooperation and promoting navigation on the Lancang and Meikong rivers.
