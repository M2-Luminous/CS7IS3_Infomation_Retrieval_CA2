FR941104-2-00009 FR941104-2-00004 Spring Valley Picnic Shelter; Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Project; Latah County, ID AGENCY: Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture. ACTION: Notice of a finding of no significant impact. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul H. Calverley, State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, 3244 Elder Street, Room 124, Boise, Idaho, 83705, telephone (208) 334&hyph;1601. NOTICE: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council on Environmental Quality Guidelines (40 CFR Part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Guidelines (7 CFR Part 650); the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared for the Spring Valley Picnic Shelter RC&D Project, Latah County, Idaho. The Environmental Assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Paul H. Calverley, State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement was not needed for this project. The RC&D Project will upgrade an existing picnic area with the addition of a picnic shelter and a concrete walkway for better handicap access. These measures will attract people away from high impact areas along the edge of the reservoir, causing less soil erosion and reducing conflict with other users. This Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency. The basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Mr. Paul H. Calverley. The FONSI has been sent to various federal, state and local agencies, and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the address stated on the previous page. No administrative action on the proposal will be initiated until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register. (This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.901_Resource Conservation and Development Program, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and Local Officials) Dated: October 15, 1994. Paul H. Calverley, State Conservationist. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27342 Filed 11&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;16&hyph;M
