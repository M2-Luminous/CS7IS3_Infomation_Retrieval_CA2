Between 1989 and 1993, 44 percent of the voters changed party. The election study of 1993 features striking figures and it shows very clearly how important the EC issue is to voters. The study was done by two election researchers, Henry Valen and Bernt Aardal, and will be published in this week's edition of Weekly Statistics from the Central Bureau of Statistics. A whopping 44 percent switched party allegiance between 1989 and 1993. This represents the lowest level of stability in any election where such facts have been recorded. In 1989 the figure was 39 percent, and in 1985, 29 percent. There can be no doubt that in the 1993 election we saw the greatest movement within the electorate since World War II. The displacement is much greater than in that other election year that was overshadowed by the EC issue: 1973. "It was in the election of 1973 that the voters' allegiance to a certain party started to cool, and this trend only intensified up until the 1993 Storting election," Aardal said. The Winners The election's winners naturally enjoy the greatest stability: 87 percent for the Center Party and 74 percent for the Labor Party. The Progress Party's level of stability is extremely low: A mere 25 percent of the party's voters from 1989 voted the same way in 1993. The Socialist Left Party also has a very low level of stability: 37 percent. "Among the larger parties it is those to the extreme right and left that suffer very low stability, even when the election result per se is not catastrophic. The other parties have much greater stability than the ones that represent themselves as alternatives," Aardal said. Historically, the Progress Party and the Socialist Left Party have had the strongest support among young voters. A mild trend in that direction continues, but both parties are now decidedly weaker among young voters than they were in 1989. First-Time Voters A full 23 percent of this year's first-time voters (18-21 years) voted for the Center Party. That is four times as many as in 1989 when only 6 percent did. The Labor Party continues to be weak among this group of voters, getting only 20 percent, as opposed to about 40 percent of the other age groups. Both the Center Party and the Labor Party have attracted many voters from just about all the other parties. In addition, there is a significant migration from the Labor Party to the Center Party. The Conservative Party has lost the largest number of its voters to the Labor Party and the Center Party, as has the Socialist Left Party. The Progress Party lost the most to the Labor Party, the Conservatives, and the Center Party. More Women Voter participation dropped from 83.2 percent in 1989 to 75.8 percent in 1993. The Progress Party's voter participation dropped the most. In the Conservative Party there were almost three times as many nonvoters among those opposed to the EC as among those in favor of it. Another notable fact in this study is that women vote in larger numbers than men, except in the highest age groups. For the 22-25 age group participation was 70 percent for women and 63 for men, and in the 26-29 age group participation is 75 percent for women, 63 percent for men. "A fundamental change has taken place in recent years, and it probably has to do with the change in the gender-role pattern. The EC issue also contributes in the sense that there are more EC opponents among women," Aardal said. What is most notable is that the Center Party now gets twice as many votes among first-time female voters as among male first-timers. Even the Socialist Left Party now enjoys more support from very young men than from women. All in all, the Socialist Left Party and the Christian People's Party enjoy greater support from women than men. The Progress Party and the Conservatives are more popular with men, while the Labor Party and the Center Party enjoy equal support from the sexes. Of the women, 50 percent vote socialist, as do 46 percent of the men. In 1989 those figures were 48 percent for women, 43 percent for men. The election study has a population of 2,194. The information on party allegiance switches is based on about 800 interviews conducted with the same people in 1989 and 1993. Conservatives Hit by EC One-half of those who voted for the Conservatives in 1989 became EC opponents in 1993. Only 34 percent of this group remained loyal to the Conservative Party in the 1993 election. It is no secret that the EC issue has had a profound effect on the Storting election, and the Valen-Aardal study reinforces this. In its own analysis of its election losses, the Conservative Party has blamed itself for its EC profile. But no study prior to this one has demonstrated just how massively the party lost on the EC issue. In the rural areas of Norway the loss was enormous. Even the researchers were amazed when they arrived at their numbers. Overall the EC supporters are more stable in their votes from 1989 to 1993 than the EC opponents: 63 percent versus 52. Among EC supporters there is a significant migration to the Labor Party from the Conservatives, the Progress Party, and the Socialist Left Party. In the research population there was not a single EC supporter who voted for the Socialist Left Party. For the opponents to the EC the Center Party has been the great magnet. Both the Socialist Left Party and the Conservative Party gave up 20 percent of their 1989 voters to the Center Party, while the Labor Party and the Progress Party gave up 17 percent each. The Labor Party has a net gain among the opponents, as compared to the Socialist Left, the Conservatives, and the Progress Party. Among those who have not decided on the EC issue the Labor Party is the decided winner. The following shows stability in percentage points for the various parties in the 1993 Storting elections. The figures indicate the percentage of that party's 1989 voters who voted for the party in 1993. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center Party |87 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Labor Party |74 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Christian People's Party |60 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conservative Party |56 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Socialist Left Party |37 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Progress Party |25 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
