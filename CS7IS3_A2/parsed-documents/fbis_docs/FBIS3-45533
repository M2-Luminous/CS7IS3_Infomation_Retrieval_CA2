Located in Qingyuan City in central Guangdong, the Qingyuan Experimental Economic Development Zone last year had a total of some 1.6 billion yuan in investment, 48 percent of which was investment from overseas. Construction of 42 projects started last year after the inauguration of the zone, which covers an area of 9.6 sq [square km.] Twenty-nine of the projects became operational the same year, producing a total of more than 300 million yuan in industrial output value. To date, the zone has provided jobs to more than 1,000 people from the relatively poor counties and towns around the city. This year the zone envisages employing in stages more local people from such areas of the province. According to a zone executive, the service industries in the zone are gaining increasing development momentum. He said a 28-story building is under construction in the zone and is expected to be the zone's center of finance, stocks, futures and science and technology. A series of high-rise buildings, meanwhile, are planned for this year. Experts hold that the zone has, in addition to greatly promoting local economies, also set a good example for poor areas across the country to shake off poverty in a faster way. The impact and influence of the zone has been felt in a wide area of China, with similar zones blueprinted in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well as Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces.
