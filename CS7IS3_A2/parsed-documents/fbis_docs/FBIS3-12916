'Abd-al-Shafi was speaking by phone with AL-QUDS from Nicosia, where he is visiting at present in response to an invitation to attend an international conference of churches after paying a visit to South Africa. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that a good solution cannot be reached except with the removal of Israeli settlements from the heart of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Settlements are the main obstacle to the achievement of a lasting peace in the region on the basis of UN resolutions. 'Abd-al-Shafi called on the Palestinian leadership to suspend the talks and reassess the current Palestinian situation entirely on a democratic basis. This would ensure the unity of the Palestinian position inside and outside by mobilizing all Palestinian potentials and defining the effective options available to the Palestinian people.
