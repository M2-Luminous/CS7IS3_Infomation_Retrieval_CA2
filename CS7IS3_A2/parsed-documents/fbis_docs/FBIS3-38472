He announced the details in Bonn today before the Bundestag Defense Committee. He said that just under DM600 million of the cuts will be achieved by means of immediate measures. Individual measures to account for the remaining sum of around DM650 million will be decided during the year, Ruehe said. The list of immediate measures comprises a total of six items. It provides, among other things, for a reduction in Bundeswehr strength to 345,000 soldiers by yearend. The budget allocation for international missions is to be cut by DM100 million. If the Bundeswehr is needed further in this area in 1994, additional funding is to be provided. Funds for military procurements are to be cut by DM220 million. Some DM165 million less are to be spent on civilian and military personnel. The suspension of all military exercises in the second half of 1994 is intended to achieve savings of a further DM45 million. Some DM60 million are to be spent on rebuilding the infrastructure in the new [eastern] states. Savings of around DM10 million altogether are also to be made in the navy and air force.
