It, in particular, states that today the Supreme Council of Crimea, as a matter of fact, restored the provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in its 6 May 1992 wording, which deals, first and foremost, with the establishment of relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements, and the introduction of Crimean citizenship. All this is a step toward Crimea's secession from the composition of Ukraine, which violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine, its state sovereignty, and contradicts the principles of international law. According to the legislation currently in force, the top state power bodies in the Republic of Crimea have no right to solve the issues that are within the competence of the state bodies of Ukraine. The volume of the plenary powers of the Republic of Crimea cannot be changed without the consent of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The resolution envisages "with the aim of protecting state sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of Ukraine on its entire territory TO STOP [capitals as per original text] the effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea of 20 May 1994 `On restoring the constitutional fundamentals of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea' as such that contradicts the declaration on state sovereignty and the Constitution of Ukraine." The Supreme Council of Ukraine proposes that the parliament of Crimea should bring the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in line with the Constitution and the legislation of Ukraine within 10 days. Today, political leaders, parties, and public organizations expressed their attitudes toward the decisions by the Supreme Council of Crimea. Vasyl Durdynets, chairman of the parliamentary group "Tsentr" [Center]: In general, my attitude toward any sanctions is very cautious. But with regard to the concrete situation in Crimea, when Ukraine allocates its last money, withdrawing it from other regions (for example, 50 billion karbovantsi were transferred to Sevastopol on 18 May), while the leadership of Crimea intentionally continues to act contrary, sanctions on the part of Ukraine would be logical and legitimate in order to bring those who stake their all against our state down to earth. Probably, it is not expedient to resort to extremities and introduce a state of emergency, however, I do not know any state that would respond to such actions of its region so reluctantly. I believe that in the last resort we will appeal to the world public. Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy, people's deputy of the Supreme Council of Ukraine: I am extremely worried about what I have seen in Crimea of late. First and foremost, this is the opposition between the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and President Yuriy Meshkov. The Crimean Tatars favor Ukraine's territorial integrity and openly declare that they smell gunpowder in the air. In my opinion, Yuriy Meshkov is provoking the aggravation of the situation. Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, whom I met at a mourning ceremony in connection with the 50th anniversary of the Crimean Tatars' deportation, declared that he was inclined to the necessity of setting up a commission of the Supreme Council of Crimea to hold consultations with the representatives of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on issues of Crimean Tatars and relations between Ukraine and Crimea. (As UNIAN reported today in a special release, such a commission, chaired by Serhiy Tsekov, was set up at the Supreme Council of Crimea session on 20 May). The People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], in its appeal to the citizens of Ukraine, states that the actions by the Supreme Council of Crimea endanger Ukraine's territorial integrity and lead to igniting a fratricidal war as a result of which peace in Ukraine and, therefore, in the entire European and Black Sea region, is endangered. The appeal asserts that all the actions by the "helmsmen of Crimea are encouraged by the deputies to the Russian Federation State Duma, with the president of Russia being aware of this." In the opinion of the authors of the appeal, the interests of the 700,000-strong Ukrainian population in Crimea and also the interests of the Crimean Tatars are totally ignored. Stepan Khmara, people's deputy, chairman of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party: This antistate act must be stopped by the most radical means, because this is an attempt upon the integrity of the state. Yuriy Meshkov and his company must be arrested as conspirators. The president's veto is insufficient at this point, more radical actions are necessary, all structures must be involved to protect the state. Volodymyr Marchenko, people's deputy of Ukraine, one of the leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine parliamentary group: Socialists will not agree to Crimea's secession from Ukraine. The territorial integrity of the state envisages Crimea within the composition of Ukraine. This is unequivocal. Participants in the Political Parties Club, which is taking place in Kiev (the Ukrainian Party of Justice, the Party of Free Peasants, the Constitutional-Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Social- Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, People's Movement of Ukraine, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), adopted an appeal to the president and the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "in connection with the aggravation of the political situation in Ukraine, first and foremost, connected with Crimea" to hold a joint meeting for consultations and the soonest possible solution of the existing problem.
