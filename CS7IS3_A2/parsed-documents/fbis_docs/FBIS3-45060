Top government cadres have admitted that a lack of investment was partly responsible for the water-shortage crisis that was afflicting two-thirds of Chinese cities as of last year, according to official statistics. The water ministry officials told the GUANGMING DAILY that the resulting economic losses were causing serious concern at all government levels and they called on people to save water wherever possible. The newspaper also quoted the mayor of the free-wheeling southern special economic zone of Shenzhen as saying water shortfalls were making it impossible to implement reforms and maintain rapid economic development. The lack of attention given to the water crisis is the most serious mistake China has made in the past 10 years, the mayor said. Shenzhen's daily water shortfall is currently estimated at 100,000 cubic metres (3.5 million cubic feet). The newspaper also quoted officials in Beijing as saying that, by 2000, the capital will have no quality drinking water unless steps are taken immediately.
