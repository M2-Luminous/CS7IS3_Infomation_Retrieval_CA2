The debates are mostly centered on the types of criticism levelled on the government's performance in the past few years especially in connection with the implementation of the 5-year Development Plan. It is an undeniable fact that the enemies of the Islamic Revolution, in particular the U.S., do not wish Iran to be successful in its social reconstruction programs, and to be turned into a prominent economic power. The U.S. used the same strategy in its fight against communism, and finally succeeded in using that ideology's flagrant economic weakness to deliver the fatal blow at an appropriate moment. It should be pointed out that the collapse of communism was brought about by a complex combination of factors. America has already used various tactics against Iran such as arranging coup d'etat and giving the green light to Iraq to invade Iran, and it has failed to undermine the foundations of the Islamic Republic. So now America is trying to strike at us with the economic weapon. In pursuit of that strategy the U.S. has been exerting various types of pressures on the European countries to make them restrict their economic cooperations with Iran. One of the economic weapons with which America hopes to deal destructive blows on Iran is to spread false rumors about Iran's economic position and to create an atmosphere of instability and distrust regarding Iran's economic successes. It is a great economic success that in 5 years time electricity breakdowns will reach zero level, gas pipelines construction will have been completed in 200 cities and towns, vast portions of surface water sources will have been harnessed and telephone communication facilities will have spread to the remotest villages. Alongside of all of these successes, the press and the other mass media have every right to express their constructive criticism. There have undoubtedly been shortcomings in the planning and implementation of parts of the 5-Year Plan, and now at the conclusion of the Development Plan, it is the indisputable right of the press to undertake an analytic examination of the First Plan for the purpose of using the experiences gained from its implementation in the Second Plan. It is our firm belief that a clear-cut distinction should be made between constructive and subversive criticisms.
