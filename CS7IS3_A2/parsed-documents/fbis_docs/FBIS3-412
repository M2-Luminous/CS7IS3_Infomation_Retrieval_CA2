The meeting is against a background of a civil service strike that threatens to cripple the homeland as strikers demand the return of their pension contributions and re-incorporation into South Africa. The cabinet must decide whether to register alongside its Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, and Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front. Although the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], of which Gen Viljoen is chairman, decided on Saturday against registration, the Freedom Front could still participate in the elections. Attempts are being made to persuade moderates to follow through with the registration. Hopes for Bophuthatswana's inclusion in the electoral process were further boosted when African National Congress President Nelson Mandela said in Pietersburg on Sunday that the deadline for registration could be extended. A spokesman for the Office of Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said on Monday that if the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] would accept the registration of Bophuthatswana's ruling Christian Democratic Party on Monday afternoon, "the government will not obstruct that". He said any objection to the late registration would be based on practical rather than political objections. "Whatever the IEC can accommodate, that will be okay with the government," the spokesman said. A Bophuthatswana government source said a representative would be flown to Johannesburg to register if the cabinet decided on participation.
