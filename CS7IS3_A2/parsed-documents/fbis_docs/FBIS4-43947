A press statement from the Prime Minister's Office says, among other things, that instead of taking the Icelandic boats into port and bringing Icelandic seamen before Norwegian courts -- or taking the Svalbard conflict before an international court -- the Norwegian coast guard is resorting to the same methods which have so far only been used by Greenpeace. This was a reference to the international environmental organization's at times militant methods at sea. At the cabinet meeting the government also decided to ask foreign experts in international law to evaluate Iceland's and Norway's legal positions in the so-called protection zone off Svalbard. On the basis of their investigation the Icelandic Government will reach a decision on a possible complaint to the International Court in The Hague. The decision for a legal investigation, the statement goes on to say, was made because so far the Norwegian Government has refused all negotiations about Iceland being granted fishing rights off Svalbard. The Icelandic Government also promises to assist those fishing boat companies which want to bring actions against the Norwegian authorities for the loss of fishing equipment off Svalbard because Norwegian coast guard vessels have cut trawl cables. The Icelandic Foreign Ministry will, for example, help the national association of fishing boat companies, LIU [expansion unknown], to employ a lawyer to prepare the cases.
