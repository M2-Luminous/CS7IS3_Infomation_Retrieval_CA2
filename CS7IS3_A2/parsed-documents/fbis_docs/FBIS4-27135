Kakizawa, responding to questions before the House of Representatives Budget Committee, said it is nevertheless desirable that the talks be brought to an early conclusion. The foreign minister said he confirmed the absence of a deadline in a recent telephone conversation with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. But Kantor has reportedly suggested bilateral talks on government procurement be wound up by the end of June, while negotiations in other sectors should be concluded before the end of September, when the U.S. administration is scheduled to decide whether to invoke the Super 301 trade provision that permits sanctions against countries allegedly practicing unfair trade. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee that Japan would take recourse to arbitration in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington opts for sanctions.
