Qiao sat down beside Mr. Ann Tse-kai, a vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He asked whether Mr. Ann is used to living in Beijing after coming from Hong Kong. Qiao began talking with Ann about the issue of resuming China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. "Our stand has been consistent on the Hong Kong question," he said. "The British side should be held entirely responsible for the breakdown of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong question," Qiao said. "We shall never waver in our determination to resume China's sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997," he said. Speaking of the current NPC session, Qiao Shi pledged to speed up legislation, tighten supervision over government work and standardize a socialist market economic structure. At 8:50 A.M., President Jiang Zemin entered the lounge and sat down beside Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. The two leaders talked about how to promote ideological and cultural progress in China. They were soon joined by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who told president Jiang: "The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has voted down an anti-China motion raised by some countries." Jiang said, "It is unpopular to attack China by using the human rights issue. We should justly and forcefully refute such attacks." Premier Li Peng, who had just come in, said, "I'm going to state our stand on this matter in the government work report." President Jiang said: "Right!" Speaking of the current NPC session, Jiang said, "At present the overall situation in China is excellent. All major policies and principles have been formulated. The key to success lies in earnest, concerted endeavors by people of all nationalities." Shortly before leaving for the rostrum to deliver his government work report, premier Li Peng told reporters that Deng Xiaoping has always advocated concise, pragmatic reports. "This year's government work report highlights reform, economic development and social stability," he said. "I hope that, during the current session, NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members will speak their minds and air their views on how to revise my report," he said. The premier was joined by Li Ruihuan, who said: "Reform serves as the motive force, development is our goal and stability is a prerequisite." "So long as we correctly handle relations between reform, development and stability, and work hard and in unity, we will be invincible," he added.
