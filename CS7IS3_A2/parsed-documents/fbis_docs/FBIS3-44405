The municipal government approved 3,650 foreign-funded projects involving contractual investment totalling 7.016 billion U.S. dollars last year, increases of 82 and 110 percent respectively over the previous year. A municipal government official in charge of foreign investment said that of the 120 transnational corporations set up in the city, 60 percent began to make profits last year. The city approved 205 large projects each with an investment exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars last year. These projects account for a total investment of 4.24 billion U.S. dollars, 60 percent of the total. The official noted that 1,037 of the approved projects are involved in banking, trading, commerce, real estate and improving urban infrastructural facilities. By the end of last year, more than 3,000 industrial projects had gone into production, becoming a new force in Shanghai's economic development. Experts here attributed the soaring investment in Shanghai to the large-scale development of the Pudong area, a newly-established economic zone, and the daily improvement of investment conditions. So far, the city has approved 6,939 foreign-funded projects with contractual investment totalling 13.705 billion U.S. dollars.
