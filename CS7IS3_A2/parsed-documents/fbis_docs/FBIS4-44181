While some countries of the former Eastern Bloc, such as Hungary, have reduced their intelligence activities in Germany considerably, Russia is "now, as then, pursuing very aggressive spying activities, particularly in the military sphere." This was said by State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who is responsible for coordinating the intelligence services in the Federal Chancellor's Office, in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Schmidbauer called on Russia to also adapt its intelligence efforts to the changed political situation. The "methods of the Cold War" must be "reduced step by step." We have "not noticed anything yet" regarding the "necessary drastic reduction" in Russia's intelligence activities in Germany, the state minister said. The Federal Intelligence Service [BND] office in Moscow -- one of more than 70 BND facilities in other countries -- was trying to increase cooperation with Russian intelligence services for the fight against organized crime and the prevention of nuclear smuggling. In the past few years, the BND has been able to get an insight into the logistics of those eastern smugglers that want to sell weapons-grade nuclear material on the European market. It is in this sphere that cooperation with the eastern intelligence services is beginning "to work." The BND has repeatedly "uncovered the smuggling of nuclear material" without informing the public. In most cases, the nuclear material appeared only in small quantities, mostly samples. In the past few years there has "hardly been a sphere in which the BND's effectiveness could not be proved convincingly," Schmidbauer said. It is due to the BND's activities that there was "not a second al-Rabitah," and in the "Mykonos trial" in Berlin the "BND's contribution has also been obvious." As a result of the changed situation after the end of the East-West conflict, the tasks have become more varied for the BND. Apart from proliferation, organized crime, money laundering, refugee smuggling and narcotics trade had become new areas in which the German intelligence services have become active. "Those who are aware of the increase in such crimes in those spheres know that, without the necessary information on the logistics and the background of these criminal organizations, we are unable to develop sensible defense strategies at home," Schmidbauer said. The new tasks of the BND require new investments as a result of the advance in technology. The participation in an intelligence satellite alone will "cost several hundred millions of German marks." The ultimate decision on Germany's participation in the French or the U.S. project is still pending. The decisionmaking process will involve fundamental issues in terms of security, foreign, economic, and research policy. While the U.S. satellites that are used for military purposes are said to have a resolution of 30 centimeters, most maps in the BND archives in Pullach have a resolution of only 10 meters. Cuts in BND personnel have reached the "absolute limit." The objective is to streamline the administration by 1996/97 and recruit "new experts in the spheres of organized crime, money laundering, and the narcotics trade." Asked whether, apart from Iran, the BND had relations with other countries suspected of supporting international terrorism, too, Schmidbauer said: "Intelligence services must have such contacts. They must conduct critical dialogue. They must get information. They are involved in the fates of abducted Germans or Germans in captivity. We cannot always chose our partners in the talks. A lot of what we describe as critical dialogue has yielded positive results -- for German citizens abroad, for the liberation of hostages, for the search of terrorists even on our own territory. We have to rely on such contacts." Of the about 6,500 BND employees, 3,500 are working in the headquarters at Pullach; others work in the 70 branch offices abroad (from Prague to Moscow and Damascus) or other facilities in Germany. The BND collects at least 80 percent of its information from open sources, mainly newspapers: from 1.5 million reports per year. Compared to that, "human sources" provide "only" about 80,000 reports, and technological intelligence provides some 100,000 reports. Moreover, there are about 12,000 documents provided by ambassadors each year and the reports from about 200 other intelligence services in the world with which the BND cooperates. On the basis of the huge amount of material collected, analysts in Pullach issue publications that are distributed to ministries, the Bundeswehr, and others with the note VS [Verschlussache -- classified document]. BND agents have told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that the procurement of military material from abroad "has always helped" to lower the enormous costs of the Defense Ministry, for example when "one got hold of Russian tanks of the most recent design," which were then tested for their vulnerability.
