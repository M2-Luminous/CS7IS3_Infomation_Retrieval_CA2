He graduated from Kharkov University, and has worked at Ukrainian newspapers and publishing houses. Completed graduate study at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Since 1987 he has been head of the Russian Language department of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences' Linguistics Institute. Doctor of philology, author of 13 books. Elected Supreme Council deputy by state list from Kustanay Oblast. Deputy chairman of the parliament's Committee on Culture, Press, Mass Media, and Public Associations. Today the parliament member answers our special correspondent's questions. [Gora] Well, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, the parliament, like a big boat--if one may put it this way--has reached the open sea of life. And it is very important for the deputies-oarsmen to take their places and work at full capacity. In my view, however, the parliamentary boat is moving in a quite leisurely way; a lot of time is spent on arguments, discussions, tongue lashing. What is your opinion on this subject? [Garkavets] The Greeks called boats of this class--that is, with so many oarsmen--catarga; the Turks called them galere, and the oarsmen took to the oars not because it was their calling; also, to ensure coordinated rowing, the methods used on these quite sturdy vessels were, to put it mildly, command-administrative. However, if we extend your metaphor to picture other branches of authority--as analogous big boats--then the parliament is the only surface vessel solidly moored to them: All its work, miscalculations, and shortcomings are in the public view, while the other seafaring vessels are predominantly of an underwater variety and are equipped not with oars but nuclear reactors. They are the ones pulling our society from one bright future to another--through thorns to the stars. And the neighboring flotillas, too, are trying to prevent us taking off on an independent voyage. While the blame falls on those who are exposed. That is why I think that in these conditions the parliament, in keeping with the will of the voters expressed during the elections, first and foremost must decide whether we really are going where the people want us to go, and whether we are doing so the right way. In order to define our strategy we have to first of all sort out interparliamentary relations. Therefore, some time has been spent on organizational matters. There were inevitable arguments and attacks. But it simply does not happen otherwise in collectives where everyone is equal. There are already some results of the discussion on the strategic issue: "Are we heading in the right direction and are we going about it the right way?" In its statement, produced after almost a week of debate on this issue, the parliament questioned the correctness of the course of socioeconomic and legal policy of the government. Now we will hear the government program of reforms, in particular, urgent measures for getting out of the crisis, into which it has led us in the first place. Although for objectivity's sake one has to admit that it could be several times worse. [Gora] All deputies have equal rights, but it is no secret that they have different potential. This means we can assume that in time some or other parliament member will simply be unable to carry the heavy load, to meet the high standards. Who can determine the effectiveness of a deputy's activities and recall him if he cannot handle his job? [Garkavets] Do I handle well, for instance, the "job of a professional parliament member?" And what is a "professional parliament member" and what is his job description? For many, including myself, these are notions that so far have not been precisely and clearly defined. We know for certain two things: We were elected by the people, and our only duty is to carry out the will of the people who elected us by the means set by the law. How to carry this out so that the work will be considered professional is still to be decided. The main criteria of parliamentary professionalism will be most graphically expressed in the laws on the Supreme Council and on the status of the Supreme Council deputy, and other related legislative acts. Then you can put the Supreme Council and its deputies to a real test. [Gora] Deputies of the former parliament stayed close to the population, met with voters quite frequently, conducted open dialogue, and reported on the work done and on carrying out the mandates. Now it appears that professional parliament members will not have much time for meetings, unless one counts short vacations. Will this not lead to isolation from the voters; will a wall of alienation not rise up between deputies and voters? [Garkavets] It is unlikely that the deputies of the current parliament will detach themselves from the population. Special time is set aside for work in the oblasts (districts). There also will be an assistant to the deputy, hired specifically for this purpose, working there. Anyway, our people know their way to the capital very well--they will not let us drift away. Being an armchair scholar, and having shifted only a few years ago from history and theory to the practice of ethnic and language policy, lawmaking in this area, as well as public work in the area of ethnic revival, in five to seven years I have accumulated such intensive contacts that a professional politician can only dream of. They will keep me on my toes. Especially considering that I, as the chairman on the public associations subcommittee, spend many hours every day in discussions with leaders of the republic's most active associations of citizens of diverse political leanings, ethnic, confessional, and other affiliation. [Gora] Factions have been established and are operating in the parliament. Can their activities exert perceptible influence in lawmakers' activism, the parliament members' quality of work? [Garkavets] I do not yet know about factions, even the radical-moderate faction of the National Congress of Kazakhstan, to which I belong as a member of party's political executive committee, but some deputy groups, which formed as we went, have already clearly made themselves count. For instance, the Progress group, which prepared the draft of the parliament's statement of no-confidence in the government's course of socioeconomic and legal policy. The work showed that the dialogue between deputy formations will be businesslike and constructive, and will serve society's consolidation instead of splitting it. Although in the conditions of economic stratification there are more then enough preconditions for a schism both in society and in parliament, first and foremost on a class basis. What will ensure calm in the parliament and a semblance of peace in the country, however, is not potential attempts to cajole deputies, practiced in exploiter states. Only concern for unprotected population strata, consistent implementation of the principle of pay according to labor, and priority support for goods producers--and in ethnic policy, the principle of equality--will preserve peace in Kazakhstan and the working zeal in parliament. [Gora] Lawmaking undoubtedly will require of parliament members daily strain, exhausting labor, and great intellectual and emotional efforts. In my opinion, an important part is the skill to conduct discussion in such a way as to prevent unneeded waves of emotions from arising. I do not want to hurt the feelings of any of your colleagues, but observations show that not everyone possesses the skills to conduct dialogue calmly. How do you raise the level of deputies' political culture? [Garkavets] Joint involved work--humanity has not invented a better teacher of ethics. Working together in committees, commissions, working groups, and plenary sessions, we will gradually, as they say, adjust. One cannot do without emotions, however. We are defining the principles of a state system, organization of production relations, participation in socially significant labor, and distribution of the aggregate product. This is not at all a semantic dissection of phrases comprising the law. [Gora] You were at the beginnings of the Ukrainian national center. I assume you still hold its concerns close to heart. What has it achieved, and what tasks is the center facing? [Garkavets] The main task today is the publication of Kazakhstan's republic-wide newspaper UKRAYINSKIY NOVYNY, which was founded by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan; the publisher is the republic publishing house Deuir. More than 150 Ukrainian newspapers and magazines are published outside Ukraine, where about 11 million Ukrainians live; there are also about 70 institutes, departments, and chairs. All of them, however, exist mainly on public money. Even to organize a chair of Ukrainian studies in Harvard University, which now has an independent Institute of Ukrainian Studies, 25 years ago the Ukrainian diaspora had to collect $2 million. Our newspaper, however, was from the very beginning financed by the state--the first state Ukrainian newspaper outside Ukraine. For Kazakhstan's Ukrainians, for Ukrainians all over the world, it is testimony to the true internationalism of the Kazakh people, who are building together with us, citizens of other nationalities, a sovereign democratic state. With great pleasure I serve as the newspaper's volunteer editor in chief. [Gora] And now a little about yourself. How do you spend whatever little free time you have, when you manage to find it? [Garkavets] I am continuing my work on a collection of folklore of Urum (Kypchak-language) Greeks in the Azov region, in four volumes--about 2,500 pages. There are about 400 pages left to go. I have been collecting material for more than 20 years in the Mariupol area, and now I can finally publish these texts together with the original 18th-19th century manuscripts. Then it will be time to publish a unique dictionary of this language. Also, I help my friends in forming art publications. I make computer-generated layouts for them. For instance, Sultan Orazelinov's photo album "Abai Eli" ("In the Abakh Land") will be published soon--it will be printed in the Czech Republic. In a month or two an American weekly newspaper about unusual and amazing events in the world--WEEKLY WORLD NEWS--will begin publication in Russian; it will also be printed in the Czech Republic. Initially it will be published twice a month. This is also my hobby.
