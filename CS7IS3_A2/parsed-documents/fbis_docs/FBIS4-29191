The PRC has maintained a cautious stance on imposing sanctions against the DPRK. As a result, it is expected that for the time being, behind-the-scenes maneuverings -- including possible revisions to the draft resolution -- will continue among UNSC member nations, with attention focused on how China will react to the U.S. proposal.
