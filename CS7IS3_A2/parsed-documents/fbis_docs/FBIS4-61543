FBIS4-61543 "drsov089_p_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Yerevan Denounces Baku's Stand on Nagorno-Karabakh Yerevan Denounces Baku's Stand on Nagorno-Karabakh LD0605180794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1452 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605180794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] [Text] Press secretary Levon Zurabyan of Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan told INTERFAX that Baku's refusal to negotiate a ceasefire on the line of confrontation between the Karabakh and Azeri forces proved that Baku's stand on Nagorno-Karabakh was short-sighted and that Baku still hoped to resolve the Karabakh problem by force. Zurabyan said Baku rejected all suggestions and initiatives for a settlement, as well as mediation by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia. In Zurabyan's view, its own policies led Baku up a blind alley. Zurabyan felt the key to the solution of the Karabakh problem lay in Baku because Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had repeatedly declared their willingness to negotiate an enduring ceasefire accommodation. IF Note: On Thursday the Azeri delegation to a two-day conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, held in Bishkek, refused to sign a protocol with a call for the introduction of a cease-fire as of 0000 on 9 May. The other participants in the two-day negotiations -- Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia and Kyrgyzstan -- signed the protocol. Baku rejects the document that makes no mention of the Armenian occupation of part of Azerbaijan and allows for the creation and introduction of a Commonwealth peacekeeping contingent in the disputed area. In addition, Baku suggested that the protocol, signed by Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole, must also be signed by Karabakh's Azeri community. The suggestion was rejected. Chairmen Babken Ararktsyan and Karen Baburyan of the Armenian and Karabakh parliaments told their Kyrgyz counterpart Medetkhan Sherimkulov in Bishkek Friday that on return to their home places they would work for a cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. Sherimkulov, who chairs the Karabakh peacekeeping group of the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, sees what Ararktsyan and Baburyan told him as response to his request for the unilateral introduction of a ceasefire at 0000 on 9 May. Sherimkulov intends to address Baku with a similar request. Ararktsyan praised the results of the Bishkek conference and told INTERFAX that the Armenians would take unilateral action to implement the Bishkek protocol. He hoped Baku would realize the impossibility of resolving the conflict by force.
