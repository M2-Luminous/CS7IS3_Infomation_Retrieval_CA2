ACTION: Notice of initiation of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review; consideration of revocation of order; preliminary results of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review; and intent to revoke order. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Prosser or Wendy J. Frankel, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; Telephone (202) 482&hyph;1130 and 482&hyph;0367, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background: On May 9, 1980, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (53 FR 40926) an antidumping duty order on Portable Electric Typewriters (PETs) from Japan (the order). On February 15, 1994, Smith Corona Corporation (Smith Corona), the petitioner in the underlying less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, submitted a request for a changed circumstances administrative review and revocation of the order based on the represented fact that the order no longer is of interest to the domestic interested parties. Smith Corona submitted this request contingent upon termination of the suspended antidumping investigation on portable electric typewriters from Singapore (A&hyph;559&hyph;806). Scope of Review The scope of the order covers PETs, automatic PETs (PATs), PETs incorporating a calculating mechanism, and certain personal word processors (PWPs). On August 7, 1990, in Preliminary Scope Ruling; Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan (55 FR 32107), the Department clarified the scope of the order, ruling that ``*␣*␣* certain later-developed PETS, including so-called `personal word processors', are presumptively of the same class or kind as PETs within the scope of the order *␣*␣*.'' The Department determined that to be of the same class or kind as a PET, a typewriter must meet the following seven physical criteria: (1) Be easily portable, with a handle and/or carrying case, or similar mechanism to facilitate portability; (2) be electric, regardless of source of power; (3) be comprised of a single, integrated unit; (4) have a keyboard embedded in the chassis or frame of the machine; (5) have a built-in printer; (6) have a platen (roller) to accommodate paper; and (7) only accommodate its own dedicated or captive software. The final scope ruling was published on November 13, 1990 (55 FR 47358). PETs, PATs, and certain PWPs are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) item numbers 8469.10.00, 8469.21.00, and 8469.29.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Our written description of the scope of this order is dispositive. This changed circumstance administrative review covers all manufacturers/exporters of PETs and PATs, and PETs incorporating a calculating mechanism manufactured in Japan and all manufacturers/exporters of those PWPs falling within the scope of the PETs order that are manufactured in Japan. Initiation of Changed Circumstances Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Consideration of Revocation of Order; Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative Review; and Intent To Revoke Order Pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), the Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Department determines, based on a review under section 751(b)(1) of the Act, that changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant revocation. Section 751(b)(1) of the Act requires a changed circumstances administrative review to be conducted upon receipt of a request containing sufficient information concerning changed circumstances.
