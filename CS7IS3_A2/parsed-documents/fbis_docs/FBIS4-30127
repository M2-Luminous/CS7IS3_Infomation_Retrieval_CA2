The decision has been made because concerns have been voiced in some quarters of the Japanese Permanent Mission to the United Nations, among other relevant offices, that "Japan is not making itself clear on this issue in comparison to Germany," as well as because the ministry has judged that the public now has a deeper understanding of the issue. MOFA plans to make stronger appeals to UN member nations in the process of unfolding its UN diplomacy and conducting bilateral talks. Currently, the issue of Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC is being discussed at a working-level panel on reforming the current framework of the UNSC, and efforts are underway toward working out details in preparation for a report which is to be compiled by September. In this connection, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa spoke at an Upper House Budget Committee meeting on 15 June, reiterating Japan's strong bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. He said: "Countries being considered as candidates for permanent membership in the UNSC has been narrowed down to Japan and Germany." Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, likewise, clearly indicated Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC when he used the term "permanent member of the UNSC" for the first time at an 8 June meeting of the working-level panel on reforming the UNSC framework. During the time of the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, such officials as then Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura were cautious about Japan's bid for a permanent membership in the UNSC. As a result, "distorted" relations existed between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA. However, such relations have ceased to exist under the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, resulting in improved relations between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA. Thus, MOFA is now able to take a more determined stance toward Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. All this has contributed to MOFA's stepping up its efforts in this direction. At the same time, MOFA's move has also been triggered by the fact that the results of a recent MOFA public poll have shown that a majority of the Japanese people support the nation's bid for permanent membership in the UNSC. However, opposition parties have raised objections to MOFA's stance. For example, Shusei Tanaka, acting representative of the Sakigake [Harbinger Party], has said: "MOFA is acting on its own. Sufficient debate has not been held to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of becoming a permanent member of the UNSC." A senior official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan has also said: "Currently, a broad understanding of the people has not been gained regarding the issue." Apparently, MOFA hopes to get the public involved in the issue by going as far as to stir up a controversy.
