Washington began contacts with European countries and rebels in south Sudan to implement a scheme to separate south Sudan from north Sudan and create an African state to protect U.S. and European interests in the Horn of Africa. President Bill Clinton asked the National Security Council to prepare a new plan to overthrow Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's regime to replace the plan that the CIA failed to implement last year. Sources reported that the new plan, which the U.S. National Security Council wants to implement before the middle of this year, focuses on the following factors: 1. Gathering the Libyan opposition forces in various parts of the world and agreeing with them on the "Salvation and Purge" plan as they call it. 2. Tasking U.S. ambassadors in various countries to meet Libyan opposition forces and discuss their requests for necessary funds and arms to implement the plan. 3. Asking particular Libyan opposition figures to hold contacts inside Libya with particular Libyan military commands qualified to participate in implementing the plan. 4. Agreeing with a country neighboring Libya to act as the assembly and staging point to carry out the plan. 5. Contacting particular European governments and agencies to participate in military and financial funding to implement the plan. Sources asserted that a U.S. National Security Council team will meet figures who call themselves Libyan opposition leaders in Washington in the next few weeks. These figures have received invitations to visit Washington for this purpose. A meeting was held in Washington with Sudanese rebels from south Sudan to prepare a plan. Washington bases its new plan against fraternal Sudan on the "Washington declaration" of last October. The U.S. Administration, which approves the secession of south Sudan, arranged this declaration for particular south Sudanese rebels. The new U.S. plan aims to incite the south Sudanese people to broaden their political and economic demands if the Sudanese Government insists on continuing the negotiations to solve the problem of south Sudan. The southerners will then escalate military operations in a bid to avoid Arab and African opposition to the establishment of a state in south Sudan and to convince African and Arab countries that a state in the south was established after negotiations with the Sudanese Government failed. The sources pointed out that Washington expressed a readiness for military intervention in favor of the southerners to implement the U.S. plan.
