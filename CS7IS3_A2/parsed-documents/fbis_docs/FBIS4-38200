AL-THAWRAH stresses that attempts to effect a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement are doomed to failure. Having undergone numerous tests, the strategic relations between Syria and Lebanon have emerged sound and safe, because they reflect vital national aspirations and interests. AL-THAWRAH notes that Lebanon adheres to a just, comprehensive peace based on UN resolutions. It will accept no peace without the full implementation of Resolution 425, as well as Resolutions 242 and 338. Lebanon is confident that its alliance and continued coordination and cooperation with Syria will thwart all Israeli attempts to weaken it. Syria and Lebanon have a common destiny. In its peace efforts and moves, Syria makes no distinction between the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. It insists on the implementation of Resolution 242 as much as it insists on the implementation of Resolution 425 on Lebanon. The paper says Lebanon knows well that in all of Syria's peace discussions, Resolution 425 has been an essential part of Syrian strategy. Speaking about Israel's attempts and distorted concept of peace, AL-THAWRAH says that what Israel frequently attempts to convey through its officials is not the desired peace nor the one provided for in the UN Security Council resolutions. For peace to be viable, it must comprehensive. Withdrawal from every inch of the Golan and withdrawal from every inch of southern Lebanon is the basis and prerequisite of peace; without it, there can be none. Israel should understand that Syria and Lebanon are not after just any peace. If Israel believes that its penetrations on other tracks will support it against the Arabs and that it can impose its terms, it is undoubtedly deluded. This is because Israel deeply knows that there is no peace without Syria, as everyone knows.
