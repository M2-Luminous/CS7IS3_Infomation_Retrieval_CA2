FR941102-1-00129 FR941102-1-00020 III. Request for Comment The Commission invites comment on all the issues raised in this release including expanding the definition of payment for order flow, the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10, the amendments to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 regarding disclosure of the value of payment for order flow and internalization/affiliate practices, inclusion of standardized options, and other approaches that address internalization/affiliate practices and payment for order flow, including a requirement that broker-dealers describe their order routing practices for all orders. The Commission also requests commenters to address the feasibility of adopting the proposed amendments to become effective on April 3, 1995, the date newly adopted Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 are to take effect. In addition to the specific requests for comment set forth above, the Commission requests comment on whether the proposed rule amendments, if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competition or would impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. Comments on the inquiry will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities under Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. IV. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. sec. 603 regarding the proposed rules. The following summarizes the conclusions of the IRFA. The IRFA uses certain definitions of ``small entities'' adopted by the Commission for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Analysis notes that the proposed rule amendments would require at the time an account is opened and on an annual basis thereafter, broker-dealers to disclose their policies for routing customer orders in exchange listed securities, provide the range of monetary payment for order flow received on a per share basis on the confirmation, the aggregate value of monetary payment for order flow, an estimate of the aggregate value of non-monetary payment for order flow and internalized/affiliate orders, and an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order flow and internalized/affiliate orders received by the broker-dealer on a per share basis on the confirmation. The proposals could necessitate changes to broker-dealer confirmation systems that generally do not provide that specific information now. Broker-dealers would need to keep records of payment for order flow to fulfill the disclosure requirements of the proposed rule amendments.

Ostergaard, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549, 202/942&hyph;3197.
