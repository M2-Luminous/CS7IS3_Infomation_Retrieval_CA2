FR941220-0-00086 FR941220-0-00014 The Department also proposed that ``interested party'' would be defined to include persons and entities who are affected by the employer's action or the investigative determination at issue. The Department did not propose that such an individual need be adversely affected. By using the term ``interested'' (rather than ``aggrieved'') to identify the parties for whom hearing opportunities would be offered, Congress clearly mandated a broader class of persons for these rights than for investigations in response to complaints. The Department's broad definition, based on the Department's experience, would encompass both private and public entities. Twenty-three NPRM commenters addressed these proposed definitions_18 opposed and 5 in support. All 10 business commenters and half of the trade association commenters were opposed to the proposal. Almost all commenters expressed the view that there was a connection between the Department's proposed definition of an aggrieved party and the Department's proposal regarding directed investigations; commenters viewed complaints from government agencies as an alternative avenue to achieving the opportunity to conduct directed investigations. See 1.g. (Directed Investigations) below. Two commenters to the Interim Final Rule proposed that the term ``aggrieved party'' should not include someone who provides frivolous or harassment complaints against an employer; these commenters also suggested that if the complainant's allegation is not sustained in a DOL proceeding, the complainant should be liable for any administrative costs incurred for the proceeding(s). The statute at 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A) provides that the Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation if there is reasonable cause to believe that an LCA-filing employer failed to meet a condition specified in the labor condition application or misrepresented a material fact in the application. A complainant providing such information has a right to provide it to the Secretary of Labor regardless of the complaint's resolution. Consequently, the Department cannot accept the proposal that the complainant should be liable for any administrative costs incurred from the proceeding(s). After reviewing the comments, legislative intent, and programmatic experience, the Department is promulgating these proposals to add these definitions as they appeared in the NPRM, in order to achieve the Congressional intent of protection for workers and other affected parties through fair and effective post-admission investigations and administrative hearings. g. Directed Investigations (See ยง XXXX .710.) As a result of its experience in operating the H&hyph;1B program and after consideration of the comments on the proposed rule, the Department has determined that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to limit its post-admission investigation of possible LCA violations to those where complaints have been filed by aggrieved parties. Thus the Final Rule allows post-admission investigations which the Department may conduct on its own initiative. This has no impact on the pre-admission LCA approval process. The change in no way contravenes the Congressional intent. Labor condition applications, as required under the INA, continue to be accepted and certified unless incomplete or obviously inaccurate. No extensive weighing of evidence or investigation is added to the pre-admission LCA process, and the entry of the H&hyph;1B workers to the United States and to the employment is in no way slowed. The change, however, facilitates enforcement by removing a regulatorily-imposed impediment from the Department's post-approval investigative authority, so that the program's purposes can be better served and covered workers better protected. The authority to conduct non-complaint investigations is not viewed nor intended by the Department as a mandate to conduct sweeping enforcement actions. Rather, in light of resource constraints and compelling enforcement priorities, the Department anticipates that its discretion for self-initiated investigations will be exercised sparingly, in circumstances where the Wage and Hour Administrator has reason to believe that H&hyph;1B violations may be occurring or have occurred. An investigation of an H&hyph;1B employer could be undertaken, for example, where the Administrator becomes aware of a possible violation of an employer's LCA as the result of information obtained in the course of an investigation of another employer, in the course of an investigation of the employer under another statute or another LCA, or as the result of the receipt of public information. The Final Rule brings the H&hyph;1B program in line with regulations and practice under the H&hyph;1A nonimmigrant nurses' program. See, e.g. , 20 CFR 655.400(b) and 655.405(a). Under the H&hyph;1A program, which has statutory enforcement language similar to the H&hyph;1B program, investigations have been conducted since the initiation of that program as a result of a complaint or otherwise, and there has been no sweeping directed enforcement program as a result. Id. ; see also 8 U.S.C. 1182 (m) and (n). Originally, the Department questioned its authority to conduct post-admission directed investigations under the H&hyph;1B program, because discussion of the enforcement aspects of the H&hyph;1B program in the legislative history spoke of it as being ``complaint-driven.'' However, re-examination of those statements_in context_shows that they consistently were made for the purpose of limiting DOL pre-acceptance review and investigation of the labor condition application; the statements were not directed to the scope of the Department's authority to investigate the LCA after it has been certified and the H&hyph;1B workers begin their employment. See, e.g. , 137 Cong. Rec. S18242, S18244 (November 26, 1992). In addition to being consistent with the Department's regulations and practice under the similar H&hyph;1A program, post-admission directed enforcement in the H&hyph;1B program clearly is not prohibited by and can be supported under an analysis of the language of the statute. Section 212(n)(2)(A) of the INA directs the Secretary to establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A). Section 212(n)(2)(B) states that, ``[u]nder such process [established pursuant to subparagraph (A)], the Secretary shall provide, within 30 days after such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C).'' 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(B). Unlike subparagraph (B), subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 212(n)(2), which provide for notice and opportunity for a hearing for failure to meet a condition, for sanctions, and for back pay orders, do not refer back to ``such process'' as must be established pursuant to subparagraph (A). 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2) (C) and (D). Thus, subparagraphs (C) and (D) stand on their own as processes for sanctioning employers which violate the terms of certified labor condition applications. Such employers may be placed in the subparagraphs (C) and/or (D) notice and hearing processes either as a result of a complaint and investigation under subparagraphs (A) and (B) or as a result of some other action, such as a post-admission investigation undertaken by the Department on its own accord. As indicated above, this is essentially the same statutory framework under which the Department investigates and sanctions H&hyph;1A program violations in the absence of a complaint. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E) (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v).
