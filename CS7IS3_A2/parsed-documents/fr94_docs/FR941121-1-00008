FR941121-1-00008 FR941121-1-00003 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 70 [FRL&hyph;5110&hyph;2] RIN 2060&hyph;AE&hyph;72 Operating Permits Program Rule Revisions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA). ACTION: Extension of comment period for proposal to revise the operating permits program regulations. SUMMARY: On August 29, 1994, EPA proposed in the Federal Register (59 FR 44460) revisions to the operating permits regulations in part 70 of chapter I of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The comment period provided in that notice was 90 days, closing on November 28, 1994. Today's action extends that comment period an additional 45 days until January 12, 1995. DATES: Comments on the changes to the part 70 regulations proposed on August 29, 1994 at 59 FR 44460 must be received by January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments must be mailed (in duplicate if possible) to: EPA Air Docket (LE&hyph;131), Attn: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;50, room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Trutna (telephone 919/541&hyph;5345), mail drop 12, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Information Transfer and Program Integration Division, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Part 70 contains regulations requiring States to develop, and submit to EPA for approval, programs for issuing operating permits to major, and certain other, stationary sources of air pollution. The minimum elements of operating permits programs are contained in part 70 which was promulgated on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250). Subsequent to promulgation of part 70, nearly 20 entities, including State and local governments, environmental groups, and industry associations, petitioned for judicial review of the part 70 regulations. One of the key aspects of the litigation and of an operating permits program is the system for revising permits to incorporate changes at permitted sources. Several requests for an extension of the comment period on the proposal notice have been received to allow time for preparation of comments primarily on how to fashion a more workable permit revision system. Because of the complexity of the proposed revisions, potential commenters assert that the 90-comment period provided is not long enough to prepare comprehensive comments on the permit revision system as well as all the other proposed revisions. An additional 45 days is therefore being provided for development and submittal of comments. Dated: November 15, 1994. Mary D. Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.
