Police here, who worked with the Criminalpol branch and the special narcotics squad, said Vincenzo Mobilio, 38, was stopped today at a toll booth east of Milan leading off the Venice-Milan expressway where they found 100k [kg] of uncut heroin in the boot of his car. He had been under close surveillance since Tuesday afternoon [1 February] when he left Milan for Venice. The suspect is from a town in the southern Calabria region and now lives in Milan with his wife and three children. He is thought by investigators to be on the payroll of the Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta. A police spokesman said the heroin had been "professionally packaged" in one-kilogram insulated bags "with a technique of great precision, something new for us." The goods could have been cut seven times, seven kilograms for retailing for each kilogram of the Turkish-produced drug. Milan Police Chief Achille Serra reported that the haul was the biggest since November 1985 when a shipment of 114k [kg] was seized here. He also explained that the wholesale price of this type of heroin has doubled over the past year, to nearly 50,000 dollars per kilogram, because traffickers have been experiencing increasing difficulty in laying hands on the Turkish goods.
