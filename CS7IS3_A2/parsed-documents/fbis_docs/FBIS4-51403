Practice shows that this system conforms to the development and the changes of the rural situation; satisfies the broad masses of the peasants's urgent demands and strong desires for defining collective property rights, conducting property cooperation, and expanding the scale of production and management; and accelerates the pace of having the peasants become fairly well-off. Just as what we did in those years to carry out the system of contracted responsibility for production, we should persistently proceed from reality to develop shareholding cooperative enterprises, fully respect the enthusiasm and creativeness of the masses, give free reins to the development of these enterprises, adopt different forms according to different actual conditions, try every possible means to expand the scale of the implementation of this system and to accelerate the implementation pace, not stick to one pattern, and not demand uniformity. To encourage the development of shareholding cooperative enterprises, we should formulate preferential policies on developing such enterprises; regard such enterprises as collective ones; give them preferential treatment in the scale of management and in the aspects of management, new product development, technological transformation, capital input, tax reduction and exemption, industrial and commercial management, and capital construction; and create conditions for developing such enterprises. Now, the shareholding cooperative enterprises in the rural areas can roughly be divided into four categories as follows: The enterprises of the first category are set up by pooling capital from among the people. With township and village cooperative economic organizations acting as go-between, the peasants are voluntarily organized to manage the projects through accurate selections and according to the agreements that they have attained. Those whose stocks amount to a large proportion or technicians should be enterprise leaders. The enterprises of the second category are set up by collectives with shares. Township and village collectives can become shareholders by offering land, workshops, equipment, and means of production as well as investing some money. Peasants can become shareholders by investing money. Shareholders can enter plants with capital or make investment instead of labor. All shareholders can draw extra dividends. The enterprises of the third category are organized by various sectors. These enterprises' shares are owned by peasants, enterprises, township and village collectives, and society. Boards of directors will assume responsibility for the management of these enterprises. The enterprises of the fourth category are set up through joint management and cooperation. As shareholders, urban and rural institutions and their staff members and workers can cooperate with rural collectives to develop projects and run enterprises, break with the bounds of trades, and become shareholders by offering capital, technologies, land, and other production factors. Besides the aforementioned four categories, we should persist in various forms in the course of development, respect the aspirations of the masses, avoid rigid mediation, and ensure the sound development of the shareholding cooperative enterprises. At the time of vigorously running shareholding cooperative enterprises, we should focus the change of enterprise mechanisms on transforming the existing enterprises into shareholding cooperative ones. Through the forms of converting into stocks and expanding stocks, we should transform the existing enterprises into shareholding cooperative ones, further define property rights, intensify the staff and workers' awareness of being the masters of enterprises, perfect the enterprise democratic management and supervision mechanisms, guarantee and increase the value of enterprise assets, and enhance the reserve strength for enterprises' development. In the course of transformation, we should give different instructions to different enterprises. We should proceed from the increment of enterprises' property and promote, in a step- by-step manner, the transformation of enterprises first from those in danger and with difficulties and those in urgent need of expanding the scale of production. Practice shows that the following five enterprise transformation patterns can vigorously be carried out: First, the pattern of one enterprise with various systems. The enterprises which are on a larger scale and have larger amounts of debts and the difficulties in continuing their management are allowed to have parts of their enterprises with vitality carry out the shareholding cooperative system. The rest parts should be auctioned, rent, or managed on a mortgage or contracted basis. That is, an enterprise can carry out various systems. These enterprises' debts should be repaid year after year by their head plants which rely on collecting rent and contracted charges. Second, the pattern of measuring property. The enterprises whose plants are built with collective investment, whose property value has increased by a big margin, and whose staff members and workers have made great contributions as well as those with small profits and capability to maintain their production should thoroughly conduct transformation by sorting out and assessing property, defining property rights, and converting property into stocks and marketing these stocks to rural collectives, enterprises, and staff members and workers. Third, the pattern of increment of property. The enterprises with good economic results, readily marketable products, and appropriate prospects for development but in need of more working funds to develop new projects, to increase new products, and to expand the scale of production and management should externally draw stockholders and investment to expand the increment of property and internally define property rights to staff members and workers. Simultaneously, a portion of these enterprises' stocks should be controlled by rural collectives and the rest should be marketed to society. Fourth, the pattern of transferring property rights. The enterprises with less property, small profits, or deficits; on a smaller scale; and without hope to change their situation within a short period of time under the restrictions of objective conditions should sort out and evaluate their property, fix prices for themselves, and market themselves to stockholders so that they will become shareholding cooperative enterprises without collective money paid for shares. Meanwhile, rural collectives should withdraw the money from marketing property rights to develop another new enterprises. Fifth, the pattern of shareholding companies. The enterprises with different scales, economic results, and management forms as well as with certain difficulties in independent development and that supplement with one another to a certain extent through cooperation should be organized into shareholding cooperative companies with key enterprises playing a dominant role. These companies can rely on their collective advantages to pioneer markets. In line with the principles of development before standardization, of standardization in the course of development, and of transformation after standardization, we should standardize the systems governing formulating regulations, defining property rights, setting up organizations, exercising management, distributing extra dividend, and making guaranteeing measures so as to organize, perfect, transform, and standardize town and township enterprises' shareholding cooperative systems. First, it is necessary to scientifically calculate stocks and reasonably define stock rights. According to the principles of voluntary purchases of stocks, of equality between shareholders, of shareholders with the same amounts of stocks being distributed with the same amounts of profits, and of sharing profits and running risks on equal terms, we should mainly establish stocks for the rural areas, society, social legal persons, foreign investors, and individuals. We should define the total volume of enterprise stocks and the price for each stock to enable all the staff members and workers of the newly built enterprises and the enterprises whose increment has been expanded to buy enterprise shares so as to enhance their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility to run the enterprises well and to enable their staff and workers to have both rights and duties and not only to participate in management but also to run risks. The staff members and workers of these enterprises must not get a refund for their stocks. The shareholders who are not working at enterprises should neither be engaged in management and policy-making nor get a refund of their money for shares before expiration of their terms. But, they can be distributed with fixed amounts of dividends. To ensure that enterprises have sufficient reserve strength for development, we should define enterprises' property accumulated by enterprises themselves and added through state tax reduction and exemption as enterprise stocks. The profits distributed to enterprises according to the enterprise stocks can only be retained by enterprises for use to expand production. That is, enterprise stocks must not be obtained by any individuals. Second, it is necessary to perfect organizations, regulations, and systems. To strengthen the leadership and management of the shareholding cooperative enterprises, these enterprises should set up the systems to hold meetings of shareholders and shareholders congresses. These meetings and congresses can elect and produce boards of directors and boards of supervisors; define rights and duties for the boards, methods for producing enterprise legal persons, management strategies, methods for establishing and managing funds paid for shares, and major policies on distribution of profits; formulate enterprise regulations and systems for management of financial affairs, labor, materials, and quality to standardize enterprises' activities. Third, we should take all aspects into consideration and achieve the distribution of profits. We should focus the standardization of shareholding cooperative enterprises on distribution of extra dividends; take into consideration the profits of owners, managers, and producers; ensure the payment of various taxes to the state; guarantee that enterprises have sufficient reserve strength for development; combine the principle of distribution according to work with that of distribution according to stocks; and accurately handle the ratios in the distribution of labor wages. According to the demands for expansion of production, enterprises should annually obtain a portion of after-tax profits, convert this portion of money into stocks, and distribute these stocks to shareholders for use to expand production. The enterprises that are in the initial stage of carrying out the shareholding cooperative system are allowed to carry out the policy on retaining interests and distributing extra dividends so as to encourage increasingly more people to buy stocks and to become major shareholders. The interests of the money paid for stocks should be listed into production and management costs. Shareholding cooperative enterprises should be treated as rural collective enterprises, enjoy all preferential policies, and draw and use various special funds according to the standards for collective enterprises.
