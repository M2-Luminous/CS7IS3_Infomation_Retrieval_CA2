Under the plan, two assistant minister-level posts--assistant minister for international policy coordination and one in three standing members at the Fair Trade Commission [FTC]--were abolished. The plan also called for abolishing two director-general posts, one in the international policy coordination office and economic information and education bureau. At the same time, eight director-level posts in the international policy coordination office, economic information and education bureau and performance evaluation bureau were scrapped. Instead, five director-level posts--three in the budget office and two in the FTC--will be established to adapt to the changing economic environment, resulting in a net loss of three director-level posts, EPB officials said. The EPB said the organizational change came in response to a widely-claimed principle for a "small but efficient" government which President Kim Yong-sam has advocated consistently since taking office last February. Analysts said the EPB moves will spark a chain reaction to slim down other government ministries which have been concerned about public clamor for a small government. Under the plan, an assistant economic planning minister will be authorized to oversee the function of the now-defunct assistant minister for international policy coordination. The international policy coordination office will be scaled down to a bureau which will encompass five divisions and will be led by two directors general. The most striking of the EPB's organizational changes was to establish a new bureau commissioned by a director general fully in charge of the defense budget in the budget office. The EPB said the establishment of a new bureau in the budget office is aimed at making a thorough examination of the defense budget which has long remained as a sanctuary in the government budgeting process. Analysts said now the EPB will be able to examine government outlays made under the Yulgok military buildup program, which has stirred a major controversy over irregularities recently.
