They arrived from Damascus in US embassy cars and crossed at this border post, 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Beirut, which was guarded by 50 Lebanese troops. The motorcade, flanked by 10 jeeps carrying members of the Lebanese army's special forces, then headed for the nearby village al-Sultan Ya'qub, where three Israeli soldiers went missing during a battle with the Syrians in 1982. Syria agreed in December to assist the congressional team to try to shed light on the fate of the six men, a move Israel hailed as a step forward for the peace process. Only airman Ron Arad is believed to be still alive. The Americans met families of the missing men in Israel on Thursday, and had talks in Damascus on Saturday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.
