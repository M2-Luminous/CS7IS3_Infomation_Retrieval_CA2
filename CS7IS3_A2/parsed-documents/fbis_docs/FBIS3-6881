[Hanaoka] Do you feel any aftereffects from the aborted cabinet reshuffle? [Ouchi] If a decision had been made to reshuffle the cabinet, it would have been split into a bloc led by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the DSP, and a group composed of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The coalition's centripetal force would have been weakened too. The prime minister's decision to give it up was the right one. [Hanaoka] What do you think of moves by Shinseito and the Japan New Party [JNP] to form a joint parliamentary group? [Ouchi] Shinseito is probably trying to make rapid advances on the JNP with the argument that it is better that they cooperate with the JNP and create a fresh image than form a bloc with Komeito. I have a feeling that the prime minister is willing to cooperate with Sinseito. [Hanaoka] What is the SDPJ going to do about that? [Ouchi] There will be a freshness and the necessary organizational backup if the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and the DSP form a core group. I think this is the best way as far as the people are concerned. However, I am not certain if we will move in that direction following the possible breaking of a pledge the JNP made to Sakigake and the differences in opinion within the JNP. It is not an issue for our party alone. The important thing is to deepen discussions. [Hanaoka] Would you accept an offer to join Shinseito and the JNP if they ask you to? [Ouchi] I never thought about it. The issue of forming a joint parliamentary group is linked to reorganization of the political world. It is not a simple matter of having everybody join the group. We would like to make a decision after making it sure what other parties' intentions are. [Hanaoka] Are you going to meet Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata and representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa? [Ouchi] It is possible, of course. I, as a chairman of the DSP, have to make a decision at the final stage. [Hanaoka] The phrase -- union of "liberal SDPJ and DSP" -- sounds good. However, I think there are considerable ideological differences between the two parties. [Ouchi] The SDPJ has to renew itself, change its fundamental policies, and get rid of the leftist line if it wants to play a central role in reorganization of the political world. The top leaders of the SDPJ know that the party will be isolated unless they change. The party has a potential to change. [Hanaoka] Do you think a joint parliamentary group or a new new party [shin shinto] will be formed? [Ouchi] It is certain we will have an upper house election next year, but I think a there will be a lower house election before that. As upper house election candidates start campaigning up to one year before the elections, we will be forced to make a decision this summer on the formation of any new organization. We have to appeal to voters to find out what sort of political forces candidates will have as their support bases. We have to find the direction of our political reorganization before the summer. The standard tactic is to form a party and clarify party policies rather than trying to get eight coalition parties cooperate in elections through the nomination of joint candidates. However, it is not a matter of our party alone. The next best way is to cooperate with each other to put up joint candidates. [Hanaoka] Differences in tactics will be fatal to a grand union [daido danketsu]. [Ouchi] It will be a dictatorship if such a union allowed one particular person to freely steer the government in the way he or she wanted. Mr. Ozawa has explained to each coalition party that he will not allow that to happen. We need to talk about this point very carefully. [Hanaoka] Some people think Mr. Ozawa's power is necessary to settle pending issues. [Ouchi] I do not think so. I think we were able to create the centripetal force needed to maintain the Hosokawa administration because the SDPJ has compromised by accepting things that they never had previously, and also because the eight coalition parties exercised self-restraint. [Hanaoka] What do you think of the current Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? [Ouchi] Reorganization of the political world is an issue that faces all political forces, including the LDP. I think the LDP will split if there is a major change. The DSP is primarily a democratic party. It is close to the LDP, therefore, and there is a foundation from which we can promote dialogue between ourselves. On the other hand, we are far from the SDPJ. We are not returning to the LDP's side, even if support for the Hosokawa administration drops. The LDP has lost self-confidence. I think the LDP is trying to somehow outgrow its former self. [Hanaoka] It seems that the LDP tactically trying to take the budget hostage. [Ouchi] President Yohei Kono's Diet question was a de facto declaration of his intention to recapture power. The LDP will, in all probability, take a tough line and try to prevent us from holding budget committee meetings. This tactic will have a major impact on the future organization of the political world. The scene for the political realignment will change completely if the Hosokawa administration makes mistakes. The LDP is, in particular, pursuing the issue of the prime minister's 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin. There is no knowing what they will do. [Hanaoka] What do you think will happen in next year's Tokyo gubernatorial election? Do you think Governor Suzuki will win a fifth term? [Ouchi] We should not allow that to happen, though I cannot predict how the election will turn out.
