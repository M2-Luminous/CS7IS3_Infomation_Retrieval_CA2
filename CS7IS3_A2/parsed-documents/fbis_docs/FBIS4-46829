Davydov: "Wages--on Time; From a Conference Call in the Ministry of Railways"] [Text] The continuing drop in transport operations and the inoperative payments mechanism do not leave hopes for a quiet life for the railroad workers. Despite the fact that hauls of freight and passengers are being steadily achieved, the sector's economic situation is very alarming. As First Deputy Minister O. A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent conference call, approximately a third of March wages had not yet been financed by 12 May, although based on the dates it was already time to distribute those for April. We have written more than once what the reasons are for such a situation. The problems among problems is the shortage of "live" money in the revenue accounts of the railroads due to the clients' inability to pay. It has already become a rule that in the best case half of the funds earned is received in money and the rest is mutual write-offs, the products of debtor enterprises, etc. But in order to pay the entire March wages and, let's say, half of April's before the end of May, no less than 924 billion rubles, which represents 57 percent of all earnings from transport operations, needs to be collected in the accounts. If one considers that in April the railroads received less than 42 percent of the planned earnings in cash, then it becomes clear how difficult a task remains to be resolved. It is difficult to expect positive results without laborious daily work to reduce debts, cut expenditures and increase revenues and without bringing the contingent of service personnel in line with the volumes of transport operations, reducing outlays from non-intact hauls, fines for delays in the delivery of freight, etc. And the fact is that one needs to finance not only the wage fund of the railroads and the plants, but also to settle accounts with the funds from the withholdings for social needs (social insurance, the pension fund, medical insurance, etc.--39 percent all told) and with taxes into the state budget. The circumstance that on a number of railroads an unfounded wage increase, so to speak, more than the right which the basic wage agreement grants, has been permitted, exacerbates the situation. Thus, the growing expenditures for these purposes to a certain degree have become the catalyst for prolonging the time periods for settlements with the labor collectives. They exceeded the wage fund (relative to December 1993) during the first quarter on the October and Sverdlovsk railroads by more than R14 billion. The overexpenditure on the West Siberian and Far Eastern railroads is two times less, but also very substantial. The rates, as we can see, exceed what has been planned. The Ministry of Railways and the trade union central committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the accelerated indexing of wages further complicates the task of liquidating payment arrears. Especially as the right to accelerated indexing was envisaged by the basic wage agreement only for the first quarter. However, the leaders of the Gorkiy, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk and certain other mainlines have already in April carried out a 12-17 percent increase in wages, although the forecast of the growth in consumer prices (in accordance with which indexing in the second quarter should be carried out) was no more than 10 percent and actually came to less than 9. All this has been negatively reflected in the attempts to liquidate the wage arrears. For now they are distributed on time only on the Moscow and Kaliningrad railroads. This is a serious problem for almost all the remaining railroads. Which, as a matter of fact, has been confirmed by the statements of the leaders of the mainlines during the conference call. Nevertheless, the roads have supported the strategic line proposed by the ministry--to enter into a normal rhythm of wage distribution by Railroad Workers Day. Briefly, the essence of the strategy comes down to the following. Wages for March should be fully paid before 20 May, for April by 15 June, for May by 5 July, and for June prior to 30 July. Thus, we will enter into a normal payment regime with the June wages. That is, one needs to recover R3.3 billion in money from the clients, which represents 48.9 percent of planned earnings during this period, in two and a half months. The task is extremely complex but, as the discussion has indicated, feasible. It was especially emphasized that the amount designated is sufficient provided that not a single ruble goes for other needs. There can be no such thing in life and that is why the task has been set of recovering no less than 60 percent of the earnings in money. And, what is more, of more fully utilizing other sources for obtaining money. First, selling the products received on the debts' account quicker. This can yield about R100 billion every month. Secondly, through other receipts (local revenues, penalties, fines, various services, etc.) the monthly increase can come to no less than another R60 billion. And, finally, the ministry has called for the more active recovery of debts from so-called other clients. For the system as a whole they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult matter, but transportation can no longer continue to carry the debt. As O. A. Moshenko has emphasized, write-offs, debts, earnings--all must now be specifically accounted for and each railroad chief must have a detailed plan on his desk for whose implementation daily monitoring is required. The conference participants have come to the conclusion that for the system as a whole receipts of "live" money into the revenue accounts of the railroads need to be increased by 6 percent, which will permit the financing of wages in conformity with the schedule that has been adopted. But this is on the average. And the Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and Baykal-Amur roads need to have 65-75 percent more such earnings. The collectives of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East Siberian, Far Eastern and Kuybyshev railroads also have to put in some serious work in this area. One cannot hush up the fact that the situation at the sector's plants is even worse than in transport itself. Of course, the amounts required here are of an order smaller but it is not easier for the working people of the enterprises for that reason. However, funds for the payment of wages to the workers of the Ministry of Railways' plants are also called for in the figure of R3.3 trillion indicated above. Serious complaints have been expressed to the leaders of the shipping roads which occasionally "forget" about their financial obligations relative to the transit roads. Here's a special question for you--recovery of debts from the railroad administrations of the CIS countries, which are already reaching R400 billion. In summing up the conversation that had taken place, the first deputy minister called upon the leaders of the mainlines to display greater exactingness towards clients and to not by-pass non-traditional revenues which however directly "knock" against the railroad workers. And the main thing is to search and find unordinary ways of increasing revenues and cutting expenditures.
