The opposition decided to withdraw from the pact because the Colorado Party has filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a law that prevents military and police officers on active duty from being members of political parties. The decision to withdraw from the talks was announced yesterday by Juan Manuel Benitez Florentin, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party [PLRA]; by Miguel Angel Montaner, president of the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; and by Victor Sanchez Villagra, president of the Febrerista Revolutionary Party [PRF]. The opposition leaders noted that they were withdrawing from the interparty board until the respective executive boards of their parties decide the course of action to be taken. They will have to decide whether to withdraw once and for all from the interparty talks because the Colorado Party failed to honor its promise to request the annulment of Article 2, not of the entire law. [passage omitted] The PLRA, PDC, and PRF members are already discussing the possibility of forming a united opposition front to decisively support the transition process to democracy. They believe President Wasmosy is now lacking adequate political support because even the Colorado Party executive board has made a proposal that contradicts the president's decision. [passage omitted] The PRF yesterday issued an official communique to state its position on the governability pact. The PRF announces that it is withdrawing its representatives from the interparty board in protest over the Colorado Party petition that the law temporarily suspending the party memberships of military and police officers on active duty be declared unconstitutional. The communique adds that the PRF categorically rejects the duplicity observed in the Colorado party's political actions because, on the one hand, it committed itself to institutionalizing the Armed Forces and the Police, but on the other, it is revealing its regressive goal of attempting to revive the nefarious practice of identifying the party with the state and with the Armed Forces, a concept which is absolutely totalitarian and which we thought had been eradicated.
