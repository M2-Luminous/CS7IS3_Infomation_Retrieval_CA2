Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] Representatives of the Pacific Fleet consider the concern of domestic and foreign nature conservationists about the problem of liquid radioactive waste in the Maritime Kray unfounded. Valeriy Danilyan, chief of the fleet service of radioactive and chemical defense, related at a meeting with Greenpeace movement activists that the radioactivity of this waste was so low -- 0.07 to 0.08 curie -- that it could be compared to the background radiation of the Sea of Japan, and did not endanger it in any way. Furthermore, the economic expenses of constructing an unnecessary, in principle, complex for processing the waste promise to be very substantial. However, international experts do not share such a complacent attitude, and believe that both Russia and Japan, which volunteered to help it, procrastinate in an unforgivable manner in solving the problem of utilization of nuclear waste in the Maritime Kray.
