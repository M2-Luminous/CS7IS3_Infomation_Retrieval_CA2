Would you characterize yourself as one? [Tsochev] When on 16 May Professor Berov invited me and I was asked to stand for the post of trade minister, the first question that I asked was who was proposing me. The prime minister answered that I was his candidate and that he had agreed my candidature mainly with professionals in the field of foreign trade. [Bashlieva] Do you know the identities of these professionals? [Tsochev] They were not named, but Prof. Berov said that many of the people whom he had consulted had given, though it is embarrassing for me to say so, a positive assessment of my work. The condition that I set was that I do not want any political force to stand behind me, making me its hostage in the government of experts that I believe this government represents. [Bashlieva] Did the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] set any conditions for supporting you? [Tsochev] Certainly not. Our conversation was correct, in terms of finding out who I was -- where I had worked, what sort of job I had done, and they were pleased to receive a negative reply to the question whether I had been in the state security system. Was I a member of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party]? Yes, until 1990, since when I have been nonparty. [Bashlieva] How do you explain that the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] parliamentary group did not invite you to meet them? [Tsochev] Many of the BSP's economists do not know me. [Bashlieva] Why did you accept Prof. Berov's invitation to join his team? [Tsochev] I find this an interesting challenge. The know-how that I have acquired in 20 years work in state government and two years in the private sector gives me grounds to want to try to do something for Bulgaria. I would not like to sound immodest, but I come from private business and am materially secure, although unfortunately I will have to put my company into deep freeze while I serve as a minister. [Bashlieva] Is life easier in private business? [Tsochev] Yes, but my zodiac sign is Aries, so I am the kind of man who seeks a challenge. [Bashlieva] You mentioned that you do not expect to work miracles. Nevertheless, what ambitions do you have as you accept your ministerial post? [Tsochev] I have a few ideas, but first of all want to see what has been done so far in the trade sector. I will meet Mr. Karabashev [former trade minister] today. [Bashlieva] Are you prepared to make any assessment of what he has achieved? [Tsochev] I do not think I am entitled to do so. [Bashlieva] Do you have any impressions about the team with which Mr. Karabashev worked, and are you considering making any changes to it? [Tsochev] So far I have not met the team, but I will be meeting everyone. At this stage I do not intend to dismiss or appoint anyone. However, this does not mean that anyone who commits a professional gaffe will not go. [Bashlieva] What are your initial ideas? [Tsochev] They relate mainly to the foreign trade sector -- stimulating exports, protecting domestic production, and making it possible for us to recover our positions in foreign markets. In a week's time my team and I will announce a two-stage program -- for the next three months and until the end of the year. [Bashlieva] Can you say anything more specific? [Tsochev] One man does not make a team. Please let me first hear what the people with whom I am to work have to say.
