FR940830-0-00065 FR940830-0-00013 Basis for Appeals Comment: Commenters also indicated a need for a full explanation of the calculation of formula amounts announced each year by HUD to determine if they have a valid basis for appeal. Currently, HUD issues virtually no information on how the amounts are calculated from year to year, other than the formula characteristics which HUD uses as input to the formula. Commenters requested that HUD provide a simplified explanation to all HAs, including such factors as any set-asides HUD is making each year off the top of the modernization, the R.S. Means or other factors HUD is using to adjust local allocation levels, and any deductions HUD is making against the HA's allocation. Response: HUD intends to prepare a Notice each FFY that explains any modernization set-asides, deductions and carry-over funds and the amount of funds allocated to the CIAP and the CGP. HUD will also provide information relative to the R.S. Means Index used for that FFY. The formula characteristics data used to calculate the formula amount will be transmitted to the HA with its formula amount. Appeals Comment: HUD gives HAs 30 days to review and advise HUD of errors in the FCR. It does not specify the calculation of the 30 days. It is recommended that the regulation be redrafted to state ``30 days from the HA's receipt to review and advise HUD of errors'' because of previous delays ( e.g ., up to 15 days before HAs received this year's report). Currently, the appeal of a HA's annual formula allocation can only be based on unique circumstances. HAs suggest that this is inappropriate and should be changed, but they realized that this would require a statutory amendment. HAs want to be able to appeal their allocation if it is based on calculations that inaccurately represent a HA's real modernization needs. It was also noted that the increase in the amount of time a HA has to appeal based upon error from 30 to 60 days equalizes the HUD&hyph;HA partnership for appeals based both on error and unique circumstances. However, if HAs do not file within the time period, they forfeit their appeal rights. In the spirit of true partnership, it was suggested that if HUD fails to respond to an appeal in either situation within 60 days, HUD should forfeit its right to reject the appeal. Further, they stated that this would only be effective and fair if HUD officials do not automatically disapprove an appeal in order to extend the time period. Response: HUD acknowledges past difficulty in ensuring that HAs had a full 30 days to review and return the FCR. It would be difficult to track a HA's receipt of the FCR on an individual basis, and there is a need for a fixed time for HAs to respond. Because the data changes little on an annual basis, HA review time should be minimal. As previously noted, HUD will send out the FCR prior to the end of the FFY, ( e.g., mid-August), and HA responses will not be due until after October 1. In addition, HUD has revised the regulation to provide that the HA will have at least 30 days to review and correct errors in the FCR. Although the commenters recognized that a statutory amendment would be necessary to allow other bases for appeals of the annual formula allocation, HUD would like to point out that the formula is based on data collected from a major study of the modernization needs of public and Indian housing agencies. This formula is being used because the modernization needs study could not provide statistically valid data on modernization needs for every HA. The formula by its nature cannot be completely accurate in estimating the needs at each HA participating in the CGP, but does provide for a reliable source of funds to all participating HAs. HAs should also recognize that, because this formula funds on the basis of relative needs of HAs, a successful appeal by one HA results in the reduction of formula allocations to all other HAs. HAs are also advised that the appeals no longer have an extra layer of HUD review. The review and approval of appeals on the basis of error in data and of the reduced formula because a PHA is mod-troubled have been delegated to the Field Offices, and this should facilitate HUD's responding to those appeals within the 60-day time frame. The approval of appeals on the basis of unique circumstances will be approved at the Headquarter's level following review at the Field Office level. The review at the Regional Office level has been eliminated. Therefore, HUD has not adopted the suggestion that an appeal is considered approved if HUD does not approve/disapprove within 60 days. Reallocation of Funds Withheld From Mod-Troubled HAs Comment: One commenter noted that HUD should be more aggressive in recapturing CGP and CIAP funding which has not been obligated or expended in a timely manner and should also be more aggressive about reallocating CGP funding withheld from mod-troubled HAs. It was urged that these funds should be reallocated in a timely fashion to HAs who have proven that they can obligate and expend the funds in a timely fashion. Commenters were concerned that FFY 1995 CGP funding would be reduced for all HAs because of the amount of unobligated and unexpended funds. Instead, they suggested that HUD add recaptured and reallocated funds to new congressional appropriations to put the money where it will get utilized. HAs indicated that it was unfair to penalize high performing HAs because some HAs have been negligent in obligating and expending their funds. Response: The commenter should note that section 14 of the Act, as amended, provides the methodology and eligibility for the reallocation of funds. The Act also establishes a credit system to provide a HA with additional funding after the HA is determined to be no longer mod-troubled, to compensate for amounts not received because of the mod-troubled designation. The Department views the recapture of funds from a HA as a last resort since recapture adversely impacts on the residents who have to continue to live in housing which needs rehabilitation. HUD staff is directed to exhaust all other means of technical assistance, including requiring alternative oversight by a third party, to help HAs obligate and expend funds. However, where such assistance does not work, HUD will recapture funds. In response to the concern regarding possible reduction in CGP funding, HUD has amended its FY 1995 budget request to increase by $100 million funding for modernization up to $2.9 billion. Obligation of Formula Funding Comment: Most commenters agreed with the concept of fungibility of work items to promote expenditure of oldest funds first and recommended various ways that HUD could further speed up the process. First, to speed the flow of funds in the modernization pipeline, HUD should substantially speed up HUD's own release of the modernization funds each year. The commenters believed that most HAs do not get a funding reservation until late summer each year. HUD should be able to make each year's new funding under CGP available to the HAs by no later than March 1. Commenters disagreed that the two-year obligation period should begin with the ACC amendment. HAs stated that it can take up to 15 months to receive the ACC amendment. HUD was asked to improve its performance in this area or continue to allow a five-year period. Allowing a five-year period would give HAs maximum flexibility in scheduling modernization work. It was suggested that HUD's role should be limited to monitoring PHA progress through the P&E Report.
