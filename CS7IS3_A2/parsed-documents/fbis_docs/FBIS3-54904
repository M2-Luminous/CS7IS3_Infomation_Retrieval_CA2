Pronin, member of the Political Council of the Ukrainian Socialist Party: "The Congress of Socialists"] [Text] The third congress of the Ukrainian Socialist Party [SPU] has taken place. The 494 delegates that represented the 31,000-strong party force and 120,000 of its sympathizer from all Ukrainian oblasts and the Crimea listened to a report about activities of the SPU Political Council (by O. Bozhko) and a report of the revision commission (by O. Mishchenko). Central to the congress was the report "On the Party's Electoral Platform and Its Objectives" delivered by O. Moroz, head of the SPU Political Council. N. Vitrenko and O. Yushchyk presented reports on the platform ideology. All those who presented reports as well as deputies who took the floor later rejected Rukh's propagandist suggestion, dutifully publicized by the mass media, holding communists who supposedly remain in power personally responsible for the catastrophic situation in Ukraine. Former CPSU activists crowding the leadership of all anti-communist parties -- Rukh among them -- proved plain renegades. By approving the Rukh-made program of building capitalism in Ukraine through privatization and liberalization and allying themselves with nationalistic patriots and criminal bourgeoise, which made fabulous fortunes on this, reduced Ukraine to its present condition. They have no right to retain power and should surrender it to representatives of workers that were most affected by the unheard-of looting of Ukraine. The delegates to the congress spoke for the reinstatement of soviets and the liquidation of presidential structures, and demanded that the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets be called as soon as possible, that people's and workers' control be restored, and that a transition constitutional law be adopted instead of the proposed draft constitution. Major emphasis was placed on the party's tactics and strategy on the eve of legislative elections. The congress reconfirmed that the SPU will approach the elections as an independent political force with its own program and candidates, which does not rule out the possibility of cooperation with like-minded public organizations of a social orientation. A declaration on this kind of cooperation was signed at the congress by representatives of the SPU, the Ukrainian Communist Party [KPU], and the Ukrainian Peasants' Party. The congress approved the party's electoral campaign -- it will be published in the nearest issue of the TOVARYSH [Comrade] paper --- and adopted a resolution on the report by the Political Council and the Revision Commission. The decision by the SPU and other leftists parties to participate in the upcoming elections provides an opportunity to get out of the crisis by peaceful and legal means. The party's electoral slogan will be: "For Social Justice, Power of the People, Lawfulness, and People's Safety." In an appeal to the Ukrainian people, the congress called on electors not to make the mistakes from the previous elections, when they allowed antisocial and antipeople forces sneak into the Supreme Council, which vastly used funds from their foreign sponsors. We have no right to make the same mistake. The SPU appeals for all electors to go to the voting stations. A low turnout would abet further pillaging of Ukraine. The congress warned that an antipopular course of the Ukrainian leadership raises protests of workers that might turn into a social explosion. Coal miners, shipbuilders, defense industry workers, etc. are standing up to defend their interests. The SPU has repeatedly warned that the current course leads to catastrophe. Before it is too late, the SPU calls on the authorities to meet all demands of striking committees, including those urging resignation of the president and the government, and altering the course of reforms to the advantage of the majority of the people. The congress elected O. Moroz chairman of the Political Council and O. Mishchenko head of the Revision Commission. After the congress ended, the Political Council held a meeting where O. Bozhko, I. Musiyenko, and V. Romashchenko were elected its deputy chairmen, and the 15-strong Council's Presidium was established. The congress was attended by P. Symonenko, first secretary of the KPU Central Committee; M. Brokiavicius, the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee; B. Bondarchuk, co-chairman of the Socialist Party of Russian Workers Central Committee; K. Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the SKP-CPSU [expansion unknown]; S. Dovhal, leader of the Ukrainian Peasants' Party; representatives of Belarusian Socialists, "Working Ukraine," the Ukrainian Communist Union, the Association of Working Women, "For the Future of Our Children," the Ukrainian Leninist Communist Youth Association, veteran and other organizations as well as V. Hranycharov, member of the Executive Committee of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, and Cuban and North Korean ambassadors.
