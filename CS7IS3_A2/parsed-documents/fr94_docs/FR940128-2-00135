FR940128-2-00135 FR940128-2-00088 In cases reviewing final agency decisions on Social Security benefits, the exclusive methods by which district courts may remand to the Secretary are set forth in sentence four and sentence six of section 405(g), which are set forth in the margin. 1 See Melkonyan, supra, at XXX &hyph; XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2163&hyph;2164. Schaefer correctly concedes that the District Court's remand order in this case was entered pursuant to sentence four. 2 He argues, however, that a district court proceeding under that provision need not enter a judgment at the time of remand, but may postpone it and retain jurisdiction pending completion of the administrative proceedings. That argument, however, is inconsistent with the plain language of sentence four, which authorizes a district court to enter a judgment ``with or without'' a remand order, not a remand order ``with or without'' a judgment. 1 Sentences four and six of section 405(g) provide: ``[4] The [district] court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing *␣*␣*. [6] The court may, on motion of the Secretary made for good cause shown before he files his answer, remand the case to the Secretary for further action by the Secretary, and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary, but only upon a showing that there is now evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding; and the Secretary shall, after the case is remanded, and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm his findings of fact or his decision, or both, and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which his action in modifying or affirming was based.'' 2 Sentence-six remands may be ordered in only two situations: where the Secretary requests a remand before answering the complaint, or where new, material evidence is adduced that was for good cause not presented before the agency. See section 405(g) (sentence six); Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U.S. XXX , XXX , and n. 2, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 2163&hyph;2164, and n. 2, (1991); cf. Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 626, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 2664, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990). The District Court's April 4, 1989 remand order clearly does not fit within either situation. See Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 629, 110 S. Ct. 2658, 2666, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990). Immediate entry of judgment (as opposed to entry of judgment after postremand agency proceedings have been completed and their results filed with the court) is in fact the principal feature that distinguishes a sentence-four remand from a sentence-six remand. See Melkonyan, 501 U.S. at XXX &hyph; XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2164&hyph;2165. Nor is it possible to argue that the judgment authorized by sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a ``final judgment''_as required by section 2412(d)_upon expiration of the time for appeal. If that were true, there would never be any final judgment in cases reversed and remanded for further agency proceedings (including those which suffer that fate after the Secretary has filed the results of a sentence-six remand). Sentence eight of section 405(g) states that ``(t)he judgment of the court''_which must be a reference to a sentence-four judgment, since that is the only judgment authorized by section 405(g)_``shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions.'' Thus, when the time for seeking appellate review has run, the sentence-four judgment fits squarely within the term ``final judgment'' as used in section 2412(d), which is defined to mean ``a judgment that is final and not appealable.'' 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(G).
