The good news is that the increase "is accounted for by activity in drugs interdiction which resulted in a total of 894 offences being detected (in that category) compared with 606 in 1992," said RCIP Commissioner Alan Ratcliffe. In reviewing the 1993 crime statistics at a press conference Thursday morning, the Commissioner conceded that the 3,298 offences reported in 1993 "is a lot of crime." At the same time, he was optimistic because the rise in crime was directly attributable to drug arrests and offences. He noted it was "gratifying" that more than 75 percent of crimes (2,532) were solved. "But there's still no room for complacency," he added. The 77 percent clearup rate is a 10-percent increase from 1992, he pointed out. Police clear a crime when a suspect is arrested and charged, not when a conviction occurs. [passage omitted] In discussing the drugs problem, the Commissioner made it clear that the police statistics "only show how successful we have been in tackling the drugs problem." The statistics do not show the overall usage or sale. "There is evidence there are far more drugs on the island than have ever been here before," he said. He and Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts are convinced Cayman has become a major transshipment point for drugs. "Drugs are shipped here to go north. Some do find the local market, but it's impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic market," said Commissioner Ratcliffe. He based that upon a discovery rate estimated at 10 percent of the total and the fact that police seized 4,330 pounds of ganja (marijuana) and 52 pounds of cocaine in 1993. "If (those figures) are 10 percent then that becomes "worrying." And, he pointed out, that's just what police seized. It does not include Customs seizures in 1993. Superintendent Cutts concurred, saying Cayman "is like a giant warehouse" for drugs coming from Jamaica headed for the United States. When asked what the police are doing to stop the flow of illegal drugs into Cayman, he deferred to Customs. "Customs is the primary agency ... to stop drugs entering." He praised his Drugs Squad staff, noting that the 14 people on the Squad "work long hours," and often become stressed out in the battle against drugs. Sometimes it might appear the Drugs Squad is fighting a "losing battle" said Mr. Cutts. "But you try and keep your finger in the dike." "Make no mistake, I don't think we are fighting a losing battle. This is a beautiful island and it can be kept that way," if people work together to eliminate the drugs problem, he said. "Solve our problem here. Look at the people arrested and their nationality."
