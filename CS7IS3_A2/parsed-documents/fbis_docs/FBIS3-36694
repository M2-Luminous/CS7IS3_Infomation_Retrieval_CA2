President Calls on Citizens To Take Part in Federal Elections"] [Text] Yesterday's sitting of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet's 18th session is likely to remain as the shortest on record, lasting 20 minutes in all. Having found no common ground on the question of reforming the republic's authorities, Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin decided to close the session. After a 30-minute break he opened another, the 19th session. It will be as memorable as the previous one, with Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev's publicly calling on parliament to hold repeat elections for the Federal Assembly on 13 March. Discussions in Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet on reforming the authorities have been going on since 18 October 1993. Yesterday proved that even this time was too short for the two parliamentary commissions to come to an agreement on two versions of the draft law. The dragged-out discussion on reforming the authorities augured a heated atmosphere, something neither the Supreme Soviet chairman nor the president wanted at all in connection with what Mintimer Shaymiyev was going to say in parliament. This is perhaps why the session was urgently terminated. The statement that followed came as a total surprise for many deputies, especially those who represent Tatar national circles. "Proceeding from the course of the negotiations with the Russian Federation, I consider necessary the presence of Tatarstan in both the State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia. I am confident that the republic's population will support me by their active part in the 13 March elections," the president said. This address obviously came in response to Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev's successful negotiations in Moscow. Attesting to their positive result is also the fact that Mr. Shaymiyev did not arrive in Moscow Saturday although his visit had been expected, according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights. In the meantime, many deputies speaking for the local press right before that had no doubt that the president sided with those who support the line toward Tatarstan's going it alone, and urged him to demand that Moscow grant special status not only for the republic but also for its representatives in the Federal Assembly. Radical nationalists demanded that only Tatarstan observers rather than its full members of the senate and the Duma be present there. Mr. Shaymiyev also stated, having in mind the interstate treaty between Moscow and Kazan: "Being born is a document hitherto unknown in practice, which will provide a testimony to a renewal of the federation on democratic principles, a guarantee of our republic's statehood." The deputies' reaction to the president's words remained an enigma for Russian-speaking journalists because debates were called off at the parliamentarians' request following two speeches in the Tatar language. Local observers believe that at least 60 percent of the republic's citizens will come to the polls on 13 March with the blessing of Mintimer Shaymiyev. In all probability one should expect in the coming days an official communication on Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev himself and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin joining the election campaign for a seat in the Federation Council.
