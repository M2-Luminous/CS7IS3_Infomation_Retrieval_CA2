Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found in the July 26, 1982 Federal Register (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16. II. Submission of the Amendment By letter dated January 4, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1193), Indiana submitted a proposed amendment ( # 93&hyph;1) intended to address the required program amendments concerning revegetation at 30 CFR 914.16 (i), (j), (k), (l), and (m). See 57 FR 41869 (September 14, 1992), and 57 FR 22653 (May 29, 1992) for background on these required amendments. The amendments submitted on January 4, 1993, were reviewed and approved by the Director on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). By letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1392), Indiana submitted formal program amendment # 94&hyph;3. The proposed program amendment concerns the performance standards for restoring soil productivity for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana stated that all of the rules, except 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16, were submitted in a previous package (amendment # 93&hyph;1) and approved by OSM August 2, 1993. In addition, 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), which was approved as part of amendment # 93&hyph;1 has been deleted and does not appear in this submittal. Indiana stated that as a result of ongoing Federal litigation over the language of the previously-submitted subsection (c) of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) will not be resubmitted. With amendment # 94&hyph;3, only those provisions which differ from the amendments approved by OSM in the August 2, 1993, Federal Register notice were considered by OSM to be amendments subject to public review and comment in the current rulemaking process. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 16, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 47574), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on October 17, 1994. III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program.
