This, some will say extremely harsh, claim can be easily justified by what has been published over the past few days: The district prosecutor of the town of Sandanski has leveled charges against four distinguished activists of the United Macedonian Organization [OMO] "Ilinden" for organizing an illegal rally near the Rozen Monastery last year, on the occasion of the anniversary of Jane Sandanski's death. The head of the District Prosecuting Attorney's Office used Article 174 of the Criminal Law to institute prosecution for the organizing of meetings, since he was not able to find any other legislation with which to punish those who feel and declare themselves Macedonian. Jordan Kostadinov, Bozidar Kirijanov, Vihren Zaprev, and Kiril Gilev can be sentenced to a year of imprisonment. That is the conclusion of the joint, four-year battle that they have waged together with hundreds of other Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia, with the aim of proving to the world that neither tsarist, nor Zivkov's totalitarian -- let alone present democratic -- Bulgaria can suffocate this feeling or eradicate a national identity. "Deliberate" Justice Of course, the whole farce was preceded by exclusive preparation in the vrhovists' [Bulgarian nationalists] "studio" in Sofia, which involved Ivan Tatarcev, the Bulgarian prosecutor general, being available night and day, a man who, by the way, is the nephew of one of the founders of the VMRO [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]. The top Bulgarian prosecutor issued a personal warrant to start this new political process against the four Macedonians. Moreover, Tatarcev is well known to the Bulgarian public and beyond for the many cases of "deliberate" justice, adapting cases to the needs of day-to-day policy, and ignoring the provisions of the law. He became equally famous when he arrested two former Bulgarian prime ministers, Andrej Lukanov and Georgi Atanasov, by using ridiculous and unsubstantiated evidence adapted to fit some article of the criminal law adapted especially for the occasion. He was not ashamed to act as a prosecuting attorney in a range of other cases involving reprisals against various personalities of the former regime. In any case, this is another attempt to shape the modern history of repression in order to deal a blow (besides using police batons) to a very serious movement headed by OMO "Ilinden." Public Disqualification The Macedonians in Bulgaria for the first time, after many a year of persecution in Zivkov's ethnically "pure and homogeneous" state, publicly raised their voices in the cold and dramatic autumn of 1989. It happened at a mass meeting for democratic changes in the large square near the "Aleksandar Nevski" monument in Sofia. Among the hundreds of thousands of spectators there was a group of Macedonians who came with their own slogans as a sign of identification and to announce their struggle against the suppression of political rights. Soon afterwards OMO "Ilinden" was formed and its activities were stepped up. However, in spite of the upsurge of democracy, the great waves of euphoria following the fall of Todor Zivkov and his police regime in Bulgaria at that time, and the feeling that a climate for real democratic resurrection was being created, the ranks of the nationalists were soon consolidated and the vrhovists organized the Alliance of Macedonian Associations (later on the VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Alliance of Macedonian Associations]), assisted by the frightened state leadership, started, as provokers and initiators, the whole battle against OMO "Ilinden." They began to organize counterdemonstrations, to deny the existence of the Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, to humiliate the "Ilinden affiliates", and discredit them as "foreign mercenaries," "lost souls," and so on, all to prove that they were a small group of "renegades from the system." Halting Assimilation OMO "Ilinden" did not suspend or abandon its goals despite the strong media and other public pressures. On the contrary: On 11 March 1990, over 100 Macedonians organized a march through the streets of Sofia and they handed a petition to the Bulgarian parliament with a request to end the assimilation of Macedonians and for the reestablishment of minority rights. Despite the fierce anti-Macedonian campaign launched in Bulgaria, only a month later OMO "Ilinden" organized a rally with around 15,000 Macedonians from Pirin Macedonia in the courtyard of the Rozen Monastery, marking the anniversary of Jane Sandanski's death. The rally ended without incident, but with straightforward demands for cultural independence and respect for human and minority rights, accompanied by Macedonian folksongs and dancing. This demonstration at the Rozen Monastery eventually angered all the Bulgarians, from the ultra leftist to the ultra rightist parties and movements. The first consensus reached at that time between the hated communists and the new democratic forces was to suspend the Macedonian movement. Events unfolded this way: False accusations were made about the Macedonian organization, it could not be legally registered, its activities were then banned, and finally police batons were brought into play and every kind of demonstration was banned. In the meantime, members of OMO "Ilinden" went on hunger strike, wrote letters to foreign embassies and offices, and then directly addressed the Bulgarian leadership in July 1990 to insist they were not what they were accused of being -- separatists -- but were loyal citizens who were simply asking for the freedom to express their national identity. Bloody Clash Instead of receiving understanding, the response to all this was that the OMO "Ilinden" activists had their passports confiscated, while some were arrested in December of the same year in Blagoevgrad, others were beaten up in the streets as they collected signatures for support, and so on. Consequently, the traditional Rozen rally was banned in 1991 and 1992, and there was a brutal, bloody clash between the police and the rally around the tomb of Jane Sandanski in April 1993. Last year's Rozen persecution, the latest in a series of anti- Macedonian activities, completed four years of the Bulgarian political leadership's attempts to suppress the Macedonian organization using the state's apparatus and organizations founded specially for the purpose, neither minding the means, nor economizing on money or words for propaganda, schemes, or actions in the field. However, the truth about the assimilation of the Macedonians in Pirin Macedonia has become known, as well as the suppression of the Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, and is to be found in all the reports of international associations. Now, the political trial of four OMO "Ilinden" leaders approaches. It is further proof of the continuing policy, contrary to all Bulgaria's declarations on its respect for human rights, the UN charter, the CSCE documents, Vienna.... It is naive to imagine that prison sentences will eliminate the existence of the Macedonian national minority. Unfortunately, Bulgaria has not learnt any lessons from history -- many Macedonians rotted in camps and jails for years and even decades, and yet there now come fresh generations that refuse to forget about their ancestors' national identity. Is it not more rational, just for once, to accept the bitter truth in order to help the Balkans, during its transition into newly oriented states, to become a stable region liberated from its complex historical past. The borders remain, and that may be the strongest motive for the elimination of some inherited syndromes.
