Similar hasty moves have been made before in order to put political and psychological pressure on the FRY and to inflict damage on its reputation. These moves are completely unfounded today, as they were in the past, and do not make any contribution toward creating an atmosphere needed for a successful completion of the peace negotiations. The Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that on the territory of the FRY, full personal safety and conditions for normal life and work are guaranteed for all diplomatic personnel, members of their families, and all foreigners. We therefore expect that these decisions will soon be reexamined and withdrawn, the statement says in conclusion.
