Environmental Evaluation In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part 1021), Western has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Executive Order 12866 DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required.
