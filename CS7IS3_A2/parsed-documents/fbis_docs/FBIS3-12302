Hundreds of Palestinian citizens were murdered or wounded in this act. In a statement to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali described what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque as an unprecedented crime, and as an indication of fanaticism, extremism, and lack of respect for human rights and sanctities. Dr. al-Majali said that this criminal act constitutes a huge obstacle on the road to achieving a just and comprehensive peace, which Jordan has been tirelessly seeking to achieve. He stressed the need for a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and for the removal of settlements as a guarantee to prevent the recurrence of such criminal acts that are in conflict with all humanitarian and religious values. Dr. al-Majali said: At this time, when our region is witnessing immense events, we are in a dire need for a unity of stands and ranks on the Arab and Islamic levels in order to be able to confront challenges. In his own name and on behalf of the Jordanian Government, Dr. al-Majali extended condolences to the Palestinian leadership and to our people in the occupied territories. He said: We consider the misfortune of our people in Palestine as our own misfortune.
