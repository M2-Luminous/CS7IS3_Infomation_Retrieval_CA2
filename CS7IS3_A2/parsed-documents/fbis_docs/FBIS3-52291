The American roving ambassador for anti terrorism affairs during Bush's term, Jerry Braemer, gave press statements saying that the levelling of accusations against Libya was related to the so-called `requirements' of the peace process in the Middle East and the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon. John Murphy, a relative of one of the victims of the Pan Am American airliner said that the families of the victims of the plane were smelling something fishy emanating from this turnabout in the case against Libya.
