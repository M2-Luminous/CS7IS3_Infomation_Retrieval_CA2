For the first time in two years, he took a vacation. On 5 December, after finishing his vacation, he addressed an appeal to the president and the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces requesting permission to resign from the Armed Forces. Therefore, he appeared before the audience in civilian clothes. He was elegant and cheerful. Only his sad eyes showed what he had lived through since he was dismissed as Ukraine's first defense minister. In my mind, he is living through a tragic moment in his life: He was the first to swear allegiance to Ukraine and has done a lot to help build our independent Armed Forces, and he could do even more if he were to stay. However, this is not his personal tragedy but a tragedy of his colleagues who believed in him and came with him to the Defense Ministry. This meeting with the ex-defense minister was organized by the Association of Students "Hurt." This move is the first political action of "Hurt." It is symbolic that Konstyantyn Morozov met with students first: They were the first to support the independence of Ukraine. During his meeting with Kiev students, Konstyantyn Morozov told students about his activities as Ukrainian defense minister and discussed issues of national security. For more than two hours, he answered students' questions. Of course, the first question was: Why did you retire? Morozov said: "I always answer for all my actions. However, when the government was dismissed, I understood quite well that the acting Supreme Council will not nominate me to the post of defense minister because I opposed our CIS membership. In addition, I had my own viewpoint on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet. Hence, my resignation. Our president has approved my step." Morozov stated that he was pressed by the Cabinet of Ministers and received written threats from special security organs. He provided an example of how his attempts to combat corruption in the Armed Forces were obstructed. For example, a Cabinet of Ministers decree had established a commercial structure within a long-range aviation unit. Regular monitoring of that unit revealed many financial violations and abuses of the law. The defense minister had issued an order halting the activities of this commercial structure within the Armed Forces. However, the new defense minister started his activities by repealing Morozov's order. The public asked Konstyantyn Morozov about the fighting condition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the nuclear arms issues, and prospects for restructuring Ukraine's Armed Forces. The ex-minister confirmed to the audience that the Republic's nuclear warheads are in a state of combat readiness. Answering a question on if a civilian should be named defense minister, he said: "In my opinion, sooner or later Ukraine will have a civilian defense minister." Speaking about his plans, Morozov explained that he has received a lot of proposals from various political parties and movements to run in the upcoming Supreme Council elections. The ex-minister has not yet made a final decision to represent a specific political movement, but he is going to run in Kiev.
