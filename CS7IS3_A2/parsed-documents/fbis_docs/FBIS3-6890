No reason was offered for Han's last-minute withdrawal from the traveling party, but ministry sources noted that it is likely related to the increasingly tense situation on the Korean peninsula. Han's meeting with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata, also scheduled for Thursday, was also canceled, the ministry said. Kim will be in Tokyo for a three-day visit beginning Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and then will travel to China for meetings with Beijing leaders. Talks with Hosokawa and Chinese leaders are expected to focus on resolving North Korea's refusal to permit adequate inspections of its nuclear facilities.
