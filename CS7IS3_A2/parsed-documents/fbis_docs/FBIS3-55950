The Interior Ministry will most probably be divided in several parts called "operative main departments" which will be entrusted with fighting the most serious types of crime. The departments will comprise criminal police. Policemen who ensure public order may be united into municipal police. Firemen and investigators will become "independent" departments, as well as the department which deals with prisons and labour camps. The reform scheme is currently being drafted by the interior ministry itself, according to the sources. Experts are split in assessing the planned reform of the Interior Ministry. Some of them told TASS they are against splitting the anti-crime forces while others believe the reform of the ministry is necessary to meet the demands of the time.
