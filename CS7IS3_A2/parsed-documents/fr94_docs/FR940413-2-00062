FR940413-2-00062 FR940413-2-00031 The FCA recognizes that System institutions continue to undergo structural change in their effort to best meet the System's mission. The agency realizes the importance of these changes and will consider each request promptly. Specific Request for Comments The FCA Board intends to evaluate any matter involving competition among System institutions that comes before it by balancing all relevant factors on a case-by-case basis. The FCA Board specifically invites comments on the factors set forth in the proposed policy statement and on the appropriate analysis of such factors, and asks for suggestions for additional factors or analyses that should be considered by the FCA Board. No one factor is likely to be dispositive in any given matter, and the FCA Board has set only one specific criterion or standard that must be met in each proposal involving increased competition among System institutions_that the proposal, if approved, would lead to a net overall improvement in the availability, quality, and price of credit and credit services to eligible customers. The FCA Board invites suggestions on the information it should require and the procedures it should use to determine the ``availability, quality, and price of credit and credit services'' when it is considering a matter involving competition among System institutions.
