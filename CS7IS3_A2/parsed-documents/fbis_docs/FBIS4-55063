Most attention today was devoted to the borders between cantons and the number of cantons within the federation. Our special correspondent, Amir Hodzic, reports from Vienna: [Begin Hodzic recording] Stands have so far been coordinated on the canton of Foca with a majority Croatian population and [word indistinct] of two cantons in central Bosnia and the Lasva Valley. There have been a few disputes about the status of Gornji Vakuf, that is, individual districts in the outskirts of the commune's territory. Views about the cantonal setup of Herzegovina are somewhat different. Our delegation is of the opinion that the commune of Stolac with (?Dubrava) Plateau and the region along the left side of the Neretva River should be a canton with the Bosniak-Muslim majority population because it has an absolute majority of 55 percent of Bosniak people. For this reason, as well as for the reasons of tradition, geography, economy, communications, and other reasons it should be a special cantonal entity. The Croatian delegation, however, offers one canton that would have an ethnic [word indistinct] with a majority Croatian population, its borders would be drawn at the foot of the Jablanica Mountain, along the Neretva Valley, and it would encompass the whole of the Stolac Commune. As a major, principled question is involved here, participants in the talks will focus their attention on it in the afternoon as well so that a realistic agreement can be reached at the end.
