Both the BSP and the SDS are for a policy of non-involvement of the Balkan states in the conflict. BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva told BTA that the NATO ultimatum is rather a preventive measure and it will hardly come to actual air strikes. "We do hope that it will work... I think that in reality it won't come to air strikes," she said. When asked about the BSP's position in case it comes to air strikes after all, Ms. Ananieva answered that she hoped "the military had considered all possibilities." Today Ms. Ananieva met with Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov to discuss the Yugocrisis and other issues. She emphasized the unchanged stand of the BSP against any sort of involvement, be it direct or indirect, of the Balkan states in the conflict. "SDS believes that the Balkan problems should be regarded as European problems and it should not be left to the Balkan states alone to find the way for their settlement, as they could be of great international and geopolitical significance," Filip Dimitrov told the press today. SDS is positive that the international institutions, military ones included, need to commit themselves to the settlement of Balkan problems. "We all hope the problems will be solved in a peaceful way but if it proves impossible, they are the ones to determine the most effective means to put an end to the bloodshed and the expansion of the conflict," he added. "In a situation like this Bulgaria cannot dodge responsibility," he said, pointing out the SDS's conviction that the Balkan states' direct involvement might have grave consequences. "This is precisely the reason why we insist on international institutions' intervention," said the leader of the Union of Democratic Forces. He also criticized the Bulgarian Government for lacking a clear stand on the impending strikes in Bosnia.
