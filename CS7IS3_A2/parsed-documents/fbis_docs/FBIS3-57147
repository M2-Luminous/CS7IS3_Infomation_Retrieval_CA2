These reshuffles are causing a great deal of debate. Today we have the opinion of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. Here's what he thinks about the new-look government. [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] As far as the current government and its sentiments are concerned, then I can say that it is typical of the governments that the Soviet Union had. It's a typical government, consisting of absolutely different people, most of whom have no legitimacy whatsoever because they're not elected and didn't even run for election. The second factor is that this is a government that has no policy program. The problem, however, lies not in this but elsewhere: the fact is that I am very concerned over what the current government represents in the basic situation that today, this year, is beginning to emerge. [end recording] Those words were said by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy at a news conference. My colleague Vyacheslav Osipov was there, so over to him. [Osipov] To continue our discussion about the government: when Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on the new composition of the government-cabinet, he had already received several days earlier a letter from Grigoriy Yavlinskiy in which the member of the State Duma set out a new concept for structuring the government. On the basis of it, Yavlinskiy proposed making the government responsible for inflationary processes. At his news conference, the parliamentary faction leader set out the reasons for the country's economic recession. One of them, he believes, lies in mistakes made during privatisation: using miscalculations in the way this is implemented, workforces are directing all profit into consumption rather than production, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy thinks. He dwelled in particular on the complete refusal to extend soft loans. This only fuels inflation and causes further decline in the ruble rate of exchange. As regards this, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy commented as follows: [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The falling exchange rate is without doubt an inflationary factor, but bringing the rate into line could have a positive impact for a while on our industry. Therefore, if you hear gung-ho claims in February that things are getting rather better, then that will be a temporary phenomenon linked to the fact that the rate of exchange is falling and imports are becoming less profitable than they were before. My last remark: You know of the Belarus agreement on currency union. Even the sharpest critics of this agreement, those who are most dissatisfied with it, reckon that the cost comes to about 1.5 trillion rubles, a sum we cannot afford. I want to say that this sum cannot even compare to the debts, for example, that have built up to agriculture, the military-industrial complex, and others. [end recording]
