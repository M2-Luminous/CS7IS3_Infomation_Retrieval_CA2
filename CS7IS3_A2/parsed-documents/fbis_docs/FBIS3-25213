Two volunteers working for the CEFA [Comitato Europeo di Formazione Agraria, Bologna-based charity] humanitarian aid organization have been kidnapped near Giohar. Their names are not yet known. The Italian authorities are currently negotiating for the two Italians to be released. The kidnapping took place against the backdrop of an important diplomatic initiative being carried out by Italy. Achille D'Amelia reports from Somalia. [D'Amelia] The news about the kidnapping of the two Italian aid workers in Giohar, 100 kilometres north-east of Mogadishu and where Italian Blue Helmets are based, was given by Somali sources to Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary [Carmelo] Azzara and the Italian delegation which is trying to create a network of talks and mutual interest between local clans, a network that would guarantee a peaceful withdrawal for our contingent. The climate is tense in Mogadishu and all over Somalia. Our friends are chiding us over our withdrawal and those who have given their arms to us are now empty-handed, but the kidnapping of the two Italian aid workers, whose names are still not known, seems to have more to do with economic motives -- a banal ransom demand -- than political ones. Specially selected units of Italian troops and helicopters have been sent to Giohar, where the kidnapping took place, by the Italian Blue Helmets commander, General [Carmine] Fiore; but, above all, he has invited village elders to show reason.
