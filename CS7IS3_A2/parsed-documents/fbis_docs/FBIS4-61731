FBIS4-61731 "drsov090_g_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-090 Daily Report 6 May 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Newspapers Resume Publication Newspapers Resume Publication WS0905141694 Minsk NARODNAYA GAZETA in Belarusian 6 May 94 p 1 WS0905141694 Minsk NARODNAYA GAZETA Belarusian BFN [Open letter issued by Iosif Syaredich, editor in chief of NARODNAYA GAZETA: "NARODNAYA GAZETA Will Always Be With Its People!"] [Text] Only several issues of NARODNAYA GAZETA failed to appear. This also applies to SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA. The paper received numerous bewildered phone calls: Are the authorities unable to help the media during these difficult times? As for NARODNAYA GAZETA, it expects fair relations with the state, its founder -- the Supreme Soviet -- and the government, rather than help. The Presidium adopted a resolution obliging the state to pay for the printing of laws, decrees, and other legislative acts on supplementary pages. Normally, it would have to provide the newspaper with necessary materials and funds. But what really happened? Until now, our newspaper has not been paid for the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year. When a question came up about purchasing paper for supplementary pages for the rest of the year, a declaration was issued, saying: "The Supreme Soviet has no money..." The newspaper had to secure a bank loan of more than 1 billion rubles [R] to buy paper for those pages, ordered by the newspaper's founder. We hoped that this issue will be eventually resolved. Unfortunately, after almost two months, the paper has not yet received the money back. If it were a matter of R100,000-200,000, one could forget this sum, but the state owes the paper nearly R2 billion. This is why, dear readers, we were forced to suspend the publication of our newspaper. Beginning today, its publication -- and that of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA PRAVDA -- will be resumed. Serious talks were held with the founder and government structures. There is every reason to believe that the attitude toward NARODNAYA GAZETA will be more fair. On 4 May, chief editors of the above papers met with Prime Minister Kebich. We upheld the interests of both our newspaper and the entire Belarusian press. From the state reserves, two tonnes of paper have been allocated and will be distributed among publications commensurate with the size their circulation. Publications whose leadership refused to join the action of solidarity will certainly receive their portion. Well, life is always easier behind someone else's back... Although the paper will not be given by the state free of charge, the most important thing is that it has been provided and there is no need to deliver it from Syktywkar or Kandapoga. One more thing: As V. Kebich promised, future paper purchases will be carried out on a centralized basis. Newspapers will receive financial assistance in the form of cheap credits. A possibility arose that taxes and tariffs on printing services might be lowered. Most importantly, the state will subsidize the postal service which, in turn, will relieve the papers from covering delivery and distribution costs. Also, some other proposals were accepted which were intended to protect openness by stabilizing the situation of the press. True, neither M. Hryb nor V. Kebich have so far signed any official documents confirming the compromise reached between the newspapers that were forced to suspend their activities and the authorities. However, let us hope that the high-ranking officials will make good on their promises. We would so much like to put the crisis behind us and never see it happen again. We decided not to wait until all legal matters are handled because we know that readers look forward to receiving NARODNAYA GAZETA and other papers every day. So, the editorial staff will do its best to ensure that NARODNAYA GAZETA is always with the people. We want to thank all those who cared for the fate of our paper and who would give anything for the freedom of speech, democracy, and the revival of their native Belarus. We would like to assure you that those cases of "truancy," which did not happen through any fault of NARODNAYA GAZETA, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, ZVYAZDA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA, will be compensated for by the end of this quarter. We will keep our word, esteemed readers! We hope that our friendship will become even stronger, more sincere, and fruitful. This is why we trust that subscriptions for the third quarter, which began yesterday, will bring good results. Let me note that the price of almost all national publications newspapers will reach R9,000. The papers accepted this low amount based on the assumption that, like bread, newspapers should be affordable for all social groups -- even though there are people for whom even this price is too high. This is why we call for the leadership of enterprises, institutions, collective and state farms, and other people to help those who have found themselves in a difficult situation. NARODNAYA GAZETA should really be in every house, with every family. [Signed] Iosif Syaredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA editor in chief.
