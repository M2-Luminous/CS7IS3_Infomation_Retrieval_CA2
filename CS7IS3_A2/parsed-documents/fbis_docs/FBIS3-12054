Special measures have been adopted in Havana Province to see that these products reach their destination, that is, the population. Thus, checkpoints have been created, and the trucks' itineraries are monitored. So far, these measures have yielded satisfactory results. [(Geronez)] All these measures being adopted in the fields and in monitoring the trucks on their way to the wholesale markets have considerably reduced the diversion and illegal sell of agricultural products. We want to point out that last year, many trucks used to arrive at the markets and packing plants with great weight differences. They also used to have great document problems, problems that used to facilitate illegal activities, and these problems stem directly from illegal actions in the fields or while the trucks are circulating. The practical effect of the checkpoints on the roads and the new measures we have taken to identify the itineraries has been to prevent the truckers from deviating from their itinerary to unload part of the cargo in some particular place or to sell these products to people who take advantage of these illegal actions to acquire a large amount of products so as to to then resell them. [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez), in 1993, these trucks used to arrive at the packing plants or wholesale markets showing a tremendous difference in weight. [(Geronez)] I want to point out that last year, the difference in weight when these trucks arrived at the wholesale markets or packing plants was so great that we called them gross problems or gross differences. Now, since 28 February when we began this harvest campaign, we have had no gross differences yet as regards the weight of the trucks. There are some problems with the documents, but after the investigations we conducted, we found out that these problems are not the result of attempted criminal actions but rather normal problems that sometimes occur, perhaps through ignorance or negligence on the part of certain colleagues or perhaps for certain other reasons, but they are not the result of evil intentions. [Alemany] All the Interior Ministry's forces are participating in the struggle against the theft of agricultural products in Havana, and the population is supporting these measures. Government officials have also acted severely, to punish those conducting illegal business in agriculture with the force of the law. [(Geronez)] Well, these measures have helped reduce theft considerably. Last year, during the first week of the campaign, the incidence of criminality in this connection and the number of people tried in the courts was high. This year we have conducted a great publicity campaign and people are aware of the measures we are adopting. Moreover, the criminals will be punished severely, especially for crimes involving these agricultural products, which are meant to provide relief for the nation and the population during the current crisis. [Alemany] At the same time tomorrow, we will release the last part of the interview with Lt. Col. (Geronez) concerning the measures adopted to prevent the diverting and stealing of agricultural products in Havana Province.
