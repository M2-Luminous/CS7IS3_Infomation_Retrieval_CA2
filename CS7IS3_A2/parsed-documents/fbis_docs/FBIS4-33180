[Robaina] These summits continue to be special occasions when we can meet without being ordered to do so by the Empire. The Ibero-American Summit, specifically, is already threatened by the Miami hemispheric summit, convened by the U.S. Government for the clear purpose of discrediting it. I believe that in light of such a maneuver, it is important for the Cartagena summit to be stronger than ever in terms of its development. I have no doubt that, independent of their efforts, the Latin American peoples are increasingly more independent and will continue to find their own path. We need to see how the rest of America responds, but I have confidence in Colombia's readiness and the peoples' response. I believe this will be an important forum for discussion and that Colombia would like it to become a stage for debate, discussion, and unrehearsed speeches. I hope it will be a summit for action rather than intentions. [Gili] Thank you minister.
