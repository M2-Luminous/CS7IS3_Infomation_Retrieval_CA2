There, together with Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the board of Ukraine's National Bank, Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and food, Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko, Mykhaylo Kovalko, chairman of the state oil and gas committee, and others, he familiarized himself with the work of the Zmiyev vegetable processing plant and held talks with the president's representatives in the oblast rayons, the chairmen of local councils, and managers of agricultural enterprises, and also a consultation with representatives of Ukraine's gas industry. "The most topical problems needing immediate resolution are agrarian issues, issues of foodstuffs, and power, the president of Ukraine said. We should support everything that works to produce food." As far as the issue of trade with CIS countries is concerned, Ukraine, according to Leonid Kravchuk, was the first to propose a treaty on free trade between these countries. This treaty should envisage equal conditions for the participants of a free trade zone. The Ukrainian position differs from the position of the Russian side, which insists that oil, gas, gold (approximately 100 types of goods), be excluded from the free trade zone, that is so that the Russian consumer can buy these goods 2.5 times more cheaply than the Ukrainian consumer. According to information from Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the board of Ukraine's National Bank, it is now necessary to refuse as much as possible an emission solution for rural problems [as heard]. It is also necessary to introduce normal pricing and a nonemission financial and credit mechanism, to improve settlements and currency regulation, change quotas and licenses in agriculture, and also to set up support funds for the sector by attracting investments. According to Yushchenko, current seasonal inflation is 10-12 percent compared to the 38 percent each month last year. According to Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and food, 10 percent of our state's credit resources will in future go on agrarian projects, and a crediting mechanism will be elaborated at the expense of the state stabilization fund. Leonid Kravchuk noted at the consultation with representatives of Ukraine's gas industry that a program is being prepared to develop Ukraine's own energy-carriers, which envisages the extraction of 25-30 billion cubic meters of gas per year. "We are capable of resolving these problems with our personnel and industrial level. All that remains is to find a source of finance and equipment, and to make scientific and technical plans. In future it may be about attracting foreign investments, especially when mastering the Black Sea Basin," the president of Ukraine said.
