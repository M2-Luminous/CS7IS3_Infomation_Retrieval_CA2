The meeting heard a report on the work carried out by the authorized commissions into the circumstances leading to the crash of an Iranian C-130 military transport plane over Nagorno-Karabakh on 17 March, and on the assistance provided by the Armenian authorities for discovering the causes of the tragedy. In expressing deep regret over the unfortunate incident and human losses, it was noted that Armenia provided and is providing unreserved assistance to the experts from Iran and the authorized commission from the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee for the detailed study of all the circumstances surrounding the crash of the plane. The transportation of the victims of the tragedy from Stepanakert to Yerevan and then to Tehran was organized on an appropriate state level. It was also noted at the commission's meeting that the disinformation carried by some [word indistinct] news agencies and presumptive assessments of the incident are turning this tragic incident into a subject of political exploitation. It was also stressed that many problems still needs to be finally resolved. It is evident from the testimony of the Iranian experts that the C-130 plane did not have a black box. It was also clarified that after flying for 50 minutes from Moscow, the plane's airtight seal was disrupted. As a result, it dropped 2,400 meters. But the crew decided not to return to Moscow airport and instead to continue the flight. The studies show that, in general, the plane did not enter Armenia's airspace and did not establish contact with Yerevan air-traffic controllers, despite the fact that at the initiative of the latter an attempt was made to establish contact with it through the No. 954 flight of a Russian plane. And Yerevan controllers learned from Georgian air controllers that the plane deviated from its air route and that they too lost contact with it. It is not clear why the plane sharply deviated from its flight path after leaving Georgian territory, entered deep into Azerbaijani territory, and flew some 4,000 meters lower. The meeting expressed the hope that it will be possible to find answers to all questions after a comprehensive study of the incident by the experts and authorized commissions. Underlying the vital necessity of establishing stability and peace in the region, the meeting also expressed concern that Azerbaijan's derailment of initiatives for the peaceful resolution of the Karabakh problem is causing tragedy not only for the sons of Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but also unwittingly for the friendly Iranian people. The commission also examined a number of problems related to Armenian-Iranian economic ties.
