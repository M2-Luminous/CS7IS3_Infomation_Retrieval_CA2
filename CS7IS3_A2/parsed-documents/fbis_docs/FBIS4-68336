Among the more promising projects for multipurpose, reusable aerospace planes--MAKS "VTB+OS," "Interim-Khotol," and "Khotol M,"--those which have the best chances for realization are the ones which answer the set of requirements for a more complete fulfillment of power-engineering specifications. The projects for aerospace planes envision the use of liquid hydrogen as fuel, and this substantially limits the possibilities of their use for a number of reasons, but particularly because of their low parameters of reliability and safety. The general lack of experience in operating aerospace systems on liquid hydrogen fuel casts doubt on the axiomatic assertions about the high priority of the systems. The technical director and supporter of the use of hydrogen fuel naturally can boldly construct the simplest fuel tank in the world, and one which is also the most complicated in its aerodynamic aspect and technical utilization. But imagine to yourself the psychological state of the crew of a MAKS or an AN-225-"Interim-Khotol" system which is carrying on board a "hydrogen bomb," ready to explode with the slightest leak in the tank of liquid hydrogen. It is a known fact that in the case of mixture with air, detonation takes place in a wide range (from 4 to 75%) of hydrogen concentration. However the need for reliable and inexpensive space vehicles remains urgent. A group of specialists, who have substantiated the possibility of creating practical space aviation, have developed an alternative project for an aerospace plane--"Promethues," which operates on hydrocarbon fuel. It most fully achieves power engineering specifications, thus essentially differing from the planes mentioned above. In calculating ballistics, strength, engine characteristics, and other features, the generally accepted methods were used and assumptions were based on real and statistical data, taking into account the technical level which has been attained to date. A comprehensive analysis of various concepts on aerospace planes according to other questions demonstrated that, as compared to flying vehicles using hydrogen fuel, aerospace planes on hydrocarbon fuel, which have minimal mass and dimensions as a result of the high density of the fuel, when combined with the lighter artificial earth satellites of the new generation are preferable for the near future, since they are superior in terms of all crtiteria without exception--economic, technical, commercial, operational, technological, efficiency of use, reliability and safety, building time, etc. It should not be forgotten that attempts to use hydrogen fuel in aviation have proved to be ill-founded. A calculation of technical economic indicators (in the prices of 1990) confirms that, at present the world prices for putting into orbit a unit of mass of a commercial payload, the expenditure for the development of an aerospace system with aerospace planes on hydrocarbon fuel at a rate of 40 launches a year will pay for itself within two years. With improvement of operational qualities and an increase in the number of launches to 80 per year a profit of $ 13.8 billion can be expected over a five-year period. The saving in funds as compared to the carrier-rocket Soyuz in combination with the space vehicle Progress amounts to 15.3 billion rubles. In this context one carrier-plane and four aerospace planes can put into orbit a payload which is the equivalent of the payloads of 800 Soyuz carrier-rockets with Progress space vehicles. In addition to this, aerospace systems with aerospace planes using hydrocarbon fuel make it possible to economize on metal, fuel, alienated lands, and other resources, which are becoming ever more expensive. The delay in starting the development of aerospace systems, while financing non-priority activities and launches of carrier-rockets with Progress space vehicles, is bringing irrretrievable yearly losses of 0.6 billion rubles, or 1.6 million rubles per day. The changes which have taken place make it necessary basically to reformulate Russia's policy on the use of circumterrestrial space, and to determine the most important directions for research efforts in this area. In this context it is necessary to take the following facts into account: 1. The production of a considerable number of carrier-rockets, (whose volume will correspond to the previously planned program for space activities of the USSR for the period 1996-2010), with analogous aerospace planes and payloads will be the task of enterprises in the Ukraine. 2. The The Baykonur Space-Launch Complex, which provided for a significant portion of the launches of carrier-rockets of the USSR, is now located in a foreign country. 3. The economic situation which is taking shape in the Russian Federation is forcing a reduction of financing for space programs, yet at the same time it is necessary to save the aerospace industry from complete destruction and to provide employment for the many factories which are connected with space. In these circumstances the proposed concept for aerospace systems offers the only realistic prospect for the develolpment of practical astronautics for Russia in the near future,--and to be specific: 1. Production facilities for an aerospace system are located within the territory of the Russian Federation. 2. In the territory of Russia there is a sufficient number of the airdromes necessary for basing aerospace systems. 3. In Russia the infrastructure (production facilities, test base, etc.) which is necessary for the production of liquid-propellant rocket engines on hydrocarbon fuel, aerospace planes, equipment, etc., has already been created. 4. Russia posseses trained cadres which have invaluable practical experience in the development, production, and operation of this type of technology. 5. The main features of the proposed aerospace system are based on a level of technology which has already been attained in Russia. 6. There is a backlog of uncompleted work in the creation of reusable orbital spacecraft, in the development of new construction materials and of more perfected hydrocarbon fuels, with improved power and operational charcteristics. 7. As compared to other concepts, the builidng times, amount of necessary financing, and technical risk are minimal. To generalize what we have discussed above, we shall note that with competent leadership in the field and the correct allocation of funds (both state and private) Russia has a unique opportunity to take up a leading position in the field of inexpensive and reliable space vehicles for the delivery of payloads into circumterrestrial orbit, and to capitalize on this position in the form of concrete political and economic gain.
