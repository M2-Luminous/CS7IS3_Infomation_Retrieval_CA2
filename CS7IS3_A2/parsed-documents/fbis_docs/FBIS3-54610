Replying to three motions to the Knesset agenda by Knesset Members Hanan Porat (National Religious Party), Efrayim Gur (Likud), and Pini Badash (Tzomet), Gur said that since the talks on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip were launched, the local residents, motivated by the fear of internal strife, have been hoarding large quantities of weapons. Gur said that the security forces have been taking action against this trend, attempting to reduce the quantities of weapons in the Strip. He admitted that there is apprehension that the large quantities of weapons would be also directed against Israelis, but noted that the incidence of attacks on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] involving firearms is not high at this stage.
