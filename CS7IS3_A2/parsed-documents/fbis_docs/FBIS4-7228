"Today the Khmer Rouge attacked Poipet, I don't know what is happening there but our general staff are following the situation," Hun Sen told reporters in Phnom Penh. The ultra-left guerrillas started to shell Poipet, a normally busy market town on the Thai-Cambodian border, early Tuesday and Thai military officials reported heavy fighting throughout the day. More than a hundred civilians fled to the safety of Sisophon, 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the east, fearing the guerrillas would overrun the town. Thai military officials told reporters in the Thai town of Aranyaprathet, which is opposite Poipet, that the Khmer Rouge attacked in a pincer movement with the guerrillas's 450 Division moving in from the south while the 519 Division pushed from the north. No figures were available on the number of men involved in the attack or on casualties. Hun Sen said he was surprised by the size of the guerrilla attack. "I just wonder how the Khmer Rouge could have such strength to attack Poipet," he said, adding: "I don't say that I accuse Thailand." Hun Sen last week accused Thailand of assisting the Khmer Rouge in the guerrillas' April 19 recapture of their headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia. Thailand denied the accusation and said that Phnom Penh's repeated allegations of Thai support for the Khmer Rouge risked jeopardising relations between the two neighbouring states. Thai military officer also said that Cambodia's National Route 5 which runs from the border to the country's second city of Battambang was closed due to the clashes.
