Kim wants to visit Beijing in the belief that the circumstances surrounding the Korean peninsula will change rapidly as a result of successful negotiations between his country and the United States, said the sources, who are well informed on North Korean affairs. "North Korea is secretly sounding out the Chinese Government on the possibility of Kim's visit through diplomatic channels," one source said. "Beijing is showing agreement in principle for the North Korean leader's visit to China after the nuclear question is resolved." If the visit takes place, Kim and Chinese leaders will discuss such problems as reform and open-door policy in North Korea, improvements in North Korea's relations with Japan and the United States, an inter-Korean summit and South-North relations, he said. In this connection, Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and one of Kim's closest aides, will visit Beijing in late January at the invitation of the Chinese Government to discuss the visit, the source said. "Hwang's Chinese visit has not been made public in detail as yet, but judging by recent developments both in North Korea and China, Hwang will discuss issues related to the Korean peninsula as well as Kim's visit," he said. In addition, Hwang will study China's reform and open policy, he said. Chinese officials confirmed Hwang's planned visit in meetings with the South Korean National Assembly speaker when he visited China on Jan. 6-11, the source said. Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's Assembly along with Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu. Hwang was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and named to head a so-called task force for relations with China and the United States. As such, he is understood to be managing issues related to improving ties with the United States.
