Speaking at a news conference today, the minister says he opposes the idea of dismantling the Jewish community in Hebron and the settlement of Qiryat Arba'. Mark Weiss reports: [Begin recording] [Weiss] The police minister said members of the force's Serious Crime Unit are still searching for four Kakh activists on the list of five that will be placed in administrative detention, and he expressed confidence that they will be found soon. He said some Kakh activists will be totally disarmed, and others will only have their automatic weapons taken away. He called the crack down on the extreme right an extraordinary act for a democratic country. However, he stressed that Kakh has less than 100 members and Kahana Hay even less, and he does not believe they have large numbers of sympathizers. Shahal said he opposes the dismantling of the Jewish community in Hebron and the settlement of Qiryat Arba', because this would mean a major change in the Declaration of Principles. The major problem, he said, remains ensuring the security of Israelis. [Shahal] We didn't have any guarantee from the Palestinians that they are going to prevent any kind of terror or violence. Still, we are optimistic enough to go on with the process. So, there is no need to come after this act, horrible as it was, and to change an agreement between the Palestinians and Israel. They have our guarantee that the Israeli Government will prevent any kind of terror or violent act, and we are doing more than any other country that I know of with all of our ability to do so. There is no question about it. [Weiss] The police minister predicted that the Palestinian police force will remain somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000 strong, and will not be significantly increased because of the massacre.
