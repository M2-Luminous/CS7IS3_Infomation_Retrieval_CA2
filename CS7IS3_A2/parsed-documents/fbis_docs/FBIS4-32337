The first three places in the ranking of trustworthiness have been occupied throughout this period by the same politicians--Vladimir Meciar, Michal Kovac, and Jozef Moravcik. This transpires from a public opinion survey conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office at the beginning of June. The survey ascertained considerable differences in the level of confidence in political personalities between the residents of Bratislava and the residents of other regions in Slovakia, especially regarding the top places in the ranking. At the beginning of June, 31 percent of Bratislava residents did not trust any politician, which is 11 percent below the all-Slovak average. (The table below includes only the names of politicians who were trusted by more than 2 percent of respondents in June. Each respondent could name, at his own discretion, up to three figures, which is why the sum total exceeds 100.) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trust of Slovak Republic Citizensin Politicians(in percent) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Apr 94 |May 94 |Jun 94 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Meciar |26 |20 |22 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Michal Kovac |25 |18 |14 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozef Moravcik |25 |19 |13 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peter Weiss |13 |13 |8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ivan Gasparovic |8 |10 |8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jan Carnogursky |4 |6 |4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozef Prokes |5 |3 |4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vojtech Bugar |3 |3 |4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Roman Kovac |7 |4 |3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mikulas Dzurinda |2 |3 |3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Brigita Schmogner-|-- |1 |2 | |ova | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Milan Knazko |1 |2 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jan Luptak |1 |1 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No one |25 |35 |42 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 21 June on page 3 carries a 400-word TA SR report on the above survey, which includes the following passage on the structure of supporters of the three top-ranking politicians: ``Vladimir Meciar continues to enjoy the greatest trust among Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] sympathizers (68 percent of whom trust him), in the group of citizens over 50 (28 percent), among blue-collar workers (29 percent), and in central Slovakia (28 percent). ``President Michal Kovac is a politician who enjoys the stable trust of, in particular, Christian Democratic Movement (30 percent) and Democratic Union [DU] (28 percent) sympathizers, citizens of Hungarian nationality (28 percent), university-educated people (20 percent), and Bratislava residents (23 percent). ``Also, citizens who trust Jozef Moravcik represent a more or less stable group in terms of their social and demographic makeup.
