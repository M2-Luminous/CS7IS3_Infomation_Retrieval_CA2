Everyone is awaiting this pivotal event in the peace process. The results of this summit will definitely make major headlines in the region for a long time to come. Perhaps the great attention given to the Geneva summit primarily stems from the interest in the need to achieve peace in the Middle East, a peace that is considered an international demand more than it is a domestic or regional demand. [passage omitted]. We will not be divulging a secret if we say that we agree with the U.S. Administration on many points, most prominent of which is the need to achieve a comprehensive peace, admitting that separate and partial deals do not bring a real, viable, and durable peace, that peace can only be achieved through the restoration of the territory and ending the occupation, that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are two integrated tracks without which the peace process cannot be completed, and that stability in the region is important, vital, and essential for world security. Such security can only be achieved through the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace based on the international legitimacy and UN resolutions. Many points of disagreement notwithstanding, the points mentioned above were behind Syria's readiness to cooperate with the former Bush administration and the present Clinton administration to make the peace process successful and to remove obstacles from its path. For over two years, Syria has been making every sincere and honest effort in this context. This has enhanced respect for Syria, increased its importance, and boosted its stands, not only in the eyes of the world, but also in the eyes of the decisionmakers in the U.S. Administration in particular, who planned the Geneva summit as recognition and acknowledgement of Syria's role and of President Hafiz al-Asad's decisive role in the peace process. This Syrian- U.S. cooperation exists and will continue as long the U.S. Administration is committed to the peace process and as long as it is interested in its success in accordance with the assurances, guarantees, and principles on the basis of which it has been launched. This cooperation is apt to yield good fruits in the Geneva summit if the Clinton administration shoulders its responsibility seriously and effectively to convince the Israeli rulers to comply with the terms of peace and to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. There is no problem with Syria, which has accepted the peace process and its bases and worked to make it successful. The problem lies in the stands of the Israeli rulers, who, up to this moment, reject the bases of this process. Furthermore, they are working to marginalize this process. They are tampering with its tracks and distorting it through secret contacts and vague and incomplete agreements. Out of our interest in the peace process, we in Syria are greatly hoping that the Geneva summit will yield positive results which will open the way for the peace process and will remove the traps that the Israeli rulers have placed in its way. By all yardsticks, it is an exceptional chance for the Clinton administration to rectify the situation, improve the atmosphere in the region, make real peace in the Middle East, and prove the credibility of the United States as the sole superpower which has a historic responsibility toward the achievement of peace and security for peoples of the world.
