The revised law stipulates the establishment of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee which will audit the budget of the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) and oversee overall activities of the powerful intelligence agency. Under the law, the committee will have 12 lawmakers as members. Rep. Chong Chae-mun of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party was reportedly tapped to become chairman of the committee. The Assembly also passed a revision to the Law on Additional Punishment for Specific Crime which stipulates punishment of up to a five-year prison term or 5 million won in fines for intelligence committee members and their secretaries accused of leaking official secrets. According to the new law, lawmakers are not allowed to interpellate Cabinet members at the Assembly plenary session longer than 15 minutes. Thus far, the maximum duration of the interpellation was 30 minutes. The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from making harangues or asking same questions as those already asked by other lawmakers previously. Instead, the law introduced the "four-minute free speech system" under which any lawmaker can make a speech for up to four minutes during Assembly plenary sessions. The Assembly speaker is allowed to preside over the free speech session for one hour. Assembly standing committees are obliged to hold two regular meetings every month under the law. The law bans lawmakers owning businesses from being affiliated with Assembly standing committees related with their businesses. For example, a lawmaker owning a construction firm is barred from being a member of the Assembly Construction Committee. The clause is aimed at preventing lawmakers from seeking profits by taking advantage of their status as members of related standing committees. The new Assembly law introduced a clause aimed at discouraging lawmakers' absenteeism. Lawmakers who skip plenary or committee sessions without good reasons will see their allowances curtailed. Under the new law, lawmakers will be able to ask for government documents even while the Assembly is in recess. To encourage Assemblymen's legislation activities, the Legislation Information Center was set up at the National Assembly in accordance with the new law. The revised law also allows live broadcasting of Assembly plenary and standing committee sessions through cable news networks.
