FBIS3-32197 "drlat023_o_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 Colombia * Polls of Voter Preferences Differ on Front Runner * Samper Leads in CNC Poll 94SM0165B Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Dec 93 p 1B 94SM0165B Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Text] The race for the presidency of Colombia between two candidates, Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana, is fairly close, according to EL TIEMPO's latest poll, conducted by the CNC [National Survey Center]. Samper would win the first and second rounds, based on responses of people who intend to vote. But of the total respondents surveyed, Pastrana would win the first round, with a tie in the second round. In comparing these results with the EL TIEMPO poll conducted by Yankelovich in September 1993, the same trend is evident. Three months ago Pastrana was winning the first round among the total number polled by 1.2 points, while in the second round the two candidates would each win 38.3 percent of the votes. In the same way, among people who said they intend to vote, which at that time was 57 percent of the total number polled, Samper led Pastrana by 0.7 percent. Now, of the total number polled, 39 percent think Pastrana is going to be the next president, followed by Samper with 38 percent. Those who said they are going to vote think Colombia's next president is going to be Ernesto Samper, by a three-point difference. These results show that the race between Samper and Pastrana is a real neck-to-neck contest, as the poll has a 3-percent margin of error for the total population. The poll results show without a doubt that Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper would be chosen as their party's presidential candidate, both in the liberal primary and in a conservative primary, if the conservatives decided to hold one. Voters and Nonvoters Of the total population, over half the people polled said they intend to vote in the next elections; 64 percent are now registered. Of this group who intend to vote in the next presidential election, 89 percent always intended to vote for the same candidate, while 9 percent had thought of voting for someone else. In the total population, 19 percent are still undecided about whether or not they will vote. Age and Sex In breaking down the population by sex, age, and socio-economic level, the results among the total number polled show that Pastrana would get more votes from women than men, while Samper would receive more votes from men than from women. In terms of age, the majority of Pastrana's votes would come from people between 18 and 39, while the majority of Samper's votes would come from people over 25. In terms of socio-economic level, classified for the purposes of this poll as lower, middle, and upper, both candidates would get most of their votes from the middle class, followed by the upper class. A difference was found among voters from the lower socio-economic group, where more people intend to vote for Samper.

When compared with the May and September polls, these figures show that the president's ratings have improved in both aspects. In May, 34.5 percent approved of his performance; in September, 47.1 percent, and in December, his approval rating was 53 percent. The president's positive image rose from 15.1 percent in May to 31.2 percent in September, and to 33 percent in December. In the latest poll, 14 percent have a poor image of the president and 38 percent disapprove of his performance. On the nation's situation, 59 percent describe it as average, 33 percent as bad, and 8 percent as good.

The telephone poll was conducted among 1,298 persons in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and Santa Marta, from middle, lower, and upper socio-economic levels. In all, 589 men and 700 women between 18 and 65 were surveyed. The poll's margin of error is 3 percent.
