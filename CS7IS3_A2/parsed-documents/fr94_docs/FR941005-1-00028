Proposed Amendments If the proposed port of entry designation is adopted, the list of Customs regions, districts, and ports of entry at ยง101.3 will be amended to include Rockford, Illinois as a port of entry in the Customs District of Chicago and the Greater Rockford Airport will be deleted from the list of user-fee airports in ยง122.15. Comments Before adopting this proposal as a final rule, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), ยง1.4 of the Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and ยง103.11 (b) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11 (b)) on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U. S. Customs Service, Franklin Court, 4th floor, 1099 14th St., NW., Washington, D.C. 20005. Authority This change is proposed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and 19 U.S.C. 2, 66, and 1624. The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 Customs routinely establishes, expands, and consolidates Customs ports of entry throughout the United States to accommodate the volume of Customs-related activity in various parts of the country. Thus, although this document is being issued with notice for public comment, because it relates to agency management and organization it is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553. Accordingly this document is not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). In addition, this proposal does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development. Dated: September 19, 1994. Samuel H. Banks, Acting Commissioner of Customs. John P. Simpson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
