Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is soon to visit Beijing, and mainland president Jiang Zemin will also visit Moscow and meet with Russian President Yeltsin in the second half of this year. It has been many years since any Soviet Union or Russian prime minister visited the Chinese mainland. Both sides, therefore, value this visit very much. It is learned that on his forthcoming visit to Beijing, Chernomyrdin will mainly discuss with the Chinese mainland economic and trade issues as well as the problem of illegal immigration. Last year, trade volume between the Chinese mainland and Russia reached a record high of $7 billion. At the moment, the Chinese mainland is Russia's second biggest trade partner, after Germany. But there are so many trade obstacles between the two sides that demand immediate removal. The most serious problems are to do with settlement of exchange and transportation. Though the Chinese mainland declared last year that it acknowledges free exchange between the ruble and the renminbi, the two sides have not yet worked out a specific way to conduct settlement through banks. Businessmen from the two sides often have to carry sacks of banknotes with them to make purchases in the other country. Besides, despite the dramatic expansion of Sino-Russian border trade, inadequate transportation capacity in border areas has brought great difficulty to the cross-border barter trade. In recent years, large numbers of Chinese mainland residents have illegally settled in Russia. According to one estimate, there are at least 100,000 Chinese people in greater Moscow. A Russian official survey indicates that the population of illegal immigrants from the Chinese mainland in Moscow proper is 50,000. As a Russian diplomat put it, one can hear Chinese spoken any time at underground railway stations and on sidewalks. Illegal immigration has brought many security problems to Russia, causing a headache for the country. On his forthcoming visit to Beijing, Chernomyrdin will discuss with Beijing authorities ways to block illegal immigration. Military cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Russia has caused much concern among the international community. Though it is still unknown whether or not it will be among the topics of the prime minister's meetings, there is nevertheless information indicating that Beijing is carrying on a number of military technical cooperation projects with Russia, and negotiations on weapon purchase are still underway. Last year, on his visit to Moscow, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, gave Russia a long shopping list of weapons, including Sukov-27K fighter planes, missiles, tanks, and submarines. Negotiations on this purchasing plan are still continuing. In addition, the two sides are also continuing to implement plans for reciprocal military personnel training and technical transfers. A high-level Russian diplomat put it straightforwardly that military cooperation is an important part of Russia's relations with the Chinese mainland, which is conducive to the Russian economy. He said: Russia's defense industry is facing enormous difficulties. To find a way out, the defense industry must try to open up the international market. This official pointed out: Standardization was lacking in the past when Russia sold weapons to the Chinese mainland, and ordnance companies could export weapons on their own. But now the Russian Government has set up a "Weaponry and Equipment Corporation," through which the center could keep centralized control on the export of weapons. He said: Russia's arms sale policy toward the Chinese mainland is no different than that toward any other country, as regional balance will be taken into consideration and Beijing will not be privileged. Commenting on the rumor that Russia may export aircraft carriers to the mainland, this official said: "It does not have much ground." It is learned that though Russia badly needs to make money by exporting weapons, it is unlikely that it will export to the Chinese mainland such weapons as aircraft carriers that may pose a threat to Russia itself.
