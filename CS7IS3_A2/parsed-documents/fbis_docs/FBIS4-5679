Aramaki, 62, who ran as an independent, defeated independent contender Mampei Kimura, 70, by a wide margin. Aramaki was supported by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and all seven ruling parties -- the Social Democratic Party, foreign minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's new party Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party. Kimura was supported by the Japanese Communist Party, another opposition party. Aramaki won 421,583 votes, while Kimura garnered 225,688 with 78 percent of ballots counted as of 8:30 P.M. Voter turnout stood at a record low of 43.02 percent, down 0.72 percentage point from 43.74 percent four years ago. The governorship race, which came on the heels of Hosokawa's resignation announcement Friday, did not receive much attention from voters because it was virtually a replay of the previous election, fought between the same two people.
