Tomorrow the government's Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss its attitude to Partnership for Peace, but will not make any decisions yet. Prime Minister Esko Aho, who addressed the Diet's Defense Committee, said that the main content of the offer to Finland concerns peacekeeping activities. Aho's definition is broader than the stance presented by Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn to the Defense Committee on Tuesday [15 March], according to which Finland will limit itself to offering peacekeeping training only.
