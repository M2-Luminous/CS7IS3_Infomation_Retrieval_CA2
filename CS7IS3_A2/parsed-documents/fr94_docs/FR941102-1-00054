FR941102-1-00054 FR941102-1-00015 Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules None. Description, Potential Impact and Number of Small Entities Involved The proposed changes in the regulations would affect a number of entities both large and small. An estimate of such parties affected is approximately 65 million new wireless services users and approximately 4 million PBX equipment owners. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with Stated Objectives With respect to PBX equipment, the NPRM asks whether the proposed rules must be applied where the equipment serves a physically small location, such as a single story building, or a small number of closely situated telephone stations.
