At the leader's request, the delegates unanimously voted to extend his powers in that post (without reelection) "until 2 April 2004." They also adopted a number of amendments to the rules, under which the LDPR chairman has the opportunity to appoint personally the party's Supreme Council and other leading bodies, and to change their composition at any moment he sees fit. The delegates also confirmed that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will remain the party's candidate in the event of presidential elections being held in Russia. The fifth congress of the LDPR also adopted a resolution on setting up the party's "Zhirinovskiy's Falcon" [Sokol Zhirinovskogo] Television and Radio Company which is to disseminate "the truth about the party" in conditions of "a complete information blockade." Asking the congress deputies to grant him additional powers, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that this was out of financial considerations and "intrigues by the special services" that are doing everything to destroy the party. On the whole, the theme of Russian and foreign special services ran throughout the entire one and a half hour speech by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. According to him these "special services" offered him 100 million dollars to "leave politics." The LDPR leader is inclined to attribute their efforts to the behavior of a number of recent comrades-in-arms and members of the LDPR faction in the State Duma who recently announced their decision to leave the faction. As is known, several party members recently announced their differences with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Viktor Kobelev, until recently head of the party apparatus, was among such representatives of the LDPR. Judging from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's speech and by the decisions adopted by the congress, it has been decided to put an end once and for all to the internal party rebellion. Henceforth, to use the words of the LDPR leader, "the rebels will not be able to carry out hostile activities by playing their card of election by the congress." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as always, did not mince his words. He said that the LDPR's immediate task is to become the ruling party, to form a single-party government, and to occupy the post of head of state. "The political system of Russia will soon receive first aid in the form of the LDPR," he told those assembled. "The LDPR's slogan is 'The LDPR on the path to power' and we will implement it without fail," he added. "The mighty vessel of the LDPR has set sail on the expanses of the oceans and all unseaworthy tubs have been left behind," is how Vladimir Zhirinovskiy described the situation on the threshold of the future presidential elections. The LDPR leader unambiguously defined the position of his party toward the authorities. "We are the main party in opposition to the existing regime," he stated. The government, in his opinion, "is incapable of doing anything" and the longer it remains in power "the more votes we will receive in all the subsequent elections," he stated. The LDPR leader advised the president "to give up his advisers and crew who are always putting him in an awkward situation." National and state problems occupied quite a big place in the party leader's speech. As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed the readiness "to defend the interests of Russians on the territory of the former USSR." He prudently refrained from rash statements on "pushes to the south" this time, stating that coming to power, the LDPR would act only legally. Nevertheless, "the frontiers of the USSR as of 1975, recognized by the world community, will be restored and Russian flags will fly over the cities of Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus, etc," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. Everybody has a hobby and the LDPR leader's, to use his words, "only vice is a weakness for frontier posts: For them being in place." "If some unclean force" has moved them inside the Russian state, the task of Zhirinovskiy's party is to return them to their place, but within the framework of the law, he added. Dwelling on the party's financial problems, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that the pre-election campaign on the eve of last year's parliamentary elections cost the LDPR 250 million rubles and the party had just paid its debts, and in the four years of its existence, the party has spent 1 billion rubles at current prices. At the congress, besides delegates, there are quite a few people from abroad who share Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's views -- mainly representatives of various Serb organizations, and also of Iraq's ruling Ba'th party, the German People's Union, and others.
