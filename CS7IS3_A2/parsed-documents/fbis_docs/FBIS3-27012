It is a rare event in China's rocket development history to achieve complete success during a rocket's first test launch. Long Lehao said: The Long-March 3A rocket, which incorporates China's latest carrier rocket technology, is actually a brand new model. The newly developed high-energy oxyhydrogen III (gao neng qing yang di san ji 7559 5174 8641 8638 0005 4787] involved the successful tackling of several hundred technological problems and the development of dozens of major new technologies, many of which approach contemporary advanced international levels. The carrier rocket also employs a control system for operating four-spindle gyroscope oscillating platform [dong diao tuo luo si zhou rao xing ping tai 0520 6148 7094 5828 0934 6519 2371 1840 1627 0669] for the first time in China, a technology quite advanced even in the world. The use of the cold helium heating pressurization technology [leng hai jia wen zeng ya ji shu 0397 8640 0502 3306 1073 1090 2111 2611] for pressurizing the third-stage liquid oxygen chamber makes China the second country after the United States to independently and successfully develop and utilize such a technology. The low-temperature hydrogen energy source [di wen qing qi neng yuan] and other technologies used in the servo-control mechanism of the third-level oscillating power generator [san ji bai dong fa dong ji 0005 4787 2369 0520 4099 0520 2623] is also a new technology in our country. Long Lehao said: The successful launch has extremely great significance to China's space undertakings: -- The successful launch has provided a carrier vehicle for China's new-generation and bigger-capacity satellites -- the Dongfanghong [East Is Red] 3. As a result, it will play an important role in promoting the development of China's broadcast and telecommunications industries. China's new-model telecommunications satellites will serve the needs of its economic construction even better if they can be launched earlier. -- It helps lay the foundation for the formation of a rocket series capable of carrying the largest payload onto higher orbits. The carrying capacity of the Long-March 3A is 2.5 tonnes, up from the Long-March 3's 1.4 tonnes. The Long-March 3B -- which is based on the Long-March 3A with extended second-stage rocket, an enhanced cowling system, and four cluster liquid booster rockets -- is capable of carrying 4.8 tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3C, which strips two booster rockets from the Long-March 3B, is capable of carrying 3.5 tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3A, 3B, and 3C rockets constitute China's rocket series capable of carrying the largest payloads onto higher orbits. The series is capable of carrying a wide range of payloads. It ranks first in China and second in the world in terms of the capacity to carry payload onto higher or lower orbits. -- The success in the rocket's first test launch greatly improves the Long March rocket's competitiveness in the international market for satellites launch services. Because it is capable of carrying a payload ranging from 1.4 tonnes to 4.8 tonnes and sending it to geosynchronous orbit and because it is capable of launching one, two, or three satellites at the same time, it can be used for launching a variety of satellites and thereby has a greater appeal to consumers. The Long-March 3A can also change orbits, redirect, initiate revolution [qi xuan 6386 2467], and conduct large attitude angular movement according to consumers' demands.
