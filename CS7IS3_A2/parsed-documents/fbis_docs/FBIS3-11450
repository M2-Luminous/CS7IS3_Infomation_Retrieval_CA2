During the celebrations they met with 4,000 Guaranis and responded to their demands for education and territorial recognition. The president, according to 29 January EL MUNDO, traveled to Camiri with other high officials to launch his nationwide Educational Reform Program and, by establishing the first Guarani Educational Council, he legally recognized the Guarani bilingual education program. Launched in 1992, this program involves 30 schools and offers bilingual instruction to children as well as adult literacy classes. It operates under the auspices of UNICEF and other nongovernmental organizations such as the Peasant Research and Promotion Center (CIPCA) and the Social Investment Fund (FIS). It is estimated that over 5,000 people have taken advantage of the program so far. [La Paz PRESENCIA "Reportajes" Section 23 Jan] La Paz daily PRESENCIA of 29 February reports that during the visit, Vice President Cardenas, Bolivia's first indigenous vice president and a prominent advocate for indigenous rights, declared that "the existence of slavery in the Bolivian Chaco is a disgrace to all Bolivians," referring to the estimated 10,000 Guaranis living in indentured servitude on large estates in Chuquisaca and Tarija Departments. There are also "free" Guarani communities in Santa Cruz Department that maintain a tenuous hold on their communal lands, as spotlighted in a 16 January PRESENCIA special investigative report (LATIN AMERICA DAILY REPORT 18 Feb). Santa Cruz daily EL MUND0 of 29 January reports that in one of the first steps to combat this situation, President Sanchez de Losada officially announced a resolution that would make bilingual education in what the press describes as "captive areas" compulsory. Large landholders of Tarija and Chuquisaca would be obligated to build schools on their estates for their workers. The schools would come under the supervision of the Secretariat of Education. The FIS, for its part, would give special attention to the improvement and creation of educational infrastructure for the Guaranis. Finally, the Guarani Higher Institute for Bilingual Intercultural Education would be established. According to the 22 January issue of PRESENCIA, Maria Calvo, under secretary for ethnic affairs, said that the extension and consolidation of bilingual education into "captive" areas is one of the most important steps taken to mobilize those Indian groups who remain in illegal servitude. She acknowledged that this task will not be easy because of opposition by landlords who have accused "literacy campaign workers" of preparing "an armed revolution" and of "fomenting a workers uprising," as reported by PRESENCIA "Reportajes" section of 23 January. Other reactions to PRESENCIA'S report on slavery in the Chaco came from Human Rights Commission officials in the Chamber of Deputies who resolved to take concerted action with government and nongovernmental organizations to end these human rights abuses, according to 22 January PRESENCIA. A few days before the 28 January presidential visit to Camiri, Guarani People's Assembly (APG) spokesman, Guido Chumiray, was reported by the 24 January issue of PRESENCIA to have met with the Secretary for Ethnic Affairs Ramiro Molina to review a list of demands to be submitted to the president at that time. First on his list, the paper said, was the "legal recognition of Guarani territory" to halt the tide of confiscations, remedy unequal land distribution, eliminate illegal servitude, and stem migration to the cities. The list also called for the creation of a Guarani Development Fund for the implementation of agricultural projects in the Chaco among the "free" communities. Projects would include irrigation systems, agricultural research centers, credit for the purchase of machinery, the rehabilitation of arable land, the purchase of livestock, and marketing promotion. The secretary observed, according to the daily, that the situation of slavery for thousands of Guaranis in the Chaco is a decades-old problem and acknowledged their "subhuman" living and working conditions as well as the extermination and extinction of other Indian groups. He agreed that current land legislation needed to be modified, but that it should be done in coordination with other secretariats and representatives of Indian groups. Following President Sanchez de Lozada's visit to Camiri, PRESENCIA 29 January reported that "with the official establishment of the [Guarani] Council, the government partially acceded to APG demands on the subject of education but maintained a discreet silence with respect to the other demands submitted in La Paz."
