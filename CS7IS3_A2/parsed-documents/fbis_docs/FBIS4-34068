A U.S. Army South communique says the troops sent to Colombia are specialists in meteorology, air traffic control, civilian-military operations, security, and medical treatment. The U.S. troops' mission is to transport Colombian Government first aid personnel and supplies and to evacuate disaster victims. The Neiva Airport in Colombia is serving as an operations center and a storage center for supplies that will later be transported by helicopter to affected areas that are inaccessible by land following last week's earthquake. The strong earthquake, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and disappearances early this week, was part of a wave of earthquakes that "bounced" among Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, the United States, and Canada. Earthquakes have recently increased in the so-called "circle of fire" in the Pacific, which includes all countries on the Pacific coast.
