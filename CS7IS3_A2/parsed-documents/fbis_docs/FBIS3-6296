The draft, released to members of the House of Representatives justice committee, constitutes a proposed amendment to a law regulating the professional activities of foreign lawyers in Japan. The draft bill envisions conditionally authorizing Japanese and foreign lawyers to run a joint law firm and provide legal consultation services, although it will keep a ban on the personal hiring by foreign lawyers of Japanese lawyers in Japan. One of the two conditions mandates that Japanese lawyers wishing to start a joint law firm must have practiced for more than five years since registering with the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. Under the other condition, however, the proposed legislation will continue to bar foreign lawyers from arguing both criminal and civil cases in Japanese courts. If the two conditions are met, a joint law firm as an entity will be authorized to hire Japanese lawyers, according to the text of the bill. If enacted, the amendment will allow a client to receive consultation services regarding Japanese and foreign laws from a single law firm. The government plans to introduce the amendment in parliament in early April. If approved, it will come into force within a year. The amendment will also soften the current law's principle of mutual benefits, thereby authorizing lawyers from countries that ban foreign lawyers' activities to practice law in Japan. The amendment calls for qualifying foreign lawyers, who have practiced law for more than five years in countries where they obtained licenses, to practice law in Japan. It will also soften a five-year requirement by allowing such lawyers to count up to two years of practicing law in Japan as a legal trainee as part of the five-year requirement. The legislation will allow foreign law firms to use in Japan the corporate names they use in their countries of origin. The amendment was sketched out as a result of joint study by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and the Justice Ministry. Its broad outline was released as part of a package of pump- priming economic measures in February by the government of Prime Minister Horihiro Hosokawa.
