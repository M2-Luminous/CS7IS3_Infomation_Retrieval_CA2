The average Japanese family of 3.48 people spent 335,379 yen monthly in the year, down 0.6 percent from the previous year, following a 0.5 percent fall in the previous year, the agency said. "Families spent less on durable goods, discouraged by lower income resulting from the recession," an official at the agency said. Families of salaried workers spent 1.3 percent less, while families of nonsalaried workers registered a 0.7 percent spending increase, the official said. In March alone, household spending shrank a real 4.3 percent to an average 353,908 yen for the second consecutive month after four months of year-on-year gains, it said.
