Even the boldest classifications of world markets by Western institutional investors did not view Russia as a high-risk but potentially high-return financial market, preferring to just pass it over in silence. However, it appears that the incredible has happened: A large American finance company, Pioneer Group, Inc., yesterday announced its intention to invest on a large scale in the stock of enterprises from Russia and the CIS; the volume of such investment at the first stage will come to $3 million, and is expected to grow by another $100 million. This is the first case in which specifically institutional foreign investment in Russia has been organized. Pioneer Group is one of the large American finance companies, which manages a family of "mutual" funds in the United States, Poland, India, and a number of other countries. The decision of the Pioneer Group to establish a mutual fund solely to invest in the Russian market represents the first case of an institutional approach to organizing capital investment in the Russian economy. It was no accident that the announcement of the Pioneer Group concerning the creation of the "Russian" mutual fund was timed to coincide with Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. The important political aspect of the institutionalization of American investment was stressed in this manner. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, two considerations at once compel a serious attitude towards the intention of the Pioneer Group to be the first American mutual fund to make money on the Russian stock exchange. First, the Pioneer Group has succeeded in winning considerable support from two influential Russian organizations--the Institute of Economics of the Transitional Period and the Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises. Both organizations have acted as founders of a Russian finance company established with the majority participation of the Pioneer Group. This company will manage financial resources raised by Pioneer in the United States and earmarked for investment in the Russian market. Second, the Pioneer Group has the currently unique favorable experience of effectively managing financial resources in East European finance markets. Three years ago, this company established the first mutual fund in Poland, which within a very short period of time became the main institutional player in the financial market of that country, and introduced quite a number of financial techniques in the Polish market that were new to Poland (in particular, standards of professional investment analysis). In Poland, Pioneer also started out with $3 million; as of today, the amount of assets of the Polish fund exceeds $400 million. The well-known international company Ernst and Young has been selected to be the main financial consultant and manager of the Pioneer project in Russia. According to an official Pioneer press release, this company was selected because its specialists have considerable experience and knowledge of the Russian market. In addition, Ernst and Young has an extensive international network. KOMMERSANT experts note that the fact that mutual funds are organizing investment in the Russian economy may, in and of itself, serve as a reliable external indicator of a change in the quality of the Russian financial market. As the president of the Pioneer Group, John Cogan (John Cogan [name rendered in English in parentheses]), stated in yesterday's official press release, his experts have been following the evolution of the financial market of Russia for a long time. In Mr. Cogan's opinion, the current stage of development of privatization and structural changes in Russia's economy provide unique investment opportunities "for experienced investors" in the coming decade. KOMMERSANT experts believe that the appearance of a professional American mutual fund in the Russian market will put Russian check funds into a serious competitive situation, especially with regard to a dialogue with privatized enterprises and organization of their effective transition to market conditions for economic operations. Besides, participation of a sizable amount of capital from Pioneer in operations on the stock and state securities market may influence the liquidity of these markets very beneficially. [Boxed item] Pioneer Group--the First Foreign Mutual Fund in Poland Based on 1993 performance, operations of the Pioneer Polish fund turned out to be the third most profitable within the general structure of operations of the Pioneer family of mutual funds. Polish observers maintain that the presence of a powerful foreign institutional player became one of the reasons for the creation of a liquid market on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It is essential that the Pioneer Polish fund uses for its operations not only American investment but also contributions from Polish citizens by extensively distributing its stock in Poland.

Pioneer also manages funds in Poland, India, Taiwan, and a number of other countries. In its press release, Pioneer announced its intention to concentrate on the stock of privatized Russian enterprises. However, the investment strategy of Pioneer will be defined more clearly at the official presentation of the fund on 19 January. [End boxed item]
