A management umbrella organization will continue the traditional name, Pieter D. Harmsen, chairman of the board of directors, announced after an extraordinary meeting of the board of governors in Fuerth on Friday evening [4 February]. The restructuring entails a reduction of jobs by 3,300 to 11,400 in the corporation by mid-1995. The corporation managers justified the profound restructuring by pointing to the development at Grundig, which is practically an "almost-collapse." The basic reason for this is the decline on the European market for entertainment electronics.
