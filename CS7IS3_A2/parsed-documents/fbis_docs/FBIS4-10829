Concurrent [concurrente] Ambassador Lazaro Cabezas presented his credentials to Governor General Sir Reginald Oswald Palmer in St. George's on 5 April and held official discussions with Nicholas Brathwaite, prime minister and foreign minister. Cabezas, an ambassador stationed in Barbados and accredited to five eastern Caribbean countries, told PRENSA LATINA during a telephone interview that the reception in Grenada was surprisingly friendly despite many years without diplomatic relations. "We felt all of Grenadian society recognizes the important contribution Cuba made during the government of Maurice Bishop (1979-1983) to the development of that small island," he said. Government officials and professionals who studied in Cuba told Cabezas of the importance of Cuba's contribution in building the Point Salines International Airport, which has led to an increase in tourism, the giving of advice to the fisheries industry and health sector, and the offering of scholarships. The Cuban diplomat said the governor general as well as Brathwaite conveyed to him their gratitude for past assistance and their interest in promoting new ties of cooperation, mainly in the public health field. In a visit to explore means of cooperation, the Cuban representative met with Phinsley St. Louis, health, housing, and environment minister, and Shirley Mcthlin, Foreign Ministry permanent secretary and law school graduate from Santiago de Cuba University. Cabezas also met with executives of the Grenada Chamber of Commerce, whom he invited to participate in the meeting of Caribbean businessmen scheduled for June in Santiago de Cuba. In the VIP book of visitors to St. George's Government House, the Cuban ambassador left a written testimony of "this historic day" during which Grenada and Cuba grew close again. Bilateral relations reached their peak during the popular revolutionary government of Maurice Bishop, who was ousted and killed by a faction of his cabinet on 19 October 1983. The United States launched a powerful military invasion against the small island seven days later under the pretext of rescuing U.S. citizens who were at St. George's. The U.S. military occupation lasted a year and a half, and bilateral relations were frozen during the government installed under those circumstances. Following the election of the current Grenadian Government, Cuba stopped questioning its legality in international forums, and Grenada lifted its objections of allowing Cuba into the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO). All of these actions can be considered a process of detente which culminated in the acceptance of the new ambassador's credentials.
