This is an old custom; a lot of religious and non-religious people have done this. But we must recognize that such an "obligation" has become an obsession among a group of Brazilian prelates. In every election, always at the last CNBB [National Conference of Brazilian Bishops] meeting before an election, some kind of document defining how Catholics must vote is submitted to the bishops conference. In the past few years the tone has always been more or less the same -- at least since the PT [Workers Party] appeared on the national political scene. This election year, The Responsible Vote does not conceal its position. The religious men who sign it define themselves politically. The document distinguishes three threats to the informed vote: the resistance to voting, the lack of knowledge of what is at stake in the elections, and the lack of information about the elections. The latter subject is blamed by the voting instructors on the pernicious role played by the media, which "nearly totally" responds "to the interests of the major economic groups." Given that Brazilian voters cannot perceive what is correct without the help of these progressive clergymen, they have barely three options: the "neoliberal" choice, which represents the peak of submission of the sinners to Satan -- given that this option meets the "recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank" -- and preaches a considerable increase in the role of the market; then comes the "organized capitalism" option that attempts to "solve the crisis" through the reorganization of the economy and the state (is this a crime?). This threat is equally sinful because it seeks to promote a "swift incorporation of the Brazilian economy into the international market." And finally, the redeeming proposal, the "people's democracy proposal," which is the only one that seeks "to resume development by redistributing wealth and meeting the needs of the people." Only one political party fulfills the yearnings of the national progressive prelates. As Bishop Demetrio Valentino, coordinator of the CNBB Social Pastoral and one of those responsible for the document, said: Political action is not "a mere option, but an obligation" for Christians. He added that through political action "men and women" transform society. However, serious problems can result from supporting this party because the PT does not divide humankind into two genders. Under the light of the Social Pastoral, can the third gender, which also is accepted by the PT, transform society? In this document -- which is plagued with commonplace ideas (such as "we should not be deceived by speeches" and "several candidates who make believe they are good and respectful persons only want to fool the people") -- it is stated that our participation in the electoral process is not a matter of choice "but a matter of faith." Could it be that Pope Johan Paul II lends the word this meaning? Can "faith" depend on party obligations?
