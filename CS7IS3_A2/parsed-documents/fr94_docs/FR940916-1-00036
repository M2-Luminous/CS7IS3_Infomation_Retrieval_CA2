FR940916-1-00036 FR940916-1-00015 O. Small Business Subcontracting Goals DOSAR 619.705&hyph;1 is added to require that contracting officers incorporate the Department's current fiscal year goals as negotiated with the SBA in all pertinent Department solicitations. A new provision at 652.219&hyph;70 is added to accomplish this purpose. P. Hazardous Material Identification Subpart 623.3 is added to require that all work, including the handling of hazardous materials, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Department of State Safety/Health and Environmental Management Resource Guide. Q. Resource Conservation and Recovery Subpart 623.4 is added to provide policy and guidance implementing Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962, P.L. 92&hyph;580) regarding an affirmative procurement program for recovered materials. Associated solicitation provisions and contract clauses are provided at 652.223&hyph;70 through 652.223&hyph;78. R. Defense Base Act Insurance Supplementation Subpart 628.3 is added to provide guidance on the Defense Base Act for acquisitions for services or construction which require contractor personnel to perform work outside the United States. Language is also added to provide guidance on use of the contract which the Department has awarded to an insurance broker and carrier to provide Defense Base Act insurance. Associated solicitation provisions and contract clauses are provided at 652.228&hyph;71 through 652.228&hyph;77. S. Alternative Dispute Resolution DOSAR 633.214&hyph;70 is added to provide policy and guidance regarding alternative dispute resolution. T. Increase in Major Systems Acquisition Threshold DOSAR 634.001 is amended to increase the Department's threshold for major systems acquisitions from $10,000,000 to $30,000,000. The threshold has not changed since 1988. The revised threshold is more accurate given current spending trends and inflation. U. Contractor Use of Travel Advances Part 651 is added to state the Department's prohibition on issuing travel advances, official travel orders, or Government Travel Requisitions to contractors. II. Other DOSAR Revisions Numerous other revisions have been made to update the DOSAR to implement FAR changes that have occurred; to indicate appropriate approving officials as required by the FAR; to delete obsolete DOSAR passages and clauses; and, to reflect current organizational designations and language. These changes do not affect the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor. Several DOSAR clauses have been deleted, as they are obsolete. They are: 652.202&hyph;70, Definitions; 652.214&hyph;70, Language Version (superseded by FAR 52.214&hyph;34, Submission of Offers in the English Language); 652.214&hyph;72, Authorization to Perform; 652.232&hyph;70, Invoice Requirements and 652.232&hyph;71, Method of Payment (Electronic Funds Transfer) (both superseded by FAC 94&hyph;20 which clarified that Prompt Payment Act requirements apply to overseas contracts; therefore, FAR clauses 52.232&hyph;25, Prompt Payment and 52.232&hyph;28, Electronic Funds Transfer Payment Methods, will be used). The following new DOSAR clauses have been added, in addition to those mentioned in I. above: 652.206&hyph;70, Competition Advocacy/Ombudsman (to provide potential offerors with a contact point if they believe that a solicitation is particularly restrictive of competition); 652.216&hyph;71, Price Adjustment (to allow overseas contractors to be able to adjust their prices if the host country government enacts laws affecting actual costs of direct service labor); 652.232&hyph;70, Payment Schedule and Invoice Submission (Fixed-price) and 652.232&hyph;71, Voucher Submission (Cost-Reimbursement) (to provide clauses pertaining to the submission of invoices/vouchers); 652.237&hyph;70, Compensatory Time Off (to allow for personal services contractors to be given compensatory time off for overtime work); 652.237&hyph;71, Identification/Building Pass (to ensure that contractors who work in Department of State facilities are properly cleared and have an identification pass); and, 652.237&hyph;72, Observance of Legal Holidays and Administrative Leave (for contracts where contractor personnel will be working on-site in any Department of State facility). The following Department of State forms have been added: DS&hyph;1918, Purchase Order File; DS&hyph;1919, Delivery Order File; DS&hyph;1910, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) File; DS&hyph;1921, Award/Modification of Interagency Acquisition Agreement; and DS&hyph;1910, Small Business/Labor Surplus Agency Review_Actions Above the Small Purchase Limitation. These forms are all for internal Department or Government use; since they do not affect contractors or potential contractors, they are not being printed in this Federal Register publication. III. Impact The Department of State certifies regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
