FR941103-2-00143 FR941103-2-00081 In a letter dated May 11, 1994, Volkswagen informed NHTSA of contemplated changes to the antitheft device to be placed as standard equipment on the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines, and requested that the modified antitheft device be permitted. In a letter dated July 14, 1994, Volkswagen submitted a letter showing ``good cause'' why NHTSA should make the grant of the petition for modification applicable to MY 1995. In a letter dated August 3, 1994, Volkswagen provided supplemental information addressing section 543.6(a)(4), reasons for the petitioner's belief that the antitheft device will be effective in reducing motor vehicle theft, and section 543.6(a)(5), reasons for the petitioner's belief that NHTSA should determine that the antitheft device is likely to be as effective as parts marking. Together, Volkswagen's submissions of May 11, July 14, and August 3 constitute a complete submission, as required by 49 CFR 543.9(c)(2), in that the petition meets the general content requirements of section 543.5 paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) and (7); and the specific content requirements under section 543.6. In a letter dated May 23, 1994 to Volkswagen, the agency granted the petitioner's request for confidential treatment of bracketed information in its May 11, 1994 letter. On September 6, 1994, Volkswagen informed NHTSA in writing that the names of the A6 and S6 car lines and the model year of their introduction, had been publicly released, and therefore, Volkswagen no longer requested confidential treatment for this information. Volkswagen's petition contains a detailed description of the identity, design, and location of the components of the antitheft device, including the electrical schematics of the device. There are locks on the trunk, the driver's door, and the front passenger door. Volkswagen stated that the antitheft device planned for MY 1995 is activated by removing the key from the ignition and locking the driver's door or trunk. When the operator removes the ignition key, exits from the vehicle and locks the driver's door with the key, the central locking system is activated. Activation of the central locking system renders the starter motor nonfunctional and arms an audible alarm. The alarm is triggered by sensors in the light contact switches for the doors and engine compartment, by a sensor located in the trunk key cylinder, and by disconnection of the ground wire between the radio housing and the antitheft alarm unit. The theft deterrent system of the antitheft device planned for MY 1995 has an engine starter interrupt function. While the system is armed, any breach of it will automatically interrupt the starter relay. Once the alarm has been triggered, the engine cannot be started until the alarm has been deactivated with the key in one of the front doors or the trunk lock.
