FR940831-0-00063 FR940831-0-00024 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [TN123&hyph;1&hyph;6349&hyph;FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;5] Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of Tennessee AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The purpose of this document is to accelerate the effective date for the redesignation of Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee, from nonattainment to attainment for the carbon monoxide (CO) air quality standard. EPA previously published a direct final action redesignating the Memphis/Shelby County CO nonattainment area effective September 26, 1994. Since no comments were received during the public comment period on that notice and sanctions would otherwise be imposed for a brief period, this notice makes the redesignation effective immediately. This action stops the sanction clock and thus prevents sanctions from being imposed on the Memphis/Shelby County area. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will be effective on August 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia, 30365. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ben Franco of the EPA Region IV Air Programs Branch at (404) 347&hyph;3555 ext 4211, and at the above address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 26, 1994, EPA published a direct final notice (see 59 FR 37939) redesignating the Memphis/Shelby County area from nonattainment to attainment for CO. That notice stated the effective date of the redesignation would be September 26, 1994, if no adverse comments were received. No adverse comments have been received. Subsequently, on August 4, 1994, EPA published a rule (see 59 FR 39832) identifying areas with findings in place that would be subject to sanctions under the Clean Air Act (the Act) as amended in 1990. This action becomes effective on September 6, 1994. The Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee, CO nonattainment area was identified as one of the areas which would be subject to sanctions under section 179(A) of the Act beginning on September 6, 1994. The 18-month clock leading to the imposition of these sanctions was started by a letter dated January 15, 1993, in which EPA found that the State of Tennessee had failed to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for an oxygenated fuels program and corrections to a basic inspections/maintenance program by November 15, 1992. These sanctions would be lifted once the redesignation becomes effective. Under the timetable established by the August 4, 1994, sanction rule and the July 26, 1994, redesignation notice, sanctions would be in place from September 6, 1994, to September 26, 1994, the effective date established in the July 26, 1994, redesignation notice. In order to prevent the imposition of sanctions for a three week period on an area whose redesignation to attainment has been approved, EPA is hereby accelerating the effective date of the redesignation and making it effective immediately upon publication of this notice. This will alleviate a restriction for which there is no useful purpose in this instance. Final Action The EPA published this action on July 26, 1994, (see 59 FR 37939) without prior proposal because the Agency viewed this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipated no adverse comments. Since no comments were received the final rule published on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37939) amending 40 CFR 52.2220 and ยง81.343 is effective August 31, 1994, under the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
