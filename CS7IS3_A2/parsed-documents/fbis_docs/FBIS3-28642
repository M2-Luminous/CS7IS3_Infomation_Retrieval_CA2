FBIS3-28642 "dreas027_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 South Korea * President Kim's Advisers, Style Described 942C0068B Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean 12 Jan 94 p 4 942C0068B Seoul TONG-A ILBO Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [Article by Song Yong-on] [Excerpts] People often say that President Kim is a "political pro of the 10th grade." They mean to say that he has an outstanding ability to make political maneuvers and breakthroughs that baffle the imagination. He changed direction by suddenly announcing during his New Year's press conference the postponement of the DLP convention originally scheduled for May, and subsequently on 10 January hosting a luncheon in honor of the three former presidents. Where did the president get his idea of bringing abut a turnaround in the political situation? His intimates unanimously point out that it was his own well thought-out idea. If so, is he a person who won't listen to others? [passage omitted] In the process of adapting a political decision or selecting personnel, President Kim widely utilizes public and private channels. What he uses most is telephone conversation. In fact, he avails himself of every opportunity to make phone calls to many people to hear their opinions on various matters. He meets some of them in person, although the frequency of such meetings has decreased since he moved into the Blue House. Said an official concerned: "President Kim seems to feel that overdependence on information furnished by official agencies might cause information overload and that there is a limit to his ability to listen to the public through these channels. That is why he is in all ears to listen to opinions from all sources." [passage omitted] The president often makes the calls himself so that even his secretaries are kept in the dark. Mostly he does so between the end of the 2100 TV newscast and bedtime. When he moved into the Blue House, he carried with him his personal telephone book that he had kept when he lived in Sangdo-tong. Listed here, titled "Telephone Reference," are the names and numbers of more than 800 persons, including those who are not well-known, such as his classmates, hometown friends, those he contacted during his days in the opposition, restaurant owners, etc. The list also includes many of opinion makers in the economic, judicial, and academic communities. [passage omitted] Said an official: "President Kim has become acquainted with a surprisingly large number of people since he entered politics some 40 years ago. Valuing his ties with these people highly, he calls them up or meets them from time to time to hear their opinions on a wide range of issues." He calls just to say hello sometimes or to hear about the trend of public opinion. When he discusses policy matters in the economic, judicial, and academic circles, he hears a lot. Prominent among those in the business community with whom Kim often consults are: Ku Pyong-hoe, chairman of Lucky-Goldstar; Kim Sang-ha, chairman of Samyang Co.; Kim Ung-se, president of Lotte World; Sin Kyok-ho, chairman of the Lotte Group, and Pak Yong-hak, chairman of the Taenong group. Lotte World President Kim is the father-in-law of President Kim's second son, Hyon Chol. In the academic community Kim consults with: Professors Pae Chae-sik, Yi Kak-pom, Yi Myong-hyon, and Yi Su-song at Seoul University; Professor Pak Yong-sik (former president) of Yonsei University; Professor Kim Kye-su of the University of Foreign Studies; Professor Mun Pyong-chip (former president) of Chungang University; and Professors Ha Tok-mo and So Chae-kin of Tongguk University. Professor Pae was President Kim's classmate at Kyongnam High School. President Kim often calls members of "Samsuhoe," an alumni organization of Kyongnam High School. Reportedly, he met them once in a group. The membership of Samsuhoe is about 80, some of whom live in Pusan. In the judicial circles the president consults with: Attorneys Kim Yun-to, Kim Hong-su, and Mun In-ku. The president also seeks opinions from many in the military. Last spring while discussing the 12 December [1979] incident, Kim said, "I recently met with Gen. Chong Sung-hwa." A source close to President Kim said: "He got acquainted with many in the military because he himself served in the National Assembly Defense Committee for many years when he was an Assembly member. He seems to seek opinions from many military figures, regardless of whether they are in uniform or on the reserve list or in civvies." There is one person whom we cannot omit when discussing Kim's private channels of communication. That is Hyon Chol, his second son. He is currently taking a doctorate course at Koryo University. It is said that he presents candid opinions to his father on a wide range of issues. In the December government and party reshuffle, including the replacement of Blue House senior secretaries, some belonging to the Sangdo-tong inner circle were appointed. Some observers attribute this to Hyon Chol's influence. Chon Pyong-min and Yi Chung-pom are said to be assisting Kim Hyon-chol. Shortly before the new Administration, Chon was tentatively chosen for Kim's senior secretary for policy affairs but was later struck from the list. Yi, on the other hand, formerly served as Blue House secretary for executive oversight, but resigned because of the controversy over the lawyer's retainer.
