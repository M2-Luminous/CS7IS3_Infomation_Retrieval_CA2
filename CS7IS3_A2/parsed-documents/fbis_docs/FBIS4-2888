Kantor was speaking after discussions of Sino-U.S. relations and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang. Gu, who is heading a delegation to GATT's ministerial meeting here, expressed the hope that the negotiation process would be sped up for China to re-enter GATT and become a founding member of the WTO. He reaffirmed China's principles in the negotiations, which are to seek a balance between rights and duties and China's status as a developing country. Kantor said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations was "beneficial not only to the two countries, but also to the whole world." He also noted that the two sides should continue consultations to solve the existing problems in the negotiations. The two sides have agreed in principle to start a new round of bilateral talks in Washington next month on China's re-entry into GATT. The ministerial meeting, which started in the Moroccan city Tuesday to sign the Uruguay round trade accords reached last December under GATT, will end Friday.
