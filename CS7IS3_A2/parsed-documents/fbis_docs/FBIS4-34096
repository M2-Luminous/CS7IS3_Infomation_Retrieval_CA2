He did not say how he would be able to do this, as most of the budget funds are allocated to expenditures contemplated in laws. "The budget funds have not been allocated, particularly as the budget has not even been approved. This is a shame. It should have been approved in December. It is a shame to see that the government has no power, not even to approve the budget," he said, changing the subject. This morning Lula recorded the program for small businessmen linked to Sebrae [Service for Support to Small and Micro Firms], which will be broadcast by TV Executive in 28 auditoriums in the state capitals. According to Lula, it is possible to create the 8 million jobs envisioned in his program by channeling to this goal resources that are currently "being thrown away." In Lula's opinion the federal government has money, and only lacks the political will to use it well. According to him, the public funds required for the jobs will be withdrawn from funds such as the FGTS [Severance Pay Fund] and those contemplated by the Constitution, such as official banks and pension funds. Lula does not believe that the government has no money for investment. "Government officials have little creativity. With a little more creativity, resourcefulness, and simplicity there would be a possibility to do more with the same money," he said, mentioning Ciacs [Integrated Centers for Assistance to Children]. "If there are no funds to do things such as Ciacs, I will build meeting places and ask the Church and the labor unions to lend their facilities for reading and writing classes." Lula discredited the Vox Populi Institute, which reported on 12 June the results of a poll indicating that support for him had decreased from 41 percent to 36 percent. "There are other institutes with more credibility. This one used to serve Collor, and met with Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party) on his campaign." Lula attacked the PSDB candidate, and said that the economic program had caused losses to the workers. He said that even after the new currency is implemented the workers will continue without purchasing power. He asserted that the PT is not negotiating any agreement with former President Jose Sarney and Senator Pedro Simon, both from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. "There is no possibility of reaching an agreement with Sarney. That was made up," he said. He added that he would like to talk to Simon, because he likes him. "But he is participating in the electoral campaign of a candidate who is disputing with ours the governorship of Rio Grande do Sul State," he said.
