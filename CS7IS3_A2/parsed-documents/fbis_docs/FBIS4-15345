The press centre described the letters as a form of psychological pressure on the Black Sea Fleet Command. Commanders of a training unit of one of the fleet bases were warned that "in the event of combat activities or hostilities" their unit will be subject to "extermination by sabotage and fire." Other letters demand that Russian servicemen leave Ukraine under threat of physical revenge. The letters correctly name the numbers of all military units and their phone numbers.
