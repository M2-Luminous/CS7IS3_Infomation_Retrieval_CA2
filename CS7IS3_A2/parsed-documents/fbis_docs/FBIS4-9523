In their open and cordial talks with Slobodan Milosevic the representatives of the Russian parliament expressed support for Serbia's peace efforts and voiced their unanimous stand that economic sanctions against the FRY should be lifted unconditionally, according to a statement released by the office of the Serbian president. These sanctions are essentially an expression of discriminatory policies, something that is at odds with the principle of equality in international relations. The economic blockade of the FRY imposed by the international community is in deep contravention of modern and democratic commitments to integration in the worldm, since it is one of the most inhumane actions taken against a people at the end of the 20th century, it was said at today's meeting between President Milosevic and the Russian parliamentarians. In the opinion of the members of the Russian parliament, Russia should help, with its principled and objective attitudes to the parties in the Yugoslav crisis, to find a just political solution, something that is totally incompatible with the continuation of the unreasonable economic blockade against the FRY. Stressing that Serbia holds in high regard Russia's balanced and impartial attitudes, as well as its peace efforts aimed at bringing an end to the civil war in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and establish a just and stable peace in these lands, President Milosevic pointed out that in this context it is of great importance to restore the impartial role of the United Nations in the peace process in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and to abandon the policy of pressures, threats, and imposed solutions on the part of the international community. During the talks it was stressed that Serbia advocates an end to all hostilities and a political solution secured through a negotiating process. FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part in today's talks between President Milosevic and the Russian parliamentarians.
