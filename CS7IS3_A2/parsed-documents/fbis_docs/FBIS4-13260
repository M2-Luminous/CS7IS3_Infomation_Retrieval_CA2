FBIS4-13260 "drnes075_j_94002" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen YSP Official Interviewed on `Stifling Crisis' YSP Official Interviewed on `Stifling Crisis' NC1704082594 London MBC Television in Arabic 1707 GMT 16 Apr 94 NC1704082594 London MBC Television Arabic BFN [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, by Tawfiq Jazulit; place and date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Jazulit] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad: We talk to you, as YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] secretary general and member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, when Yemeni unity is experiencing a stifling crisis. That is why I want this dialogue to be frank. We hope we can learn what goes on in the mind of the YSP leadership. As you know, Yemen has just seen the Salalah meeting. Some believe it failed. Why did that meeting fail? [Muhammad] Welcome to you and to MBC, which is putting Yemen's worries in front of the Yemenis and Arabs. The Yemeni issue interests not only the Yemenis, but all the Arabs and the world. This is due to what Yemen stands for and to its location in addition to the issue of unity and how to achieve it. This is a pan-Arab and national goal. Unity was peacefully, voluntarily, and democratically achieved in an approach contrary to that which was hitherto pursued and that believed that Yemeni unity could only be achieved through war. We appreciate the feelings of our Arab nation, our friends, and our people. We must be frank when it comes to presenting the issues, hardships, and challenges the process of unity is encountering. Everybody followed up the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document and the political dialogues held earlier to create it. There were domestic, Arab, and friendly efforts that helped Yemen, its parties, and its political mentality to work out that document. This document stands for the collective aspiration common to all parties and categories in Yemen today. Everyone is convinced of its stipulations, although some are opposed to it or have some reservations about it. But it represents the national program, which everybody tries to implement in his own way. That is why there were various interpretations, particularly after the document was signed in fraternal Jordan, and why difficulties were encountered during that meeting. There were efforts to arrange a meeting between the brother president and his vice president to halt the military developments that ensued, most notably on the day the document was signed. These developments have become the primary issues; they take priority over the issues specified by the document. The first issue in that document was the security problem, which has lately experienced many developments. This issue has not been tackled. Hence the Salalah meeting. I can frankly say that the phrasing was not carried out in the desired manner. There was no paper specifying the nature and agenda of the meeting. We hoped the meeting would be held to halt military developments, eliminate barriers and, thus, reverse any development leading to [word indistinct] in Yemen. [Jazulit] There are questions regarding implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document that you all signed in Amman. The opposition accuses the YSP of resorting to particular political tactics to avoid signing and implementing it. This stance is clear in one case: An agreement was reached within the framework of the national dialogue committee to attend--in your capacity as a member of the Presidential Council--a meeting of the Presidential Council in Sanaa at the same time as a Cabinet meeting in Aden chaired by Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. You agreed to attend the meeting but then you changed your mind. This seemed to be the reason for [words indistinct]. What are the real reasons for not responding to the national dialogue committee decision regarding your meeting in Sanaa? [Muhammad] It is a Yemeni characteristic that sometimes, the opposition and the authorities agree fully or differ to the point of [word indistinct]. Our party has good relations with the opposition political parties. Our party was the first to raise the idea of broadening the political dialogue. You may remember that the parties of the coalition insisted on solving their problems within the framework of the ruling coalition. Our party broached this idea to expand the dialogue and political and popular participation in this committee. The opposition joined this committee. We made a decision that any agreement reached by this committee would be binding [words indistinct]. When we attended the Amman meeting, which was attended by Jordanian brothers, notably His Majesty King Husayn, the Yemeni president and vice president, and the opposition parties, of whom I remember Shaykh [name indistinct], Shaykh Mujhid Abu-Shawarib, and the Reform Grouping secretary general [sentence incomplete as heard] At this one meeting, which failed, the YSP proposed a working paper relating to the Document of Pledge and Accord to implement it according to a timetable and mechanism. The working paper was rejected by our brothers in the General People's Congress. So we differed and afterward the paper was submitted to the national dialogue committee. This paper includes interrelated issues. At its meeting in Aden, the national dialogue committee approved every measure relating to security. The committee formulated its views and submitted its recommendations. Afterward, when the committee discussed merging the institutions, it automatically approved my attending the Presidential Council meeting. I received no agenda, although discussion of the document should be instructed by the Council of Ministers. The main issue for us was implementation of the document. We believe the security issue is the main thing and the practical approach to normalizing (?relations). If this issue is settled, then the institutions in both parts of Yemen can be merged and things will return to normal. But this has not materialized. You hear daily that security is worrisome, particularly in the capital. There is indeed a need for intensive and bold efforts to help us normalize security. First, we must hand over the personnel who disturbed security and those who stand behind them to the judiciary to issue its verdict. This issue relates to the normalization of relations. The situation in the establishment charged with security must be corrected. If not, this establishment will not help to restore security. As things stand, this establishment cannot perform its duty. We can attend any meeting and participate in any effort to address this issue. Otherwise the situation will remain the same [words indistinct] and ignore the document. [Jazulit] So as far as you are concerned, the current security situation is a barrier to realizing unity as stipulated by the Amman agreement. Some believe the situation the Yemenis are experiencing has nothing to do with unity. First, your party leadership sits in Aden. You have left Sanaa, the capital. You have not united either the Army or the currency. So you are not experiencing unity, but division, which has become a fait accompli. What is left of this unity? [Muhammad] The only thing left is popular unity. There is movement between the two parts. But I agree with you that the army is divided and that there are two currencies, two capitals, and two administrations. These are the conditions that prompted us to review the course of our unity. This is the suffering that has made us propose 18 points, participate in formulating the document effectively, and attempt to present the issues of the people. We do not know what sort of unity we are in. Some propose that we must formulate a merger unity. We believe the situation needs to be rectified and reviewed. This is why we have tried very hard to have the Pledge and Accord Document contain all the issues that lead to rectifying this course. This is a course that has not made us feel unity, except in the united anthem and flag, and sometimes in the united representation in the [word indistinct]. This is why the document must be implemented. We know time will not help us. The crisis will create harsh conditions if it continues too long, like this. [words indistinct] I personally believe that things will become even more complicated. [Jazulit] Within the framework of the negative repercussions of unity in Yemen, you, the leadership of the YSP in Aden, suspect that religious extremism will increase. Do you not believe your party is responsible for the failure of unity in Yemen, as is the GPC [General People's Congress], which was your ally in making the unity decision between the two parts, the north and the south. The failure of your party and the GPC dissatisfied the Yemeni people. It also helped to develop extremism in Yemen. How could you reconcile between the process of solving the unity problem in Yemen and confronting extremism, as you called it, while you are the ones responsible for this problem? [Muhammad] Our party is undoubtedly responsible historically, whether in working to establish unity among the Yemeni people or in the failure of this unity. Undoubtedly, our party is a partner and participant in this historic process. But the truth that has been confirmed by fact--and no one can refute it--is that the party has played its role in trying to preserve this unity. It presented a great deal. In my evaluation, there is no party in power in this day and age, according to my modest information, that pays daily, in martyrs and dead from among its cadres and leaders, while acting as an essential participant in power. It enjoys leadership in the Army and the Administration. This party can also do the same things. But the party has categorically stated that going down such a route is fatal and cannot solve problems. This is why we have tried, since unity was established, not to be dragged into this conflict. Of course, some sides may have felt the party was weak. They played some [word indistinct] cards. They thought these cards could realize greater gains for them, not only in dissolving the unity of the party, but also in weakening the relationship between the party and its supporters. So they started resorting to various methods, which I do not have the time to explain in detail here. In general, I believe that in light of the circumstances of Yemen and our limited potential, we have done everything within our means to maintain unity and allow it to succeed. We have done everything to start the course of democracy, which is the new phenomenon in our life, whether with regard to Yemen or the Arab region. Proceeding from this, I believe that dialogue with the Reform Grouping is one of the issues that concern the party. We believed that through this course and our attempts to gather all the political currents and set aside all their programs, views, and differences, we could, in light of the situation in Yemen, the unity, and the people's aspirations, create what we have called the Yemeni character, the Yemeni edition. This consists of making the left, the right, and the center start united coalition action [words indistinct]. We have tried to learn from the Algerian lesson. We have tried to learn from our mistakes. We have also tried to do something new that can be added to the unity and democracy process we have started. Unfortunately, there are some mentalities that are below such levels of thinking. They have harmed unity, democracy, and the outstretched hands. They started adopting two kinds of terrorism: physical terrorism represented in cutting off roads, killing people, and creating a state of terrorism and mental terrorism, judging people as heretics and issuing fatwas on agents, as well as resorting to the mind-set of the sixties and seventies, which consists of falsely accusing others if they do not agree with their opinion. Thus, we bear our responsibility toward rectifying the situation and toward the mistakes and emotions affecting us in realizing unity quickly and without any settling of accounts. We went to Sanaa with one thing in mind--that the others are of a particular standard. But time has proven that this standard, unfortunately, is not there. [Jazulit] A trend within your party says that YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid unilaterally decided to go ahead with the unification process. This same trend is now opposing the continuation of unity saying that the circumstances are still not right. How influential is this trend within the YSP? [Muhammad] We are a real party, one that interacts with its members and leaders. Any decision is made through the party's institutions ... [Jazulit, interrupting] Is it true that al-Bid made the unity decision unilaterally? [Muhammad] It was not a unilateral decision. As you know, unity was one of the party's concerns and strategic issues when it was in power in the south. The same applied to the other part in the north [words indistinct]. Our leadership was united. For us, unity will remain a fateful issue. But what kind of unity do we want? The YSP formed a team that continued to study the issue for one year. The team made recommendations and proposals regarding unity. It offered several options, including a federation and a confederation. But developments and circumstances dictated that policy, namely, that we sign the 30 November agreement and adopt the existing Constitution, which we are still adopting. The YSP secretary general made no unilateral decision, as some people are claiming; the decision was made through consultations with the leadership--the Political Bureau [words indistinct], and the Central Committee. I remember that day when brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih came to Aden and was received by brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The Central Committee of our party was in session and we were discussing that particular subject. We in the YSP make no unilateral decisions; we always refer to the party's institutions when we make fateful and important decisions. [Jazulit] You did not answer the essence of my question, brother Salim Salih Muhammad. There is undoubtedly a trend within your party saying that unity cannot continue because the circumstances are not ripe. How strong is this trend on the level of the leadership, the cadres, and the members of the party? [Muhammad] I am not exaggerating if I say that our situation has never been better as far as trends, wings, and blocs are concerned. We are now in agreement on national issues more than ever. We have no trends against these issues, among the leaders, or the base. But opinions are expressed by this person or that or this group of brothers or that. Now we are expanding democracy in the life of the party and society. We are dealing with things through dialogue and we make decisions through dialogue. What is happening now is that some people are proposing rectifying unity's course. They express their views and we discuss them within the framework of the party's institutions. These days, we are discussing a host of issues in the Central Committee. We are trying to find the right thing and convince each other about the best formula the party should offer and deal with [words indistinct]. We must not restrict ourselves or reject opposing views regarding these issues because we do not want to repeat past mistakes. We, therefore, accommodate this [word indistinct] and do not have trends in the old sense of the word, that is, that a particular trend has a particular opinion and will triumph and the other trend will lose. All the trends must coexist within dialogue to formulate the right position for the party. [Jazulit] Arab mediation has been expanding. What is the essence of this mediation? [Muhammad] From the beginning, we have welcomed every initiative by our Arab brothers. We deal with this mediation. At first, the Jordanian and Omani brothers helped, whether through the military committee or the political dialogue. The initiatives produced the known results. I would like to thank the Omani and Jordanian brothers and also the friends, whether [words indistinct] for their role in defusing tension and calming the military situation. But the crisis was oversimplified, and this is perhaps what foiled the meetings and efforts. We insist on an intensive Arab role. We do not feel shy about saying that the brothers in Saudi Arabia are concerned with Yemen's developments, and we ask for their help. The brothers in Oman, the Gulf states, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and all Arab countries are also concerned. Yemen is part of the region, and what happens here concerns the Arab brothers. Arab efforts should be effectively redoubled, first, to prevent a civil war that would have dire consequences for the Yemeni people and unity [word indistinct], and second, to help normalize the situation. The security issue is integrated: Yemen is facing an organized international terrorism practiced by the international fundamentalist movement, which has its centers and sources of finance. So what happens in Yemen does not concern Yemen alone. [Words indistinct] Yemen began to export some trouble to fraternal and friendly countries. [Jazulit] In view of the unity crisis and its complications, some alternatives have been proposed. I remember that when the crisis started you proposed the alternative of federalism. This option was strongly opposed by the GPC and the Islamic Reform Grouping. Now you are again proposing federalism. Where does federalism stand now as an alternative to the Yemeni crisis? [Muhammad] This idea should have been discussed. When we proposed this idea, before the document was signed, it was supposed to be an alternative that could have been discussed. When I was asked about it, I said that we are ready and willing to discuss any alternative that could rectify the course of the country and the situation in it, including the issue of federalism. Of course, the thinking prevalent among the older generations is fixed in many ways. If there is a warning or statement that does not agree with the accepted concepts imprinted in the Arab political mind, they will automatically reject it and categorize it into different things. Therefore, this idea was buried right from the start. We know that the document [word indistinct] addressed some 70-80 percent of this issue in my estimation ... [Jazulit, interrupting] What do you mean? How come? [Muhammad] The document addresses the issue of provinces for local government. In Yemen, we could have anywhere between four and seven provinces. They have full powers, except for judicial authority and nominating portfolios for the Cabinet. The federal situation or the known unity conditions--I do not want to delve into detailed explanations; I will neglect its legal aspects and the characteristics that could [words indistinct]--led us to understand that there will be local governments. There is also a general framework for maintaining the sovereignty of the homeland, Yemeni patriotism, the united economy, and legislation. There are all these issues. We are really trying to strengthen this unity as we explained at the beginning of the interview and to clarify its various aspects. It is truly regrettable. The document was set out and now, as a party, we are proposing that the real introduction to realizing this goal is possibly local government and [words indistinct]. As I said, the inherent contents of this document are the federal unity that we proposed. [Jazulit] Let us go back to the beginning of the crisis. The Amman summit failed. Then the Salalah meeting failed. There are preparations now for a summit that might convene in Cairo during the coming few weeks. Has a date been set for this meeting or for such a summit? [Muhammad] There is no invitation to such a meeting or summit. But there are calm and important preparations to avoid making the same mistake as previous preparation, such as in Amman and [word indistinct]. [Jazulit] Is there a bilateral agreement between the YSP and the GPC over points on which to agree before going to Cairo so that you do not fall into the same trap you fell into in Amman, for example? [Muhammad] We feel that the Egyptian and the United Arab Emirates [UAE] roles, as well as the Arab role, despite [words indistinct] political presence, and even though some Arab countries rule out implementation of any decisions--the Arab role has clearly tried to politically support the Egyptian and UAE roles--have been trying from the beginning to diagnose the issues. At the same time, they work on proposing solutions and preparing for a meeting that will really be a success. We believe this is good work. [Jazulit] You continue to ask the Arab countries in general to work on salvaging what can be salvaged from Yemeni unity. This is something you have confirmed often. What are the concessions that the YSP could make to guarantee the continuation of unity and its success? We mean building the structures of unity. You must make some concessions if you really want unity. What are the concessions that you might make if you go to Cairo for a meeting? [Muhammad] Our party has made every possible concession, especially big concessions. It abandoned power; it went to Sanaa. [Jazulit] But you are still in power. [Muhammad] What power are you talking about ... [Jazulit] You, in Aden, are still in power, as is the president in Sanaa. [Muhammad] You know the situation we are in. All those inside and outside Yemen know our situation. Our party, as I said, might have worked and sacrificed for the big aim or it might have committed a naive political act. But all this is not very important. We are very ready to make concessions and to have a new government for example. We are ready to work to rectify issues. We are ready to concede our right as individuals or a party but we cannot make concessions over issues that define the fate of unity and the future of the generations. This is a matter over which we can make no concessions. If we made any concessions over it, we would be abandoning our credibility toward our people, our friends, and everyone. [Jazulit] Do you believe that the awaited Cairo summit could yield some positive results if you make use of the negative aspects of the Amman and Salalah summits? [Muhammad] There are efforts we appreciate a great deal. We address them and interact with them, not just on our level. We also try to exchange trust with other parties so as to render these Arab efforts a success. I believe the Egyptian and other brothers now have a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the crisis. They could help Yemen overcome the stage of fighting as a first step. After that, we need to work jointly with everyone and all the parties to bury such thinking. Second, we can start rectifying the course of unity, which would calm the various parties. [Jazulit] We thank you for this meeting.
