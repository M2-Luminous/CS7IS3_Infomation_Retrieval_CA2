FR940304-1-00063 FR940304-1-00013 The State's Board of Fisheries (Board) formulates regulations to manage the crab fisheries under procedures specified in the State's Administrative Procedure Act. On February 8, 1993, the Board established Norton Sound in the BSAI as a superexclusive registration area for purposes of managing the Norton Sound red king crab fishery. The operator of any vessel registered in a superexclusive area would not be able to register the vessel in any other area during that registration year. This management measure was proposed to address the unique collection of problems that make fishery management difficult in Norton Sound. The problems are associated with conservation and management of a fishery with a small biomass, small guideline harvest level (GHL), and a stock on the edge of its geographic range, which makes it biologically sensitive. The problems include overcapitalization, short seasons, high management costs, and both over-harvest and under-harvest of GHLs. Historically, the fishery has been characterized by years with low levels of participation and fairly high catch rates followed by years with high levels of participation and low catch rates. A combination of factors has led to high participation, which is expected to continue into the future. These factors are primarily the overcapitalized crab fleet and participants' efforts to establish catch histories in the event individual fishing quotas (IFQs) are instituted. Superexclusive registration would be expected to create a management environment discouraging participation by large crab vessels and catcher/processors. Probable results are a slower-paced fishery, fuller attainment of GHLs, a longer season, and reduced administrative and enforcement costs. The Alaska Crab Coalition (ACC) appealed the State's designation of Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. Following Secretarial review of the State's action, the Secretary issued an interim final rule that superseded State regulations establishing Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area in the EEZ of the BSAI (58 FR 38727, July 20, 1993). This action was necessary because the Secretary had determined that designation of superexclusive registration areas was inconsistent with provisions of the FMP. The FMP contains three categories of management measures: (1) Specific Federal management measures that require an FMP amendment to change; (2) framework type management measures, with criteria set out in the FMP that the State must follow when implementing changes in State regulations; and (3) measures that are neither rigidly specified nor frameworked in the FMP, and which may be freely adopted or modified by the State, subject to an appeals process or other Federal laws. Registration areas are listed as a Category 2 measure. Section 8.2.8 of the FMP specifies that king crab registration areas may be designated as either exclusive or nonexclusive. Designation of a registration area as superexclusive would require an FMP amendment and incorporation into the FMP as a Category 1 management measure. In July 1993, the Council requested proposals for possible amendments to the FMP. On August 13, 1993, the Board submitted a proposal to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. This proposal was reviewed by the crab FMP plan team, which ranked it as a high priority and recommended it to the Council for consideration. At its September 1993 meetings, the Council recommended analysis of the Board's proposal. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and NMFS prepared a draft analysis for the proposed FMP amendment to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) during the Council's December 1993 meetings and adopted for public review. At its January 1994 meetings, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives and the general public on the proposed action to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. The Council adopted the proposed action under Amendment 2 to the FMP and requested NMFS to remove existing regulations at 50 CFR 671.20, which supersede existing State regulations designating Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. Classification NMFS prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have significant effects on small entities. Overall, superexclusive registration area designation likely will result in a transfer of participation and income from a predominantly large-vessel fleet to a predominantly small-vessel fleet. Twenty-six vessels registered and fished in Norton Sound in 1992, and Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 0.7 percent to any of these vessels' crab landings for the year. Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 1.6 percent of the total for any of the catcher/processors in 1990. Neither operators of individual vessels nor participants in the pre-1993 fleet were dependent on this fishery in terms of year-to-year participation or landings within any one year.
