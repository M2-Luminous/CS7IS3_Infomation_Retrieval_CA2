O Ik-chae, supreme leader of South Korean Chondogyo, proposed in his message that they hold a working-level contact in the Truce Village of Panmunjom in March to discuss ways to jointly push ahead with a project celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Tonghak Revolution. The message to Yu Mi-yong, chairman of the central guidance committee of North Korean Chondogyo, was in reply to a North Korean proposal on Jan. 24 that they hold a working-level contact in Panmunjom on Feb. 3 to discuss the joint commemoration. O said, "in the current situation, a visit by your people to Seoul is not appropriate. I firmly believe that every problem will be solved by early March and that we must make efforts to solve the problems by then." Chondogyo is a religion founded in Korea by Choe Che-u in 1859. It is the religion of the heavenly way (Chondo), but its name was later changed to Tonghak (eastern learning). In an era of political chaos in the late 19th century, the followers of Tonghak rejected the influence of Japan, Russia, China and other foreign powers and rebelled against the king and the government. However, they failed to take power.
