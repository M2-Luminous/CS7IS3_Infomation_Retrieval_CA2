On the one hand it unties B.N.Y.'s hands, permitting the establishment of a regime of personal power, on the other, it also contains the possibility of a split in the executive in the center along "president-government" lines. In addition, the artificial removal from the draft of many regional pillars of constitutional order in Russia (the clause on the sovereignty of the republics, the Federal Treaty, and others) is fraught with new representations from the regions. The stories of the "success of fascism in Russia" circulating among the radical democrats do not withstand even the first contact with reality. Presidential authority itself excommunicated from the election campaign the most active nationalist groupings (the Russian National Union, the Constitutional Democratic Party, the NRP [National Republican Party]). The authorities gave the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] with their own hands the former's potential electorate (6-8 percent of the vote, according to a number of estimates). The rapid growth of the LDPR pertained to the last two weeks before the elections. It is hard not to notice the sharp contrast between the soothing tone of the political statement of B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, of 13 December and the hysterical response of the radical democrats regarding the "fascist breakthrough in Russia." These facts compel us to treat attentively the rumors circulating in the most varied political circles concerning the preventive funding of the LDPR's election campaign by certain structures of the executive. In the initial election scenario "Zhirinovskiy's party" was, by all accounts, assigned the role of "pump" designed to "draw off" from one-third to one-half of the electorate of the Communists. And the idea of using the Federal Assembly as a "stabilization" trump card in the presidential game would seem tactically justified. V. Zhirinovskiy, loudly stating his pro-presidential sympathies, is together with S. Filatov already being seen as a candidate for the position of speaker of the State Duma in the semi-secret political consultations that have begun. The success of the LDPR strikes through, virtually, the parliamentary scenario of the radical democrats counting if only with a minimal preponderance in the ballot on "filtering" the government and subordinating to themselves the power structures and, consequently, the president also. The series of dismissals of high-ranking officials in the last two weeks had underlying motives, first, the need to identify and punish the "fall guys" and those "to blame" for the surge of Zhirinovskiy and the Communists, second, an attempt by the radicals prior to the opening of the Federal Assembly session to realize if only some of their "personnel preparations" (hitting at the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and so forth). It was the regional elites who achieved the election of the majority of their candidates to the Federation Council. At least three scenarios of the behavior of the Federation Council, depending on the breakdown of forces in the lower house of parliament, are likely. Scenario 1. The majority that takes shape in the Federation Council backs the factions and personalities that are dominant in the State Duma. This is possible given the rapid "domestication" of V. Zhirinovskiy and the prolongation of the question of the government, if this is followed by the consent of the "agro-communist" faction. Scenario 2. The majority that takes shape in the Federation Council begins to orient itself unequivocally toward President B. Yeltsin. Scenario 3. The Federation Council prefers to distance itself from the State Duma and from the president, assuming the role of a kind of counterpart of the former Federation Council. In all three cases the role of the Federation Council will be far more significant than that imputed to it by the new Constitution. In all likelihood, this will be manifested in the first weeks of work of the Federal Assembly. The power structures do not have direct representation in the Federal Assembly. V. Zhirinovskiy, meanwhile, not a military leader and having no chance of becoming such, of course, is articulating a kind of ideology of militant "liberal patriotism" connected with the rapid growth of influence of the power structures 3-5 October and in the weeks since October. Within the framework of programmed reductions approximately 500,000 servicemen will be discharged from the army in the next two years. Considering that even now hundreds of thousands of families of military persons "expelled" from East Europe, the Baltic, the Transcaucasus, and Central Asia are without housing, it would be natural to expect that interest in V. Zhirinovskiy, who is promising the military the distribution of land entails and full social protection, will be manifested primarily among the middle and junior officers, the majority of whom voted for the LDPR. The generals, on the other hand, are in sympathy with Zhirinovskiy's statements concerning an increase in the army's role in the country's foreign and domestic policy. Nor do experts rule out V. Zhirinovskiy's support for the political claims of the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs connected with a tightening of the machinery of repression and a broadening of the rights of the operational search and investigation subdivisions justified by the fight against crime. Up to the fall of 1993 B.N.Y. played a Bonapartist game on the contradictions between the republics within the Russian Federation, the sparsely populated resource-extracting oblasts, and the traditional Russian agro-industrial regions. Then, when the contours of large-scale geopolitical alliances oriented to a considerable extent against the Kremlin (the Urals Republic, the Greater Volga and Siberian Agreement associations) emerged, the pendulum of the president's regional policy swung in the directly opposite direction, which was expressed in the draft constitution and, as a retaliatory response, in a surreptitious increase in separatism. The appearance at the political forefront of the figure of V. Zhirinovskiy, the "total unitarist" and "ethnocratic imperialist" provocatively manipulated by the presidential grouping, corresponds splendidly to the idea of Russian disintegration: the response of the regional leaders, who have come round from the October coma, will be unequivocally separatist and anti-Kremlin. Experts of various persuasions see in the future the possibility of a quite rapid collapse of the traditional Russian ethno-state nucleus into puppet "principalities." It does not need to be said that V. Zhirinovskiy is incapable of showing himself to be a great-power leader like figures of the National Salvation Front or the Russian National Assembly.
