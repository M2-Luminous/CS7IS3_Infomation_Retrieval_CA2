In an address to the National Assembly, which is holding a special session today to decide what measures will be adopted, Fidel said: "I do not think it would be worthwhile to do nothing, to stop halfway, because it would be a disaster if the measures we adopt are insufficient." "We are far from having a full idea of the problem; not even the comrades with a better education have it, although we have certainly made progress," the Cuban leader added. Castro referred to the series of proposals presented this morning by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who outlined the need to create a tax system, reduce some subsidies and benefits, increase prices for nonessential products, and create a convertible currency, among other things. Castro added: "Everyone is prepared to find solutions, but no one wants to pay taxes on their salary or to have even a cent cut from their salary. Everyone wants a solution but they want solutions without having to take these types of measures." Castro termed the country's current economic situation as a "cancer" characterized by over 11 billion pesos in circulating money, which has virtually nullified the purchasing power of the national currency, and a 1993 public deficit of 4.2 billion pesos. "A human policy of solidarity with the people that neglects no one involves a surplus of circulating money -- which is tolerable for some time -- but, within the special period, the time has come to solve the problem, and that is not so easy," Fidel Castro said. He insisted that it is necessary to carefully decide what must be done so the situation does not reoccur. He said that it is necessary to "get to the root of the problem," otherwise "it would be a tremendous waste of time." "We must create real solutions," the Cuban leader said after concluding that there "is no other choice but to take measures that are part of the special period, a special period that is much worse than we ever imagined."
