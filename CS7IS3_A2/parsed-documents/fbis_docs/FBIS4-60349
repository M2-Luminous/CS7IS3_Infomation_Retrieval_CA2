FBIS4-60349 "drnes100_s_94006" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Iran Editors Refuse To Meet U.S. Counterparts Editors Refuse To Meet U.S. Counterparts Visit Motives Questioned NC2105111194 Tehran JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI in Persian 14 May 94 p 2 NC2105111194 Tehran JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI Persian BFN [Text] News section--The director general for foreign press and mass media at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance wrote to invite the chief editors of the country's newspapers to participate in a meeting on Saturday afternoon, 14 May (today) with American chief editors affiliated with the Association of American Chief Editors. The invitation makes no mention of the topics to be discussed and gives no explanation on the objective of this meeting. It is still not clear who invited the American editors to Iran or why the foreign press and mass media director general at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has extended this invitation to the American journalists. Over the past years, America has made extensive and futile efforts to find a way to open the door to dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Apparently a dialogue between the American and Iranian chief editors is a new ploy by the Americans to achieve their goal. During the past 15 years, American publications have disseminated the most poisonous propaganda against the Islamic revolution, Imam Khomeyni, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Journalism is one of the masks that the Americans use to send their spies to other countries, and the American journalists who have visited the Islamic Republic of Iran have always disseminated false and biased reports about Iran. With its clear assessment of such dialogues, JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI refuses to attend this meeting. There is still no precise information on whether the chief editors of other newspapers will or will not attend this dialogue.
