Addressing a darbar [meeting] of the Punjab Regiment in Mardan today, the prime minister said we do not cherish aggressive designs against anyone. However, we cannot remain oblivious to our defense which will be strengthened within our limited resources. Our neighbors must not dream to establish hegemony because we can neither be provoked nor submit, she said, adding the people of Jammu and Kashmir must be given the right of self-determination and the Kashmir issue should be solved in a manner that it leads to laying a solid foundation for peace in the region. A neighboring country is dreaming to bring us under its hegemony, she said, adding we will not be cowed down by anybody. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the government is making every endeavor for the welfare of the people. The task is stupendous and the problems are many, which need cooperation from every segment of society.
