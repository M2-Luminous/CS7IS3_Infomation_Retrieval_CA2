Talks between the ANC and the AVF have broken down over the establishment of an Afrikaner volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. Leader of the AVF, General Constand Viljoen: [Begin recording] [Viljoen] It is a disappointment. There is some inconsistency in the whole development. We had, on Saturday morning, rather very positive discussions with the negotiating team and then all of a sudden, Saturday afternoon Mr. Mandela took a very strong viewpoint and he repeated it Sunday evening and to us it is now very clear that Mr. Mandela has decided completely otherwise [as heard]. As I say this is rather, you know ... [changes thought] It is not in line with the discussions and the spirit of the discussions which we had up to now, so it is a great disappointment, yet the two leaders met yesterday afternoon and they have sorted it out and it appeared as if Mr. Mandela has decided that there will be absolutely no position on a volkstaat -- then I agree with Dr. Hartzenberg. Then there is no sense in carrying on with the negotiations at the moment. [Pienaar] Have you had any feedback from the negotiators on the ANC's side and from your negotiating team so far? [Viljoen] Of course, we met here with our own negotiating team. We have discussed the situation, not with the complete team but we have consulted with the individual members up to now. I haven't called them together. The ANC today will probably meet their negotiating team and we will probably hear from them in due course -- what their viewpoint is, but from the negotiating teams there is not much we can do because it was decided at leadership level there will be no negotiations and I can see no alternative, because what is the sense of carrying on with negotiations. Are we just wasting our time? This is the pity, you know, even Mr. Mandela's present action is inconsistent with his previous ones, because previously he has said to us -- don't shout at us, give us a map. Now this is the time when we were really moving towards what he demanded and then all of a sudden he called it off just like that. So to us this is not quite understandable. [Pienaar] How do you see the road ahead? Is there still a light at the end of the tunnel? Do you still see the possibility of an agreement being reached before the deadline? [Viljoen] This is a very serious situation that we have arrived at, at the moment, because humanly speaking we have come to the end of the road of negotiations. Now, what have we achieved? I think from the Volksfront's point of view what we can say is we have achieved at least the higher moral ground -- to say that ... [changes thought] or the moral high ground to say we have done everything that we possibly could. We have really gone all the way. We have done this with enthusiasm and we haven't spared a moment. We even worked between Christmas and New Year to facilitate this so that is what we have achieved. Now the road ahead of us: I would say we have to decide now what else to do because there is no doubt about the fact that the Afrikaner wants a volkstaat and that we are going to have a volkstaat. I have been very firm on this right from the beginning and we were prepared to negotiate the details of the volkstaat, but we were never prepared to negotiate anything but a volkstaat and this is for a security arrangement -- for a peace arrangement for the future of South Africa. I think it is in the interest of the whole country, and what is even more important is the fact that this is a possible peace settlement or a complete change of attitude between two major forces of South Africa -- the Afrikaners and the Africans, as represented by the ANC. It is rather a disappointment because we both ... [changes thought] both negotiating teams always acknowledged this fact of how important this is. [end recording]
