The same question was raised time and again: To what extent should the North Atlantic defense alliance, whose meaning and purpose must be redefined as a result of the changed world political situation, open up to the Central and East European states without offending Russia? The confusion of voices culminated in reports on a quarrel between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, which were quickly denied, however. Differences of opinion between Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe were also detected in the statements they issued. If one analyzes the flood of declarations and listens carefully to the voices in the political camps, one discovers more agreement than one would at a superficial glance. Bonn advocates the integration of the Central and East European states into a new security architecture whose core should be NATO. The problems that might arise for Russia from a sudden NATO expansion to its borders are apparent, however. On the other hand, Bonn wants security agreements with Moscow. Russia's membership seems ideal, but is not feasible because of the domestic political problems in the eastern part of the huge empire. Moreover, no president -- no matter what his name is -- would be able to implement that. Basically, the differences of opinion in Bonn concern the right steps and the appropriate way as to how to shape the complicated security-political relations between the old NATO countries and the former members of the Warsaw Pact, some of whom are urgently pressing for NATO protection. Bonn's defense politicians have adopted a pragmatic approach. They claim the larger NATO is, the smaller is the danger that Russia might seek military adventures in the old Soviet sphere of influence. Bonn's foreign policy experts, however, recommend cautious steps toward a rapprochement with the Central and East European states, in order to prevent sudden conflicts. Bonn's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who has been advocating long-term thinking on this issue for some time, naturally plays a major role here. Shortly before the beginning of the NATO summit, he spoke of a very difficult dilemma that NATO, and in particular Germany, will have to solve. A "double message" must be conveyed to the Central and East European countries: Basically, NATO wants to be open for new members. On the other hand, however, this is a lengthy process, and it will not be possible for them to join the Alliance as fast as some would like. There is no order and no timetable for new members. The only thing Kinkel wants to promise for the time being is consultations at the political level. Germany's special position is characterized by the fact that the Central and East European states view Germany as the advocate of their interests in the expansion of cooperation. Besides Kinkel, Chancellor Kohl also made it clear that Bonn must link two goals: The justified security needs of the Eastern neighboring countries must be taken seriously, but at the same time security relations must be developed with Russia. Kinkel is right: This will be a difficult balancing act.
