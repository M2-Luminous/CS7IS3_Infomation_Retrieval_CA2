[EL WATAN] The IMF agreement will inevitably have a very heavy social cost. What does the government plan to do to soften the immediate effects on the most disadvantaged classes? Are you going to ask the citizens for additional sacrifices? Will they be willing to accept them in today's economic situation? [Malek] If there are sacrifices, they will have to be shared by all of society, and we will see to it that they are. Both our social cohesion and the effectiveness of our reforms are at stake. We know that the social safety net has been in place since February 1992, but we can see how relatively ineffective it is at the moment by the fact that it affects over 7.5 million people without satisfactorily targeting those who need the most support. We must show imagination in order to give it a more consistent content. That should be reflected in the creation of jobs and housing assistance for the most disadvantaged. Incidentally, the increased availability of scarce resources will be of overall benefit to the resumption of certain activities, among them construction and public works, and help bring down unemployment. Along those same lines, the government has plans for a coherent system of social protection comprising retirement, early retirement, unemployment benefits, and social security. Those measures will be implemented in cooperation with our social partners. [EL WATAN] During his last visit to Algiers, the director general of the IMF mentioned the possibility of a standby agreement for this year. What is the nature of that agreement, what will be its amount, and what socioeconomic effects will it have? [Malek] A standby agreement, also known as a confirmation agreement, runs for one year and is concerned basically with the external and internal financial equilibriums. It deals with matters having to do with the price of goods and services, the exchange rate, the interest rate, credit conditions, the budget, trade, and the foreign debt. Such an agreement precedes the three-year "enlarged facility" agreement that is concerned with structural adjustment--that is, the development of small- and medium-size businesses and the private sector, the rehabilitation of state-owned enterprises, development of the banking sector, the efficiency of the social protection system, and all the measures that strengthen the national economy's competitiveness with respect to other countries. The enlarged facility being granted by the IMF is accompanied by programs that must be carried out with the World Bank. [EL WATAN] The IMF director general questioned your government on the issue of the government program. That insistent concern is not felt only by Camdessus; it is also felt by the social partners who are waiting for your program. Why the delay? [Malek] Let us understand each other. There is the government program that has an overall character--political, economic, social, and cultural--and on which we are currently working. It necessarily takes time. And then there is the "program" that Camdessus is talking about and which, in IMF language, has specific meaning. It refers to a set of proposals relative to the exchange rate, the interest rate, monetary policy, foreign trade, the budget deficit, prices, and so on. Those are the matters to be covered by the above-mentioned standby agreement. It is those proposals--that "program"--that the director general of the IMF wants to see adopted by Algeria as the expression of a free choice arising from its desire for reform, not as something forced on it from outside. [EL WATAN] There has been talk of a cabinet reshuffle. Certain cabinet posts remain to be filled. Is the matter being considered? [Malek] We are working on it. You may think that we are not moving very fast. But there is a time for everything. The main thing is to move forward. [EL WATAN] Does this mean that the government will remain as it is after the CNT [National Council for Transition] is installed? Is yours a long-term government? [Malek] Government instability carries a high cost; everyone agrees on that. But that does not prevent some people from continuing to speculate on the subject. It is as though instability would serve their purpose. Any pretext that will encourage a wait-and-see attitude is acceptable to them. We must get rid of that suicidal way of thinking. And this at a time when we are faced with serious security problems and when we are having to confront economic and social problems which, for their part, will not wait. [EL WATAN] Exactly what is the state doing to face up to the situation of violence? Your statement that not everything has been done to combat terrorism is perplexing. Can it be said today that those steps are being taken? [Malek] I merely meant that the state has great capabilities for making itself respected and that those multifaceted capabilities must be used more rationally and with more determination. To hear certain experts in disinformation tell it, you would think the state was at the end of its rope and near collapse. People who think that way are simply confusing their desires with reality. The Algerian state, the historic achievement of an age-old struggle, is unshakable. It will emerge from the storm the winner. It is true that we are experiencing a tragedy. But the terrorist crimes being perpetrated daily condemn themselves by their absurdity--the horrible nature of their barbarity. No cause and no excuse can justify them. The population as a whole rejects them. This is something that should be pondered by all those who, at one time or another, have thought they could make religious feeling a convenient tool for their ambitions. But the thing that is perplexing is the strange silence of a certain element of the opposition regarding terrorism. Can a political official worthy of the name, whether in power or not, reasonably keep silent and maintain a wait-and-see attitude in the face of a phenomenon that is a terrible disservice to the country, tarnishes its reputation, and humiliates Algeria as a nation? [EL WATAN] The agreement between the government and the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] has been denounced in part by the union, according to recent statements by Benhamouda regarding the government's failure to live up to its commitments with respect to the amount of the financial package intended to pay for the wage increases. Is the agreement being broken? [Malek] Not at all. We reached an agreement, and we are sticking to it. So it will be implemented. The wage increases will be paid, as stipulated, beginning on 1 April, and will be retroactive to 1 January 1994. [EL WATAN] The success of dialogue also depends on the adoption of pacification measures. The HCE [Higher State Council] announced that new pacification measures would be adopted as dialogue continued. Is that still on the agenda? [Malek] Let us give the new presidential body time to settle in. President Liamine Zeroual will find ways and means for resuming effective dialogue. [EL WATAN] What is your position on the rehabilitation of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] under its current name or another name and on dialogue between the government and the FIS? [Malek] That party has been dissolved. There can be no prospect of going back to square one. We simply say that chances for dialogue exist with all sincere patriots who distance themselves from terrorism and recognize that it leads nowhere, stick to constitutional order, and agree to work within the law. [EL WATAN] On that subject, what is your comment on the attitude of the political parties? [Malek] The parties need to be a little more constructive. They should take advantage of the transitional period to contribute to national unity, democracy, and a solution to the crisis. [EL WATAN] Some people are predicting civil war for Algeria. [Malek] Despite the terrorist crimes, the population is maintaining its attachment to peace and public order. In those conditions, how can one talk of civil war? The people talking about it are the one who want it. But once again, they are wrong. [EL WATAN] Some states are openly displaying hostility to Algeria. [Malek] Algeria harbors no animosity toward anyone. What is certain is that it does not allow any interference in its internal affairs and will be able to respond to such interference with appropriate means, as it has done up to this point. In that connection, it should be pointed out that despite the difficulties it is experiencing, Algeria remains attached to its national sovereignty and rejects all forms of pressure, regardless of their origin. I would like to take this opportunity to deplore the development of systematic disinformation on the part of certain foreign media with respect to Algeria. It plays into the hands of subversion and certainly does not help to shed light on what is really at stake in the current situation.
