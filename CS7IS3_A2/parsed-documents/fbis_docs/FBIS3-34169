This enhanced the image of Pakistan in the international community. She was addressing a news conference in Islamabad this afternoon on her return after a week-long visit abroad. [passage omitted] The prime minister said she raised the Kashmir issue at the Human Rights Commission as she had promised to the people of Pakistan and Kashmir. It is Pakistan's basic policy to repeatedly shake the world conscience about the Indian repression in Kashmir. She told the world assembly that India's allegations about Pakistan's interference in occupied Kashmir are totally baseless and wrong because about 700 Indian soldiers are deployed at every one km distance along the line of control. India has, thus, raised an iron wall on the border. When asked about threats coming from across the border, the prime minister said we are not afraid of them as Pakistan is capable of defending itself. She pointed out that these threats show that the Indian case on Kashmir is weak and it does not wants a political solution. She said the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is an international dispute and both India and Pakistan are committed to a plebiscite there. To a question, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said while agreeing to talks with India, Pakistan sent a clear signal to India that Pakistan believes in talks and there is a government in Pakistan which can settle the Kashmir issue, but these talks will be successful only if the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir is improved. The prime minister said India failed to respond positively to repeated Pakistani proposals for ending atrocities in Kashmir. That is why we had to go to international forums. She said she told the Indian foreign secretary during his visit to Pakistan that India should take visible steps in the valley, including the release of Kashmiri leaders, reduction of the Indian forces, and stopping the killings. The prime minister said Pakistan even now is ready for talks with India on the Kashmir issue, but first India should end repression in Kashmir. [passage omitted]
