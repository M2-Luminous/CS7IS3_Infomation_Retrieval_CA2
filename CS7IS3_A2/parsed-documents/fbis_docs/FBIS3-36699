The Russian delegation is headed by Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador at large of the Russian Federation, and the Ukrainian delegation is headed by Valeriy Shmarov, vice-premier for issues of the military-industrial complex and conversion. "This is the latest phase of talks to develop the trilateral statement. Another such meeting would come in useful," Valeriy Shmarov informed a UNIAN correspondent in an exclusive interview. "Several more statements have been prepared, and there is no doubt on the Ukrainian side that they will be signed. All issues will be resolved in strict compliance with the START I Treaty. There is already a draft program for implementing Ukrainian pledges: the share, quota, proportion, and procedure for recycling and taking silos out of a combat state--all this has been elaborated and is to be discussed." The meeting is scheduled to end 9 February.
