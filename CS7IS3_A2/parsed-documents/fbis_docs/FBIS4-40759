Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin announced today at a meeting of the public chamber under the president of the Russian Federation. According to Shokin, the purpose of the decree is to promote the working out of a new military doctrine and to reduce the state order to the defence industry. It is worth recalling that during his recent tour of the country Yeltsin mentioned the forthcoming reduction of the army from three million to 1.5 million and urged enterprises of the defence complex to take up conversion. "The Russian Army does not need a large amount of armaments. It needs mobile military hardware, which can stand competition at the domestic and foreign markets," the president said. His stand has been reflected in the forthcoming decree.
