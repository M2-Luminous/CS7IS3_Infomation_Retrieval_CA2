Menu item means, under Nutrient Standard Menu Planning or Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning, any single food or combination of foods. All menu items or foods offered as part of the reimbursable meal may be considered as contributing towards meeting the nutrition standards provided in §210.10(a), except for those foods that are considered as foods of minimal nutritional value as provided for in §210.11(a)(2) which are not offered as part of a menu item in a reimbursable meal. For the purposes of a reimbursable lunch, a minimum of three menu items must be offered, one of which must be an entree (a combination of foods or a single food item that is offered as the main course) and one must be fluid milk. For the purposes of a reimbursable lunch, one of the selected menu items must be an entree. Under the offer versus serve option, three menu items must be offered and an entree and one other menu item must be selected. * * * * * Nutrient Standard Menu Planning/Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning means a way to develop meals which is based on the analysis of nutrients which would require school lunches, when averaged over a school week, to meet specific levels for a set of key nutrients and calories rather than a specific set of food categories. Analysis of the menu items and foods shall be based on averages that will be weighted by production quantities as offered to the students. Such analysis is normally done by a school or a school food authority. However, for the purposes of Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning, menu planning and analysis are completed by other entities and shall incorporate the production quantities needed to accommodate the specific service requirements of a particular school or school food authority. * * * * * School week means the period of time used as the basis for determining nutrient levels of the menu and for conducting Nutrient Standard Menu Planning or Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning for lunches. The period shall be a minimum of three days and a maximum of seven days. Weeks in which school lunches are offered less than three times shall be combined with either the previous or the coming week. * * * * * §210.4 [Amended] 3.
