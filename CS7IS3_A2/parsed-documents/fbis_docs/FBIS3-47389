Those workers who have returned and are now applying for reentry visas are having problems. Libya has refused to issue visas to workers whose contracts have expired. New job seekers are also encountering many problems. They have to wait for a long time to get a visa to work there. Job placement companies have been waiting, but have not received an answer. This has disrupted the businesses of brokers who send Thai workers to work in Libya. The delay in issuing visas comes despite the fact that Thai workers are skilled and the companies that hired them want them to return and complete the projects they were hired for. Thamrongsak Saengthong, owner of (Fa-ez) Thailand Company, admits that he can do nothing to help the workers because it is up to the Thai Government and the Foreign Ministry to solve the problem. He is waiting for the outcome of how the government will handle the problem. Job placement companies are confused on the issue of Libya. They hope Phaithun Kaeothong, the new labor minister, will be able to solve the problem effectively. According to a source at the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, Phaithun Kaeothong made a remark to some high-ranking authorities that he is concerned about the problem. The problem was discussed at a meeting of the committee in charge of helping Thai workers in Libya, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan. Phaithun has been informed by the brokers that they were told to send all Thai workers home by February, including those whose contracts have expired as well as those whose contracts are still valid. "Workers whose permits have expired will not be given reentry visas. As for new workers applying for visas, Libya has not rejected their applications, but is just delaying issuing visas. As of 4 January, the Labor Ministry instructed its officials in Greece to check with Thai workers in Libya and report the facts they obtain back to the ministry. Therefore, a report is expected this week," the source said. According to the same source, Labor Permanent Secretary Sawai Phrammani has discussed the matter with his deputy, and they agreed to send a team to negotiate with Libya once a report is received from the labor attache in Greece. They stressed, however, that the issue of Thai workers must be separate from that of international relations. "The Libyan attitude is seen as a tactic to pressure Thailand into working actively to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries. The matter was discussed with Libya a long time ago, but Thailand has remained quiet about it, especially now that it has become a member of the Nonaligned Movement. Libya is serious about it. If Thailand makes its position clear on diplomatic relations, it is believed the problem of Thai workers will be settled," the source said. The Labor Ministry's Job Placement Department reports that there are currently about 20,000 Thai workers in Libya. They are confused about the Thai Government's attitude. The companies say that workers were asking questions after a report said that Libya was unhappy with Thailand's policy of following America.
