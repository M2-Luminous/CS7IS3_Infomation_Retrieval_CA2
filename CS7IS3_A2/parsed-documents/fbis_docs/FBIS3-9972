Only 40 of the 156 U.S. soldiers who came to build a school and a health center remain. The worrisome part is that "TV Today" has learned that their mission was to bury toxic waste in Malaga Bay and that they may return in 20 days to complete their work. After 62 days of uncertainty and of not believing a single word about the facilities that supposedly would be built by the U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, finally the soldiers, Marines, engineers, or whatever they were packed their incredible tons of cargo, containers, trucks, and machinery and began their long journey to Panama. In Juanchaco, however, there is even more uncertainty today. A worrisome rumor is circulating on the island that the gringo soldiers did not come to build facilities but to bury toxic waste in Colombian territory. Those rumors are cause for concern among residents. Out of 156 U.S. soldiers, not even the 40 who stayed and who will leave tomorrow from the naval base in Malaga Bay received any explanation for this action, which now explains the real reason for their presence in our country. What worries the people most is that last Wednesday a U.S.-flagged ship was asked to leave our territory because it carried a shipment of toxic waste. The incident has increased the people's fears and they are afraid to report the case to the media. They merely express their frustration because the work was not completed. [Begin unidentified resident recording] Now that the work is in Colombian hands, we wonder if it will be finished because an airport has been under construction for a long time, and it is still incomplete. [end recording] Meanwhile, the U.S. soldiers said they have no knowledge of the case and that they have nothing to do with it. They also expressed their respect and appreciation for Colombia and said they are leaving with the best impression. [Begin unidentified U.S. soldier recording, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] We must go home because we have completed our work in Juanchaco. [end recording] A U.S. soldier told "TV Today" that 20 days after the elections, a new contingent of U.S. troops will return to Malaga Bay. Meanwhile, we visited the school and health center that are only half finished. Only the roof and walls confirm that U.S. soldiers were indeed there at least trying to build those facilities. Colombian troops, not U.S. soldiers, will work on repairing the airport's runway, which has been practically destroyed.
