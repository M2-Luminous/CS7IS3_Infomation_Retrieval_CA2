Kostenko, head of the delegation, informed the participants about the signing of the tripartite statement in Moscow by the Presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the problem of nuclear disarmament. The representative of Ukraine noted that this statement, the text of which was disseminated at the CSCE forum on behalf of the delegations from Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, crowned a long political and diplomatic marathon and is a result of intensive and complex work. It confirmed a well-known truth: Any problem, even the most complex ones, can be resolved only by way of compromises. The ambassador drew attention to the fact that the tripartite statement mentions political guarantees of Ukraine's security too -- that is it confirms its independence, sovereignty, and existing borders. The representative of Ukraine emphasized that the Ukrainian Government is counting, in connection with the elimination of nuclear weapons located in Ukraine, on receiving from the CSCE the necessary assistance and support in ensuring Ukraine's national security on the basis of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act. On behalf of the European Union, the head of Greece's delegation read out an EC communique in connection with the tripartite statement. The communique evaluates highly the accords achieved and expresses the hope that the legislative procedures necessary for them to come into force will be carried out without delay. Speaking at the session, representatives from the United States and Russia also evaluated highly the tripartite accords, emphasized that they are opening the way to nuclear disarmament, and expressed the hope that they will come into force and be fully implemented in the near future.
