"The American light plane Cessna-550 was flying along the MK-56- H3 route from Dutch Harbour (Aleutian Islands) to Petropavlovsk Kamchatka on April 13," said Leonid Shirobokov, spokesman for the Russian air defence troops. "The flight had been officially announced and we were aware of it. Before crossing the Russian state border at 3:58 a.m. Moscow time [2358 GMT] the pilot failed to report. In order to find out the identity of the plane an air defence fighter was ordered to take off and approach the Cessna. After that the American plane reported," he said. Asked to comment on the ABC report that the Cessna was forced to land, but after refueling was allowed to continue the flight, Shirobokov replied that "no one landed anyone. After having established the identity of the plane our fighter returned to the base, while the Cessna which had communicated with Russian air controllers was allowed to continue the flight and made a safe landing in Petropavlovsk Kamchatka."
