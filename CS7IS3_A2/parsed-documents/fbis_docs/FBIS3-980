The minister of state in the ministry, Chief Anthony Ani, made this known yesterday in Harare, Zimbabwe, while addressing the diplomatic staff of the Nigerian High Commission. Under the new arrangement, noncareer people will no longer be appointed as ambassadors while retired officers will not be granted contract terms. Chief Ani explained that the move was to ensure that career FS [foreign service] officers attained the highest positions while still at their prime. The minister of state also announced that a number of the staff in outstations will be recalled as part of the reorganization and cost saving exercise. He appealed to them to cooperate in the restructuring which, he said, was to provide a better fate for them.
