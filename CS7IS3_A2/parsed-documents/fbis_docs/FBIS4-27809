FBIS4-27809 "dreas107_a_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Boundaries for New Electoral Districts Outlined Boundaries for New Electoral Districts Outlined OW0206144794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1251 GMT 2 Jun 94 OW0206144794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A government panel released a rough outline Thursday [2 June] for the boundaries of 300 new single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives. The group will begin drawing up concrete boundaries for the electoral districts after submitting the outline to the lower house special committee on political reform, government officials said. The ruling coalition wants the panel to report as early as Monday so that a bill can be enacted during the current Diet session which ends in late June, but the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has insisted on June 9 or later, political sources said. A new electoral system was enacted in January, but it will not take effect unless the boundaries for the new electoral districts become law. The outline provides a basic policy for defining constituencies, the officials said. It suggests that cities, wards, towns, villages and counties should not be divided into two constituencies, and detached districts should be avoided. Social and natural conditions, including geography, history and transportation, should be considered in drawing up the boundaries of the constituencies, it said. The panel, headed by Tadao Ishikawa, former president of Keio University, was launched on April 11. Under the new electoral system, 300 of the 500 lower house members will be elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through proportional representation. The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected last July from constituencies supplying two to six members each.
