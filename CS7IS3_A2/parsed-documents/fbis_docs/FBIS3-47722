In faxed message where he reacted to reports that the military had arrested Tabara and four other dissidents, Sison said, "The so called capture of Arturo Tabara is not a real capture because he has been a military asset since 1988, the year his wife was arrested and released upon Tabara's agreement to cooperate with the ISAFP (Intelligence Service of the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines]). Sison, however, said it was possible the four others were truly captured by the military and were trapped into being so by Tabara. "There are strong indications that Tabara surrendered his henchmen to the enemy. They were supposedly armed and yet did not offer any resistance," the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] founder said. Because he believes the capture was merely staged, Sison said he would not be surprised if Tabara is soon released. Moreover, "we should not be surprised if Tabara and his henchmen shall continue to speak and act as counterrevolutionary agents of the U.S.-Ramos regime and are given all the opportunities to do so while they are supposed to be in military custody," he said. Tabara was one of four former CPP officials expelled from the party late last year. They were opposed to the leadership of Sison and have been identified as leaders of the "rejectionists" faction in the underground leftist movement. In an interview after his capture, Tabara dared Sison to come home and lead the rebellion himself. He called Sison a megalomaniac and discounted the possibility of a reunification with Sison's group. Tabara added that his group is forming a new "proletarian people's party" with armed struggle and political work as the basis of their existence. Meanwhile, former Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the government panel negotiating with the communist groups yesterday admitted that he is getting impatient with the "dilly dallying" attitude of the communist leaders adding that delay in the talks will only put their group at a disadvantage. "The more they make us wait, the more they can be marginalized," Dee said. President Ramos earlier said that after 25 years of existence, the Communist Party of the Philippines have failed to successfully push their ideology and even resulted in party rift. Dee said the talks is now temporarily stalled since the CPP leaders have yet to answer government demands that the preconditions to the preliminary talks pushed by CPP head Jose Maria Sison be removed. Dee said Sison is proposing that the preliminary talks be held in Europe, either in Brussels, Netherlands or Luxembourg so that Sison who is in exile in Utrecht will have no difficulty in getting travel documents. Dee stressed that the preliminary talks which they both agreed should precede the exploratory talks in Vietnam should tackle only the ground rules and physical arrangements for the talks. He said the contentious issues which Sison and his groups want resolved before the preliminary talks should instead be included as agenda during the exploratory talks.
