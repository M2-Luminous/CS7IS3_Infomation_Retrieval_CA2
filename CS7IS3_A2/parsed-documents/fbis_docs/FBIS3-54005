An agreement is all the more urgent because tension is rising on the ground, in particular, in Gaza where there are more and more clashes between Palestinians against a background where firearms are proliferating. Our correspondent Charles Enderlin reports: [Enderlin; against video dated December 1993 showing masked uniformed men parading and firing into the air] The phenomenon has reached unprecedented proportions in Gaza. Whereas only three months ago fighters scarcely dared show their weaponry, today there are hardly any parades or rallies by Palestinian organizations without a show of assault rifles. A huge underground firearms market has come into being. The dealers sell to organizations like Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or Fatah, but also to individuals. [Arms dealer] [video shows him sitting in home, with a few rifles and pistols; clip captioned: Gaza, this morning] I only sell to those who are defending society, not to people who buy weapons for the pleasure of walking around with a gun. [Enderlin] Where do you import the goods from? [Arms dealer] The Kalashnikovs come from Egypt. All the rest from Israel, in particular the ammunition. [Second arms dealer] [video shows him standing outside house, waving a pistol] A 9-mm pistol like this one costs 3,000 dollars, 18,000 francs. A Kalashnikov 36,000 francs; the highly prized American M-16 costs 66,000 francs. Before the agreement with Israel it was very hard and very dangerous to get hold of items like this. Today it is easy. There are a lot of goods, and the Israelis do not give a damn. [Enderlin] The heads of the Fatah military wing are worried. They are afraid of accidents and inter-Palestinian clashes. They seize the weapons of individuals who do not belong to any movement. Yesterday, several hundred students demonstrated outside the PLO headquarters against the sale of weapons, and against fratricidal clashes. Ahmad Hillis, one of the Fatah leaders, makes his accusations: [Hillis] The Israeli authorities have completely stopped controlling weapons. But Gaza will not become a second Lebanon. If we have peace, things will settle down. Otherwise, all these weapons will be turned against Israel. [Enderlin] Only the establishment of autonomy and the rapid deployment of the Palestinian police will prevent Gaza from sinking into anarchy.
