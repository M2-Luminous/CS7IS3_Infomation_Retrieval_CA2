Approximately $285 million has already been paid off, leaving a balance of $825 million. In 1992, the balance was $339.6 million, and in 1991 $172.5 million. A further growth in the balance is expected this year. According to Zimola, the overall structure of the capital flow into the Czech Republic is gradually changing. In the first stage, to 1992, government arranged loans from international financial institutions -- particularly the IMF -- were dominant. In 1992, direct investment exceeded $1 billion. This year, this has declined somewhat (to approximately $500 million), but foreign credit and portfolio investment show an upward trend. The reasons for the increasing loans from abroad are mostly their lower price (interest) and a shortage of, above all, long-term loans from Czech banks. Two-thirds of the foreign credits are loans for terms longer than four years. [passage omitted] On the whole, according to Zimola, it can be said that the volume of credits from abroad shows a highly progressive trend, and favorably influences the general development on the balance of payments and the foreign currency reserves.
