Commenting on the latest developments to an ITAR-TASS correspondent, he said: "This bloodshed shows that the process of self-annihilation of the Chechen people, against which our government has been warning everyone for a whole year, is exacerbating." Yaragi Mamodayev cited as evidence of this the fact that forces which, until quite recently, could in effect have been described as allies, for one reason or another clashed in Groznyy on 13 June. According to Yaragi Mamodayev, more people have been killed in Chechnya since the first bloody conflict in June last year than in the open war in former Yugoslavia. The number of casualties in yesterday's tragedy was also several times higher than official figures suggest. It is precisely because each day and each hour of the confrontation is claiming more human lives that our government once again urges the present Chechen leadership to seek reconciliation, not just in order to ensure peace for our compatriots, but for the sake of the very future of the Chechen people, Yaragi Mamodayev stressed.
