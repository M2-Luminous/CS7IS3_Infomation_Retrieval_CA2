A Constitutional Court ruling has given the green light to legislation that authorizes the expropriation of property owned by persons charged with illegally acquiring wealth. By backing the Vienna Convention, the United Nation's highest treaty on drug trafficking, the Constitutional Court has endorsed one of the leading mechanisms to fight this scourge in Colombia. Authorities are convinced that with this endorsement of the treaty it will be easier to confront drug traffickers. [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] It is an international instrument that is essential in the fight against drug trafficking in all of its phases, such as money laundering, taking drugs, and diverting chemicals used in processing cocaine. [end recording] The Court has ruled that, from now on and through a judicial procedure, seizing goods that originated in drug trafficking or goods that represent illegal acquisition of wealth can be authorized. [Begin Gonzalez recording] The Vienna Convention is important because other countries can imitate us. It will be possible to establish regulations and agreements to complement the Vienna Convention in order to freeze drug trafficking-originated goods. It is also an essential instrument in breaking organized crime's financial backbone. [end recording] The nonextradition of Colombian citizens was also agreed upon during the revision of the Vienna Convention.
