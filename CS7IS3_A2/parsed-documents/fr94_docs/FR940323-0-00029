ACTION: Correction to final regulation. SUMMARY: This document contains a correction to the final regulations (Docket 48438) implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 that were published Wednesday, December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67696). EFFECTIVE DATE: January 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert I. Ross, telephone (202) 366&hyph;9154, FAX (202) 366&hyph;9170. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final regulations that are the subject of this correction made amendments to DOT's Privacy Act regulations (49 CFR part 10). The correction concerns appendix A to part 10, wherein DOT exempts various of its record systems from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemption for Coast Guard's Law Enforcement Investigative System and the Federal Aviation Administration's General Air Transportation Records on Individuals was intended to be invoked under 5 USC 552a(k)(2); instead, it was inadvertently invoked under 5 USC 552a(k)(5), thereby affecting the exemption's applicability. Accordingly, the publication on December 22, 1993 of the final regulations (Docket 48438) that were the subject of FR Doc. 93&hyph;31112 is corrected as follows: PART 10_[CORRECTED] 1. On page 67697, amendatory instruction 3. is corrected to read as follows: 3. Part I of Appendix A is revised, and Part II.A. is amended by revising introductory text, paragraph 1, paragraph 12, and concluding text, and adding a new paragraph 13; Part II.B is amended by revising paragraphs B., F.3., and G.1.; and paragraph 3b. to Appendix D is amended by revising all of the subparagraphs to read as follows: 2. On page 67698, in the second column, in section II.B., in the indented paragraph following ``B.'', in the last line, ``5 USC 552a(k)(5)'' is corrected to read ``5 USC 552a(k)(2).'' This correction is issued pursuant to 49 CFR 1.57(l). Issued in Washington, DC, on March 8, 1994. Stephen H. Kaplan, General Counsel.
