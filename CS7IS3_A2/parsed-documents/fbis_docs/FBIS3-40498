Some aerodynamic characteristics and flowfield properties are presented. 1. Rarefied Gas Numerical Wind Tunnel Work is moving ahead on the development and implementation of the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel (RGNWT) which is designed for determining aerodynamic characteristics when a high-level airfoil such as the space plane flies through rarefied gas. High-precision, high-efficiency simulation techniques are a must for three-dimensional full-airfoil simulations in rarefied gas. For this purpose, the null-collision (NC) direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DS-MC) method[.sup]1[/] is used where the mean molecular lower limit per collision cell is no more than approximately 1 and the computation time is short. General-purpose use is made of a high-efficiency (uniform) rectangular parallelepiped for the computation area, collision cell shape, and data cell shape. The boundary conditions at the boundary of the computation area are that the uniform flow at the object upper flow and vertical and lateral boundaries are disregarded, and the changes in the direction of flow at the object lower boundary are disregarded in making approximations. The object surface cells that are for determining the aerodynamic characteristics of the object are divided into shapes that are suited to the object shape independently of the collision cell shapes. As to the gas molecule reflection conditions at the object surface, a mixed form is assumed which is a mixture of mirror-surface reflection and diffuse reflection. The gas molecule model used is the variable soft sphere (VSS) model which was recently proposed as a high-precision, high-efficiency molecular model.[.sup]2[/] We are also now developing a molecular model for conducting high-precision, high-efficiency simulations of actual gas effects such as molecular spin, vibration, dissociation, electronic excitation, ionization, and radiation. 2. OREX We used the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel to conduct three-dimensional rare flow simulations around the orbital re-entry experiment vehicle (OREX). The collision (data) cells and the object surface cells are diagrammed in Figure 1. Figure 1. Collision (Data) Cell and Object Surface Because the inter-molecular potential at high energy is indeterminate,[.sup]3[/] we used values for the parameters in the VSS molecular model which correspond to those of rigid sphere models. We also assumed a uniform flow temperature dispersion wall for the object surface. The figures which follow depict the results with angle of incidence _a_ = 0� for cases where flight is at a uniform flow Mach number M[.sup]�[/] = 27 (speed ratio S[.sup]�[/] = 25) in a rarefied flow with a uniform flow Knudsen number Kn[.sup]�[/] = 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01, with the OREX diameter as the standard criterion. The object axis (rotational) symmetrical surface infra density and temperature distributions are depicted in Figures 2 through 5 for Kn[.sup]�[/] = 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01. Along with the reduction (high-level reduction) of the Knudsen number, the disturbance area in front of the object is also reduced. The density reaches several tens of times the uniform flow value in the vicinity of the forward stagnation point, while the temperature exceeds a hundred times the uniform flow value in front of the forward stagnation point. There is also a high temperature region in the back flow of the object which is several tens of times the uniform flow temperature. Figure 2(a). Density Distribution; Figure 2(b).

Density Distribution; Figure 5(b). Temperature Distribution; In Figure 6 are plotted the changes based on the Knudsen number Kn[.sup]�[/] of the drag coefficient C[.sup]D[/]. The drag coefficient declines along with the decline in Kn[.sup]�[/]. The degree of convergence in the computational results for the decrease in the collision cell size is indicated on the diagram also, but the convergence is inadequate at Kn[.sup]�[/] < 0.1, and we see that it has become a largish value. Figure 6. Drag Coefficient; (Circle), Collision Cell = The distributions of both the non-dimensional (surface) pressure P[.sup]w[/]/(_r_[.sub]�[/]c[.sub]�[/][.sup]2[/]) on the OREX surface and the non-dimensional (surface) heat transfer Q/(1/2_r_[.sup]�[/]c[.sub]�[/][.sup]3[/]) are plotted in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, where _r_[.sup]�[/] and c[.sub]�[/] are the uniform flow density and thermal velocity, respectively. The non-dimensional pressure is not very dependent on Kn[.sup]�[/], but the non-dimensional heat transfer declines considerably with declines in Kn[.sup]�[/]. Both exhibit a gradual decline in the conical portion. Figure 7. Surface Pressure Distribution; (Square), Figure 8.

Some of the simulation results are recorded in the animation entitled "Monte Carlo Simulation of OREX" produced by the Mathematical Analysis Department of the National Aerospace Laboratory, and we wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Fujino who cooperated in the animation production. 1.
