FR940819-2-00015 FR940819-2-00006 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Continuous Measurement System&hyph;&hyph;Random Digit Dialing Test. Form Number(s): None. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 21,000 hours. Number of Respondents: 28,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 45 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Census Bureau is developing and evaluating a design to continuously measure the long&hyph;form data that has traditionally been collected once a decade as part of the decennial census. Under the Continuous Measurement System (CMS) a long&hyph;form questionnaire would be mailed to a sample of different addresses contained in our master address file (MAF) each month. Continuously collecting the long&hyph;form data will not only provide more timely data, but will lessen respondent burden in the decennial census. The first phase in this research is to conduct a survey in approximately 2,000 different households each month over a 14 month period. The objectives of this test are to determine the feasibility and costs of a telephone nonrespondent follow&hyph;up component for the CMS, examine question wording to collect ``rolling'' or accumulated income estimates based on 5 years of data, review possible seasonal effects on income estimates, prototype the processing system, and research the cost and effectiveness of using cross&hyph;reference directories to obtain phone numbers. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) will be employed in the test as a means of sampling and for obtaining telephone numbers of households. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: Monthly. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: August 15, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
