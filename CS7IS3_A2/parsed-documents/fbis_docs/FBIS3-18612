In a KURIER interview, the Czech Prime Minister sharply criticized Austria for lobbying against a United States loan to complete the Temelin nuclear power plant located near the [Czech-Austrian] border. "This intervention is impossible for me. It has something to do with the elections," Klaus suspects. The Austrians have other things on their minds rather than nuclear power plants. Chancellor Vranitzky categorically rejects this suggestion: "There are clear reasons for our strict antinuclear policy: The referendum on Zwentendorf [nuclear power plant], the nuclear-free policy resulting from it, and the practical experience of half of Europe had with Chernobyl," the Chancellor said in an interview with KURIER. This is "ample justification" for opposing Temelin. He has repeatedly pointed out this problem, "which we do not want to hold back in spite of good neighborly relations." Klaus' accusation that the investment offered by Austria to transform Temelin into a gas power plant was "state-organized lobbying," is countered by Vranitzky dryly: "The free-of-charge electricity supplies would have cost 3.5 billion Austrian schillings per year -- this is not lobbying." Also, it is not true -- as Klaus thinks -- that Austria lacks understanding for the Czech Republic that is building up a free market economy after 40 years of communism. But: "The answer to the effects of communism cannot be a nuclear power plant built the communist way." Vranitzky emphasized that the dispute over Temelin is "not a crusade against the Czech Republic, but our offer to cooperate."
