FR940505-1-00251 FR940505-1-00012 G w = mass of VOC captured and delivered to control device using a TTE F w = mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from a TTE Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain G w . Procedure F.1 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F w . ( 2 ) Liquid/gas method using TTE. The U.S. EPA specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE = (L&hyph;F w )/L where CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction L = mass of liquid VOC input to process F w = mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from a TTE Procedure L contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain L. Procedure F.1 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F w . ( 3 ) Gas/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which ``F'' and ``G'' are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE = G/(G + F B ) where CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction G = mass of VOC captured and delivered to control device F B = mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from building enclosure Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain G. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F B . (4) Liquid/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which ``F'' and ``L'' are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE = (L-F B )/L where CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction L = mass of liquid VOC input to process F B = mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from building enclosure Procedure L contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain L. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F B . (C) Recordkeeping and Reporting. ( 1 ) All affected facilities must maintain a copy of the capture efficiency protocol submitted to EPA on file. All results of the appropriate test methods and capture efficiency protocols must be reported to EPA within sixty (60) days of the test date. A copy of the results must be kept on file with the source for a period of five (5) years. ( 2 ) If any changes are made to capture equipment, then affected facilities must notify EPA of these changes and a new test may be required by EPA. ( 3 ) All affected facilities must notify the Administrator 30 days prior to performing any capture efficiency test. At that time, the source must notify the Administrator which capture efficiency protocol will be used. ( 4 ) All affected facilities utilizing a PTE must demonstrate that this enclosure meets the requirement given in Procedure T in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 at all times. ( 5 ) All affected facilities utilizing a TTE must demonstrate that their TTE meets the requirements given in Procedure T in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 for a TTE during testing of their control device. The source must also provide documentation that the quality assurance criteria for a TTE have been achieved.
