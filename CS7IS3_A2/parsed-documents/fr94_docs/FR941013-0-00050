Inseason Action 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 16 Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B Closed to Halibut Fishing Preliminary tabulation of catch figures for the September 12&hyph;14, 1994, fishing period in Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B indicates that the season's catch in all three areas are close to their respective catch limits. While exact numbers are not yet available, it is apparent that not enough halibut will be available in any of the areas to allow an October fishing period. Therefore, all fishing in U.S. waters is now closed to halibut fishing for the remainder of 1994. Dated: October 5, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25281 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
