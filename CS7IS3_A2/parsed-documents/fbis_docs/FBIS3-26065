Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, told all members of the inspection groups at the Great Hall of the People today that paying back what is owed to the teachers is not an expedient measure and that there must be no further default in teachers pay after paying back what is owed them. Li Lanqing said: The "Teachers law" adopted at the fourth session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee is an important law in promoting China's education cause. The law must not be ignored; it must be strictly enforced. All localities and departments across the country must resolutely implement the law and use it as a weapon to resolve practical problems encountered by teachers and to further develop a fine social ethics of respecting teachers and education. Li Lanqing said: Elementary education is the most important layer in China's macroeducation structure. It is something of vital importance to the people's standards and the nation's future. Therefore, we must do everything possible to make our elementary education a success. It is the important responsibility of governments at all levels to make elementary education, including the nine-year compulsory education, successful. Thanks to the efforts of governments at all levels, the question of default in teachers' pay, which had existed in some areas since the second half of 1992, has been mostly resolved. To our knowledge, the problem, however, still existed in a few areas. Resolving the question of default in teachers' pay is a concrete expression of respect for teachers and education. Governments at all levels and people of all walks of life should all take it seriously. Paying back what is owed to teachers is not an expedient measure; there must be no further default in teachers' pay after paying back what is owed them. An appropriate safeguard mechanism must be established. Zhao Dongwan, chairman of the NPC Education, Science, Culture, and Public Health Committee, and Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of State Education Commission, were present at the meeting. Zhao Dongwan said that the emphasis of the current inspection is to find out about: 1) measures adopted by various localities in implementing the teachers' law; 2) progress made in various localities in paying back teachers' wages; 3) progress made in various localities in implementing the newly announced wage system; and 4) ways to improve the mechanism for ensuring payment of teachers' wages. The four provinces which the inspection groups will visit are places where the question of default in teachers' pay is more serious. The NPC Education, Science, Culture, and Public Health Committee took the lead in organizing the current inspection. Responsible persons of departments concerned of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee and the State Education Commission were also present.
