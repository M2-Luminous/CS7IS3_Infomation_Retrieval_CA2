Ustasha fighters were attacking virtually all defense regions and the enemy fired dozens of projectiles from (?different) artillery pieces. Unlike their [word indistinct] practice so far, the ustashas especially intensified their artillery activities during [word indistinct] morning. In the region of Potocari in the north of the Mostar commune, over 50 mortar bombs of various calibers have been fired. Other regions in the north of the Mostar Commune, such as (Plice) and (Racici) were exposed to increased shelling, and the ustashas shot at the lines of separation with [word indistinct]. There was also no peace in the central parts of Mostar, so that about 30 projectiles, mostly mortar bombs of the largest caliber, have been launched on the district of (Dalic) alone in the last 24 hours. However, other Mostar districts have not been spared, because it has been registered that, late last night, the Ustashas fired several rockets at the village of (Jelice) from a multiple rocket launcher, and shells and mortar bombs were fired at all districts in the region of Pracevac. At the separation line, on the right bank of the Neretva River, along with increased fire from infantry weapons, 25 mortar bombs were also fired. Despite all the assaults by the enemy (?Ustasha) formations, all lines of separation in the zone covered by the 4th Corps have remained unchanged and stable.
