FR940505-1-00085 FR940505-1-00012 The proposed AIM coatings FIP rule (see 40 CFR 52.2959) builds upon the California Air Resources Board_California Air Pollution Control Officers Association 1989 Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural Coatings and upon current district rules. In addition, and parallel to the FIP effort, EPA is involved in a Regulatory Negotiation 48 (Reg Neg) for the development of a national AIM coating regulation. The relationship between a potential national rule and the proposed FIP rule is discussed later in this section. Where possible, EPA has attempted to take into account the potential outcome of the Reg Neg and its possible impact on a FIP regulation. 48 The Regulatory Negotiation includes representatives from industry, user groups, regulators, and environmental organizations. The goal of this consensus building process is to assist EPA in the development of a national AIM rule or control technique guideline. The proposal is modeled after the 1989 SCM and currently adopted California regulations, and it incorporates recent information regarding low VOC AIM coatings. The proposed regulation phases in lower coating limits from 1996 to 2003. In January 1996, initial limits for approximately 40 coating categories will go into effect. This will be followed by a second reduction phase in 2000 with lower limits for select categories such as: all clear wood finishes [350 grams of VOC per liter (g/l)]; concrete curing compounds (250 g/l); and traffic paints (125 g/l). A third reduction phase in 2003 will lower limits for select categories such as: varnishes (250 g/l); flats (50&hyph;150 g/l); many industrial maintenance coatings (275 g/l); non-flats (150 g/l); roof coatings (250 g/l); and traffic paints (50 g/l). In addition, the small container (less than one liter) exemption will be phased out as of 2003. The environmental, economic, and other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support document. The rule is expected to affect approximately 150 paint manufacturers who market their AIM coatings in the State. Implementation of this rule is expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 25&hyph;30 percent, depending on the stringency of the current SIP regulation for a given district. FIP area reductions are expected to be 2.0 tpd (1999) and 2.3 tpd (2005) for Sacramento, 1.7 tpd (2005) in Ventura, and 21 tpd (2010) in South Coast. The proposed FIP AIM coating rule establishes future effective limits which allow industry time to transition, where necessary, to lower VOC coatings. For the most part, low VOC coatings are being sold today which can meet the limits proposed for 2000 and 2003. While EPA acknowledges that the proposed limits may in some cases phase out certain high VOC technologies (e.g., nitrocellulose lacquers), the proposal assumes that available alternative resin technologies can adequately replace high VOC coatings. The proposal will also encourage the further development of new and improved low VOC technologies. As described earlier, AIM coatings are formulated with pigments, resins, solvents, and additives. Changes and improvements in coating technologies begin in the research laboratories of the resin manufacturers/suppliers and paint manufacturers capable of researching new resin technologies. The cost of phasing in lower VOC AIM coatings will depend in part on the ability of resin manufacturers/suppliers and paint manufacturers to develop and market low VOC coatings. For those already manufacturing low VOC products, the proposed regulation would initially impose no additional costs and might, in fact, lead to increased profits. For AIM coating manufacturers who manufacture high VOC coatings affected by the proposed rule, the cost may approach several thousand $/ton for conversion to low VOC product lines. These costs can be partially reduced through the assistance of resin manufacturers/suppliers and/or large paint manufacturers, who are primarily responsible for researching and developing new coating formulations. Upon request, most resin manufacturers/suppliers are willing to share information and sample low VOC coating formulations with interested paint manufacturers, both large and small, to assist in the development of low VOC coatings. While low VOC coatings are available today which meet the proposed coating limits, there continues to be debate over the performance characteristics and perceived limitations of certain low VOC AIM coatings. EPA requests comment and technical information on: available or soon to be available low VOC coatings which meet the proposed limits; previous or potential reformulation costs; performance or application limitations (if any) of low VOC coatings; and any AIM coatings or promising technologies where low VOC technology is expected to advance beyond the proposed AIM FIP limits. (1) Relationship to National Rule Development. In early 1992, EPA began to explore a Reg Neg (57 FR 1443; January 14, 1992) to assist in fulfilling its obligation for a national AIM regulation or CTG as described under section 183(e) of the Act. Although today's proposed FIP action is independent of the ongoing Reg Neg process and is not an attempt by the Agency to meet the requirements of section 183(e), EPA will fully consider the potential Reg Neg outcome and may modify the proposed FIP rule as appropriate. Either a FIP AIM coating rule or a national AIM coating rule/CTG will ultimately provide the basis for the regulation which reduces emissions from AIM coatings sold into and used in California. While the Reg Neg process is nearing completion, unresolved issues remain and EPA does not anticipate that the proposed action under section 183(e) will be published prior to the court-ordered FIP proposal deadline. In addition, there is not a statutory deadline for an AIM rule per se under section 183(e), 49 so there is currently no assurance as to when the AIM regulation will be finalized. Because of the need to demonstrate through actual regulations the emission reductions necessary to achieve attainment in the FIP areas, EPA could not rely on the speculative outcome of the Reg Neg for its FIP rule and is therefore proposing a FIP AIM rule. While EPA is hopeful that the Reg Neg will result in a rule/CTG which could benefit the FIP areas, the court ordered deadline for the FIP proposal does not allow EPA the opportunity to wait for the potential national rule/CTG. Upon completion of the Reg Neg process and EPA's proposed national AIM rule/CTG, EPA will reevaluate its FIP strategy for AIM coatings. 49 Section 183(e) of the CAA requires that EPA submit a report to Congress by November 15, 1993. Upon submission of the final report, the Administrator will establish categories of consumer and commercial products intended for regulation and divide the categories into four groups to establish regulatory priorities. Every two years after promulgation of the list, EPA shall regulate one group until all four groups are regulated. EPA has yet to submit the report and establish the list of categories to be regulated. (2) Relationship to Local Rules. While all of the major metropolitan areas in California already have an architectural coatings rule, coating limits may vary between districts for certain AIM categories. Because the proposed FIP regulation will be more stringent than all current district regulations, the proposed FIP rule will effectively bring all of the areas under a common standard to provide equity within the industry and greatly enhance the enforceability the rule. 50 50 As a matter of law, the local agencies could continue to enforce their local SIP rules, but manufacturers would be expected to formulate their coatings to address the more stringent statewide FIP provisions. (3) Alternative Reduction Approaches. The following additional approaches for reducing emissions from AIM coatings were also considered.
