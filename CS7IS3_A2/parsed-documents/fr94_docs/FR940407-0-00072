FR940407-0-00072 FR940407-0-00014 3. Program Baseline An EIP baseline must be fully defined within the EIP, and used as a basis for projecting program results and, if applicable, for initializing the incentive mechanism. States have flexibility in defining the program baseline for EIP's that implement new RACT requirements for previously unregulated source categories through trading programs, as long as the new RACT requirements reflect, to the extent practicable, increased emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional RACT program. States may also use a flexible baseline for EIP's that allow trading with respect to newly imposed RACT requirements on previously unregulated sources in a previously regulated source category (e.g., sources newly covered by lower applicability cut-offs), as long as the EIP, in the aggregate, yields reductions in actual emissions at least equivalent to those which would result from source-by-source compliance with the existing RACT limit for that source category. This requirement can be satisfied by using existing data on actual and allowable emissions from the previously regulated sources in the affected source category (see paragraph IV.C.). A State also has flexibility in defining the program baseline for any EIP submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the submission of any complete areawide progress plan due at the time of EIP submittal (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan (section 182(b)(1)) and subsequent 3 percent plans (section 182(c)(2))), and/or an attainment demonstration. In all such cases, the flexible program baseline may be based on actual, allowable, or some other intermediate 10 or lower level of emissions, provided the State demonstrates that the program baseline is consistent with and reflected in the associated RACT rule, progress plans, or attainment demonstration. Further, for EIP's submitted prior to the submittal of a required progress or attainment demonstration, the State must include with its EIP submittal a commitment that its subsequent attainment demonstration and all future progress plans will be consistent with the EIP baseline in effect at that time, as well as a discussion of how the baseline will be integrated into the State's attainment demonstration. Further, in this discussion, the State should take into account the potential that emission reduction credits issued prior to the attainment demonstration may no longer be surplus relative to the attainment demonstration. 11 10 A typical intermediate baseline may consist of a SIP-allowable emission rate and an actual level of production. 11 For example, the State could establish an escrow account or a formula for pro rata reductions of credits to cover credits that subsequently are no longer surplus. Conversely, for EIP's that do not meet the above conditions relating to RACT and progress requirements, the program baseline must be set no higher than the lower of actual or allowable emissions. Actual emissions are to be taken from the most appropriate inventory, such as the 1990 actual emission inventory (which was due for submission in November 1992), and allowable emissions are the lower of SIP allowable emissions or the level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. In addition, following submission of an EIP that incorporates a flexible baseline, if the State fails to submit a complete attainment demonstration, or if the EPA disapproves the attainment demonstration on the grounds that it does not provide for attainment of the NAAQS, the EPA may require the State to incorporate in the EIP a program baseline set no higher than the lower of actual or allowable emissions. The baseline for an EIP submitted in conjunction with an attainment demonstration must be consistent with the assumptions employed in the attainment demonstration, including the location of emissions assumed in the photochemical grid modelling, if applicable. In considering emissions trading, the EPA continues to focus on the aspect of trading that involves the relaxation of a control requirement on a particular emissions-producing unit (the credit-receiving unit). Under trading programs, this relaxation is offset by tightening the control requirements on another emissions-producing unit (the credit-generating unit). Under section 110(l), this relaxation is authorized only if it, taken in conjunction with the tighter control requirements, does not interfere with the ability of the SIP to meet the various requirements of the Act_most importantly, for present purposes, the RACT requirement and the requirements for progress (e.g., for RFP in O 3 nonattainment areas, 15 percent reductions in VOC emissions by 1996; and 3 percent-per-year over each 3-year period until the attainment date), as well as attainment requirements. It is understood that when the credit-generating unit's actual emissions are below the level mandated by the applicable control requirement, relaxing a control requirement on the credit-receiving unit in exchange for tightening the requirement on the credit-generating unit may result in an increase in aggregate actual emissions. Under these circumstances (i.e., trading from an allowables baseline), the relaxation and its resulting increase in actual emissions could, in some circumstances, jeopardize RFP and attainment.
