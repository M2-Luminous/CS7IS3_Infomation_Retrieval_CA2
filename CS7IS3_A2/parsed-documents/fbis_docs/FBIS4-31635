After debates that lasted many hours and after six amendments proposed by the opposition representatives and by the special Senate panel had been rejected, eventually they passed, by ballot, the amendment proposed by Senator Ion Culcea of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. In concordance with the text proposed by the senator, Article 2 was adopted in the following wording: The persons mentioned by Article 1, that is, the former owners or their heirs, are to benefit from restitution in nature in the form of regaining their right to property over the apartments they currently live in as tenants, while for all other apartments they are to be paid damages under the terms of Article 12 of this bill. Article 2 was passed by only 60 votes in favor, 15 against, and 4 abstentions; that is, the total number of votes was just 79. This happened because before the article was submitted to ballot, the representatives of the opposition, with the exception of the Democratic Party senators, walked out of the hall. Immediately following this, Senator Alexandru Popoviciof PL-93 [Liberal Party '93] explained their gesture by pointing out that the opposition cannot associate itself to theft and that it decided to definitely withdraw from the discussions on the aforementioned draft bill. According to our correspondent, Dan Preda, immediately after the opposition senators walked out Omnia Hall [Senate headquarters] they met with representatives of the press. Here is the declaration that was adopted in the end of that meeting and which was sent to us via fax by our correspondent: Considering the fact that today the parliamentary majority in Senate adopted in principle merely the paying of limited damages for the nationalized dwellings or other dwellings that after 6 March 1945 went into state property under any other form -- expropriated, confiscated, or taken by abuse; -- considering that this solution actually represents a second and final nationalization; -- considering that this solution violates Romania's Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights; -- considering that the ruling coalition has rejected all the amendments suggested by the opposition, including the ones adopted by the [Senate] Commission for Public Administration and the Organization of the Territory, as well as other variants to those amendments; -- considering that the ruling majority has not accepted the proposals of the opposition regarding the social protection of the tenants; -- not wishing to be coauthor of such legislative abuse, the signatory parties of the present declaration withdraw for good from the discussions and vote-taking on the draft Bill on the Regulation of the Juridical Status of Certain Dwellings Which Became the Property of State by Nationalization. The declaration is hand-signed by representatives of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania], the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], the PL-93, and the PNL-CD [National Liberal Party-Democratic Convention].
