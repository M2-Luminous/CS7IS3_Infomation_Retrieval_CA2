Engineer 'Ali Sa'idlu, deputy minister of commerce for trade and chief of the Iran Export Development Center, announced the above at a gathering of news reporters. He said: In this regard talks have been held with Foreign Ministry officials, because trade attaches in the embassies will help develop exports. He discussed the provisions the government has made to support exporters of nonoil goods. He said: Based on a measure enacted by the Money and Credit Council, the share of credits to be provided for exports is increased from last year's 6.5-percent figure to 8.5 percent for the current year, with a commission rate of 18 percent. Engineer Sa'idlu also added: The Supreme Exports Council, which met recently chaired by President of the Republic Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani and attended by a number of ministers working in economic affairs, will soon prepare a comprehensive export program. He explained that the measures enacted by this council, along with the new activities of the exports guarantee fund, will solve the problems in the export sector. Engineer Sa'idlu noted that imports of goods must be done in exchange for exports. On this same basis, the Export Development Center sets prices on export goods and gives an affidavit to that effect to the exporters. Using these affidavits it is possible to import the goods needed by the country. In conclusion, he said that holding an international exposition all over the country depends on obtaining authorization from the Export Development Center.
