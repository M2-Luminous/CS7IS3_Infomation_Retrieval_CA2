Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah told the AL-WATAN newspaper in his first interview as interior minister that the Ministries of Interior, Defense, and National Guard were "prepared to block any possible aggression, especially as these forces are operating under joint and clear coordination." Responding to a question on his future plans for the Interior Ministry, he said "work in the Interior Ministry is different to that in defense but the minister is required to work in the light of the state's general strategy." "There are many ideas, including developing work in the departments, circulating some officials, and finding ways capable of handling citizens' dealings as quickly as possible," he said. He added, "the ministries and the state's apparatus suffer from a shortage of qualified human cadres" and indicated that modern equipment would be required to compensate the shortage and overcome bureaucracy. Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah said there were "several ideas to develop the work of sentries and village chiefs to find a bigger and more comprehensive role for them. "I am not superman and I alone cannot carry out all achievements. That is impossible without the intertwining of efforts, which would emerge by concentrating on ingraining the spirit of responsibility and confidence in security men, be they small or large." In that context, he stressed his rejection of centralization of the administration. "Kuwait's interest is above any consideration and I will not delay in punishing and reprimanding all who try to disturb the security of this country and the unity of the people of Kuwait," he said. Asked about some security members who sullied their positions and their work places with their conduct, he said that "this matter cannot be considered a phenomenon but there are some individual acts that give the security apparatus a bad name and we will try to select elements of high skill and abilities to carry out excellent performances." He spoke of his wish to establish the principle of every citizen being a sentry so that he could, in the future, be responsible for his country's security, which was a joint responsibility. Asked about tackling the problems of illegal residents and the position of Kuwaiti women married to non-Kuwaitis, the minister said that he could not go into those two issues at present until he had seen all figures and information found in reports.
