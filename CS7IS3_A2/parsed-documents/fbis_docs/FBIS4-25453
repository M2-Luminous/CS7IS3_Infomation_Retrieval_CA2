Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out powerfully that stability is the crux for China's development and strengthening. Studying this idea by Comrade Xiaoping is of major significance in our doing well in the various aspects of reform and construction work. The Selected Works elaborate on the idea that stability is more important than everything else from many angles, many sides, and many levels. We can sum up the ideas in the following points: Stability is in accord with the highest and greatest interests of our party, our Army, and the people of all nationalities in our country. Without a stable political situation and a stable social environment, there would be no speedy economic growth, no social development and the people would not be able to live and work in peace. If we are to continually consolidate and perfect the socialist system in practice, we must have a political and social environment which has long-term stability. Otherwise, the socialist system, which has been created through the sacrifices and the blood of millions of people, will not be consolidated and safeguarded and could even face the danger of dissolution. As Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out: "A collapse can occur overnight. Collapsing is easy, construction is very difficult." The 40-plus years of history since the establishment of New China have powerfully proven that, with a stable political situation and social environment, our socialist cause has been able to achieve very rapid development but, as soon as the situation of stability is destroyed, our socialist revolution and construction loses its vigor and vitality. Especially during the 10 years of internal disorder during the "Cultural Revolution," our socialist economy was pushed to the point of collapse, resulting in a greater disparity between our country and the developed countries of the world. Thus, maintaining stability is in the highest interests of the party and the state. At the same time, under the socialist system, stability is also a social goal. If the country is at peace, the people are at peace. If the people can live in peace, they are happy in their work. This reflects the greatest interests of our country's people. Seek stability through reform, opening up and development. Comrade Xiaoping's expositions and the practical experiences of reform and opening up over the more than last 10 years tell us that in the process of reform and development, there is a need for a stable political and social environment. Without a stable environment, nothing else can be even talked about, nothing else can be achieved, and even the achievements which have already been scored will be lost. Meanwhile, upholding reform and opening up is a basic condition for long-term peace and stability. Only by reforming the ossified structure and establishing a socialist market economy structure, and accelerating economic development, will it be possible to further consolidate the socialist system and thereby essentially maintain stability. Thus, understanding and grasping well the internal relationships between stability, reform, and development are leadership requirements and leadership skills necessary for leading comrades at all levels and especially high-level leading comrades. Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years is the political basis for maintaining stability. Upholding reform and opening up, engaging in economic construction with one heart and one mind, and taking the development of the social productive forces as the basic task at the present stage, will lay down a base for the long-term stability of the state. The four cardinal principles are the basic principles on which the state is based. They are the political orientation and the political principles with which we must be in accord in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. If the party leaders are able to increase the cohesion and centripetal force of the people of all nationalities throughout the country, it will be a basic political guarantee for maintaining social stability. The essence of socialism is the liberating and development of the productive forces, the elimination of exploitation, the removal of polarization, and the eventual realization of common prosperity. This superior social system provides system guarantees for maintaining a stable political order and creates beneficial social conditions. The people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful guarantee and weapon for achieving social stability. Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful spiritual motivation and spiritual prop in engaging in socialist construction and reform. Comrade Xiaoping has fully affirmed that Mao Zedong Thought is still the guiding ideology of our party. This has major and deep significance in terms of maintaining the ideological unity of the whole party, in unifying to open up a new road for developing the socialist cause, and in guaranteeing that our party and state can pass the rigorous tests of the rapidly changing international situation. In maintaining stability we must take a clear-cut stand in opposing bourgeois liberalization. On the subject of opposing bourgeois liberalization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said much. He astutely pointed out: "If China engages in bourgeois liberalization, there will certainly be chaos, resulting in our being unable to achieve anything. Then, the line, principles and policies, and the three-stage development strategy targets we have formulated will all fizzle out." In his speeches while inspecting the south, Comrade Xiaoping also laid stress on this issue, pointing out: "We must continue to grasp this with both hands. One hand must grasp reform and opening up and one hand must strike at various types of economic crimes. We must maintain a tight grip with both these hands. In striking at various types of criminal activities and sweeping away various types of odious activities, we cannot relax our grip." In this respect, we must maintain an extremely clear mind. In accordance with the expositions by Comrade Xiaoping, in maintaining stability we must strengthen the building of a legal system, punish corruption, and carry out education in ideals, morality, culture, and discipline for cadres and the masses, to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has required that "comrades working in the various work posts must jointly shoulder responsibility for safeguarding, guaranteeing, and developing this political situation of unity and stability." The People's Armed Forces, as an important component part of the state machinery, is even more duty-bound by this responsibility. This requires that our armed forces do the following: A. We must grasp the safeguarding of stability as a long-term political task. B. We must put efforts into improving the fighting strength and deterrent power of the armed forces. The stronger the fighting strength of the armed forces, the greater their deterrent effect on domestic and foreign enemy forces and the greater will be the guarantee of the security and stability of the state. Thus, it is necessary to centralize efforts in training the armed forces well, in improving the fighting strength of the armed forces, and in building them into a powerful, civilized, and indomitable army so that we can take on the glorious task of safeguarding national security and safeguarding social stability. C. Increasingly close links must be developed between the army and the government and between the army and the people, so as to form iron and steel walls for safeguarding social stability. Unity between the army and the government and between the army and the people and the unity of all nationalities are important safeguards for safeguarding social stability. At all times, we must breathe as one with the masses and share their fate, and maintain and bring into play the fine tradition of army-people unity seen during the revolutionary war years. We must strengthen the close links with the relevant local departments so that there is full army-locality cooperation, giving full effect to the work of maintaining stability. "The Crux Lies in Doing Well in Building Our Party" by Li Xilin [2621 1585 2651] In Selected Works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly warns the whole party: "If problems appear in China, they will be the result of problems within the CPC"; "We must concentrate our efforts on building the party"; and "In the end, the crux lies in handling well the internal relations in our Communist Party. If there is nothing wrong there, we can relax and sleep easily." These conclusions by Comrade Xiaoping are a deep summation of experiences in international and domestic struggle, demonstrating the importance of strengthening the building of the party during the new period of reform and opening up. I will now discuss my understanding of this question: 1. Strengthen study, to raise one's own quality. Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out back in 1978: "Realizing the four modernizations is a great and farreaching revolution. In this great revolution, we advance through continually resolving new contradictions. Thus, the comrades of the whole party must be good at study and be good at studying anew." Comrade Jiang Zemin has also repeatedly demanded that the whole party place importance on and strengthen study. Only if cadres at all levels of the party strengthen their study, will they be able to be in accord with the demands of international struggle and international competition, with the demands of deepening reform and modernization, and in accord with the higher demands which the new situation places on the leading groups and leading cadres at various levels. They must consciously implement the party's basic line, guard against the principle of exchange at equal value corroding inner-party political life, and stop corrupt actions whereby power is used for personal gain and whereby power is exchanged for money, to maintain the advanced and pure nature of Communist Party members. If leading cadres are to study well, I feel that the most important points to stress at present are: A. It is necessary to recognize the promotional role which study has on work. Some comrades are always saying that they are busy with work and have arduous tasks to complete and they have no time to study. In fact, it is because of the work with which we are busy that we need to strengthen our study and raise our leadership level and work efficiency. We also need to do a little specific analysis of the term "busy." Sometimes comrades are truly busy but, at other times they are busy to no purpose. Leading cadres should centralize their energies in grasping major matters, throw off the fetters of minor tasks, and make time to study. Otherwise, even if they work harder, they will not be able to get to grips with the essentials and they will produce no results. B. It is necessary to overcome being scared of both difficulty and complacency. Some comrades hold that the socialist market economy theory is too abstruse, that modern scientific and technological knowledge is too unfamiliar, and that it is very difficult to realize any progress. Others believe that Comrade Xiaoping's works are easy to understand and they can be understood without too much effort. Thus, they are satisfied with a smattering of knowledge. There are different forms of manifestation of these two situations but actually they all essentially involve having low study standards and lacking a spirit of arduous investigation and study. C. It is necessary to seriously resolve psychological problems. The basic reason why some comrades do not continue studying and make no progress in their study is that their spirit is not braced and they do not truly use their mind in their study and work. Thus, leading cadres must bestir their spirits and bear in mind the great responsibilities they shoulder, recognize their qualitative deficiencies, begin by strengthening study, and continually raise their own abilities and levels. 2. Safeguarding the authority of the central authorities, strengthening the centralized unity of the party. Safeguarding and strengthening the authority of the central authorities is an idea which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always stressed. In response to the phenomenon whereby "when the upper levels promulgate a policy, the lower levels implement a countermeasure," he earnestly pointed out: "If reform is to be successful, it must be carried out in an ordered and guided manner. Without this, if everyone rushes in and each does his own thing, how can anything be achieved?" He also pointed out: "Without the authority of the Central Committee and the State Council, it will be impossible to resolve problems. With this authority, however, even in difficult times, major matters can be dealt with. We cannot negate authority and, when centralization is necessary, we must have centralization." At present, we must pay attention to resolving the following several questions: A. We must guard against and overcome the tendency whereby, as the market economy is strengthened, central authority is being weakened. B. We must guard against and overcome local protectionism. C. We must guard against and overcome the phenomenon whereby, using the excuse that there are special circumstances, localities do not implement the central policies and regulations. 3. We must firmly oppose corruption and promote a clean administration, to earn the trust of the people through a clean image. Comrade Deng Xiaoping takes the building of clean government and opposition to corruption as a major matter in handling matters within the party properly. He has placed the greatest stress on this and adopts the firmest attitude regarding it. I believe that at present we must pay attention to three issues. A. We must further overcome some misunderstandings which have obstructed the deepening of opposition to corruption. For example, some people say that "there is no corruption to combat," others are worried that "opposition to corruption will affect economic growth," while yet others say that "it is difficult to avoid corruption," and so on. B. We must ensure that the activities of party committees and governments at all levels in opposing corruption are capable of increasing the people's faith in the anticorruption activities. We must act in accordance with the guidance by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and "earnestly do some things to show that we are truly combatting corruption and are not just playing." Especially in respect to "major cases," we must not "hesitate to take action" and must not "give people cause to think that we are shielding corruption." We must "call a spade a spade and deal with cases as they deserve to be dealt with, so that we can gain the trust of the masses," and we must "grasp these matters vigorously and speedily and advise the masses of the details." C. We must concern ourselves with the hardships of the masses and truly help them resolve the difficulties in their lives. 4. In accordance with the standard of requiring personnel to have both political integrity and skills, we must place stress on selecting and training successors. Comrade Deng Xiaoping considers this to be a strategic question in doing well in work within the Communist Party and a question of importance to the overall situation. He has pointed out: "A correct political line needs to be guaranteed by a correct organizational line. Whether or not China can handle its affairs well, whether or not socialism and reform and opening up can be upheld, whether or not the economy can be developed a little faster, and whether or not our country can see long-term stability are all questions which, in a certain sense, depend on people." On the question of selecting and training successors, I believe that we must especially uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to select personnel in accordance with the standard that they have both political integrity and skills and that we firmly oppose improper practices in selecting and employing people. The first requirement is a political one. That is to say, these persons must have a firm faith in socialism and communism; they must listen to the party and safeguard the authority of the Central Committee; they must uphold reform and opening up and be able to develop and push forward; and they must be honest, fair, and upright and be able to maintain links with the masses. The other requirement is a professional one. That is to say, they must have abilities, including knowledge, practical experience, and organizational and leadership skills. We must uphold the cadre line of requiring justness and fairness and selecting persons on the basis of their merits. First, we must seek suitable personnel from "all corners of the land" and not just from those who are close to us. Second, we must implement the principle of party management of cadres and not allow a situation wherein a few persons or a single person have the say. Third, we must travel a mass line and not only select people on the basis of the feelings and perceptions of the leaders. "Strengthen the Building of Socialist Spiritual Civilization" by Li Xinliang [2621 2450 5328] In the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, material culture and spiritual culture permeate and promote each other. Both are indispensable elements. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while guiding the whole party to centralize efforts in developing the productive forces, placed great stress on the building of socialist spiritual civilization, making a number of important expositions on this topic. In studying the Selected Works, we come to deeply understand that these expositions by and requirements of Comrade Xiaoping have very great guiding significance in strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new situation. 1. Uphold the dialectics of joint development of material and spiritual civilization. The degree to which material civilization and spiritual civilization have been raised are two major indicators of human social progress. The socialism we want to build is socialism under which material civilization and spiritual civilization see joint development. It is because of this that Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed that we must uphold the policy of grasping with two hands and having a firm grip with both. On this question, for a very long period, we practiced "the omnipotence of the spiritual" and experienced very great suffering. After bringing order out of chaos, people detested empty prattle and respected the seeking of truth; this was undoubtedly progress. However, some comrades went to the other extreme and even abandoned lofty revolutionary ideals and the spirit of devotion. In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions on grasping with both hands, we have learned that, at the same time as upholding dialectical materialism and centralizing strengths in carrying out modernization, we must continually pay attention to strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization. In particular, in the current situation where we are establishing and developing a socialist market economy structure, while building spiritual civilization we must: Strengthen our initiative and bring it into play in a greater way; strengthen the building of party work style and clean government more consciously and firmly punish corruption; employ noble ideological culture and moral integrity in educating and guiding the masses; strongly publicize the spirit of understanding the overall situation, concerning oneself with the overall situation, and daring to devote oneself to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people; and we must advocate advanced ideas and actions, such as taking up cudgels for a just cause and finding pleasure in helping people, and so on. If we assign a high level of importance to this work and carry it out in an earnest manner, not only will it promote the smooth development of reform and economic construction but on the basis of new practice, we will be able to raise the building of socialist spiritual civilization to a new level. 2. Grasping the fundamentals, laying down a foundation and basing ourselves on educating and fostering the people. The basic task in the building of spiritual civilization lies in fostering people. In this respect, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a series of penetrating judgements. He proposed that the basic issue is educating people and that our goal is to produce people who "have ideals and morality and who are cultured and disciplined." He noted that we must use Chinese history to educate young people and stressed that "China's development line established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee will require great efforts if it is to be upheld and, in particular, we need to educate the later generations." We need to seriously implement these ideas by Comrade Xiaoping and shoulder the work of fostering successors to the socialist cause. To do well in the work of fostering and educating people, there are many aspects which need to be seriously improved. For example, in school education, in some areas, there is a serious imbalance between the stress placed on educational attainments and the inculcation of ideological and moral qualities. In some cases, children are, from an early age, kept in special places isolated from ordinary laborers. Also, some cultural publishing houses and mass broadcasting media, in their efforts to gain money, do not question whether something has socialist values or capitalist values. Further, guiding the broad number of young people to study revolutionary traditions and to get close to the industrial and agricultural masses, going deep into social practice and tempering themselves, has long been our way. However, suddenly no one seems to care about it now. If this situation continues to develop, we will not even be able to foster up-to-standard citizens, much less train socialist successors. In accordance with the requirements of Comrade Xiaoping, we must basically reverse this situation. Seen from work guidance by our leaders at various levels, the crux lies in truly overcoming short-term activities in grasping the building of spiritual civilization. Practice has proven that the period needed for fostering and educating people is far longer than the period needed for economic construction and the work is much more arduous. A cadre who is truly responsible to the party must, with the spirit of "taking 100 years to foster and educate people," make due contributions to training successors to the socialist cause. 3. Better implementing the duties of the armed forces in the building of spiritual civilization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always placed his hopes in the People's Armed Forces. In the new historical period, he has repeatedly stressed that the Army must bring into play the old Red Army traditions, uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the Army, uphold the goal of uniting in heart and mind to serve the people, and maintain revolutionary ideals, revolutionary discipline, and the workstyle of arduous struggle. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, as they have seriously implemented these important directives by Comrade Xiaoping, the armed forces' work of building spiritual civilization has never relaxed. However, we must also soberly recognize that some of the negative influences in society will inevitably be reflected in the armed forces. Guiding the armed forces to maintain and strengthen a correct political orientation; to consciously obey the party; to safeguard the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee; to establish a correct view of life and correct values; and to guard against corrosion by capitalism and the various types of decadent ideologies and cultures, are still major tasks facing us. In accordance with the new situation, while grasping the building of spiritual civilization in the armed forces, we must maintain high standards. Our Army, as an armed group for implementing revolutionary political tasks, has a sacred mission to provide security guarantees for reform, opening up and economic construction. This requires that at all times it must maintain a high degree of centralized unity. Thus, at the same time as guiding the armed forces to absorb nutrition through actively participating in revolutionary practice, we must clearly stress ideals, convictions, devotion, and opposition to the worship of money. While establishing a concept of competition which is in accord with the market economy, and urging people to be brave in pushing forward, we must strengthen education regarding the need for the individual to be subordinated to the organization and for the partial to be subordinated to the whole. At the same time as respecting individual material interests and strengthening the concept of results, we must strongly foster noble moral sentiments, including the spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion to public service. We must pay attention to overcoming vulgar exploitation of connections and establish comrade-style links of mutual assistance. In brief, the more reform is deepened, the more we need to use the "five types of revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character spirit of innovation and progress" advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin to educate the troops, so that the armed forces become a university for spreading the revolutionary spirit in the new period. We must use firm and strong action and implement the requirements of the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in that, in building spiritual civilization, the armed forces must walk in the front ranks of the whole society and thereby have the army carry out its due role properly in the building of socialist spiritual civilization.
