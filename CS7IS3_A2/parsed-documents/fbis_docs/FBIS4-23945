How would you sum it up? [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together. Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912. We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the '60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region, including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation movements. We got independence before South Africa and we continued to offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle, but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement. We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa. [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have contributed to a worthy cause? [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt that I have given all my best, because when I speak about coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise. [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms. [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia. Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task, primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this, because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in Rhodesia. [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free and a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power? [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing that the success of one is the success of the other, and we should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit of all in the country. We will not demand that the countries which are more advanced should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big potential of resources. Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard] [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to kill President Samora Machel then? [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight from here, and together with the South African officers who paid the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by officers from the South African defense forces. And there are some who did not believe in change even after the change of government here. There are some who continued giving headaches to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned by government or not, the possibility of having South African security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services, this is a strong possibility. [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile to have signed the Nkomati Accord? [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of all it has decreased the direct participation of the South African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created within the white community in South Africa because they had to judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened, because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the change of tactics of struggle against apartheid. [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and thanks for giving us your time. [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome. [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed, have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be corrected and how will that be corrected? [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services, health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities. We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals, trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen, which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already, the foreign investment, and through all this process we are going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people. As you know we have more than 1 million people who were refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment in some projects but also through these investments we are going to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the training of personnel. The human resources development program is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers in the civil life is very important and again here it's about creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their own projects, their own initiatives. [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your government's position, but why should a South African business person go and invest in an unstable area now? [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We cannot speak about the same amount of instability. In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite mines in which there is a South African company which is participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all away and so the mine is operating without need of special security. It has got the normal security which all mines have and there is a factory there. The people are living in the area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace since October 1992. We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war. I can say there is peace and economic activity has started and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there with big projects. Some other British have investments. South Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so investments are already there. [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques? [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have development. [60-second advertising break] [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the other parties that the government was not satisfied and the government wanted that this question and the other questions which were not answered that they should be addressed, therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and that questions have been answered. If we find that was it someone outside South Africa we will be glad.
