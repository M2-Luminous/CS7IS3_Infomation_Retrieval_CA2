The communique is signed by PDAR Chairman Victor Surdu. Another faxed message, which is signed by the PDAR parliament faction, addresses the following request to members of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies: In accordance with Article 112 of Romania's Constitution, the PDAR parliament faction initiates the procedure of withdrawing the confidence granted to the government by means of a no-confidence motion. Considering the reasons detailed in the censure motion, which presents the current grave situation in agriculture as a consequence of the government's inadequate activity, we express our conviction that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies members of other parliament factions, who have not forgotten those who voted for them, who are as concerned as we are over this situation, and who wish to solve the problems, will second our motion and sign the signature list initiated by our parliament faction, which, for the time being, is too small to accumulate the number of signatures necessary to meet constitutional stipulations.
