About 2,000 super tankers carry oil from overseas sources to India with an average of 18 tankers entering and leaving the country's ports daily. Besides this, the entire oil cargo from Gulf to the Fareast, Australia and Japan passes through India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as it lies astride one of the major oil tanker routes of the world. The responsibility of combating the potential threat of an off-shore environment disaster lies with the Indian Coastal Guards which patrol the country 7,000 km coastline in the eastern and western seaboards. The Coast Guard undertook five oil spill combat operations during the past one year alone and one of its officers told that visiting media persons that "the force has earned recently acclaim for its successful operation in the Andaman sea by tackling the fire and a 40,000 zone spill. The Coast Guard officials claimed that they had also contained the 6,000 tonne oil spill at Bombay high recently which was caused by the burst of a pipeline. Coast Guard Director General, Vice Admiral K.K. Kohli, said that because of the successful anti-spill operations, the Government had designated his force as the "central co-ordinating authority" for combating the maritime spill around the country. The Coast Guard has destroyer skimmers and chemical dispersants like Helo TC-3 to tackle oil slicks in the sea. For containing oil spills, boats are lowered from off-shore patrol vessels. These boats put up oil booms which are inflatable tubes used in the containment of oil. The bombs also limit the movement of the oil and facilitate recovery. As the Coast Guard demonstrated the operation, destroyer skimmers swung into action. This equipment is used to suck oil from oil water interface. Thus the recovered oil is sent to the refinery for re-processing. In another operation, oil-absorbing plastic garline like rope is used top mop up the oil and recover it. When oil cannot be recovered by this process, it can be chemically dispersed by aerial spray by Helo TCS, fixed wing dornier aircraft and surface ship, using spill spray.
