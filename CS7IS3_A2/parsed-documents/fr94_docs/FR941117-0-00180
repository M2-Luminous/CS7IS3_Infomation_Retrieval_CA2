FR941117-0-00180 FR941117-0-00012 Discussion: The sentences in question are not intended to indicate that the costs of office space for Federal program staff must be borne by the States, nor are they inconsistent with other Federal guidance. Costs of space can be charged as indirect or direct costs as appropriate, but Federal funds cannot be used to supplant local funds under programs with statutory prohibitions of supplanting. The last sentence merely reiterates the standard practice that the Secretary approves the budgets of projects supported by grant funds. No changes have been made to this section. Changes: None.
