The opium produced in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, which are known as the Golden Crescent countries, is transported through Turkey to Europe, either through highways or sea ports. The production of narcotic substances significantly increased in the region after the Soviet Union collapsed. For example, the production of narcotic drugs increased by 10 times in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the effort made to place the production of narcotic substances under control in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, which became independent republics after the Soviet Union disintegrated, has not been successful. Nearly three-quarters of the narcotic drugs used in Western Europe come from the Golden Crescent countries and Central Asia. The narcotic substances produced in the Golden Crescent countries and Central Asia are smuggled into Turkey in three ways. The first is the route from southern Afghanistan, which crosses through Iran and reaches Turkey. The drug traffickers also use the authority vacuum in northern Iraq as an opportunity to smuggle their narcotic substances into Turkey. The second route is the sea ports. Narcotic drugs are transported from the Golden Crescent countries to Karachi in Pakistan. They are then loaded on ships that carry them to the Mediterranean Sea through the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. The vessel Lucky-S was placed under custody in the Mediterranean Sea for carrying narcotic drugs in 1993. The narcotic substances were loaded on the vessel in Karachi. Officials impounded 14 tonnes of narcotic drugs on the Lucky-S. The vessel Kismetim-1 also picked up a cargo of narcotic drugs in Pakistan in 1993. The crew members reportedly sank that vessel to prevent the police from impounding its cargo. The third route through Turkey is from the Caucasus, a region that has been troubled by internal unrest since the Soviet Union collapsed. Narcotic substances are transported from the Golden Crescent countries to the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan. From there, they are transported to Azerbaijan and Georgia either in ships or in vehicles, which use the highways to the north of the Caspian Sea. The internal confusion in Azerbaijan and Georgia facilitates the activities of the drug traffickers in that region. The narcotic drugs, which are smuggled into Turkey in ships or TIR [Transit Highway International] trucks, are later transported to Western Europe either in similar trucks, which cross through the Balkan countries, or in ships, which call at several ports in the Mediterranean Sea.
