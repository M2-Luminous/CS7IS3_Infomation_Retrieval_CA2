The movement, opposed to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement, says it will continue to work to scuttle the accord. The statements were made by Hamas' spokesman Muhammad Nazal in a telephone interview. He told Quds Press "this and previous agreements are not binding on the Palestinian people, and represent only their signers." These agreements, in our eyes, renounce our people's and nation's rights to the land and sanctitities, as he put it. Nazzal stressed that his movement will resist this agreement with the same intensity it did before it was signed. Hamas will enhance coordination with other opposition Palestinian forces to cope with the challenges associated with the agreement. His movement, he said, will revitalize the alliance opposed to the negotiations with Israel that was instituted months back.
