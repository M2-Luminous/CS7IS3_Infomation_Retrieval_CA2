Both presidents confirmed their will to have the foreign ministers of both countries initial a treaty on neighborly relations. This signing ceremony is to take place on Friday [18 March], during a visit to Poland by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys. President Brazauskas invited Lech Walesa to pay an official visit to Lithuania, and the invitation was accepted. Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister, said in a statement to THE BALTIC OBSERVER, which is published in Riga, that a condemnation of Polish history in the treaty would be absolutely unacceptable to Poland, and that is why a compromise had to be worked out. In Januska's view, Poland is one of Lithuania's most important partners, as well as Lithuania's "door" to Europe. The treaty between the two countries will allow for a free-trade treaty to be signed. After the treaty with Poland is finalized, Lithuania will be able to concentrate its attention on negotiations with Belarus and Russia. But a newly established Social Committee for the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty, which was set up in Vilnius, organized a picketing at the Foreign Affairs Ministry building there, during which the committee demanded that the treaty's contents be made public and that Polish occupation of the Vilnius area be condemned. The committee announced another picketing shortly thereafter in front of the Sejm building, which is at the same time the president's headquarters.
