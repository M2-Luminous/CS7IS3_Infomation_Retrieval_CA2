(SCI), a U.S. corporate affiliate of Waterman Steamship Corporation (Waterman), by letter dated September 15, 1994, requested written permission pursuant to section 805(a) of the Act and Waterman's Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement (ODSA), Contract MA/MSB&hyph;450, to operate the U.S.-flag M/V SULPHUR ENTERPRISE (Vessel), for and on behalf of Freeport-McMoran Resource Partners (Freeport)_a principle phosphate fertilizer producer in the United States_in the coastwise trade of the United States. The requested permission is to amend a previously approved section 805 permission for the M/V NORDIC LOUISIANA. On September 27, 1991, the Maritime Administrator granted written permission, pursuant to section 805(a) of the Act and Waterman's Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement, Contract MA/MSB&hyph;450, for operation of the British-flag M/V/ NORDIC LOUISIANA for and on behalf of Freeport in the coastwise trade of the United States, as authorized by Public Law 102&hyph;100. The permission was for a period of four years, or until a replacement vessels for the M/V NORDIC LOUISIANA, enters service, whichever is sooner. The replacement vessel M/V SULPHUR ENTERPRISE is expected to be delivered on or about September 23, 1994. Because of the short time frame of this notice, one party who expressed an interest previously in this matter will be contacted directly. Any person, firm or corporation having any interest (within the meaning of section 805(a)) in SCI's request and desiring to submit comments concerning the request must by 5:00 PM on September 22, 1994, file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, together with petition for leave to intervene. The petition shall state clearly and concisely the grounds of interest, and the alleged facts relied on for relief. If no petition for leave to intervene is received within the specified time or if it is determined that petitions filed do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will take such action as may be deemed appropriate. In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues are received from parties with standing to be heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence under section 805(a) relative to whether the proposed operations (a) could result in unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusively in the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (b) would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act relative to domestic trade operations. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 20.804 (Operating-Differential Subsidies)). By Order of the Maritime Administrator. Dated: September 16, 1994. Joel C.
