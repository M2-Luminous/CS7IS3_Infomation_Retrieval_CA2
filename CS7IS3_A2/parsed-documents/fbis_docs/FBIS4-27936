Comrade Phan Van Khai, member of the party Central Committee Political Bureau, deputy prime minister, and chairman of the Central Financial and Monetary Council, was speaking on this subject in an interview with the Vietnamese New Agency. Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai gave some insights into the progress made in the financial and monetary field during the first few months of the year. Speaking on attracting sources of foreign capital, the difficulties to be encountered in the financial and monetary field in the last six months of the year, and the approaches to be taken to balance the budget and muster capital for development requirements, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said: The most effective approach will remain increased revenue collection along with economizing on spending. The national conference of the tax sector held in the middle of last May evaluated the potential for increasing various items of domestic tax and levies by 10 percent as compared with the plan for the first half of the year. If the potential for the Customs Sector to increase its revenue collection is taken into account, we will be able to exceed the target by 15 percent. The feasibility for achieving this relies on efforts to exploit the latent potential for increased production and expanded circulation, and for the enforcement of tax laws and the code of discipline for budgetary contributions. An important source for increased revenue collection is export tax which, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the total budget revenue, is a measure aimed at ensuring adequate domestic production. Along with readjusting the export-import tax chart in accordance with a resolution adopted by the National Assembly Standing Committee in late March, it is necessary to step up antismuggling activities more intensively. Not only will we have to fight smuggling at entry-exit points but we will also have to conduct inspections to obtain back taxes from goods which have been illicitly imported without payment of taxes. We must carry out our activities resolutely with appropriate and open steps so the people can supervise the leasing of land or the transfer of land-use rights as well as the shifting of the state-administered housing fund to business. By doing so, not only will we be able to generate a huge source of revenue for the budget, but we will be also able to ensure that these assets are managed and used more satisfactorily, thus overcoming a situation in which assets are gnawed off or abused.
