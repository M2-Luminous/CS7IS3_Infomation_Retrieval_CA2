Shells continued to fall sporadically on the city centre Saturday evening [11 June], causing fires and destroying several houses, after a third ceasefire in Yemen's five-week-old civil war collapsed. The worst-hit areas were Khormaksar near the airport, Mansurah and Ma'allah. A northern spokesman earlier Saturday announced that north Yemen planes attacked the airport in al-Mukalla -- where rebel southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid has his headquarters -- and "caused heavy damage." Al-Mukalla is located 700 kilometers (400 miles) east of Aden. In the Ma'allah district here meanwhile a bomb exploded under a car, wounding three. Southern officials said the "sabotage" had been carried out by "elements of the Jihad fundamentalist movement, who are trying to destabilise the city." Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden as rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away. The north had declared a ceasefire to take effect midnight Friday, proposing a joint military commission to supervise the truce. But southern leaders insisted on international observers, a proposal already ruled out by the north. The south nonetheless vowed to observe the ceasefire and to "act only defensively," but violent artillery duels around Aden continued throughout Saturday. Two other ceasefires have been broken after only a few hours this week, with north and south blaming each other. South Yemen proclaimed itself independent on May 21, four years after North and South Yemen had merged to form a fragile union and weeks after fighting broke out between the two sides. Political leaders in the unified state, at odds ideologically, had never been able to agree on the administration of the country. There was no immediate confirmation of the airport attack, which came hours before southern officials had expected UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla. Brahimi met earlier with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah and with the northern Yemen president, 'Ali Abdallah Salih in Sanaa to promote support for UN Security Council resolution 924 calling for an immediate ceasefire and political dialogue. The north has accused Saudi Arabia of supplying the south with arms from eastern Europe. Here in Aden, running water was restored to some neighborhoods after repairs were made to part of a pumping station shelled last week, city officials said. But electricity is still being rationed and occasional power cuts have plagued the city since its power station was hit Friday. A member of the ruling southern Yemen Socialist Party council, Sa'ib Sa'il, said two standby stations had been put in service to guarantee power supplies. In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety guarantees before unloading emergency medical supplies for the wounded. A Red Cross official told journalists in Aden Saturday that nearly 2,000 soldiers and civilians were being held in detention in north and south Yemen because of the civil war, which he had left thousands dead and wounded.
