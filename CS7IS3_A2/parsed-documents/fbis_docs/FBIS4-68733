This applies also to Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities and regional policy and deputy prime minister. He is, in addition, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES). Sergey Mikhaylovich met with the members of the editorial office and shared his vision of the present situation. [Shakhray] The picture of the situation will be sufficiently full and accurate if it is seen from three positions, three levels: the state of society, then the problems and contradictions of the economy, and, third, how economic interests are superimposed on the political structure. The period of diarchy: the unnatural "cohabitation" in the constitution of two types of power, ended tragically with the events of 3 and 4 October, which we consider an episode of civil war. The state is attempting to "crawl out" of the consequences and to find its feet. Society, however, does not have the immunity to protect itself. The recent elections confirmed that society is in a state of apathy. All the questions of power and economics may be decided within the framework of the Sadovoy Beltway. Enough has been said about the fact that the economy is in profound crisis. From my viewpoint, it resembles a layer cake and consists of three levels linked by a system of communicating vessels. The upper level is the legal economy, and concerning this there are the basic data of the State Committee for Statistics, forecasters use them, and the attempts to form the budget are based on them. Below is the level of the shadow economy, and lower still, the criminal economy. All attempts to do anything at the legal level, to raise taxes, for example, lead to capital flowing to the shadow and criminal "floors." The legal sphere is being squeezed constantly, like shagreen leather. The economic situation is being made worse by regional disproportions. Only 22 components of the Federation "feed" themselves, and the federal budget is sustained on what is produced on these territories, and 67 components are subsidized. The actions of the government, whoever is a part of it, will for this reason consist of maintaining a balance between an austere financial policy and social explosion. Neither the communists nor the patriots nor the democrats (whoever calls himself this) can any longer deny either private property or land reform or attempts to transform the system of administration of the government of the country. Both territorially and politically. [ROSSIYA] What should the government's priority measures be in this situation? [Shakhray] A set of measures to bring financial discipline to bear must be engendered in the government: a reduction in the burden of arrears, the conveyance of funds to the addressees, a fight against the existence of enterprises' parallel accounts. It is necessary to prepare for a change in the tax system and move toward a sharp reduction in the rate of tax. The sole problem whose resolution no one is offering as yet is how to live between point A (the moment when taxes are sharply reduced) and point B (when, on account of this, there is a revitalization of the economy, and the treasury receives the same or even more funds). Currently economics has become a hostage of politics. There is no time for it at the federal level--an unconcealed power struggle is under way. In politics and, through it, in economics also everything is being determined by the struggle of three politico-economic groups, elites. [ROSSIYA] Which precisely? [Shakhray] There are three determining sectors in our economy: the fuel and energy complex, the military-industrial complex, and the agrarian complex. The economic and political interests of millions of citizens and thousands of enterprises are tied up in these complexes. The reflection of this complex combination of three sectors with regional structures in Moscow's corridors of power signifies a complex configuration of the capital's political elite. More than 70 percent of the country's entire finance capital here is concentrated in Moscow, which means the impossibility of the realization of a single serious investment project in any region of Russia without the attraction of these bank resources of Moscow. [ROSSIYA] Things are more or less clear when it comes to the elites. But what position should the authorities adopt in this struggle? [Shakhray] The role of the government, the president, and parliament under such conditions is exceptionally big. They must assimilate the functions of arbiter among these three main groups and their representatives. Unless the Government of the Russian Federation finds a format of ascertainment of the interests of these complexes and ways of resolving the contradictions among them, the situation will become complicated and will periodically signify political cataclysms. [ROSSIYA] As we all know, your party "distinguished" itself by voting in the Duma for amnesty for the Lefortovo inmates. Passions in this connection have not subsided even today. [Shakhray] An analysis of the situation led us to conclude that unless there was a change in the situation, society could become an overheated steam boiler. It was for this reason that the PRES Party consciously voted for the amnesty. Prior to the amnesty, everything had been prepared for shooting in April-May: an ultimatum to the president and resignation of the government, up to and including the power version. The publication of Version 1 was a trial balloon for the elimination of the entire power Olympus for its replacement by a new administration. But society gained a breathing-space. We have time until September-October, I believe. All problems of the sharing of power must be resolved at the 1996 elections. A shorter timeframe would be an attempt to rush to divide up power without the rules of the game having been agreed. [ROSSIYA] Sergey Mikhaylovich, the problem of Chechnya is, evidently, one of the most acute for Russia. The negotiations are proceeding in very contradictory fashion, and there is no way out of this situation in sight, it would seem. What is the situation now? [Shakhray] The sequence of the decisionmaking chain is this: a message of the president, a decree of the government, acts of the State Duma and the Federation Council. A common approach to the Chechen problem for all organs of power has been observed in accordance with this format for the first time. The approach is built on a recognition of the impossibility of a power solution of the question. Then, and primarily, affirmation of the fact of multiple authority in Chechnya. This demands the conclusion that a political settlement of the conflict means negotiations with all real political forces: with Dudayev and with Nadterechniy District and with the Provisional Council and with the illegally dissolved Checheno-Ingush Republic Supreme Soviet Presidium. The subject of the consultations is a treaty on a delineation of authority and terms of reference. The negotiations should begin momentarily, their purpose being the treaty. But signatures to it will only be appended following free elections in Chechnya. If they are held this year, very well, in 1995, certainly. We are not dictating or determining the timeframe. At this time we, I allude to the federal authorities, are prepared to discuss and tackle specific issues. I, for example, am currently dealing with pensions for the citizens of Chechnya. [ROSSIYA] Could it be that this prudent path will not be realized and that separate negotiations will begin once again? [Shakhray] As long as I am working here, I will be responsible for all negotiations. If there is a retreat from this format, I will simply step aside because this would then be deception. [ROSSIYA] How do you evaluate the policy in respect to the Cossacks, does it not look, rather, like flirting? Another state committee for the Cossacks is being set up. A democratic government is attempting to support a public organization whose mission is the restoration of Russia within the 1914 borders, which is not taken seriously. [Shakhray] I know what is making this committee's ears "stick out." It is the manifestation of an amateurish approach, on the other hand, the uncoordinated work of two departments--the Executive Office of the President and the government. State committees may be created only following a recommendation of the prime minister and within the system of executive power. The formation of the above committee by someone else is the promise of a carrot, which will in a week or two be taken away. It is particularly dangerous acting this way in respect to the Cossacks. The Cossacks are 2.5 million people, and with their families, more than 10 million. They are capable in almost any part of Russia of putting together a detachment of 100,000 men within three days. This is a force which could be unconstructive in certain situations. The state should say that the debate as to whether the Cossacks are a "people" or "not a people" is for scholars. The Cossacks are interested in a state from the viewpoint of public service. This is a particular type of public service, military, border service primarily, included. The community is issued land, and when the Cossack goes "to arms," the community works the land for him and supports his family. Land legislation has been drawn up on these matters here also. [ROSSIYA] In order for the concept to become a guide to action, not simply an interesting idea of Sergey Shakhray's, should some documents be signed? [Shakhray] The basic provisions of the concept of official policy in respect to the Cossacks and the assignments pertaining to the preparation of drafts of the corresponding prescriptive enactments have already been signed by the prime minister. There is a Security Council decision. For me the revival of the Cossacks is a good opportunity for the resolution (albeit partial) of a very serious geopolitical problem. Thirty-two million persons reside here at this time between the Urals and the Far East. According to the forecasts, 8-10 million will remain on this entire vast territory by the year 2010. China, Japan, and Korea are looking in this direction. No wars would be needed with such a development of events, territories could "fall away" from Russia of their own accord. If the Cossacks are implanted there along the border--if they are given land free of charge, taxes for them are abolished, and they are allowed to live and work the land--they would thereby strengthen the borders. [ROSSIYA] It is being rumored in the journalist fraternity that your appointment as deputy prime minister was compensation, a counterweight for the departure of Gaydar upstairs, and a new rapprochement with the president? [Shakhray] I do not regard Gaydar as an alternative to myself. I believe that the dependence here is totally different. We have to wait for the allocation of duties. Aside from regional and nationalities policy, the government's interaction with the media and parliament will, possibly, be entrusted to me. I will not ultimately be entrusted with the press--it is too important a sector--but I could perfectly well be entrusted with exchanging abuse in the Duma. I am not about to become involved in wrangling, for that matter, I am of a mind, like the government as a whole, for constructive interaction.
