Chatumongkhon Sonakun said the department is summing up the results of the talks, held in early February, for Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin. Mr. Tharin will discuss several unresolved issues with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen during the APEC meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 19-20 March. The director general said he hoped that a conclusion could be reached and that no more official negotiations would be necessary. Anyway, he realized that it is difficult because there are several sensitive and complicated issues left to be tackled. M.R. Chatumonkhon said these partly came from the failure of Thai officials negotiating with the U.S. side, which demanded more than the Thai could grant. Another problem deals with rigid regulations the U.S. side wanted to put into the protocol, whereas the Thai side wanted something more flexible. A source at the Revenue Department said that there are several points left for negotiations concerning the protocol. He said the United States wants advantages over Thailand, whereas the matter itself is very complicated. A still unresolved important issue is about taxation on benefits. The United States has a special service set up for financing housing loans. The United States defended this as helping people to own homes. Thailand, meanwhile, wanted its BIBF [Bangkok International Bangking Facilities] covered by the double taxation protocol, but the United States disagreed. According to the source, there are unsettled issues concerning copyrights, such as import tax rates of U.S. copyrighted movies for distribution in Thailand. Thailand requested a rate reduction; there was no agreement on this. Anyway, there is no problem about purchasing real estate. The U.S. Government attached importance to U.S.-Thai negotiations on double taxation. The matter was taken up for discussion during U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's visit, and there was an agreement to hold official negotiations as soon as possible. As a result, there were talks in mid- February, but it yielded no clear-cut solution. Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin is expected to discuss the problem with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen during the meeting of APEC finance ministers pending further official talks in early 1994.
