[passage omitted] [Rutskoy] You see, everything that is taking place in our country today is the search for an enemy: Yet another [?document] is thought up, which should be signed and then an enemy should be found yet again, and so on and so forth. This is an agreement between President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Head of Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, Head of State Duma Ivan Rybkin and the Patriarch. They will move to meet one another half way. All the other people who have signed are simply hostages to this system. [Gerasimov] Currently the former vice-president is holding talks with different parties and public movements in order to set up a political organization which would (?make it possible to) start an election campaign for seats in the parliament and the post of president. [Rutskoy] I intend to set up an all-Russian public and political movement. We have already found a formula for this movement by giving it the name of social-patriotic movement. We plan to have registered membership in the movement. The movement will have iron discipline and firm order. We do not need any dissent [inakomysliye] at all in the movement because we have already had relevant experience. Ultimately, the movement's goal is to come to power because without power it is simply impossible to implement the ideas and tasks which we have set to ourselves. [passage omitted]
