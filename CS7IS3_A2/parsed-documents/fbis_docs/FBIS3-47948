The vote was 118 for and 130 against. The voting on the four bills came in an upper house plenary session that opened at 3 p.m. Some members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the biggest force in the seven-party coalition, voted against the package. Other SDP legislators abstained. The SDP members who voted against the bills or abstained are said to be dissatisfied with the bill calling for a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation in elections for the House of Representatives. The exact number of rebellious SDP members was not immediately available. They outnumbered, however, those Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. Although the coalition earlier vowed to seek to revive the package through bargaining at the 20-member consultative Diet body comprising executives from both the coalition and opposition parties, the prospects of such a revival are virtually nonexistent, Diet sources said. In the face of the failure of the package, Hosokawa has a choice of disbanding his cabinet or dissolving the House of Representatives for a snap general election. If he chooses to have the cabinet resign en masse, Hosokawa would most likely quit as premier and another coalition leader would take over the post, analysts said. If he opts for a snap general election, it would be seen as a call for the electorate's judgment on political reform but would, of course, be held under the current system of electing 511 members of the lower chamber through multiple-seat constituencies.
