But such talks must be preceded by an unconditional ceasefire, Ara Saakian, first deputy chairman of the Armenian parliament, told INTERFAX on Sunday. Today both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan are making preliminary conditions, the former pressing for a ceasefire and a certain legal status for itself, the latter demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh withdraw its troops from Azerbaijani territories they occupy, Saakian said. He said Armenia "is building great hopes" on Russia's mediation. Meanwhile, disagreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan last week prevented the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in St. Petersburg from passing an appeal against the imposition of a transport or energy blockade by one Commonwealth state against another. Azerbaijani delegation leader Afiyaddin Dzhalilov insisted that the appeal include a provision for a mechanism for liberating the 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands occupied by Nagorno-Karabakh forces and for bringing back home the more than a million Azerbaijani refugees.
