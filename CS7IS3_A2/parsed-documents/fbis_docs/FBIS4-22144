Cherkasov] [Text] Receiving information about enemy and friendly troops is inconceivable without a clear-cut organization of use of three basic means of transmitting and distributing data on the battlefield -- courier service, landline channels, and radio communications. The rapid development of communications equipment technology, the increase in troop mobility, and the increase in requirements for providing information on a real-time basis brings radio communications to the forefront, with main importance given to radio frequency service [RFS]. However, up to the present it has never been taken into consideration when planning combat operations. It was precisely such a situation that arose at the very start of Operation Desert Shield, when the transfer of units and subunits of the Multinational Forces [MNF] to the area of the conflict began without a general frequency plan -- list of frequencies, time of their operation, callsigns, and procedure for changing them. The lack of a plan was not an obstacle to using the radio spectrum, but command and control of weapon systems and troops depends on strict radio discipline when the density of radio equipment on the battlefield increases. As a rule, the radio frequency spectrum is the property of each government, but the government of Saudi Arabia transferred the right of its use to the unified Central Command [CENTCOM] of the U.S. Armed Forces. At the beginning of the transfer (August 1990), troops arrived in the areas of combat operations without the appropriate equipment and capabilities for recording and allocating the spectrum. Several months were needed to develop procedures and deploy the necessary equipment to allocate operating frequencies among the thousands of radio nets which oversaturated the airways over the territories of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the initial stage, specialists tried to use frequency spectrum management methods worked out during peacetime. They were based on the concept of centralized management: Each frequency is assigned and registered by the center. In this connection, permanent data bases were created which were carefully updated and registered as frequencies were allocated. However, it proved to be impossible to maintain the data base as a result of the constant change of the organization and establishment of the arriving troops and their relocations. The concept of centralized management assumes that the technical characteristics and geographic coordinates are known for each radio and that, for all practical purposes, it is stationary or moves very little. Based on this, a calculation is made of the range of reception and direction of propagation of the radio signal. Next, the static characteristics are consolidated into a frequency plan, the purpose of which is separation of the radio stations in space and by frequency in order to avoid mutual interference. All this is accomplished with the use of highly productive computer equipment. Each branch of the armed forces whose subunits and units arrived in the theater of war transferred its own radio frequency service system. And not a single one was compatible with another. Operational-level specialists had virtually no experience working on the scale of such a large theater. As a rule, they practiced their operations at small exercises (like the Bright Star exercises conducted in Egypt). The number of requests for use of frequencies literally swept over the service. In the initial stage, work came down to accounting for and registration of requests relayed to the Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center of the U.S. Department of Defense (Annapolis, Maryland). But this process, intended for work with stationary communications equipment, cannot in any way satisfy the needs of hundreds of mobile bodies operating close to one another. As a result, the tasks of allocating the frequency spectrum were entrusted to the U.S. Air Force Radio Frequency Service Center at Buzzard's Point, Washington, D.C. Traditionally, the Air Force, which has a large amount of radio equipment, gave preference to the concept of centralized use of the radio frequency service. This was because their air bases are stationary, and the pilots reluctantly agreed to a multiple shift of frequencies and callsigns, which, in their opinion, increased risk during combat operations. The Navy command authorities took this position for roughly the same reasons. However, the dynamics of development of the operation, the changing scope of the battlefield, and the huge number of radios used in the Army and Marines required a different approach. The problems with frequency spectrum allocation began immediately after arrival of the first aircraft with subunits of the XVIII Airborne Corps. The RFS section of CENTCOM Headquarters, which numbered one person, received the first request from the XVIII Airborne Corps on 7 August 1990. By 1 October it still had not been satisfied. Having encountered such a situation, corps specialists were forced to choose frequencies independently for communications. In the words of one operator, life forced them to use unauthorized frequencies. "The command is not disturbed about what frequency you are operating on," he said. "The main thing is carrying out the combat mission. Therefore, I had two frequency lists -- one authorized for use by CENTCOM Headquarters and one chosen by us. We carefully use both, and there were no complications. If the enemy would have been clever, he could have taken advantage of this shortcoming." During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, each branch of the armed forces occupied those frequencies that were best suited for carrying out the missions, totally ignoring the requirements and state of affairs of their colleagues. Actually, there was a total lack of coordination at all echelons -- from the level of the CENTCOM commander to the tactical level. CENTCOM Headquarters tried to solve this problem; however, the strict centralized radio frequency service oriented on peacetime was crushed by the flow of information. The data base of the CENTCOM radio frequency service registered radio equipment by its location, and frequency allocation accomplished from the United States did not at all satisfy the demands imposed by a joint operation of such a scale. Specialists of the 35th Signal Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, arbitrarily allocated frequencies for microwave relay communications, since they did not even have a personal computer for this. A situation developed in which units and subunits of the coalition forces, using the entire existing frequency band, created constant interference for one another, which led to a considerable deterioration of the operating parameters of nets and an increase in work outages. This situation could not exist very long. Temporary measures were taken to correct the situation. CENTCOM Headquarters allocated among subunits blocks of the frequency band within which they themselves accomplished dispatcher functions. Main attention was given to the UHF band (220-404 MHz), the most saturated with stations and interference. It was in this band that tactical-level communications (satellite and "air-to-ground-to-air") are accomplished and data transmission and other systems operate. Despite the urgency of resolving this matter, it took nearly two weeks to coordinate between the bodies of the branches of the armed forces. The greatest difficulty arose when examining the 4.4-5.0 GHz band. Powerful transmitters of troposcatter communications systems and low-power SHF transmitters operated in this band. The lack of a radio frequency service also had a negative effect on waging "electronic warfare." The task of compiling a combined list of forbidden frequencies (on which jamming is forbidden) proved to be virtually impossible. As a result, sometimes there were gaps in conducting electronic warfare operations. Analyzing the results of combat operations, specialists made the following conclusions: 1. Radio frequency service operates at all levels of command; however, frequency management is accomplished in each instance by the operator. 2. RFS should be decentralized and operate in each echelon of transferred troops. The more echelons transferred, the greater the need for decentralization. 3. Officers of the service must possess sufficient skill to understand the requirements of units of his echelon. 4. Up to 90 percent of the frequency allocations should be completed prior to the transfer of troops to a theater of military operations, and the remaining 10 percent should be completed at the destination, but without additional administrative procedures. 5. When using different types of equipment in one band in a limited geographical area, the frequency band must be allocated proportionally in accordance with requirements, for example, for air-ground-air communications, tactical satellite communications, microwave relay communications, and so forth. 6. Allocation of frequency resources must be coordinated with the priorities of the commander in chief for the theater of military operations. 7. Management of the frequency spectrum must be accomplished in an optimum manner and in such a way as to permit joint use of frequencies. 8. In planning, it is advisable to proceed from an overall plan of actions and predict needs that may arise during the course of development of combat operations and when individual operations become complicated. 9. For accurate calculation of the electromagnetic compatibility and mutual interference, it is necessary to have available precise data on the technical characteristics of equipment and order of troop deployment. Despite the fact that today the majority of transmissions in the radio frequency spectrum that are used in the U.S. Armed Forces are encoded, the enemy can still use electronic [ELINT] and communications intelligence [COMINT] assets to determine troop combat formations. The most effective instrument in this struggle is the frequency plan. It serves two goals: It is used as a reference and as a means of communications security. In the latter case, enemy ELINT and COMINT assets are counted by arbitrary assignment of callsigns, regular changing of them, and also changing of operating frequencies. In recent years, the importance of a frequency plan has decreased a means of countering COMINT and ELINT. This is caused by the considerable spread of secure telephone communications at the tactical level and also radio equipment with a low likelihood of intercept; for example, Singars radios with a programmable operating frequency. Now the frequency plan is used mainly as a reference aid. This was graphically confirmed during the course of the operation by U.S. Armed Forces in Grenada. Soon after its conclusion, the commanders in chief in the theater of military operations set the task of creating a unified frequency plan which would include all units and subunits under their command. The National Security Agency [NSA] compiled such a frequency plan for the main command of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic, which was tested in a series of exercises conducted. However, at the start of Operation Desert Shield, after arriving in the area of the conflict, units and subunits subordinate to this command discovered that their frequency plan was not very effective. It turned out to be incompatible with frequency allocations of other commands of the U.S. Armed Forces and the coalition troops, and also with the requirements of the country they were in. They had to create a new frequency plan for operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. More than 10 variants were developed, taking up about 500,000 pages of text. These classified reference books were delivered on military transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia, where they were distributed directly among users. Initially, a question arose as to what kind of a structure the frequency plan should have -- composite to the platoon level or just for the higher echelon (with tactical subunits authorized to develop their own plans). The first viewpoint was adopted, because practically all units subordinate to the commander in chief of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic prepared their own plans with corresponding data bases, and in the event the other solution was adopted, it would have taken considerable time to revise them. In addition, the question of allocating frequencies for the CENTCOM remained unclear. Thus, the composite plan was the only acceptable alternative to quickly solve the problem. Development of the plan was accomplished when the pace of transferring troops to the zone began to build up. On arrival, many units and subunits used the most diverse frequency plans -- peacetime for operating at their permanent dispositions and wartime for transfer to the European zone. (Before the war, a frequency plan intended for use by the U.S. Army in the FRG and certain other NATO countries was the only one formally developed in the Persian Gulf zone). The structure of the frequency plan is quite sensitive to changes in the effective troop strength. Replacements and decisions made at the last minute about leaving individual subunits forced them to make a radical revision of the variant already prepared, and to republish it. Traditionally, frequency plans were compiled on paper in the form of pamphlets, which are then disseminated to the units. However, in the past decade, a question was raised about the creation of electronic equipment for developing and disseminating them directly in the localities independently of central bodies. The main advantage of such a method is its flexibility: The commander of an operational echelon changes the structure of his forces himself and updates the frequency plan in accordance with it. One year before the start of the Persian Gulf conflict, a special commission of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff was created to study this matter. After conclusion of combat operations and an analysis conducted by the commission, it was concluded that before switching to electronic means, it is necessary to have for each commander-in-chief and forces subordinate to him a plan drawn up on paper for operations in an emergency situation. It must ensure deployment of troops within three days and their subsequent operations for three months. Only later is it planned to compile a frequency plan using special electronic equipment. According to the decision of the JCS commission, this may be equipment based on a regular personal computer developed by the U.S. Army under the special program "An Electronic System for Compiling a Frequency Plan on the Battlefield." Dissemination of frequency plans among consumers will be accomplished using NSA data transmission and dissemination networks or magnetic disks. COPYRIGHT: "Zarubezhnoye voyennoye obozreniye", 1993
