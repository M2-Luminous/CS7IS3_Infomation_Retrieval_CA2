Shevelev, chief of the Administration of the Timber Industry of Russia's Ministry of Agriculture and Food, by I. Kalashnikov; place and date not given: "Forest Belt Is a Reliable Bastion"] [Text] Benefactress earth is now in a disastrous state. Its fertility is declining catastrophically owing to the fact that the application of mineral fertilizers has decreased repeatedly. Progressing soil degradation, which is due to the increasing wind and water erosion, ferocious dry winds, and sand encroaching on arable land, aggravates the agricultural situation. As long-term practice shows, green plantings can and should protect fields. However, do we sufficiently engage in afforestation today? What hinders this? How do immediate prospects look? Our correspondent talked about this with Yu. Shevelev, chief of the Administration of the Timber Industry of Russia's Ministry of Agriculture and Food. In order to better understand the role and significance of protective forest plantings--Yuriy Aleksandrovich noted--we should first talk, even if in brief, about the natural and climatic conditions under which Russia's rural workers have to work. These conditions are highly specific and in most regions are not quite favorable for agricultural production. Here are the figures of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Agricultural and Forest Reclamation (VNIALMI). About 70 percent of the country's sown areas are located in hot and dry or in cold and water-logged zones. Deserts occupy almost 14 percent of the areas. More than one-half of the areas under grain crops are located in the zone of periodic droughts. Gullies represent a terrible evil for the plowman. Their total area exceeds 6 million hectares. In all, there are 15 to 30 million hectares of gullied land (according to various evaluations). From year to year the agricultural situation does not get better. Conversely, it deteriorates, because soil degradation is occurring and quite intensively at that. According to specialists' estimates, in the last decades approximately one-fourth of all the arable land available in Russia, owing to wind and water erosion, has lost from 10 to 30 percent of its fertility. A catastrophic decrease in humus--more than 81 million tonnes annually--is observed. It has been estimated that, owing to soil erosion, we lose 400,000 to 500,000 hectares of arable land annually. Saline soil, swamps, and drift sand continue to develop on the most fertile land in the lower reaches of the Volga, the Don, and the Kuban. It goes without saying that the picture is depressing. Forest plantings have always been protectors of fields and crops. To put it more simply, only they can save benefactress earth and bar the way to destructive dry winds, black storms, encroaching sand, and other natural calamities. Apparently, there are quite a few of them--in many regions forest belts intersect fields lengthwise and crosswise. However, they are obviously insufficient. We have 2.9 million hectares of protective plantings, but no less than 14 million are needed. It would seem that there is only one conclusion--to reduce this gap. Life itself and the disastrous state of land, in which it is, demand this. In fact, however, everything is different. For example, last year, out of the 132,000 hectares of protective forest plantings planned according to initial outlines, trees, shrubs, and other plantings have been placed only on 68,000 hectares of the allocated areas. If work continues to be carried out at the same rates, the required 14 million hectares will not be reached even in 100 years. This means that we will not stop the unceasing degradation of arable land. Conversely, it will retake vast new areas from fields. The reason for such a slow development of protective afforestation is known: The crisis situation in the country's economy--more simply, the shortage of funds--affects the course of work. The funds allocated from the federal budget for these purposes are obviously insufficient. Hopes to solve the problem with the funds of local budgets are not being realized. First of all, because local budgets are still small--they are just being formed. However, the problem lies not only in this. Local bodies of power often use even the money earmarked for the establishment of forest belts for other needs, which, from their point of view, are more important. This is due to the underestimate and lack of understanding of the importance of forest reclamation work. The question arises: What is next? How is tomorrow seen? On assignment from the government the state program for the development of agricultural and forest reclamation work in Russia is now being prepared. A large group of scientists and competent specialists of a number of ministries and departments are involved in drawing it up. Undoubtedly, the quite substantial experience in afforestation during past years should have been taken into consideration. Many, especially people of the older generation, remember well with what enthusiasm the planting of forest belts was undertaken in localities soon after the end of the war with the fascist German invaders. Some years trees and shrubs were planted on hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land, gullies, and ravines. During the subsequent period, right up to our days, there were both ups and downs in this work. Some years afforestation was hardly practised--it was abandoned almost completely. Drafting a new important document, we proceed from the fact that the agro-industrial complex and the entire national economy will derive a vast effect from the forest protective work carried out. Specialists estimate that the average annual yield of grain on Russia's fields protected by forest belts increases by 18 to 23 percent, of industrial crops, by 20 to 26 percent, and of fodder crops, by 29 to 41 percent. This promises an increase of many million tonnes in the gross output of grain and other products. Such a yield increase can be obtained if, to the existing almost 3 million hectares occupied by forest and other protective plantings, at least as much is added in the next few years (in the future their area must be increased to 14 million hectares). Such a task is set by the state program for the development of agricultural and forest reclamation work. It envisages the establishment of a completed system of protective forest plantings in the Volga Area, in the central chernozem zone, in the North Caucasus, and on big irrigated tracts of land. Similar measures are to be carried out in especially dangerous regions of the development of water and wind erosion. It will be necessary to block the encroachment of sand and to stop the depletion of meadows and pastures. What difficulties lie in wait for us during the fulfillment of the planned program? The financing of work is problem No 1. We proceed from the fact that, since the control of the catastrophic soil degradation for the preservation and increase in fertility acquires state-wide importance (after all, the program is called the state program), the federal budget should assume the main concern for its financing, at least at the first stage. Of course, this does not mean that funds of local bodies of power should not be attracted. No less than 25 to 30 percent of the performed work should be paid from local budgets. Nevertheless, I repeat, the state budget should be the main source. To shift everything to local budgets means to ruin this work. There is the danger that funds will be used for other purposes--there are sufficient examples of this. Another range of problems is of a juridical and legislative nature. Although fundamentals of both land and forest legislation already exist, numerous questions regulated by nothing arise in practice. The allocation of land for protective forest plantings is the most acute. Who assigns them and in what order? It seems that it is clear: the owner of land--the kolkhoz, the sovkhoz, the cooperative worker, and the farmer. He must allocate land, plant trees and shrubs, take care of them, and so forth. It is also clear that they do this for themselves, for their own needs--forest plantings will protect their crops against dry winds, improve the climatic situation, and, ultimately, repay them with a yield increase. However, they do this, alas, not always. In my opinion, following the example of foreign countries (Canada and the United States), we should adopt regional laws obliging all land users to carry out the entire set of necessary anti-erosion measures on their territory, including the growing and maintenance of protective forest plantings. It is also necessary to financially interest land users in the survival and preservation of forest plantings and to introduce sanctions for the nonperformance or low quality of anti-erosion work and the loss of perennial plantings. We are also concerned by the purely organizational aspect of the matter. That is, how to organize the fulfillment of the planned program in practice better and more efficiently. First of all, it is necessary to preserve forest reclamation stations (there are about 50 of them) existing in localities and not to let them die. Numerous nurseries for the growing of seedlings of future forest belts are under their authority and many different machines for the planting of trees and shrubs and their care are concentrated in them. It is also important to preserve forestry establishments participating in this work. Unfortunately, in order to survive, both forest reclamation stations and forestry establishments often withdraw many of their forces for the performance of various kinds of commercial operations and change their specialization. Of course, this does not exhaust the range of problems connected with measures for the control of land degradation. I believe that it is necessary to restore previously existing forest reclamation services in the system of local bodies of agricultural management. A significant restructuring of sectorial science and of the personnel training system lies ahead. If we do not do this, we will greatly complicate the task of afforestation in the country.
