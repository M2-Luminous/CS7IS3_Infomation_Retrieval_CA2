ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mergers and combinations involving Federal savings associations to implement sections 501 and 502 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). In general, the FDICIA amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) and to the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) ease previous restrictions on conversion transactions, and authorize Federally-chartered savings associations to acquire and be acquired by other depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), subject to specified conditions. The OTS is amending and further broadening its regulations to authorize combinations involving Federal stock savings associations and depository institutions that are not insured by the FDIC. The OTS also is amending its regulations to authorize Federal mutual savings associations to combine with other types of depository institutions provided that the transaction results in a mutual savings association. In addition, the OTS is amending its regulations governing mergers and application procedures to: specify the types of transactions that require only an information filing with the OTS; specify the types of transactions that require OTS approval of a notice or application, and the related time frames, and further clarify and consolidate OTS regulations by incorporating the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement into a single regulation. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin A. Corcoran, Assistant Chief Counsel, (202) 906&hyph;6962, Corporate and Securities Division; Therese L.
