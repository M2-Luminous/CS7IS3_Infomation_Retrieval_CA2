The news conference concludes his visit to Moscow. Here are some details from our correspondent Aleksey Sokolov: [Sokolov] The Bosnian Serb leader recalled at the start of the news conference the dramatic events that had been taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past few weeks. As a result of these events, Russia found itself at the center of efforts to settle the conflict. The Bosnian Serbs, said Karadzic, did not accept the NATO ultimatum. However, it was with satisfaction that they received a message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Currently, 50 percent of heavy weapons have been withdrawn from Sarajevo. The remainder is under the control of UN forces. Karadzic expressed the hope that this would lead to talks that should result in a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Karadzic said he had received the invitation to come to Moscow with joy. He highly praised his meetings and talks with Kozyrev, Churkin, Lukin, Rybkin, and Shumeyko. The role of Russia in establishing the peace in the Balkans is exceptionally great, said the leader of the Bosnian Serbs again. [Unidentified announcer] Tell us please, were any interesting figures, or facts to do with the situation referred to during the news conference? [Sokolov] In my view, the answer is yes. Karadzic said that historically Serbs in Bosnia owned 64 percent of the territory. Now they controlled 72 percent -- that is to say only eight percent of the land in their hands belongs to others. Moreover, Bosnian Serbs are ready to return these territories for the sake of peace. Karadzic spoke of possible concessions and of the need to examine various ways in which territories could be swapped. He agreed that Muslims ought to have a way out from their part of Sarajevo toward their own lands. The disintegration of Yugoslavia was a sad event, said Karadzic. However, since this is the case, it is necessary to establish new borders and strive for an internationally recognized treaty, which would lead to stability in the region. The Bosnian Serb leader stressed he would like NATO and the United States to see his people in a more objective light. NATO and the United States, he said, occupied an anti-Serb position. Replying to a question from a correspondent concerning the content of his conversation with Zhirinovskiy during yesterday's Spartak-Barcelona soccer match, the Bosnian Serb leader said: Football. That is all.
