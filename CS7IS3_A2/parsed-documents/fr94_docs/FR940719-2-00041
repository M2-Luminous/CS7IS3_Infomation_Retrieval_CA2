Market Statement_Pakistan Category 342/642_Cotton and Man-Made Fiber Skirts April 1994 Import Situation and Conclusion U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, from Pakistan reached 139,441 dozen during the year ending February 1994, 66 percent above the 83,893 dozen shipped during the year ending February 1993. Imports from Pakistan increased from 85,441 dozen in 1992 to 119,637 dozen in 1993, a 40 percent increase. During the first two months of 1994, imports of Category 342/642 from Pakistan were 39,497 dozen, double the 19,693 dozen imported a year earlier. The sharp and substantial increase of Category 342/642 imports from Pakistan is causing a real risk of disruption in the U.S. market for cotton and manmade fiber skirts. U.S. Production, Import Penetration and Market Share U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, fell from 7,444,000 dozen in 1989 to 7,181,000 dozen in 1992, a decrease of 4 percent. U.S. production dropped to 6,143,000 dozen in 1993, 15 percent below the 1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, increased from 6,396,000 dozen in 1989 to 6,884,000 dozen in 1992, an 8 percent increase. U.S. imports jumped to 7,386,000 dozen in 1993, 8 percent above the 1992 level. In the first two months of 1994, Category 342/642 imports are up 24 percent above the January-February 1993 level. The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 86 percent in 1989 to 96 percent in 1992 and reached 120 percent in 1993. The domestic manufacturers' share of the cotton and manmade fiber skirt market declined from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1992. The domestic manufacturers' share dropped to 45 percent in 1993, 6 percentage points below their 1992 market share. Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price Approximately 77 percent of Category 342/642 imports from Pakistan during the year ending February 1994 entered the U.S. under HTSUSA 6104.22.0030_Women's knit cotton skirts, entered as part of an ensemble; HTSUSA 6104.52.0010_Women's knit cotton skirts; and HTSUSA 6204.52.2070_Women's woven cotton skirts of other than corduroy and blue denim. These skirts entered the U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable skirts. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements May 13, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on February 1, 1994, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain cotton and man-made fiber textile products, produced or manufactured in Pakistan and exported during the twelve-month period which began on January 1, 1994 and extends through December 31, 1994. Effective on May 20, 1994, you are directed to establish a limit for cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 342/642 for the period beginning on April 29, 1994 and extending through July 27, 1994 at a level of 44,933 dozen 1 . 1 The limit has not been adjusted to account for any imports exported after April 28, 1994. Textile products in Categories 342/642 which have been exported to the United States prior to April 29, 1994 shall not be subject to the limit established in this directive. Textile products in Category 342 which have been exported to the United States prior to April 29, 1994 shall continue to be subject to the Group limit. Textile products in Category 642 which have been released from the custody of the U.S. Customs Service under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1448(b) or 1484(a)(1) prior to the effective date of this directive shall not be denied entry under this directive.
