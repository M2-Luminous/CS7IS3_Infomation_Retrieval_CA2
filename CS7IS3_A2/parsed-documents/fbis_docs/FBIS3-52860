Israel will demand U.S. compensation for expenditures caused by the project cancellation and expects the United States to be accountable for the financial commitments of the IBS [not further identified] conglomerate, which was responsible for establishing the relay station. The cabinet resolution states that Israel has received the U.S. Government's announcement "concerning its request to cancel by mutual consent the 18 June 1987 agreement between the two governments for the establishment of a VOA station in the 'Arava. The Government of Israel will not oppose the request in principle, but in view of the incurred expenses and commitments, the two governments should negotiate an agreement on the cancellation." The cabinet has been advised that cancelling the project may generate lawsuits amounting to tens of millions of dollars by companies that had been slated to build the station, most notably Elbit. There is also the possibility that the U.S. Administration will demand a refund of their $16 million investment in the 'Arava made upon the signing of the station agreement. The cabinet decided to appoint an interministerial team to draft the agreement and negotiate with the Americans. The team will be headed by Brigadier General Re'uven Yardor (Reserves), former project director for the Communications Ministry. The team will be be made up of representatives of the Foreign, Finance, Industry and Trade, and Justice Ministries. [passage omitted]
