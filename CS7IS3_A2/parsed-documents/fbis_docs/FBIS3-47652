"I haven't heard...and don't know," about such a meeting, Fujii told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. He was referring to reports of a German proposal to hold a G-7 meeting in late February. Fujii also denied reports that he would be talking with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday in Tokyo, saying, "I have absolutely not heard of it...I learned of his (Bentsen's) schedule for the first time through newspapers." Concerning a meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Fujii said it will be held in Hawaii on March 18 and 19 as disclosed by Bentsen on Monday. The APEC meeting will be for "exchanging wide-ranging views...and not for negotating policies," he said. Turning to domestic issues, Fujii repeated that the timing and size of an increase in the consumption tax must be included in a package of tax reform bills for cutting income tax. That is the "collateral" for issuing "bridge bonds" to finance the tax cut, Fujii said, reiterating his strong opposition to an issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds. The finance minister has retracted his objection to cutting income tax before raising the consumption tax as a stimulus measure on condition that repayment of bonds is guaranteed. On Friday, disputes surfaced between the Finance Ministry and the Tax Commission over the sensitive issue of tax reform. Kan Kato, head of an advisory panel to the prime minister, told reporters that a simultaneous cut in income tax and increase in the consumption tax rate is "not necessary," apparently opening the way for further objections to such a move by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and some other parties in the ruling coalition which oppose a tax increase. But later Friday, Kato called a press meeting to retract his comments after they drew strong objections from the ministry. Meanwhile, Fujii welcomed decisions by the coalition parties to drop a proposal to use public funds to purchase land as a way to stimulate the real estate market. "I believe the decisions are correct...because the government can't win public support," he said, pointing to the easing of regulations as one of a number of measures and saying his ministry is still studying what actions can be taken. He also rejected any changes in the land tax. (endall) 180219 foad DF131801.007 ym 18/0244
