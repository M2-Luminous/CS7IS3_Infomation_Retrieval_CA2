The basics of the amendment to the Constitution had been set down in the "Unification Treaty" negotiated in 1990 between the FRG and the still extant GDR. According to the legal politicians of the Bundestag groups, the package of laws is to be discussed in the Legal Committee in Berlin on 25 May and adopted by the Bundestag before the summer recess. Speakers of various Bundestag groups regretted that the debate on the Constitution has met with little response by the public. Attendance at the first hearing in the Bundestag confirmed that. Parallel to this first hearing, the leaders and the Bundestag group of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] made their decision on a successor to Education Minister Ortleb, who had resigned, and during the debate Interior Minister Kanther, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) presented a package of laws on internal security. CDU Deputy Scholz and Hamburg Mayor Voscherau, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the chairmen of the Constitutional Committee, paid tribute to the body's work. Scholz said the Basic Law is the "best constitution in German history." The success of the Constitutional Committee must not be measured solely by the number of proposals for amendments. Voscherau said a more intensive debate in a larger body (Constitutional Council) could have done more for Germany's internal unity. However, the chance to contribute to Germany's unity through discussions on the Constitution should not be overestimated. The Constitutional Committee's work also confirmed the quality of the Basic Law in those places where no changes have been proposed. The recommendations of the Constitutional Committee, which have been presented as a draft law by the groups of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], SPD, and FDP, as well as by the Bundesrat, apply to the list of basic laws, the relationship between the Federal Government and laender regarding legislation, as well as to the new structuring of the laender. In order to achieve equal rights of the sexes, the following sentence is to be included in Article 3: "The state promotes the actual implementation of equal rights for women and men and is working to abolish existing disadvantages." Furthermore, the Constitutional Committee agreed on two new regulations on state goals. One refers to environmental protection (in a new Article 20a): "Being responsible also for future generations, the state protects the natural bases of life within the framework of the constitutional order through legislation and, on the basis of law and order, by the executive branch and jurisdiction." Another regulation on a state goal refers to minority protection (Article 20b): "The state respects the identity of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic minorities." In future the self-administration of the communities is "also" to comprise "the basis of financial responsibility." The new structuring of the laender is to require the approval of the Bundestag, following a state treaty and referendums in the affected laender; the unification of the laender of Berlin and Brandenburg is to be made possible in accordace with that. Concerning competing legislation, the rights of the Bundesrat are to be expanded. The framework legislation of the Federal Government for the university sector is to be limited to certain basics (admission, course of studies, exams, university degrees). The Bundesrat's rights to participate in legislation are to be improved by extending deadlines. Mr. Jahn, the constitutional policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU group, made it clear in the debate that his group has reservations about some recommendations of the Constitutional Committee and will probably reject them in the course of further debate. Jahn cited the university sector, where, in contrast to the currently valid laws, the Federal Government would lose its responsibility for the structure and tasks of the universities, for research and university self-administration, as well as for the recognition of university institutions. This might contribute to the German university developing in different directions and might endanger the recognition of university degrees. "German universities would lose their relevance for Europe." Jahn pointed out that the majority of the CDU/CSU group rejected the recommendations on minority protection. Individual minority protection is already guaranteed in the Basic Law. The recommendation of the Constitutional Committee, which goes beyond that, might promote the demand for double citizenship or for a "duty to respect linguistic identity" (e.g. bilingual schools). As the main speaker of his group, former SPD Chairman Vogel regretted the fact that the Constitutional Committee has not been able to agree on more far-reaching regulations on state goals and on plebiscitary elements for the Basic Law. These have been presented as an independent draft law by the SPD group. Vogel called for social state goals (employment, housing, education,and social security), as well as the possibility of a referendum. He recalled corresponding formulations in the Constitution of the GDR People's Chamber, which was freely elected in 1990, and also that such regulations be set down in a number of land constitutions. Jahn stressed that the CDU/CSU group will stick to its rejection of the SPD's more far-reaching demands. Representative democracy has proved its worth. Referendums weaken federalism and devalue the parliament. There is "no reason for a total revision of the Basic Law." In the debate it became clear that the demand that "fellowship [Mitmenschlichkeit] and community spirit" be set down in the Basic Law has a chance of receiving a two-thirds majority. It would be the only amendment to the Basic Law that did not get the required majority in the Constitutional Committee. So far, a legal initiative has been signed by 345 deputies. Vogel advocated it. On behalf of the CDU/CSU group, Jahn said that even though there is no need for action from the juridical point of view on this matter, there may be "legal policy" reasons for it. The CDU/CSU group has deliberately left its options open. FDP legal politician Kleinert expressly said: "Not very much is to be moved." This is required by the respect for the valid Basic Law. The citizen must not be patronized by the Constitution. Deviating from the coalition line, Hirsch advocated plebiscitary elements in the Basic Law; these could counter the disenchantment with policy. On behalf of Alliance 90/Greens, Deputy Ullmann criticized the fact that a referendum on the amended Basic law has been rejected. Germany's unity has not yet been completed. Saxony's Justice Minister Heitmann (CDU) contradicted that, saying that the great majority of GDR citizens wanted the Basic Law, but "not to immediately tinker with and criticize it." Party of Democratic Socialism Deputy Heuer criticized the amendments to the Constitution as insufficient.
