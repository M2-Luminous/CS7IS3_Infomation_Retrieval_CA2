[TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By application filed July 21, 1994, Conrail and CSX, collectively ``applicants,'' seek Commission approval under 49 U.S.C. 11343, et seq. , for Conrail to purchase, lease, and acquire trackage rights with respect to certain CSX lines entirely within Pennsylvania. Conrail will grant back trackage rights to CSX. In Finance Docket No. 32544, Conrail proposes to lease from CSX, for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years, a portion of the Indiana Subdivision from the connection with Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (B&PR), at DC Tower (milepost 0.0 at Cloe) to the connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.74). 2 Conrail also proposes to purchase from CSX a portion of the Ridge Subdivision, from its connection with the Indiana Subdivision at milepost 0.0 to the rail switch into the Keystone electric generating plant at milepost 5.83 near Shelocta. 2 Applicants request that milepost 0.0 at Cloe be changed to milepost 2.0 once the request by B&PR to reopen in Docket No. AB&hyph;39 (Sub-No. 2X), see infra , is granted and the milepost of the discontinuance is amended from milepost 0.0 at Cloe to milepost 2.0 south of DC Tower near Cloe. In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1), Conrail will acquire overhead trackage rights from CSX on the portion of the Indiana Subdivision from its connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6) 3 near Creekside to a connection to be established at a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost 44.7 near Josephine. The trackage rights will be for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years. They are limited to the movement of limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, rail materials, transformers, and coal terminating at Shelocta. 3 Applicants refer to milepost 26.74 rather than milepost 26.6 in Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1). In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 2), Conrail will grant back to CSX trackage rights over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions that are being acquired and leased, for a coextensive period of time. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision are overhead. The trackage rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights are restricted to limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at the Keystone electric generating plant. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating at quarries or mines served by CSX or short line railroads connecting solely with CSX, or originating or transloading on The Three Rivers Railway, B&PR, Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West Virginia Northern Railroad, Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek & Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating on lines owned or leased by Conrail may be transported by CSX in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead trackage rights are restricted to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg and will terminate if CSX abandons that portion of track. Although these trackage rights are sought under agreements with the track owner, and therefore, fall within the class exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), Conrail and CSX seek their approval as related transactions because the trackage rights and the other acquisitions are part of one integral transaction. Conrail will reach Cloe via trackage rights to be obtained for this purpose. Simultaneously with the filing of this application, Conrail filed for trackage rights over a line owned by Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad from the connection with Conrail at Freeport to a connection with B&PR at West Mosgrove 4 and trackage rights over B&PR from West Mosgrove to Cloe. 5 4 Consolidated Rail Corporation_Trackage Rights Exemption_The Pittsburg & Shawmut R.R.
