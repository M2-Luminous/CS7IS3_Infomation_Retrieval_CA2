He also spoke about further steps to be taken in its implementation. Slobodan Nikolic talked to Premier Kontic. [Begin recording] [Kontic] I believe we should not be satisfied with the results that we have achieved so far. They are not definite, they are not final, and they cannot secure the achievement of those strategic goals of the economic stabilization that we have set ourselves. We are currently at the end of one phase -- the reconstruction of the monetary system -- and at the beginning of another phase -- the recovery of the economy, that is, the increase in production -- and parallel to this, certain structural changes. I believe that in the coming period it will be extremely important and unavoidable to maintain the stability of prices and the exchange rate. Moreover, in this context, we have to secure the strengthening of [words indistinct] activity. If I were to pinpoint the basic problem of the economic policy at the moment, then I would define it as revival of production in conditions of price and foreign currency stability. [Nikolic] From month to month, the [words indistinct] is greater and greater. Can we expect this [word indistinct] in the future as well? [Kontic] It is true that in the course of the three or four months since the beginning of the implementation of the program, the rate of increase in salaries and wages was quite rapid and that they have now reached a level that -- in comparison to the social product at our disposal -- is quite serious. According to [words indistinct] salaries have already reached a level of 17 to 18 percent in the social product, which is considered to be the borderline of salaries in the social product. [sentence as heard] Anything that would exceed this level or increase the participation of net salaries in the social product would at the same time mean upsetting the balance that is really necessary to our economic aspirations at the moment. [Nikolic] How do you assess the [words indistinct] incidents that have led to a situation that makes it difficult to adopt laws, for example, the law on companies, and other legislation? [Kontic] The federal government is conducting an independent internal and foreign policy, therefore, it can -- within the authority granted it by the Constitution -- adopt, institute, and implement all policies that are relevant, but it is quite certain that without intense legislative activity by the Assembly, it is very difficult to find the appropriate framework for the federal government's activity simply because we are currently faced with building a new economic and political system, and these are coordinates within which we need to maneuver, particularly if we keep in mind that the old economic system has been transcended, the new one still has not been established. This transition of the economy from one state to another certainly suffers in a certain sense, because the legislative activity of the assembly is not progressing the way we expected it to.
