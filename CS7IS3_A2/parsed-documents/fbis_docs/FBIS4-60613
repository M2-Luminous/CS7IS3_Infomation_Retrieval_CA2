[Begin recording] [Peres] 'Arafat has no legislative authority and no authority to cancel existing laws. So things are published in the newspapers, I would prefer the newspaper reports to also agree with the spirit of the Declaration of Principles. [Golan] What can we learn about 'Arafat and his behavior from this? [Peres] I am not a psychologist, and I do not think I should comment on the person himself. I can only tell you what he told me, namely, that he is facing a very strong opposition and that he is struggling to implement his policy. He told me, for example, that the entire Johannesburg mosque affair transpired during a heated argument with the Iranians, who accused him of proceeding with Israel while the latter is violating the agreement. 'Arafat claims he said that if Israel violates the agreement he will violate it himself, just as Muhammad violated the agreement after the Quraish Tribe violated it. I do not want, however, to serve as 'Arafat's advocate, it is not my duty. I also do not want to hand out grades. I am conducting negotiations rather than dealing with graphological analysis or psychoanalysis. [end recording]
