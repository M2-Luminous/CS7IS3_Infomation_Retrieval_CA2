The head of our diplomatic corps does not see this as a major problem. For this reason, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked him for an interview at the end of his visit to this country. [Buchert] Was it not a political mistake to reduce contacts drastically with Vietnam at the beginning of the 1990's and thus also affect economic relations? [Zieleniec] There was no political decision. Vietnam was simply pushed aside by our interest in other countries, especially Western ones. There was a certain easing off, but now, on the other hand, there are far greater opportunities because this state only reached the stage of more rapid reforms in the past two years. [Buchert] So, this was not a mistake by our side? [Zieleniec] It was determined by developments. I repeat, there was no political decision, and, therefore, there could not have been a mistake. [Buchert] In the wake of their recent visits to Hanoi, for example, Philippine President Ramos, Swedish Prime Minister Bildt, and Australian Prime Minister Keating all left with specific agreements. Why did this not happen in our case? [Zieleniec] You are not looking at the issue correctly. Agreements are only an element of overall relations. Incidentally, agreements will be signed soon. [Buchert] So, neither the Vietnamese nor the Czech side is disappointed by the outcome of the visit? [Zieleniec] On the contrary, the two sides were satisfied. In my opinion, it is better to carry an issue through thoroughly, right to the end. [Buchert] Officials from the Hanoi government spoke with you about the possibility of trading in arms. Were they successful? [Zieleniec] Their military hardware is compatible with ours. This issue, however, was a marginal one, and they came up with it. Therefore, they did not receive an answer, and our response will be a matter for political consideration. [Buchert] The former Federal Government released 400 million korunas as compensation for the Vietnamese working in the CSFR who had to return home early. The money was supposed to be used to aid projects for these people. Apparently, this did not happen. Has anyone been monitoring the flow of these finances? [Zieleniec] This was an agreement between governments and not between the former federal cabinet and individual Vietnamese. We provided the money. According to agreement, however, its fate was in the hands of the Hanoi government. [Buchert] According to polls in the Czech Republic, the Vietnamese are not exactly popular among our citizens. Does this not harm mutual relations? [Zieleniec] If the Czech Republic's citizens could see what the Vietnamese are really like, I think they would change their views. This will in no way harm relations.
