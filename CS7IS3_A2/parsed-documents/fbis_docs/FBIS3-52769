Bhutto, in two different cases of terrorist activities. The accused is currently detailed in Karachi. He had been sentenced by a military court in 1985 for his alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Two FIRs [First Information Reports] had been registered against him at police stations east Cantt [Cantonment] and Faqirabad. The Judge directed the public prosecutor to submit to the court complete record of the cases. In his judgement, the judge wrote that the original judicial file was not received though the same was requisitioned in connection with the present petition and the court was told that the same had been destroyed and not received back from the martial law authorities whereas only the police file consisting mostly of carbon and photostat copies of various documents were submitted. The Judge wrote that a careful perusal of the record submitted to the court showed that the present petitioner (Mir Murtaza Bhutto) was not named in the FIRs in question nor was there any direct evidence against him. Though some of the co-accused had mentioned the name of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, alleging that he gave them training instructions about the explosions, the confessions were in the form of photostat copies while the originals thereof were not available. The court was of the view that in this situation the alleged abscondance of the petitioner had no material, solid and genuine support. The court accepted the application of the petitioner and ordered his release on bail in the sum of Rs. 100,000 with two local and reliable sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court.

"The spokesman recalled that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who has been lodged to Borstal Jail, Landhi, since his arrival after 16-year in self-exile in Syria, had given a notice to the jail authorities about his hunger strike.
