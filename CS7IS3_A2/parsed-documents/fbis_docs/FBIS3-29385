Hosokawa said the five are Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Posts and Telecommunication Minister Takenori Kanzaki and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Two deputy chief cabinet secretaries, Yukio Hatoyama and Nobuo Ishihara, will also become members of the cabinet-level forum, Hosokawa said. The forum will hammer out a package of market-opening measures which will include ways to promote deregulation, imports and investments. It will also include measures to tighten antitrust policies and improve government procurement procedures, government sources said. Asked by reporters when the task force will reach a final conclusion on the package, Hosokawa said "I still do not know." Hosokawa denied that he himself will ask U.S. President Bill Clinton by letter or telephone not to take punitive actions against Japan. Clinton and Hosokawa, who met in Washington last weekend, failed to reach an accord over the trade framework. The president said Wednesday he expects to have policy recommendations drawn up in the next few days to slash Japan's vast trade surplus with the U.S. totaling 50 billion dollars annually.
