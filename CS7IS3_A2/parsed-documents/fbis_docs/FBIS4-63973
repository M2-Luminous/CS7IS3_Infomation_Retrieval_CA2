Speaking today at a conference of leaders of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSK], he set out the main objectives facing the FSK. ITAR-TASS has learned that, among other things, Boris Yeltsin called for greater efforts to forestall interethnic conflicts and a greater drive against organized crime, terrorism, and the drugs mafia. Success in these areas, the president believes, will help to boost the prestige and authority of counterintelligence agents in society. The FSK, Boris Yeltsin stressed, must also safeguard the country's economic security. In order to meet these objectives the security organs must be strengthened, the president believes. Attestation carried out within the FSK has helped to increase their professionalism, he said. Boris Yeltsin expressed hope that counterintelligence agents will cope with the tasks they have been set.
