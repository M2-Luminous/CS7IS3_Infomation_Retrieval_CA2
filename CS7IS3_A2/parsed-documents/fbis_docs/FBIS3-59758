Concrete plans for field trials are being finalized. B-ISDN will be realized and total communication and broadcasting services will be the goal with several trials to begin in 1994. The real purpose is to develop new applications using high speed and wide area networks that will become the 21st century infrastructure. Verification of market needs, and the resolution of legal problems that may arise along with the provision of service will take place concurrently. The experiments will be conducted mainly by the private sector with the support of government agencies such as MPT (Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications). By building high speed and wide area networks, multimedia communication service will be provided to businesses and homes. Led by MPT, plans for multimedia communication service field trials that will be conducted by private companies are reaching concrete levels. Emphasis will be on verification of application development, feasibility of the business, and problem resolution. Experiments will start in 1994 (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Two Experiments In Kansai Area Are Planned To Start In July 1994 At the end of July, equipment specifications provided by the ``Pilot Business Model for New Generation Communication Network'' (Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting) lead by MPT were finalized and plans reached a concrete level. In reality, optical fiber was installed at 300 locations centered around the homes of the nearby Kansai Cultural and Academic Research City. The infrastructure model of total communication and broadcasting service, Fiber-To-The-Home, is to be constructed there. Free from the constraints of extant communication broadcasting systems, a new multimedia communication system for homes will be developed. Thus needs will be determined and at the same time, this project has an aspect of an ``experiment in reform.'' Companies will be recruited and the experiment is planned to continue for 3 years starting from July of 1994. Also, near the Kansai Cultural and Academic Research City, B-ISDN will be constructed. This ``Experiment For A New Generation Of Communication Network Businesses'' aims at the development of business applications and is being actively explored with a possible starting date of July 1994. The purpose is ``to create business opportunities in B-ISDN,'' the project is identified in English as, ``BBCC: Broadband - ISDN Business Chance Creation'' by the Research Institute Of New Generation Communication Networking, that is the main organization conducting the research (headquartered in Kyoto City). One hundred thirty seven companies including communication businesses such as NTT, leading communication equipment makers, home electronic makers, and trading and construction companies are participating in BBCC. Execution of 13 projects is planned. Table 1.

Network based on upgrading a personal computer network. Practical application is assumed in multimedia electronic publishing (distribution of information using video, and receipt of viewersU comments by electronic mail) Experiment With Multimedia Newspaper Also Conceptualized Also the Hyper Network Social Research Institute (headquartered in Oita), a non-profit organization backed by MPT and MITI has been conceptualizing a ``Hyper Network Social Experiment'' that will be conducted in the Oita area. The plan is to realize an electronic newspaper by upgrading the pc communication service quite active in Oita Prefecture by sending images through existing N-ISDN at high speed. The purpose is to develop and provide multimedia communication services, and to resolve various problems such as privacy and copyright violation that may arise in a future in multimedia society. Also vitalization of the area is another big part of the project. This experiment is still in the stage of conceptualization but will be ready for execution beginning in 1994. Plans for new multimedia communication services in various fields are appearing. Key words for these experiments include: B-ISDN for research on a New Generation Of Communication Network Businesses; Fiber-To-The-Home and Experiment In Total Communication and Broadcasting for a Pilot Business Model For New Generation Communication Network. The purpose of Hyper Network Social Experiment is to explore high speed personal computer communication. Two Experiments In Kansai Area Linked Together Although the research on B-ISDN and the pilot model are to be conducted in the same area of the Kansai Cultural And Academic Research City, they were derived differently. The following explains the history of each project. First of all, practical experiments on a new generation of communication network were conducted in April of 1992, and then Promotion of New Generation Communication Network Society (PNES: Headquartered in Tokyo) was formed after MPT issued the permit. PNES decided to conduct its first experiment in Kansai area, thus BBCC was born. On the other hand, the Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting was hurriedly developed since the supplementary budget of Â¥2 billion was granted for the purpose of bringing up the economy. The allocated budget had to be spent within the year, and the organization to conduct the project had to be public corporation. To aid economic recovery, the experiment was needed immediately, and since the PNES was already in existence as a non-profit organization it was selected as the project executor. Thus the experiments on B-ISDN and broadcasting developed separately. However both projects share the same application experiment. BBCC and PNES will conduct the experiments sharing the same equipment at the center and the network. They are currently working out the logistics. B-ISDN Includes Thirteen Projects ``A large high resolution video screen will be built on three sides of a wall, and video, taped at the nearby aquarium, will be projected on the screen creating a space with the feeling of being in the aquarium,'' and ``a computer at an architectural company and a terminal at the customer service counter will connected so that design specifications of a house to be built can be discussed interactively using 3D graphics.'' These are just two of the goals for B-ISDN. ``Keihanna Plaza'' in Kansai Cultural And Academic Research City, and Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara will be connected with optical fiber. Experimental applications of B-ISDN will be conducted by connecting each network access point to a corporate participant. A video studio for high vision images will also be established as a B-ISDN experience corner. Common And Specific Projects Conducted The planned total of 13 experiments is divided into common and specific projects. The common projects will be conducted by 137 companies associated with the BBCC.

Study of Construct model 13.Study of input electronic for creation of method for library an electronic database, search library forming a methods, and database from screen display books, text, methods. pictures, graphics, and maps On the other hand, specific projects will be conducted by the companies that are recruited and will be funded by those companies. Although participating companies have not yet been announced publicly, as an example, communication equipment makers will participate in the study of high speed LANs. The router that interfaces with ATM (Asynchronous Transmission Mode) developed by the participating makers will be established at existing LANs (FDDI or EtherNet), so that actually ATM circuits will be connected and used between LANs. Home appliance makers will participate in projects involving the design and architecture of houses by using interactive computer graphics. Printing companies will participate in projects on satellite electronic editing and printing, and medical equipment makers will participate in the investigation of remote medical treatment. Also for applications aiming at the home market such as electronic catalogs using multimedia, a study will be conducted in which optical fiber connected to homes for the Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting is extended and leased out as an accompanying project. Permanent Virtual Circuits Used In ATM Network The specifications for the ATM network used in this experiment employ PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuits) that requires the registration of a party with an ATM node. The reason why the party is not selectable freely is that the specifications for ATM public network service (signal protocol) have not yet been standardized. Circuits with a physical speed of 156M bit/second are used to access an ATM node from the user's side and for links between ATM nodes. Data from the user's side is divided into an ATM cell with a unit of 53 bytes, then the signal is sent to an ATM network at various speeds ranging from several M to 10's of M bit/second depending on the terminal. Also, at this time the network is divided into a video image group and a communication group. This is because the main concern of the experiment is not placed on technical development but rather on the development of applications. In the video image group, high vision images will be transmitted with digital compression. And the image codec (digital compression, and enlargement device) employs a 150 M bit/second fixed speed rather than the newly developed codec which is a variable rate device. For this reason, the speed of the video image is fixed, and the video image group became separate. BBCC will use this network application, and experiments will be conducted. As the experiments advance, the fee structure of B-ISDN paid by users will become clear. However, quite a few express the opinion that if service is extended to homes, the collection of fees would be difficult unless the service includes not only communication but also a wide range of broadcasting services such as those offered by CATV. Study is still needed to provide the total communication and broadcasting service. New Service With Existing Technology In The Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting On the other hand, in the Pilot Business Model For New Generation Communication Network, CATV broadcasting service (61 channels) and N-ISDN (64k - 1.5M bit/second) will be provided simultaneously on a single optical fiber cable. The homes in the area of Kansai Cultural And Academic Research City will be connected with optical fiber, and research will be conducted. This experiment will be executed using a fund of Â¥2 billion supplemented by the government and Â¥3 billion collected by the private sector. At present, companies are being widely recruited, and an increased number of participants including the corporations associated with BBCC as well as companies outside of BBCC are sought. Foreign companies such as CATV businesses in the U.S. have also been contacted for their participation. In the middle of this coming October, the overall members including equipment makers and participating companies will be finalized. The experiment is planned to continue for three years. Possible Production Of TV Program By Participation Of Audience In this experiment, the dividing wall between communication and broadcasting systems will be eliminated, so that new applications will be developed by integrating communication and broadcasting as a whole, and the feasibility of business development will be studied. Although detailed contents of the experiments are not yet finalized, Table 3 shows the applications that are envisioned. Table 3. Examples Of Pilot Business Model For New Generation Communication Network (Total Experiment In Communication And Broadcasting) Items Contents CATV Service Provide TV programming such as terrestrial broadcasting and satellite broadcasting over several 10's of channels; hi-definition programming; and game software CATV Expanded Service Time shift service (Near-Video-On-Demand) Broadcasting of video software at time intervals Video-On-Demand Search video programs such as movies, music, sports, and news from screen menu. Multiple camera simultaneous broadcasting Provide multiple video channels from a single source (multiple viewing angles for video) Viewer participation CATV TV program to which viewers can call in to participate; the contents of TV program will altered by the viewers votes ;6;1 Hyper Documentation Provide information with high definition video still pictures and text Electronic libraries, art museums, and exhibitions Sightseeing of historic places Memorial stamp data base Electronic catalog shopping Electronic newspaper, living information, electronic encyclopedia Game Transmission Transmission of video game software to home computers; interactive games for users ;4;1 Video Communication Video Conference, and communications by video telephone Home care: medical consultation between hospital and home Video classes: connecting extra class instruction to home Home Office: Telecommuting connecting office and home First of all, as an extended CATV service, it will become possible for TV programs to be seen anytime when viewers desire. Utilizing the merit of multiple channels, Near-Video-On-Demand, by which the same TV program is broadcast on several channels at 30 minute intervals, and Video-On-Demand by which a viewer can request programs at any time from a central location equipped with a video server will be realized. Also for example, the experiment conceptualizes the viewer able to select and switch screen views that are broadcast with multiple video cameras using multiple channels. New applications combining broadcasting and communication will become possible. For example, it will become possible to produce a TV program in which the viewer can participate through telephone or alter the story by voting. Through the use of N-ISDN, remote medical treatment or telecommuting by using TV conferencing and video phone will become feasible. Also, high resolution image and text information may be stored in a still picture database so that an electronic library and electronic catalog shopping become possible. In order to study the business feasibility of these services, a fee structure will be established for each application and the service will be provided to users. Ready Within the Year By Using Existing Technology Looking at the system, the experiment this time employs existing technology and products. This is because the experiment was conceived to stimulate the economy, and immediate execution is needed. Analog video images will be transmitted using optical fiber. The transmission of data will use N-ISDN rather than ATM. The equipment and machines to be used at the center were announced publicly on 30 July. The specifications for the network are based on the system that NTT developed. By using optical wavelength multiplexing technology, analog video images and N-ISDN can be transmitted simultaneously over a single optical fiber. Also, for video image transmission such as CATV, the ``Demand Access Optical CATV System,'' a technology developed by the NHK technical research lab, will be employed. Two hundred fifty out of 300 households participating in the experiment are using the NTT system, and 50 households are based on NHK system. Both system will commonly support 61 channels. Thirty one channels are set for continuous flow video transmission. The remaining 30 channels are allocated for each household to use individually (simultaneous use is maximum of 30 households per system). Either way, control signals such as data to request programming is transmitted to the center via N-ISDN. The difference between the two systems is whether all channels are transmitted to a home via optical fiber (NTT System), or only channels selected by the household are transmitted (NHK System). In other words, the channel selection function will be enabled at either the terminal side, or center side. That difference is viewed as depending on whether the cost can be allocated for the terminal side or center side. Whether the equipment cost is distributed at the center side and terminal side will make a difference in the total cost. In this experiment, the economy of the systems will be studied. Advancement Of Personal Computer Toward Multimedia Electronic Newspaper Although it is at a conceptual stage, the Hyper Network Social Research Lab based in Oita Prefecture is looking toward the experiment to vitalize the local economy. As part of a ``Hyper Network Social Experiment'', the center has tender thoughts of a multimedia newspaper. The concept is that a few minutes of news video can be provided by the existing TV station or newspaper company as the basis for multimedia text or video news. The video is compressed digitally, and then distributed to users via the network from a multimedia news station. Also users can send their comments by transmitting a digitally compressed image to the multi-media news station. Along with the emulation of new forms of news media, as it progresses the experiment also has the purpose of resolving various problems that may arise in a future multimedia society such as privacy and copyright violation. By enabling multimedia, vitalization of local economy is also a goal. Although it is at a conceptual stage at this point, by upgrading the personal computer system, the exploration of pc communication is also under consideration. The area that the experiment takes place, Oita Prefecture, is quite active in personal computer communication (i.e. Toyo-No-Kuni Network). By upgrading the base network to 1.5M bit/second, the communication network is going to shift to the Internet protocol using TCP/IP. For the main network and user circuits, existing communication service will be used. At present, the center is formulating concrete plans for the experiment by studying communication networks, system configurations, and video compression technology. After the cost and plans are finalized, the center would like to start the experiment as soon as possible which will likely be sometime in 1994. Will these experiments be merely a test or lead to commercial use? Corporate participation will be influenced by this factor. For example, if the experiment on communication and broadcasting remains a special test case, then will corporate participants be satisfied? The organization is having a tough time in recruiting companies, and one of the reasons why not many companies so far have shown interest is the uncertain outcome of the experiments. In order to create the incentive for companies to participate, the government must remove the barriers and it must clearly demonstrate the attitude that these experiments will lead to commercial applications.
