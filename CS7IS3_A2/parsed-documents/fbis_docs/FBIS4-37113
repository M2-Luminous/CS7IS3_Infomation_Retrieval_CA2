FBIS4-37113 "drnes117_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Neriya on Resignation as Political Adviser Neriya on Resignation as Political Adviser TA1706082594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 16 Jun 94 p A5 TA1706082594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Amnon Barzilay] [Text] "Intelligence evaluation elements neutralized me in order to distance me from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. One of the methods they used was leaking a series of stories to the media while creating the impression in the prime minister's office that I was the source of those leaks." These remarks were made last night by Dr. Jacques Neriya, prime minister's political adviser, who filed his resignation letter at the beginning of this week. Neriya further claimed that he knows who the senior source is behind the leak that he told the prime minister, in the presence of others, that Yasir 'Arafat is crazy. Neriya further said that the source's identity, protected by the censorship, said the following: "...unlike Neriya, who thinks that 'Arafat is crazy. Neriya should have read 'Arafat's psychological profile, written over a year ago, and should have realized that he is not crazy." Neriya added: "The prime minister was fair enough not make any charges against me, but after I have been charged with so many affairs, I felt that he was keeping his distance, that he is reserved. They said that I am the current source of leaks from the prime minister's office." Neriya said yesterday that he had never made the remarks attributed to him regarding the PLO head. On the contrary, he was in charge of drafting the psychological opinion prepared in the past about the PLO head. Dr. Neriya added that he decided to resign after 20 months of work when he realized that his skills as political adviser are not being properly used by the prime minister's bureau. The fact that his status as political adviser was ignored has caused damage to the public image of the government and the prime minister over the past several weeks. Neriya claimed that the storm regarding Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst could have been prevented had he been consulted on this. Neriya revealed that Police Minister Moshe Shahal, who has been acting as a liaison between the government and the Knesset since Hayim Ramon resigned, has systematically avoided using his services, for reasons unknown to Neriya. "All the information regarding Peres' letter to Holst was presented to me. Had Shahal shown any interest and asked me about the letters to 'Arafat, I would have told him that 'Arafat had received a letter regarding the location of the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. He could have then discussed the issue with the prime minister." [Barzilay] Why did you not bring it to Shahal's attention? [Neriya] Since Shahal was appointed liaison between the Knesset and the prime minister, he sent his aide to me once. Should I be running after Shahal? This is not my job. Ramon used to call me and come to my office whenever he needed information. [end Neriya] Neriya claimed that the restrictions imposed on him, in his status as political adviser, grew gradually. "In the negotiations with the PLO, I was supposed to be an assistant to Major General Amnon Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, as the representative of the prime minister. In fact, I was left out of the circle of consultations. I stayed on as a trouble shooter." The next stage of his reclassification was when classified material stopped arriving at his desk, he said. "I felt like I was an outsider at the prime minister's bureau. They stopped passing information to me. How could I help forming political opinions?" [Barzilay] Why did they neutralize you? [Neriya] National evaluation elements were angry over the fact that the prime minister has a political, civilian arm that could draft political evaluations independently of them. [end Neriya] In the coming days, Neriya will meet Hayim Ramon to work out the definition of his position as the person in charge of the Histadrut labor federation's international relations. Neriya claimed that he has never spoken to Ramon about his political plans or about getting him into the Knesset. [Barzilay] Do you claim you were pushed aside in the bureau? [Neriya] This is probably a matter of style. [Barzilay] Were you the scapegoat of the system? [Neriya] I was the lonely link. I have no organization. My only source of support was Director General Shim'on Sheves, and the prime minister's confidence in me. [Barzilay] Do you believe the security branches are isolating the prime minister? [Neriya] The thing is that they are almost the only element that controls information. [Barzilay] Perhaps the prime minister is held captive by the system? [Neriya] You are using the wrong word. The prime minister works vis-a-vis establishments -- the chief of staff, his deputy, the Mosad, the Shin Bet. I was an irregularity in that context. [Barzilay] Would they not allow a civilian to work with the prime minister? [Neriya] Yes, and in a place like this, if you have no information, you have no power. Preventing me from receiving information was aimed at neutralizing my influence on the prime minister. [Barzilay] Did they harm the prime minister's ability to receive evaluations from you? [Neriya] They first and foremost wanted to harm my functioning and allow the Army to have an exclusive status. How long can you fight? [Barzilay] How do you feel about the prime minister? [Neriya] I love him, I appreciate him, I admire him. I think he is a role model of integrity, openness, and dedication. I learned a lot from him. I was faithful to him. I believed in his path. I have no doubts about the things he did. The problem is that I constantly had to fight for my square foot under the sun, to remind everyone that I exist, that I am here. I found I was an outsider. How long can you be an outsider? [end Neriya]
