Vice-Premier Avtandil Margiani, Aleksandr Kavsadsze, chairman of the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, and Vladimir Zemskiy, Russian Federation ambassador in Georgia, were present at the meeting. The conversation focused on the traditional goodneighborly relations existing between the two neighboring peoples. "If one neighbor is having problems, this affects the other neighbor, if it is happy, the other is also happy," stated the guests from Dagestan. They pointed out that they have always viewed Georgia as a conscientious and peace-loving neighbor. Therefore, no matter what pain is caused to one another by individual excesses, this cannot change the goodwill between our two nations that has become ingrained over the centuries. Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard Shevardnadze spoke at the meeting about mutual support between neighboring republics, which has such importance today during what is a difficult time for all. He emphasized the necessity of emerging from the crisis through joint efforts and by means of restoring old contacts and creating new ones. Dagestan could play one of the decisive roles in the Caucasus, particularly in that big issue that is called the "Caucasian dialogue," added the head of state at the end of the meeting.
