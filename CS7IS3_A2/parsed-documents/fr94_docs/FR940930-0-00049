FR940930-0-00049 FR940930-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 522 Implantation or Injectable Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Progesterone and Estradiol Benzoate in Combination AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Syntex Animal Health. The supplemental NADA provides for reimplantation of the drug combination progesterone/estradiol benzoate in steers fed in confinement for slaughter for additional improvement in rate of weight gain. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jack Caldwell, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Syntex Animal Health, Division of Syntex Agribusiness, Inc., 3401 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, filed a supplemental NADA 9&hyph;576, which provides for reimplantation of Synovex ® S (200 milligrams (mg) of progesterone and 20 mg of estradiol benzoate per implant) at approximately day 70 in steers fed in confinement for slaughter for additional improvement in rate of weight gain. The supplemental NADA is approved as of August 19, 1994, and the regulations are amended in §522.1940 (21 CFR 522.1940) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Section 522.1940(d)(2)(ii)) is revised to read ``For increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency,'' and paragraph (e) is redesignated as paragraph (d)(2)(iv), and it is amended by revising the first sentence and by removing the second paragraph because it has been superseded by enactment of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cometic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval for food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning on August 19, 1994, because the supplemental NADA contains a report of new clinical investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the change in limitations (provides for the reimplantation of steers fed in confinement for slaughter for additional improvement in rate of weight gain) for which the application is being approved. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
