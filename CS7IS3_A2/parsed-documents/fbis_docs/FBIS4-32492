FBIS4-32492 "dreeu123_h_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 HUNGARY Horn Briefs Party on Coalition Pact Horn Briefs Party on Coalition Pact LD2606111994 Budapest Kossuth Radio Network in Hungarian 1000 GMT 26 Jun 94 LD2606111994 Budapest Kossuth Radio Network Hungarian BFN [Text] [Announcer] It will be decided today whether the coalition agreement concluded the day before yesterday between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will be valid. The two parties' chief decisionmaking forums, the MSZP's congress and the SZDSZ's delegates assembly, are to vote on the coalition agreement today, on the basis of the recommendations of the parties' leading bodies. The MSZP congress began a few hours before our broadcast with the speech of Gyula Horn, party chairman and prime minister designate. The reporter is Kata Peli Nagy: [Nagy] The party chairman and the party congress are satisfied with the coalition agreement, which, in the view of the party leaders, they were able to conclude without making concessions on a single principle. Party Chairman Gyula Horn, in a speech of nearly an hour, again highlighted the agreement's historic significance. He said that if the two parties' chief delegate bodies approve it, this will be the first social-liberal government in central Europe -- what is more, between two parties which prior to 1990 were sharply opposed to one another. At the same time Gyula Horn found it worth mentioning the fact that with this agreement it is not the SZDSZ that has rendered the MSZP fit for polite society; it was the voters who gave the MSZP its legitimacy. What is more, it gained an absolute majority. In spite of this, the party offered a coalition to the SZDSZ. There was total agreement with the SZDSZ in that the country must be put onto the path of modernization, while social viewpoints are taken fully into consideration. The agreement has no secret clauses, and even taken as a whole it is a good example. Simply on its own, it is a guarantee that there can be no repetition of a coalition similar to the one in 1990 [between the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Christian Democratic People's Party, and the Independent Smallholders Party], the party chairman said. The coalition agreement, Gyula Horn said, could be a good foundation for a new political culture. The essence of this is that the two parties offer the losing parties reconciliation [megbekeles] and constructive cooperation. The agreement, incidentally, was also received favorably by the international political public, at least according to the party chairman. Concerning international affairs, Gyula Horn said activities which offend the Hungarian minorities beyond the borders would not be ignored by the next government, either. His party considers it inconceivable to have relations with a party that for example defends, and furthermore supports, the [Mayor Gheorghe] Funar type of actions in Cluj-Napoca [Kolozsvar]. Finally, in connection with the government list, Gyula Horn said the cabinet consists of competent [hozzaertoe] people, although it is not easy to find experts for government functions.
