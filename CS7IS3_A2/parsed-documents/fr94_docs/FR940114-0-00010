FR940114-0-00010 FR940114-0-00004 In submitting rules to the Commission under any of Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c), or 1.41(h) through (t), an exchange is required to furnish three copies of the proposal to the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters and one copy to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange. For rules submitted under the provisions of Regulation 1.41(d), an exchange is required to furnish one copy of the proposal to the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters and one copy to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange. Commission Regulation 1.41a sets forth procedures delegating to the Directors of the Divisions of Trading and Markets (T&M) and Economic Analysis (DEA) the authority to make certain decisions regarding rule submissions. Specifically, this regulation delegates to the Directors of T&M and DEA the authority to determine: (1) Whether to remit and not accept for review rules submitted under Regulations 1.41(b), (c) or (d) that do not comply with the applicable submission requirements of those regulations; (2) whether a rule submission submitted under Regulation 1.41(c) or (d) relates to terms and conditions thus requiring prior Commission approval pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 1.41(b); (3) whether rules submitted under Regulation 1.41(c) do not require prior approval under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b) and whether such rules may become effective prior to the expiration of the ten-day period following receipt for such rules by the Commission; and (4) whether proposals submitted under any of the expedited procedures of Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) comply with the applicable provisions of these regulations and, if not, to notify the contract market that the submission is subject to the provisions of Regulation 1.41(b). II. Amendments to Regulation 1.41 The Commission is adopting amendments to Regulation 1.41 that would revise the requirements of Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c) and 1.41(h) through (t) to reduce to one from three the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange must furnish to the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters for rule changes submitted under these regulations. However, with respect to applications for contract market designation, under the amendments the exchanges would continue to be required to submit three copies of the application, including the proposed rules, to the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters. Amendments to appendix A to part 5 of the Commission's regulations reflect this continuing requirement. Also, the Commission is eliminating the requirement that exchanges must submit one copy of rules submitted under Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange. The exchanges would continue to be required to submit one copy of rule proposals submitted under Commission Regulations 1.41(b) and 1.41(c) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange. The Commission has reviewed its procedures for processing rule submissions under Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c), and 1.41(h) through (t), and, as a result of that review, the Commission has determined that the submission of more than one copy of a rule change proposal to the Washington, DC headquarters is not necessary. Moreover, the Commission has determined that, for rule change proposals submitted under Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t), the submission of a copy of such rule to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange also is not necessary. 4 Further, these amendments would diminish the paperwork burden on the exchanges and would reduce costs associated with filing submissions under these regulations. 4 These changes would not affect the current submission requirements under paragraph (f) of Regulation 1.41 regarding temporary emergency rules, where the exchange is required to notify the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters by the fastest available means of communication. A written copy of the emergency rule shall be furnished to the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters and two copies of the rule shall be furnished to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange.
