Negotiations concerning Norwegian membership in the European Union [EU] have been concluded, the cards are on the table, and it is up to the Norwegian people to make up their mind. In the coming debate opponents and proponents will fight over how good or how bad the outcome of the negotiations is. Some will continue to insist that there have been no negotiations concerning the most important items. It is my honest opinion that the negotiated outcome is exactly as expected. The Maastricht Treaty contains precisely the same principles about free access to markets, common prices, regional support arrangements, and the prohibition of special national arrangements that the final agreement between Norway and the EU embodies. That is why the negotiated result should be an important element for any one who wants to make up his mind on what membership in the EU will involve for our country. The negotiated result is the Union's policy realized, it is the Maastricht Treaty carried out, in Norwegian waters and on Norwegian soil. The government entered into negotiations with demands for extensive exceptions and with adamant language concerning fishing quotas and [national] rights. Not on one single point did the negotiators win acceptance for special national arrangements that were at variance with the Union plan. All those positions that were intended to secure national control were abandoned on the way. Otherwise there would not have been a negotiated result at all! In this decisive phase the EU could not hit itself on the head by offering Norway conditions that were contrary to its comprehensive ambitions. The Union had no way of yielding anything as far as the framework in principle was concerned. An independent Norwegian fishing policy or agricultural policy neither can nor will exist any longer, just as the Norwegian sea, and definitely Norwegians' right to their own administrative law or right to govern will be no more. The fishing policy and agricultural policy, monetary policy, and trade policy will from now on be a Union matter and common policy. Our ocean will become a Union ocean and Norwegian fishermen will be Union citizens, in the same way that other fishermen and tailors and office clerks are citizens of the EU. If we do the best we know how, the present quotas and historical rights might last through the year 2002. After that day there are absolutely no more legal, political, moral, or constitutional guarantees for Norwegian fishermen, either outside or inside the Norwegian 12 mile limit. That is why it is a political sleight of hand to use the frictions within the present EU as an example of what the various nations can determine in the future. The fight over voting rules in the Council of Ministers is a fight over the drive and energy of the Union project, not about the direction and the goal. The Norwegian Government, which has warmly embraced the plans for union in the Maastricht Treaty, will logically have to support those who advocate far-reaching majority decisions and a high threshold for the right of the minority to block decisions. Therefore, the only thing left is to state the following: The agreement with the European Union is a document of the greatest historical importance. The government will make our country into a federal state in a forthcoming, strong union. The agreement takes away from us our status as a small, but active participant on the international arena, and makes us live on the fringe of Europe.
