The weapons, which were to be sold to Calabrian and Sicilian mafia families, had been purchased in Switzerland and illegally brought into Italy through the Grison Mountains. A total of 33 persons were arrested following the investigations that started two years ago. The police action, called "Giano," started in the area of Rimini. A group of policemen infiltrated the criminal organization that allowed them to trace the network of traffickers to the top. In addition to the weapons, that also came from former Yugoslavia through Serbo-Croat intermediaries, the policemen discovered 16 kg of pure heroin and two kg of cocaine. They impounded 15 machine guns, eight high-caliber guns, seven pistols, two riot-guns, explosive materials, and detonators.
