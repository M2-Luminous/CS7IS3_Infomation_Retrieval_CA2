FR940817-2-00124 FR940817-2-00071 UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION Investigation No. 751&hyph;TA&hyph;16 Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. ACTION: Institution and scheduling of a review investigation concerning the Commission's affirmative determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473 (Final), Certain Electric Fans from the People's Republic of China (China). SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice that it has initiated an investigation pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. ยง1675(b)) (the Act) to review its determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473 (Final). The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether an industry in the United States would be materially injured, or would be threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States would be materially retarded, by reason of imports of ceiling fans from China if the antidumping order regarding such merchandise were to be modified or revoked. 1 Ceiling fans are provided for in subheading 8414.51.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 1 Although the scope of Commerce's investigation included both ceiling fans and oscillating fans, the Commission found these fans to be separate like products of separate industries and determined accordingly on the question of injury. For further information concerning the conduct of this investigation, hearing procedures, and rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts A and E (19 CFR part 207).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background._ On October 25, 1991, the Department of Commerce determined that imports of ceiling fans from China are being sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of section 731 of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1673) (56 F.R. 55271, October 25, 1991) (an amendment to its determination, modifying the margins according to specific companies, was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 1991 (56 F.R. 64240)); and on December 2, 1991, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 735(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1673d(b)(1)), that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason by imports of such LTFV merchandise. Accordingly, Commerce ordered that dumping duties be imposed on such imports (December 9, 1991, 56 F.R. 64240). 2 On March 2, 1994, however, Commerce published in the Federal Register a revision of its original dumping determination, effectively excluding one of the Chinese producers from the order and reducing the margin for non-specified firms (59 F.R. 9956, March 2, 1994). 2 Following review in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Commerce revoked the antidumping duty order applicable to oscillating fans (58 F.R. 30026, May 25, 1993). On May 4, 1994, the Commission received a request to review its affirmative determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473 (Final) pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1675(b)). The request was filed by Encon Industries, Inc., Fort Worth, TX. On June 10, 1994, the Commission requested written comments in the Federal Register (59 F.R. 30036) as to whether the changed circumstances alleged by the petition were sufficient to warrant a review investigation. On August 10, 1994, after reviewing comments received in response to that request, the Commission determined that the alleged changed circumstances were sufficient to warrant a review investigation. Participation in the investigation and public service list._ Persons wishing to participate in the investigation as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's rules, not later than twenty-one (21) days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register .
