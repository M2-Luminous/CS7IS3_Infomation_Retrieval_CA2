A presidential order said today that the Russian Government, or the Federal Executive Power Institution, will have four deputy prime ministers, including two first deputy prime ministers. The new government will have 23 ministries and seven other state commissions and federal bureaus, including the Federal Broadcasting and Television Bureau. Yeltsin had earlier asked Chernomyrdin to present a plan on government reshuffle before January 6, for discussions in the new parliament when it opens tomorrow. But Chernomyrdin failed to do so because of differences among the cabinet members over the set-up of the new government. Therefore Yeltsin decided to take on the task by himself. The present Russian Government has nine deputy prime ministers, including three first deputy prime ministers.
