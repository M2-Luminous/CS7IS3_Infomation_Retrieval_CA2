FR940705-2-00178 FR940705-2-00091 Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;e&hyph;(1). Announcements of RAC meetings and agendas at least 15 days in advance (NOTE_If the agenda for a RAC meeting is modified, ORDA shall make the revised agenda available to anyone upon request at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting); Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;e&hyph;(2). Proposed Major Actions to the NIH Guidelines (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)) at least 15 days prior to the RAC meeting; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;f. Serve as the focal point for data management of NIH-approved human gene transfer protocols approved under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2 and registered with NIH/ORDA as required under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;g. Serve as the executive secretary of the RAC; and Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;h. Maintain a list of Major and Minor Actions approved under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;3 and a list of experiments registered with NIH/ORDA as described in Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7. Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;4. Other NIH Components Other NIH components shall be responsible for certifying maximum containment (BL4) facilities, inspecting them periodically, and inspecting other recombinant DNA facilities as deemed necessary. Section IV&hyph;D. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines As a condition for NIH funding of recombinant DNA research, institutions shall ensure that such research conducted at or sponsored by the institution, irrespective of the source of funding, shall comply with the NIH Guidelines. The policies on noncompliance are as follows: All NIH-funded projects involving recombinant DNA techniques must comply with the NIH Guidelines. Non-compliance may result in: (i) suspension, limitation, or termination of financial assistance for such projects and of NIH funds for other recombinant DNA research at the institution, or (ii) a requirement for prior NIH approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects at the institution. All non-NIH funded projects involving recombinant DNA techniques conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receives NIH funds for projects involving such techniques must comply with the NIH Guidelines. Noncompliance may result in: (i) suspension, limitation, or termination of NIH funds for recombinant DNA research at the institution, or (ii) a requirement for prior NIH approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects at the institution. Information concerning noncompliance with the NIH Guidelines may be brought forward by any person. It should be delivered to both NIH/ORDA and the relevant institution. The institution, generally through the Institutional Biosafety Committee, shall take appropriate action. The institution shall forward a complete report of the incident recommending any further action to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. In cases where NIH proposes to suspend, limit, or terminate financial assistance because of noncompliance with the NIH Guidelines, applicable DHHS and Public Health Service procedures shall govern. Section IV&hyph;E. Voluntary Compliance Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;1. Basic Policy Individuals, corporations, and institutions not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to do so by following the standards and procedures set forth in Sections I through IV. In order to simplify discussion, references hereafter to ``institutions'' are intended to encompass corporations and individuals who have no organizational affiliation. For purposes of complying with the NIH Guidelines, an individual intending to carry out research involving recombinant DNA is encouraged to affiliate with an institution that has an Institutional Biosafety Committee approved under the NIH Guidelines. Since commercial organizations have special concerns, such as protection of proprietary data, some modifications and explanations of the procedures are provided in Sections IV&hyph;E&hyph;2 through IV&hyph;E&hyph;5&hyph;b in order to address these concerns. Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;2. Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval It should be emphasized that employment of an Institutional Biosafety Committee member solely for purposes of membership on the Institutional Biosafety Committee does not itself make the member an institutionally affiliated member. Except for the unaffiliated members, a member of an Institutional Biosafety Committee for an institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines may participate in the review and approval of a project in which the member has a direct financial interest so long as the member has not been, and does not expect to be, engaged in the project. Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(4) is modified to that extent for purposes of these institutions.
