This probable enemy of Russia is, as it turns out, Ukraine. Since the article mentions our center and refers to the results of our "secret" (classified) sociological research, we want to clarify some points and make the "secret" open. Thus, the Scientific-Practical Center of Political Psychology at Ukraine's Academy of Pedagogical Sciences (until quite recently, it was attached to the Institute of the Psychology at this Academy) has actually prepared and conducted a large-scale poll among Ukraine's citizens living in different regions of the country. From the very beginning, this research was not secret. The preliminary and final results (not all, because even up to now they have not been analyzed in full) were many times publicized in the media (in the press and on the radio) and presented at a scientific conference. In addition, the research was carried out on our own initiative, according to plans of scientific work, and not as "Kravchuk's assignment", as it was stated for some reasons by the authors of the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article. We were amazed by the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA passage stating that from 50 to 80 percent of population in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions "support unification with Russia or transfer to Russia's jurisdiction." In fact, the direct question whether Ukraine should be independent was answered in the affirmative by 60.5 percent, with 18.4 percent undecided, and 21.1 percent opposed. These results come from the entire Ukraine. In three eastern oblasts (without Donbass) -- Dnipropetrovska [Dnepropetskov], Zaporizka, and Kharkivska, 49.2 percent of votes supported the independence, 18.5 percent were undecided, and 32.3 percent were opposed. In two Donbass oblasts -- Donetska [Donetsk] and Luhanska, the vote distribution was 40 percent, 22.9 percent, and 37.1 percent respectively. In the southern oblasts -- Mykolayivska, Odesska, and Khersonska, the support for Ukraine's independent status proved to be still more stronger: 52 percent voted "yes", 23. 5 percent remained undecided, and 24.5 percent voted "no." Even in the Crimea, the situation does not looks as it was presented by the authors of "independent expertise" -- Ukraine's independence was accepted by 37 percent of those polled and opposed by 31.5 percent, while 31.5 percent remained undecided. We would draw attention of these respected "experts" to one more fact. The idea that Ukraine will overcome its crisis only if it is divided into federal lands (here is a suitable opportunity for the transfers to Russia's jurisdiction!) was accepted by 8.9 percent of those polled throughout Ukraine. Now, we will present the responses of residents of those regions which "are striving to escape Ukraine for Russia." In the three eastern oblast, this opinion was accepted by 16.9 percent of citizens (unaccepted by 46.9 percent); in Donbass -- 12.1 (51.7); in the south -- 6.9 (62.8); and in the Crimea -- 3.7 (53.7). Thus, even if the Crimean sticks by to its poll results, it is not the way, in which some would like to do. Still, from where have our unknown "colleagues" collected such "interesting" data? It is possible that they interpreted -- in their original way -- the fact that Ukraine's participation in the CIS economic union was supported by 58.4 percent of those polled, in particular, in the east -- 69.8 percent, in Donbass -- 83.2 percent, in the south -- 74.8 percent, and in the Crimea -- 81.5 percent. If one identified the CIS with "the single and indivisible" [Russia -- words in quotation marks in Russian], one would conclude that not only the south and east, but entire Ukraine is striving to embrace "elder brother," whereas the referendum on 1 December 1991 was only an unpleasant misunderstanding. Is this not the point of which KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA "independent experts" were trying to convince us?
