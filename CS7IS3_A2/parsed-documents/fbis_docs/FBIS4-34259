Thorbjornsen: "Great Faith in Peace in Guatemala"] [Text] The tone was optimistic, and trust in peace was strong when the two sides in the Guatemala conflict met in Oslo yesterday. "I am expecting progress, and I am also expecting that the negotiations on the two topics that are up for discussion will be completed," UN peace mediator Jean Arnault said before the representatives of the government and the guerrillas in Guatemala began their negotiations behind closed doors in Oslo yesterday morning. How is Guatemala to handle its settling of accounts with the past? This is the most tricky aspect of the whole process, and it is the issue which the two sides will try to resolve in the course of this week. There will also be discussion of new settlements for those who have been driven from their homes -- people whom the civil war has made refugees in their own country. "If we find a solution to these issues, this will open the way to reaching our goal," Arnault said. The goal is the signing of a peace agreement before the end of the year. Agreement on this was reached in Mexico in January when a timetable was drawn up for how month by month the various conflict issues would be dealt with. Later this year there will, for example, be discussion of the identity and rights of the aboriginal population, the distribution of land, the strengthening of the civilian state, the place of the army in a democratic society, and the integration of the guerrillas into political life. None of these questions is easy to solve, and the settling of accounts with the past and the countless brutal breaches of human rights is the most difficult question of all. The figures are uncertain, but it is safe to say that at least 130,000 people have been killed and 40,000 have disappeared. The aim is to set up a "truth commission" which will look into what has happened, and it is revelations regarding its role in massacres and purges that the military machine fears most of all. The armed forces have claimed the whole time that they do not see the need for a truth commission. Kirkens Nodhjelp [Church Emergency Aid] in particular has played a role as a bridge-builder and helped to get the army to agree to negotiations on this sensitive issue. In his welcome speech to the envoys, Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said that Norway is ready to make its contribution to guarantee the economic base for the peace process. He also stressed that peace is more than the absence of war, and it can only be created by the parties themselves. The leaders of the two delegations both stressed how important it is that a truth commission be set up. "Clearing up the past opens the door to the future," said Dr. Hector Rosada, the government chief negotiator. The leader of the guerrilla group, Carlos Gonzalez, said that it is important not only to investigate breaches of human rights and to prevent new breaches taking place, but also to punish where this is necessary.
