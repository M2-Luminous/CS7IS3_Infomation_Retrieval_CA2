Will Sergey Stepashin Occupy the `Rickety' Chair?"] [Text] General Golushko's resignation has long been awaited -- ever since the reorganization of the Security Ministry and even earlier -- immediately after the 3-4 October events when the security bodies were charged with passivity. Still the action came as a surprise. The firing of the recently appointed Federal Counterintelligence Service director can hardly be linked to the arrest of the Ames couple in the United States. They worked for the Foreign Intelligence Service. (In response to a request to comment on the arrest of a Russian agent in the United States, Viktor Zorin, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service's Counterintelligence Operations Department, advised that we turn to the Foreign Intelligence Service). It is most likely that Golushko's resignation is closely related to [General Prosecutor] Kazannik's resignation. Noteworthy in this respect is a memorandum by presidential security adviser Yuriy Baturin pointing out that the Duma has issued an act of pardon and not of amnesty, thereby intruding into the president's jurisdiction. This memorandum carried an endorsement by Yeltsin himself to Kazannik, Yerin, and Golushko to act in accordance with instructions. Yerin and Golushko are directly concerned with the "instructions:" Lefortovo is a Security Ministry prison and it is now in the process of being transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is being suggested that Golushko refused to prevent the release of the inmates. At an emergency conference on 25 February with Yeltsin, attended by Kazannik, Ilyushenko, Yerin, and Baturin, the Federal Counterintelligence Service chief was not present. Apparently dark clouds were already beginning to loom over him. According to some reports, prior to signing the edict on Golushko's resignation, Yeltsin had a talk with him whereupon the rapid "resignation with no comment" followed. The edict does not even indicate the reason for Nikolay Golushko's departure: It was not until a little later that "family circumstances" were brought up as a reason.
