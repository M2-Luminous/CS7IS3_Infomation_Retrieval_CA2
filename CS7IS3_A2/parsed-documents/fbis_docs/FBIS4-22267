Moscow Will Most Likely Not Support This Action"] [Text] An accident involving a supertanker carrying fuel that occurred in the Turkish Strait of Bosphorus last Sunday has made topical the issue of ensuring safety in the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Previously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey made a statement that an increase in the intensiveness of transportation in the straits will pose a real threat to Istanbul and its 10 million residents. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from sources in the Turkish Government that a document strictly regulating procedures for the passage of ships through the straits will take effect 1 July of this year. In keeping with this document, which consists of 59 points, all tankers passing through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles will have to notify the Turkish authorities about entering the straits in advance and have to pay duties, the volume of which will depend on the size of the tanker. It is envisioned that in the event that the length of the tanker exceeds 150 meters, all traffic in the straits will be stopped for four to five hours. This will unavoidably result in a disruption of shipping and the forced layover of dozens of vessels. Naturally, the company-owner of the supertanker will have to defray all material costs entailed by this. It is believed in Ankara that firm restrictions of this nature are a forced step in order to contain the intensiveness of shipping, which has recently increased sharply. Moreover, as soon as a few years after the beginning of the development of the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan fields, about 30-40 million tonnes of oil will be carried through the straits annually, which will sharply increase the scale of ecological catastrophe should yet another accident occur. The document prepared in the Turkish Government should be, in a way, a warning signal to neighboring countries that are considering the possibility of transporting oil through the Turkish straits. This concerns, in particular, three countries--Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. The Russian side is trying to convince Baku and Alma-Ata [Almaty] of the need to deliver the produced oil to the port of Novorossiysk, from which oil supertankers will transport it to the Mediterranean, naturally, through the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. In turn, Ankara proposes to consider the possibility of building an oil pipeline which would run through Turkish territory. Azerbaijan verbally supports the Turkish plan. However, the apprehension in Ankara is that Geydar Aliyev will not be able to withstand pressure from Moscow on this issue. Several days ago, Vakhid Alekperov, president of the Russian oil company Lukoyl, visited Baku; in the course of negotiations with the Azerbaijani company Sokar he stressed that materialization of the Russian project promises considerable economic advantage. It appears that Kazakhstan has already made its choice in favor of the Russian project. Besides, according to information from confidential sources in Ankara, Moscow has already secured support from the U.S. Administration with regard to its oil transportation project. Restrictions on the movement of tankers in the straits to be introduced by Ankara directly affect the interests of a consortium of Western oil companies that will soon begin the production of oil in the region. It is easy to foresee that Western companies, which are interested in the lowest outlays on transporting oil to Europe, will hardly want to pay duty for supertankers to enter the Turkish straits. So far Moscow has been silent about the intention of the Turkish Government to restrict the movement of tankers in the straits. Apparently, at Smolenskaya Square they have so far been analyzing the results of the recently completed visit to Ankara of a technical group of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs headed by Yakov Ostrovskiy. A source in the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that in defining its position, Moscow will proceed from the Convention on Banning Restrictions on Shipping in the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which was signed in 1936 in Montreux. The Russian side may accuse Turkey of violating this international document. Ankara will respond to this accusation as follows: "Yes indeed, the Montreux convention establishes a free navigation regimen in the straits. However, the whole issue is that in 1936, when this document was signed, the large-size tankers we have now did not exist. Besides, the notion of using the straits to ship millions of tonnes of oil a year was not contemplated at that time." Therefore, the dispute may become protracted; with regard to this issue, a lot will depend on which side the West and the United States support.
