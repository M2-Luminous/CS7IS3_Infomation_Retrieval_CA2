FR940620-0-00127 FR940620-0-00029 As with ADAAG 9.1.3 (Sleeping Accommodations for Persons with Hearing Impairments), some dwelling units are required to be accessible only to persons with hearing impairments. Where possible, consistency with HUD's section 504 regulation is preserved. HUD's regulation requires that an additional two percent of the dwelling units be ``accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments.'' See 24 CFR 8.22. Comment. The NPRM requested comment on the percentage of roll-in showers that should be required. In addition, the NPRM asked whether the requirement for roll-in showers in residential housing should parallel the provision for transient lodging found in ADAAG 9.1.2. The majority of the commenters supported a requirement for roll-in showers. While some commenters such as the City of Pasadena, California suggested that most persons with disabilities do not prefer roll-in showers, commenters in support of requiring roll-in showers noted that roll-in showers allow greater independence and may be used by a wide range of persons. A few commenters raised concerns that roll-in showers might cause water damage if improperly drained. Suggestions for scoping ranged from no scoping to one hundred percent of the accessible units in a facility. Most of those who recommended roll-in showers supported requiring 25 percent of the accessible dwelling units have roll-in showers. Regarding whether the scoping should parallel that for transient lodging, there was clear consensus for applying the requirement for roll-in showers to facilities with fewer than fifty dwelling units. However, a number of commenters noted that a facility having one single-family dwelling unit should not be required to provide a roll-in shower. Response. The guidelines do not apply the requirement for roll-in showers to facilities having only one or two dwelling units. Doing so might cause these facilities to be less desirable to persons who have a need or preference for a bathtub. In a facility with more than two dwelling units, requiring a roll-in shower to be provided in only 25 percent of the dwelling units complying with ADAAG 13.2.1(1) means that a facility must have more than 80 dwelling units before a second roll-in shower is required. For example, a facility with 81 dwelling units is required to have five percent accessible units, which is five. Therefore, of these five accessible units, 25 percent, or two, must have a roll-in shower. The provision is similar to ADAAG 9.1.2 (Accessible Units, Sleeping Rooms and Suites) in that only very large facilities are required to have more than one roll-in shower. It differs in that the requirement for at least one roll-in shower applies to smaller facilities. As for the issue of water damage caused by improperly drained roll-in showers, roll-in showers can be designed, installed, and maintained without presenting such drainage problems. Comment. The NPRM asked whether a provision for bathtubs complying with ADAAG 4.20 should be included. The NPRM also asked what percentage of a facility's accessible dwelling units should contain such bathtubs. There was no clear consensus among commenters regarding the need for accessible bathtubs. Percentages suggested by commenters ranged from zero to fifty. A number of commenters noted that bathtubs are particularly useful to persons needing to immerse joints and muscles. A very few commenters suggested that the guidelines require a particular adaptable tub which can be made into a roll-in shower. One commenter pointed out that adaptable dwelling units which are covered by the Fair Housing Amendments Act are likely to have bathtubs. Response. Experience suggests that roll-in showers are not provided unless they are required. Where roll-in showers are not provided in accessible units, accessible bathtubs or accessible shower stalls are required by ADAAG 13.3.2(11). Further, adaptable dwelling units covered under the Fair Housing Amendments Act are likely to have bathtubs and are required to have support for grab bars. Therefore a specific scoping provision for bathtubs is viewed to be unnecessary. Comment. The NPRM asked whether basing the minimum number of accessible dwelling units on the number of dwelling units in each ``facility'' is the most appropriate means of determining an adequate level of accessibility. A very few commenters recommended that each building in a facility or on a site should have accessible units. Most commenters recommended using ``facility.'' Some preferred ``site'' because they believed that use of that term would affect dispersion of accessible dwelling units giving the designer more flexibility in determining the location of required accessible dwelling units within a facility. A few commenters recommended scoping according to dwelling units owned by a State or local government and used for a specific program. Most of these commenters were concerned that scattered site single-family housing which is used for certain social service programs such as residential group homes would be required to be one hundred percent accessible. Although many noted that they did not oppose such a scoping requirement for new construction, they were concerned that accessibility requirements, when applied to renovated or existing housing, would be cost prohibitive. Response. ADAAG 3.5 defines ``facility'' as ``[a]ll or any portion of buildings, structures, site improvements, complexes, equipment, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or personal property located on a site.'' The term ``site'' is defined at ADAAG 3.5 as ``[a] parcel of land bounded by a property line or a designated portion of a public right of way.'' Given that these definitions are so similar, there is no rationale for departing from the use of ``facility'' when referring to buildings on a single parcel of land. A change from ``facility'' to ``site'' would not affect the dispersion of accessible dwelling units.
