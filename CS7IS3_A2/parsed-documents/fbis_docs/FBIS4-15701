Here we offer our readers an interview he gave to Andrey Pravov, RIA-NOVOSTI's correspondent in Islamabad. [Pravov] In your view, Mr. Chairman, what role could Pakistan play in resolving the issue of settling the situation in Tajikistan? [Rakhmonov] We regard Pakistan as a friendly state. Islamabad is keen to offer assistance in resolving problems relating to a peace settlement in Tajikistan. We welcome any initiatives on this issue, which is of vital importance to us, wherever they originate -- from the United Nations, Moscow, Tehran, or Islamabad. We are being offered help and we gratefully receive it. Quite apart from anything else, this approach has an entirely pragmatic basis. Central Asia, and Tajikistan in particular, is an inexhaustible market for Pakistani products of every kind, including industrial goods. Pakistani businesspeople are also attracted here by the richness and diversity of our raw material resources. On the geographical level, moreover, Pakistan may be viewed as an extremely important transit route for shipment of goods from Central Asian states to the sea. [Pravov] But, of course, in order to establish such extensive ties, surely you will have to settle the situation in Afghanistan first of all? [Rakhmonov] This is true, of course. The continuing war in Afghanistan is an extremely serious problem for both our states. But, as far as a land transit route from Tajikistan to Pakistan and back is concerned, it may be realizable in the not too distant future. Basically, our two countries' borders are just 19 km apart in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast's Ishkashimskiy Rayon. The most likely route linking our two countries across Afghanistan is probably the so-called Vakhan Corridor. This is the gateway to the Karakoram triangle -- the area where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India meet. [Pravov] Do you think that land transit toward the Arabian Sea could be established even if hostilities continue? [Rakhmonov] Afghanistan must resolve this problem in any case. If it does not, we are unlikely to see any trade or economic projects materializing in the region as a whole. Moreover, the conflict is also dangerous because the conflagration of war could spread across state borders, not just those of Tajikistan. It seems to me that Pakistan is just as well aware of this as we are. [Pravov] However, from time to time we see hints in the press that certain circles in Pakistan are supporting the armed Tajik opposition in Afghanistan and are even encouraging its actions on the border. How do you view these reports? [Rakhmonov] If such circles in Pakistan exist, they are irresponsible circles. Attacks by detachments of gunmen on our border posts represent a clear manifestation of terrorist activity. The problems that exist between various political forces in Tajikistan cannot be resolved by force of arms. We are relying on negotiations. This is one of the reasons why we came to Pakistan and I clearly note that we have found complete understanding here. Moreover, what is happening in Afghanistan cannot be approached with double standards. It is clear to everyone that the groupings of gunmen on this country's territory answer to nobody. They constitute a real danger not just for Tajikistan. This sort of behavior is dangerous for everyone in the region. [Pravov] Mr. Chairman, since we have already spoken about the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, I would like to dwell on this problem in more detail. Do you think it likely that the coming spring will bring new and more serious problems for the border posts guarding this border? [Rakhmonov] Some time ago the armed opposition spoke about its intention to launch a spring offensive against our border. But it seems to me that their plans are unrealistic. The armed detachments of Tajik oppositionists do not have sufficient strength for this. And the groupings of Afghan mojahedin that support them will soon be embroiled in fighting one another -- seizing territory and carving it up into spheres of influence. Moreover, our border, thanks to the common efforts of certain CIS countries, has been reliably reinforced; it is also being defended by military units from other former USSR republics, now independent states, which rightly understand that the Tajik-Afghan border remains our common border and that we must defend it together. [Pravov] From time to time we see articles in the press indicating the dangers of Moscow getting "embroiled" in Tajikistan. It is alleged that in many ways Russia's actions are a repetition of the former USSR's mistakes in Afghanistan. Indeed, some points of similarity can already be seen. What do you think about these parallels? [Rakhmonov] I see fundamental differences in the two situations. First and foremost, unlike the USSR and Afghanistan in the early 1980's, until quite recently Russia and Tajikistan were part of the same country, and we have extremely close ties to the Russian people. It is not just a matter of extremely close economic and cultural ties. There are many mixed marriages. There are a number of Russians living in Tajikistan. Our states have now gone their separate ways. But many Tajiks, and Russians too, continue to believe we are still part of a whole -- whether it be with Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan. And all of us still have a common southern border -- that of the former USSR. Another radical difference from the Afghan situation is this: If you remember, once Soviet troops had been sent into Afghanistan, neither Kabul nor Moscow showed any intention of meeting with the leaders of the mojahedin groupings or holding talks with them. They relied on force. However, we favor resolving our problems with opposing forces of a different political orientation by peaceful means. And in this respect Russia fully supports us. [Pravov] Do you think the issue of finding a settlement to the situation in Tajikistan is making any headway? [Rakhmonov] Undoubtedly. First and foremost, the need for a peace settlement in the country is accepted by practically all our neighbors. And they are prepared to help the Tajiks talk to one another. We realized this once again during our present visit to Pakistan. It is clear that today everyone in the region is keen to see peace in Tajikistan, and there is no military way of resolving our problems.
