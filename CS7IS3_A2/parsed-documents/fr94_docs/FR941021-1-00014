FR941021-1-00014 FR941021-1-00003 ยง247.7 Certification and internal agency control. (a) A FedSelect check is not a check drawn on the United States Treasury. However, where the drawer of a FedSelect check is the United States, the requirements and procedures for disbursing and certifying activities under 31 U.S.C. 3321 apply to agency accountable officers issuing FedSelect checks. (b) FedSelect checks shall be drawn by an individual who is duly authorized by the agency, and shall be certified by a certifying officer. (c) When an agency issues a FedSelect check in payment of a United States obligation, such agency certifies the issuance of the payment contemporaneous to the issuance of the FedSelect check. Therefore, where FedSelect checks are issued through an automated system, certification occurs through the on-line data transfer between the agency issuing a FedSelect check and the FMS. (d) Agencies shall ensure that there are proper internal controls over the issuance of FedSelect checks, including payment authorization, check issuance, and reconciliations. Payment authorization is the process by which vouchers or invoices are approved for payment by individuals designated to do so by the head of the agency, or their designees. Check issuance is the physical issuance of a FedSelect check in payment of a duly approved voucher or invoice. Reconciliation is the process by which amounts authorized for payment are verified against amounts of checks issued. ยง247.8 Presentment. (a) Presentment of FedSelect checks must be made to the payor Reserve Bank. FedSelect checks must be presented through normal banking channels. (b) FedSelect checks may have different periods of payability depending on the agencies' requirements. The standard period of payability will be 90 days. However, at the request of an agency to the FMS, the payability of a FedSelect check may be increased to 120 days. (c) FedSelect checks shall bear a pre-printed legend, ``Void After 90 Days,'' or ``Void After 120 Days.'' (d) When an outstanding FedSelect check reaches its stale-date, a cancellation indicator will be placed against it and its status reflected as canceled due to stale-dating. A payor Reserve Bank will refuse to pay a FedSelect check presented to the bank of first presentment more than the number of days stated on the FedSelect check. A FedSelect check not timely presented should be surrendered by the holder to the payor Reserve Bank as a non-cash item. The issuance of another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen, or destroyed FedSelect check must be made in accordance with ยง247.10.
