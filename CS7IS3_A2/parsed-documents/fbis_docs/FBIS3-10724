Authorities raided a home in Las Delicias neighborhood where they reportedly found several pamphlets urging cooperation with the rebels and planning intimidation and extortion projects for various area businessmen. Seemingly, the ELN militia in Bogota would try to force people to contribute money, which would guarantee their security." [no beginning quotation mark as published] Three people were arrested in the operation, in addition to the seizure of Venezuelan arms and ammunition, as well as the pamphlets. Authorities increased operations to try to break up the ELN plan and at the same time guarantee the fulfillment of a proposal by Ciudad Bolivar militias, who offered to demobilize and get their members to rejoin civilian life the way militias have been negotiating in Medellin.
