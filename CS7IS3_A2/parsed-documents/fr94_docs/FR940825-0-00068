FR940825-0-00068 FR940825-0-00014 For the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that demonstrate attainment, the emissions reduction progress made between the SIP submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (46 days beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The de minimis timing differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations (see 57 FR 13539). For such areas that demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards. 5 5 Section 189(c) of the Act provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.'' However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment. This SIP demonstrates attainment by December 31, 1994 and maintenance through December 31, 1997, satisfying two milestones. Therefore, the submittal satisfies the quantitative milestones currently due. Accordingly, EPA is approving the SIP for Pinehurst relative to the quantitative milestone requirement. Finally, once a milestone has passed, the State will have to demonstrate that the milestone was, in fact, achieved for the Pinehurst area as provided in section 189(c)(2) of the Act. 6. PM&hyph;10 Precursors The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10, also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). The filter analyses (chemical mass balance) indicated that, on average, less than 4 percent of the PM&hyph;10 mass was comprised of secondary particulate on high concentration days. EPA believes that this is an insignificant portion and, therefore, is proposing to grant the exclusion from control requirements authorized under section 189(e) for major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area about precursor contribution to PM&hyph;10 NAAQS exceedances, this finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by IDEQ and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) of the CAA and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions are set forth in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et. al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the CAA).
