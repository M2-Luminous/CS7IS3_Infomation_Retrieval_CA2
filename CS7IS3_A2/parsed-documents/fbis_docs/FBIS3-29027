FBIS3-29027 "dreas031__s94029" FBIS-EAS-94-031-S Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 SUPPLEMENT Thailand: Government Praises U.S. Decision Surin, Foreign Ministry Comment BK0502092594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 5 Feb 94 p 1 BK0502092594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday hailed US President Bill Clinton's removal of 30-year old trade sanctions against Vietnam as a move that would benefit Thailand and the region. At the same time, Mr Surin acknowledged that the return of US business to Vietnam would have some repercussions on Thailand. He did not elaborate on the repercussions, but said they should serve to prompt Thais to "pay more attention' to economic developments in the region. "Thailand will benefit from economic development in Vietnam," he said. "The region is a free market. The emergence of Vietnam in the market system will enable the region to develop trade, investment and tourism ties," he said. A Foreign Ministry statement said the removal of the US embargo would not only improve the "atmosphere" between the US and Vietnam but also foster economic development in Vietnam and the Southeast Asian region. The Foreign Ministry's East Asia Department director-general, Don Pramutwinai, said better economic conditions expected to come with the removal of the US embargo are unlikely to lead to political liberalisation in Vietnam. It was a "matter of theory" that people enjoying better living standards would demand political freedom, he said. In reality, the situation in Vietnam was different because the Communist Party remained firmly in charge of the country, he said. The party recently made clear that it would retain the existing system, indicating that political and economic policies were working, he said. "If existing conditions in Vietnam are suitable for the country, why should they be changed?" But the future of communism in Vietnam depended on economic developments in the world at large and Vietnam's response to them, he said. Vietnamese people were unlikely to demand political change "because they have been under strict control," he said. Vietnam learned from pro-democracy protests in the Soviet Union and China where there were demands for political reform after economic improvements. Demands for democracy and human rights in Vietnam were more likely to come from the United States, he said. "If the Americans don't make the demand, no one else will," he said. Another official said that better economic conditions would improve Vietnam's access to the outside world, and this might lead to demand for change especially among Vietnamese in the southern part of the country. The southerners were previously in contact with the West and, with a better economy, might demand political change, he said. The official cited the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tienanmen Square in Peking in 1989. But he noted that Vietnam's Communist Party was "more hardline" than that of China and that it remained unpredictable how Hanoi would adjust to any demand for political change. Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat said the removal of the US embargo would help ease tension in Southeast Asia. Economically, Lt [Lieutenant] Rawi warned that Thais would have to work harder because there would be competition in the cheaper labour market in Vietnam. Another official pointed out that there would also be competition for Thailand in terms of US capital and technology. "Thai businessmen must work harder because other investors from the US have big money and high technology needed in Vietnam," the official said. "Our investors have the edge only in terms of experience in some, not many, sectors." The entry of US business into Vietnam would lead to more systematic economic development of the country, he said.
