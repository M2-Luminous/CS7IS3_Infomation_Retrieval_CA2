The increase was the highest in five years, and helped machinery exports account for 7.85 percent of Taiwan's total exports last year, up 7.2 percent from 1992, the association said. It added that the importance of the machinery industry to Taiwan's economy has been increasing noticeably thanks to continuously growing exports. Market dealers attributed the eye-catching performance by the industry to the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and the successful exploitation of the mainland Chinese market by local machinery manufacturers. They quoted customs tallies as saying that Taiwan sold US$2.43 billion worth of machinery to Hong Kong last year, with most of that being transshipped to Mainland China, an increase of US$928 million, or 61 percent, from 1992. Excluding exports to Mainland China, export volume grew by only US$128.3 million, or 3 percent. The mainland market was the top export market for the machinery industry last year, absorbing as much as 37 percent of Taiwan's machinery exports. The United States took US$1.14 billion, or 17.2 percent, of Taiwan's machinery exports, and Thailand, US$36.6 million. But the growing presence of Taiwan-made machinery in Mainland China is also a clear indication that the reliance of local machinery makers on the mainland market is increasing and that the mainland fever among Taiwan business people has not eased despite the government's call for market diversification, industry sources said.
