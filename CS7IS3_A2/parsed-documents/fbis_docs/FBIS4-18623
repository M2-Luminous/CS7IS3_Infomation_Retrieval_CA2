FBIS4-18623 "drweu068cc_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-068 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 INTER-EUROPEAN AFFAIRS EFTA Countries Fail To Meet EEA Information Deadline EFTA Countries Fail To Meet EEA Information Deadline PM0604161494 Oslo AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 5 Apr 94 p 24 PM0604161494 Oslo AFTENPOSTEN Norwegian BFN [Yngve Hellestol report: "Norway Receives a Reminder Over EEA Rules"] [Text] EFTA's [European Free Trade Association] oversight body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], has sent reminders to Norway and most of the other EFTA countries that are members of the EEA [European Economic Area] that they have not complied in full with the rules on information contained in the EEA agreement. According to the EEA agreement, all EFTA countries must see to it that national legislation is in line with the EU [European Union] directives which apply in the single internal market. In total there are around 460 EU directives that have to be fitted into national legislation in the individual EFTA countries. It is EFTA's oversight body (ESA) in Brussels which has the task of checking that countries actually adjust their legislation. Each individual EFTA country has an obligation to send information to the ESA about new legislation enacted and to enclose the text of new legislation. When the deadline for sending in this information ran out on 7 March, only Sweden of the EFTA countries had complied in full with its obligation to provide information. Norway, together with the other EFTA countries, was still lagging behind. These countries had provided about 90 percent of the information they are obliged to provide. The ESA, therefore, has set a new deadline for 30 April. ESA president Knut Almestad told AFTENPOSTEN that in formal terms there has been a breach of the EEA agreement, since the countries have not sent in the information they are obliged to send. If the missing information has still not been sent in by 30 April, the ESA will have to give thought as to how to proceed with the matter -- and consider whether or not there has been a violation of the EEA agreement. "A possible step thereafter would be to bring the matter before the EEA court," he said. Almestad also stressed that the EFTA countries have done an impressive job in introducing a large number of EU directives in a very short time -- directives the EU countries themselves have adopted over the course of many years. He said that the ESA will now go through all the material it has received to see whether the adjustments to legislation that have been made in the EFTA countries bring national legislation into line with the EU directives. The EFTA oversight body (ESA) was set up as a result of the EEA agreement. The task of the ESA is to check that the EFTA countries meet the demands and follow the rules contained in the EEA agreement. Just under 100 people work at the ESA in Brussels, and the body is headed by Norway's Knut Almestad.
