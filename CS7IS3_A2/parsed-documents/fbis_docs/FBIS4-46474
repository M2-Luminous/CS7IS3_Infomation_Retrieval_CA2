To do that, you need to enter one of the higher naval schools. If you have not yet been promoted to the 9th grade, you can become a student of Nakhimov School where young men from 15-16 years of age are accepted (you must reach your 15th birthday during the year of matriculation), have state of health that is suitable for study at military schools and desire to become a Naval officer in the future. The mandatory condition -- is study at an English language school. Parents or individuals who substitute for them submit requests for acceptance to Nakhimov School by 1 July. The documents required to do that are completed through rayon military commissariats (city military commissariats) at the place of residence. Among them are: the entrant's personnel request addressed to the head of the school; the parents' request which states that their son will continue to study at a naval school after graduation from Nakhimov School; an original certificate of birth; a medical examination by a military medical board under the rayon military commissariat (city military commissariat) at the place of residence; and, a progress report card for the first three study quarters (the candidate submits the original education certificate upon arrival at the school), which must mandatorily indicate which foreign language was studied; a school reference; information from the parents' work location or the residence location on the composition of the family and, in the case of the absence of either of the parents or of a divorce -- a copy of the death or divorce certificate. Those persons permitted to take the entrance examinations receive a summons that gives them the right to request travel documents at the rayon military commissariat to the place of residence. Upon arrival at the school, young men undergo a medical examination, a physical fitness test, and take competitive entrance examinations on the Russian language (dictation) and mathematics (oral). The term of study at Nakhimov School when matriculating after the 8th grade is three years. Upon completion of the school, graduates (without examinations) are sent to higher naval schools for further study. The school's address: House 2/4, Petrogradskiy Naberezhnaya, P-46, St. Petersburg, 197046. Russian Federation male citizens who have a middle education are being accepted at higher naval schools: from among civilian youth who are 17-21 years of age; compulsory service military personnel and those soldiers who have been released into the reserve who are under 23 years of age; and, army and navy warrant officers upon expiration of two years of service in the positions of army and navy warrant officers and officers, and also compulsory service military personnel who are up to 24 years of age.

The following is attached to the request: three certified 4 x 6 cm photographs (without headgear); an autobiography; a reference from the place of work, study or service; a copy of the middle education document (middle school students submit information on their progress at this period of time). The graduate personally submits a passport, birth certificate, military service card (or residence permit) and an original middle education certificate to the acceptance board. A special medical examination of candidates is conducted beforehand at military commissariats. Military draft boards carry out their selection to naval schools from among civilian youth prior to 25 May. Matriculation of candidates who meet acceptance conditions is conducted based upon the entrance examinations. As a rule, this is Russian language and literature (written), mathematics (written), and physics (oral or written). Servicemen and young men from among civilian youth, who have been awarded a gold or silver medal upon graduation from middle school or who have received diplomas with distinction upon graduation from middle special educational institutions or middle professional-technical school, take one examination on the profiled discipline. Upon receipt of a grade of "outstanding", they are released from having to take further examinations and, upon receiving a grade of "good" or "satisfactory", they take examinations on the remaining disciplines. The term of study at higher naval schools is five years. Cadets are under full state support. They are annually provided two-week winter holidays and also a month-long summer leave. During the period of leave, they are provided with free transportation to the location where the leave is spent. All cadets who have passed state examinations and who have defended their graduation thesis (project) are awarded the military rank of "lieutenant" and are handed a higher education diploma and the prescribed badge. Having received a lieutenant's ceremonial dagger and shoulder boards, you will become a part of the glorious Naval officers corps.
