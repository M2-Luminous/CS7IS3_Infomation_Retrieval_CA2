FR940106-2-00053 FR940106-2-00033 Health Care Financing Administration [BPD&hyph;778&hyph;PN] RIN 0938&hyph;AG28 Medicare Program; Special Payment Limits for Home Blood Glucose Monitors AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Proposed notice. SUMMARY: This notice would establish special payment limits for standard home blood glucose monitors, identified as code E0607 of the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). This proposed notice is intended to prevent excessive payment for these items. Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home blood glucose monitors and other items of durable medical equipment (DME) is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the fee schedule amount for the item. This notice proposes that payment for standard home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge or a special payment limit.

Special Reasonable Charge Limits Payment for DME furnished under Part B of the Medicare program (Supplementary Medical Insurance) is made through contractors known as carriers. Before January 1, 1989, payment for DME was made on a reasonable charge basis. The methodology used by the carriers to establish reasonable charges is set forth in sections 1833 and 1842(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and in 42 CFR part 405, subpart E. Reasonable charge determinations are generally based on customary and prevailing charges derived from historic charge data. The reasonable charge for an item of DME was generally set at the lowest of the following factors: •The supplier's actual charge for the item. •The supplier's customary charge. •The prevailing charge in the locality for the item. (The prevailing charge may not exceed the 75th percentile of the customary charges of suppliers in the locality.) •The inflation indexed charge (IIC). The IIC is defined in §405.509(a) as the lowest of the fee screens used to determine reasonable charges for services, supplies, and equipment paid on a reasonable charge basis (excluding physicians' services) that is in effect on December 31 of the previous fee screen year, updated by the inflation adjustment factor. Section 1842(b)(3) of the Act requires that all payments under Part B of the Medicare program must be reasonable. Paragraphs (8) and (9) of section 1842(b) of the Act provide that we may establish a special reasonable charge limit for a category of service if, after consultation with representatives of affected parties, we determine that the standard rules for calculating reasonable charges result in grossly deficient or excessive charges. Applicable regulations are located at §405.502(g). Section 405.502(g) requires that we consider the available information that is relevant to the category of service and establish reasonable charge limits that are realistic and equitable. The limit on the reasonable charge is an upper limit to correct a grossly excessive charge or a lower limit to correct a grossly deficient charge. The limit is either a specific dollar amount or is based on a special method to be used in determining the reasonable charge. Section 405.502(g)(1) provides the following examples of circumstances that may result in grossly deficient or excessive charges: •The marketplace is not competitive.
