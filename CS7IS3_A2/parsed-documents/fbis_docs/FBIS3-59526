The first move has been made with the announcement of a merger between Alsys (French branch) and IGL Technology; the latter is a Syseca affiliate dedicated to software (product sales and consulting) and a long-time exclusive distributor of IDE tools (including the famous STP, Software Through Pictures), as well as being now involved in marketing Centerline and McCabe products. The industrial group has made numerous software acquisitions in the past four years or so. In 1989, it started off in style with Atherton (and its Software Backplane structure), definitely purchased in the spring of 1991. In September of the same year, Alsys became part of the group, organizationally linked to Syseca, but it was clear that as a result of its international status, the Ada specialist would quickly become the group's spearhead in the marketing of software products outside France. This was confirmed the following year with the merger of Alsys and Telesoft, ranked third on the Ada market. Today, Alsys has an annual turnover of 227 million francs. This result is comparable, on the software market, to those achieved by CGI with Pacbase.
