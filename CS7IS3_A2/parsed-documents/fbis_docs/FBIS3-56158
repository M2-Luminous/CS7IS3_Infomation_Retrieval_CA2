Nazarbayev made the statement finishing his stay in Uzbekistan. On Wednesday [12 January], the last day of his visit to the neighboring republic, the president saw ancient Central Asian towns of Khiva and Samarkand where he was accompanied by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Nazarbayev saw the architectural sights, met representatives of regional authorities and ethnic Kazakhs. The presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan signed in Tashkent Monday night a treaty on creating a single economic space between the two republics. The document provides the removal of customs barriers on the border between the two countries, free migration of people and movement of goods and services and the creation of a legal basis for the joint development of communications and transportation. Addressing the news conference, Nazarbayev spoke about the need to create a similar economic union. He said that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have always favored economic integration and denounced self-isolation. In conditions of circulation of equivalent national currencies, the idea should become a reality, he said, and added that talking in private the two presidents favored equal partnership excluding any forms of dictate and hegemony.
