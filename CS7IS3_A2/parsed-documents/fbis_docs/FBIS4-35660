During this meeting, the secretary stressed that there was no alternative to serious work to achieve Arab unity to confront the political, social, and economic challenges facing the Arab world as part of the attempts by the imperialists to dominate it. He emphasised the need for the goal of unity to be sacred goal which requires extensive efforts. He said that the deep relationship and joint goals which bind the al Fateh revolution and the Algerian revolution will help them to [word indistinct] a prominent role in this sphere. He ended by saying that co-operation, integration and unity could not solve the problems of reaction and dependence which the imperialists are trying to impose.

He went on to say that the liberation movements, following the elimination of colonialism and racism have become states and the enemies of yesterday which are forgetting their unholy alliance with colonialism and racism, try to woo these states and offer assistance to them while trying to forget that the blockade imposed on the great socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah was caused by its support and assistance for the African liberation movements. He confirmed that the emancipation of South Africa from racism paves the way of the future victory and triumph of the Arab people in occupied Palestine who are struggling against the Zionist racist. He said that our jubilation will not complete unless after the achievement of the final victory for the Arab Palestinian people and after all Arab occupied territories are regained. He said in accordance with the African brethren and good neighbourlyhood spirit agreement had been reached between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad to implement the decision of the International Court of Justice. The secretary said: All [word indistinct] may remember, more than anyone else the nature of conflict between my country and the three Western states and the practical steps taken by Libya to find a peaceful settlement for this dispute and its acceptance to deal with the Security Council Resolution No. 731 as nothing remains for the complete implementation generally except the two suspects standing trial before the court which is based on the legal principle that forbids the surrendering of nationals for other states to try them outside its territory, with the preparedness to let the two suspects stand [words indistinct] and just court to be agreed upon by the parties with the aim of establishing the truth and try them at the quarters of the International Court of Justice but the other concerned patriots did not respond favourably with these practical initiatives offered by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah which aim at finding a fair and just settlement to satisfy the concerned parties particularly in the wake of the solid support of the international and regional organization for the position of the Great Jamahiriyah and the calls for the non-escalation of the dispute and the need to arrive at a peaceful settlement to satisfy all parties. The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation paid tribute to the positive role played by the O.A.U. towards this issue which is represented by the decision taken in the 58th. session unanimously by the ministerial council in Cairo and ratified by the 29th. summit of African presidents which called for urging the U.N. Security Council to review Resolution No. 748 and lift the sanctions imposed on Libya in appreciation of the positive initiatives offered by the Great Jamahiriyah to settle the crisis. The reduced African summit held in Cairo in al Kanoun (December) 1993 made an appeal for a peaceful settlement for the conflict and called for a fair trial of the two suspects in a neutral state. The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation appeal to the sisterly states, friendly countries, the conscience of the world, the intellectuals and jurists in the world to tackle and confront this flagrant violation for the international law and the United Nations Charter so that the Security Council may not be transformed [word indistinct] council against smaller countries. He concluded his speech by saying that present conditions and international developments oblige us to be more vigilant to defend our causes and issues and to act towards settling all our disputes within the framework of the Organization of African Unity and to seek the settlement of the debts crisis which is posing heavily on most of our countries. The confrontation of these challenges and others will not be achieved unless through joint will, solid collective resolve and commitment to total African unity.
