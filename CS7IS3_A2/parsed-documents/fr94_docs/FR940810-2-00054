FR940810-2-00054 FR940810-2-00030 [Docket No. PR94&hyph;16&hyph;000] Southern California Gas Co.; Notice Granting Late Intervention August 4, 1994. Motions to intervene in the above-captioned proceeding were due on July 1, 1994. A motion to intervene out of time was filed on July 12, 1994, by El Paso Natural Gas Company. No answers in opposition to the motion were filed. The movant appears to have a legitimate interest under the law that is not adequately represented by other parties. Granting the intervention will not cause a delay or prejudice any other party. It is in the public interest to allow the movant to appear in proceeding. Accordingly, good cause exists for granting the late intervention. Pursuant to §375.302 of the Commission's Regulations (18 CFR 375.302 (1988)), the movant is permitted to intervene in this proceeding subject to the Commission's rules and regulations under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. §§717&hyph;717(w). Participation of the late intervenor shall be limited to matters set forth in its motion to intervene. The admission of the late intervenor shall not be construed as recognition by the Commission that the intervenor might be aggrieved by any order entered in this proceeding. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19460 Filed 8&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
