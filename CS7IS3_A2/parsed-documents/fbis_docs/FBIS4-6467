Recalling that the acting chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross society sent a letter to the president of the South Korean Red Cross on April 19 once again urging an immediate repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners now in detention in South Korea, the news analyst says: Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were taken prisoners by the South side during the Korean war. They, therefore, should have been treated as pows under provisions of the Geneva conventions adopted on August 12, 1949, and repatriated to the northern half of the country at the time of the exchange of POWs right after the ceasefire. As far as their "acceptance of citizenship" is concerned, it was against their will. They had no other choice but to do so for the sake of their existence since the South Korean puppet regime detained them, not returning them. They still do not want to live in South Korea, and they themselves have already requested the international committee of the Red Cross to help them return to the North. Their families and relatives in the northern half of the country are waiting on tiptoe for their return. The misfortunes of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must no more be prolonged, and their repatriation must be realized without delay and unconditionally.
