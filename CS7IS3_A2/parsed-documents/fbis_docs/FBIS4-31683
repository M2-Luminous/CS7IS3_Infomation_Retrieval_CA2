Presenting the objectives of Germany's mandate to the press, Kinkel was asked by the TANJUG correspondent if there were real possibilities for the crisis to be resolved during Germany's term in office, Kinkel said that it would be wonderful if this happened. Kinkel observed, however, that because of the complications of the Yugoslav crisis, it would be too much to pledge to do this. In any case Germany will, together with its international partners, wholeheartedly act for the Yugoslav crisis to be fully resolved as soon as possible, he said. To confirm his thesis that much has already been done in that respect, Kinkel listed the ceasefire (between Croats and Serbs) in Krajina and the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the agreement on a one-month cessation of hostilities, the establishment of safe areas, including Sarajevo, the placing of Mostar under European Union [EU] administration, the founding of the Moslem-Croat federation and the joint actions by international negotiators within the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is the intention in the international community, Kinkel said, for the one-month ceasefire in Bosnia, which became effective on Friday, to be used as an incentive for seeking a lasting peace solution. Interpreting the E.U. policy, Minister at Britain's Foreign Office Heathcoat Amory said that the E.U. plan for resolving the Yugoslav and Bosnian crises remains the pillar around which all peace talks are based. Asked by TANJUG to comment statements that the plan had been somewhat altered, the British minister said that the changes were in the sense of negotiations on maps of the territorial delimitation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but did not explain if this meant that the E.U. plan could be interpreted differently by each side and accepted only up to a certain, suitable, point. Asked if the international contact group for Bosnia could still be considered as a united body following a United States House of Representatives decision to exempt Moslems from the international arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, since the group's unity was underscored as its main asset in the talks, Amory answered with a general statement that the international community was using all available means which could, in his assessment, contribute to a peace solution.
