For two full hours they marched through the streets of Bujumbura. The demonstrators had only one goal on their banners and in their slogans: Support the arrival of the Mission for Protection and Restoration of trust in Burundi -- Miprobu, in short. Christopher Nkurunziza followed the march. [passage omitted] All along the streets of the city center the placards and slogans were more than clear. For the demonstrators, Miprobu is a shield of democracy and no durable peace can come to Burundi without the coming of this international force. According to the demonstrators, the 180 soldiers of the Miprobu are insufficient and the government should request that the number of Miprobu troops be multiplied by 10. The militants of the ruling party and its allies marched for more than 15 km in light rain before reaching the Football Federation Club stadium in front of the Source of the Nile Hotel. [passage omitted] In the speech he delivered on the occasion, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, speaker of the National Assembly and interim chairman of the FRODEBU party, noted the power of last 1 June emanates from the people's will. The latter is sovereign. Thus, according to him, it was legitimate that the ruling party, the president of the Republic, the National Assembly and the government control all the organs of the country. The speaker of the Burundi National Assembly said that when the government calls on Africans to provide the security of the government, no contrary decision can be taken. The Army will have to cooperate with the Miprobu which, according to Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, is not coming to plunge the country back into chaos.
