(8) If the E200 level of the target fuel equals or exceeds 33 volume percent, then D E200 shall be set equal to zero. (9) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 18 volume percent and greater than or equal to 10 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to (ARO^18 volume percent). If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 10 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to 8 volume percent. (10) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is greater than 46 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to (ARO^46 volume percent). (11) If neither of the conditions established in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(D) (8) and (9) of this section are met, then D ARO shall be set equal to zero.

(13) If the E300 level of the target fuel is less than 94 volume percent and [79.75+(0.385×ARO)] also is greater than 94, then D E300 shall be set equal to (E300^94 volume percent). If the E300 level of the target fuel is greater than 95 volume percent and [79.75+(0.385×ARO)] also is greater than 94, then D E300 shall be set equal to 1 volume percent. (14) If neither of the conditions established in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(D) (11) and (12) of this section are met, then D E300 shall be set equal to zero.
