[Mancino] Yes, and it does not surprise me. The center is the only grouping that can offer the voters a homogeneous and solid program line. This is certainly an advantage with respect to the inconsistencies of the Right and the Left. You cannot stop in front of a door marked "Electoral Coalition." People want to know with whom and how it is intended to govern. Both the Right and the Left have little to say about this. They have made too many mistakes. [D'Avanzo] Too many mistakes. What are they? [Mancino] On the Left, Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] has committed a very serious strategic error. He decided to embrace within his coalition -- for the sake of exclusively numerical necessities -- a party that has not abandoned its plan to reestablish communism in Italy and that proclaims to the four winds that, although the Soviet system made some fundamental mistakes, the nature, the Marxist framework of its social order must still be defended. [D'Avanzo] So what is his strategic error? [Mancino] That is soon said. The attempt at an upward social leveling has failed in every corner of Central and West Europe. The raising of the weaker social classes to a higher level is part of a culture that our country cannot accept. [D'Avanzo] So much for the Left. What are the Right's mistakes? [Mancino] However many efforts [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi may make, it remains clear that the MSI [Italian Social Movement], even in the new form of the National Alliance, cannot coexist with the League in government, even disregarding the conflict that exists between the former's specific appeal for the country's unity and the latter's calls for federalism. If you look at the programs of the Right, you will find them full of demagogy. It will not be easy for those gentlemen to govern. [D'Avanzo] In the conflict between [Northern League leader] Bossi and Berlusconi, the smarter one seems to be Bossi, who has made his calculations on the basis of individual constituencies, not on the basis of opinion polls. He can now say: Of the 320 constituencies in the north, 200 will be mine. [Mancino] Yes, Bossi certainly is the smarter one. He is trying to overcome the irritation of coexisting with Berlusconi, the loss of territorial hegemony. Bossi is certainly more strategic, Berlusconi more tactical. [D'Avanzo] But Berlusconi has no doubts about victory. [Mancino] I would not be so sure, if I were in his shoes. The country has to decide whether a gentleman who owns a large proportion of the television stations, newspapers, and sectors of production can be impartial when it comes to deciding what kinds of economic measures Italy needs. I think that the Italian people are intelligent and that they will seek a third person who is able to manage the country's interests, not his own interests. [D'Avanzo] However, this third option, the center, does not seem to be playing a prominent part in this election campaign at all. [Mancino] The campaign is taking place with a deliberate understanding between two antagonists: The Left shouts about the danger of a swing toward authoritarianism, while the Right shouts out in fright about a left-wing government. But who believes in this split between two poles? It is a distorted arrangement that after the elections will have to relinquish its extreme wings in order to be able to govern. That is when it will be necessary to take account of the center. [D'Avanzo] How many seats will the center have in parliament? [Mancino] I am no soothsayer. What I do say is that if the numbers so permit, we will govern; if not, we will go into opposition. [D'Avanzo] With whom would you govern? [Mancino] If an intermediate constituent phase were to prove necessary, we would do our part. [D'Avanzo] On what conditions? [Mancino] On condition that the two poles separate at each extreme in order to agree on a program including institutional reform. [D'Avanzo] With Ciampi as prime minister? [Mancino] Although everyone judged him merely a technocrat, Ciampi has shown himself to be a shrewd and responsible politician. Having worked with him, I can say that he has not shown himself to be exclusively concerned with pursuing a merely monetarist policy. [D'Avanzo] It is very likely that you will be the last Christian Democrat minister to occupy your present post for a long time... [Mancino] If that does happen, I do not think that anyone would be distressed, neither I nor my party. [D'Avanzo] So perhaps we could take stock calmly of the damage done by the DC [Christian Democratic Party] at the Interior Ministry. [Mancino] I am willing to take stock of the damage done, if we also mention the good points... [D'Avanzo] For instance... [Mancino] To have consolidated democracy in the country at a time when there was a rifle in every home. [D'Avanzo] Very well, and what about the demerits? [Mancino] Neglect of the increasing growth of organized crime. We failed to see in time that the Mafia was turning into a holding company. [D'Avanzo] Do you not think that it is insufficient to talk in terms of neglect, in view of the fact that one former minister, Gava, is accused of associating with the Mafia and a former prime minister, Andreotti, is accused of homicide and Mafia activities? [Mancino] If you think that neglect of such dangerous phenomena is a small matter... [D'Avanzo] In other words, you do not believe in [Mafia boss] Riina's kiss. [Mancino] No, I do not. [D'Avanzo] Minister, Sisde... [Mancino] I will not discuss Sisde. I have done nothing else for the past five months. That is enough, I am tired of it. Misinformation obscures everything. I am accused of having failed to carry out checks. What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to monitor things even before I became minister? When I did become minister I brought back 14 billion lire to Sisde's treasury, in accordance with the method determined by a judge. I immediately informed the prime minister, Giulio Andreotti, and a fortnight later [Sisde chief] Malpica was dismissed. [D'Avanzo] But you are accused of having organized the shelving of the inquiry... [Mancino] That is untrue. The truth is that Malpica boasted to his accomplices of my help and who knows what else. There was no such help, nor could there have been. [D'Avanzo] Malpica talks about certain meetings... [Mancino] No. When confronted by other witnesses, Malpica withdrew his statements about a meeting at the Quirinale Palace [president's office], a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, and a meeting with [police chief] Vincenzo Parisi. All that remained was a telephone call. Well, that telephone call did take place. I told Malpica to do what he thought right... [D'Avanzo] [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti's defense attorney Marazzita, told CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "The fact that Mancino took 100 million lire a month is probably consistent with his personality..." [Mancino] What kind of answer do you expect me to give to this Marazzita, who agreed to do a few little jobs for [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi? Even though he sent me a telegram of apology, I have already instructed my lawyers to defend my honor... [D'Avanzo] Are you suing him? [Mancino] That is not decided. Maybe I will demand a billion lire in damages from him. That will teach him how to act as an attorney. [D'Avanzo] Nevertheless, the Sisde trial... [Mancino] I do not want to talk any more about Sisde... I do not feel like the interior minister; I feel like a politician, and I want to engage in politics again... When I came here the situation was disastrous. Falcone had been killed, and immediately afterward the Mafia killed Borsellino [both judges] too. We were in disarray. Since then we have succeeded in setting matters in order again. I will not now repeat things and statistics which everyone should remember. The wanted persons arrested, the operations, the arrests, the investigations... [D'Avanzo] On the subject of the Mafia, Occhetto has issued a warning: They are threatening the trade unions. Is the Mafia still active, despite its defeats? [Mancino] When you build something new, it is no surprise when the old returns to life, violently. The Mafia does exist, and it will continue to play a leading role now too by guaranteeing support to certain political groups. [D'Avanzo] Which? [Mancino] It is said that in Sicily the tendency is toward Forza Italia. But there is not only Forza Italia. There are no certainties, but I am told that the Mafia will back new political groupings and small, newly formed lists. [D'Avanzo] Craxi too has issued a warning of his own. He is talking about arrests, attacks, and murders. Is this a warning or intimidation? [Mancino] I do not want to go too far in rejecting Craxi's forecasts, because we cannot assume that we are dealing with a reckless person... I can say, however, that we have arranged for the necessary vigilance and strengthened our protection. [D'Avanzo] Are you happy even though there are people at large that want to kill [Judge] Di Pietro? [Mancino] The latest warning in his regard is a controversial matter and still remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, it is true: There are some indications that must not be ignored. The protection around Di Pietro has been very thorough for some time, and it was further stepped up some time ago.
