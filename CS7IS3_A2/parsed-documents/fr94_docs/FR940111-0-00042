FR940111-0-00042 FR940111-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Parts 251, 252 and 255 [Docket No. R&hyph;934&hyph;1589; FR&hyph;2951&hyph;F&hyph;02] RIN 2502&hyph;AF09 GNMA Requests for Full Insurance on Coinsurance Loans AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises currently applicable multifamily and health facility coinsurance regulations to eliminate the requirement that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer responsibility on current coinsured mortgages held by a defaulting lender-issuer before requesting full insurance endorsement by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The purpose of the rule is to eliminate a current regulatory requirement which has proved to be time-consuming and, in most cases, unnecessary. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Albert B. Sullivan, Director, Office of Multifamily Housing Management, room 6160, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, voice (202) 708&hyph;3730, TDD (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department's former regulations concerning GNMA's right to assignment of coinsured mortgages were found at 24 CFR 251.827 (Multifamily Coinsurance_New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation), ยง252.827 (Coinsurance of Nursing Homes and Related Facilities), and ยง255.827 (Coinsurance of Mortgages Covering Existing Multifamily Projects), before their recent removal as part of the termination of the Coinsurance program sections on right to assignment provided that, for any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will first attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender by soliciting offers to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring lenders that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner and that are also GNMA issuers. If GNMA rejects all offers or no offers are received, GNMA will then have the right to perfect an assignment of the Mortgage to itself. The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section for full insurance effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
