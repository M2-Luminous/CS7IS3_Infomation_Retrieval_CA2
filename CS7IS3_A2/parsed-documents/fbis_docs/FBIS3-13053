Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed in an interview with AL-AHRAM that arresting the masterminds and criminals of the organized assassinations in Yemen is the joint responsibility of the General People's Congress and the Socialist Party. He added that the majority of these terrorists are based in the southern governorates such as Abyan, Hadhramaut, and Shabwah, as well as in the northern governorates such as Sanaa and the areas of Khawlan and Marid [place name as published]. He pointed out that those involved in the assassinations are well known but all have not been arrested because it is not easy to do so. He clarified that the terrorists are currently hiding out in mountainous areas where huge military forces are needed to track them down. On the Pledge and Accord document, he said: The document came to express the aspirations of the people to find a system that guarantees the maintenance of unity and paves the way for local government. He pointed out that the expectation that the crisis would be resolved immediately after the document was signed in Amman was not accurate since it is too serious and complicated to be resolved by a mere signature. He explained that the conflicts started after united Yemen was established. Because of everyone's joy over unity, they forgot to take needed measures, such as merging the armed and security forces and institutions and finding a unified course the state should follow. The differences emerged very clearly after parliamentary elections were held. These elections revealed the loyalty of the parties in the north and south to their old bodies, foremost of which is the Army. This deepened the rift between the two sides. He said: What is happening in the Yemeni arena does not represent the end of the road because Yemen is currently going through a state of upheaval. Al-Mutawwakil expected the military skirmishes between Abyan and Mudiyah to stop next week and the forces to withdraw to their original positions. On the surprise postponement of the cabinet meeting that was to convene in Aden by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, he clarified that a request was made to postpone the meeting so that its success could be guaranteed, especially since the agenda proposed by the prime minister is not enough. He added that he will convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting after the 'Id al-Fitr. On the demands made by the Socialist Party to remove the military camps from the cities, he said: The pledge document has specified certain steps for doing so, however, the current atmosphere does not allow this demand to be met. Therefore, we need to hold talks and agree over a joint method to implement all articles of the pledge document gradually. Regarding the participation of new mediators, including Arab and other countries, to implement the document, he said: There is no justification for new mediation because the People's Congress is in constant and direct contact with the leaders of the Socialist Party. He ruled out that developments in the Yemeni arena will lead to restoring the split between the north and the south. He said it is difficult to accuse foreign powers of having interfered in what is happening. However, unity does have some enemies and there are some sides that wish to redivide Yemen into two parts. Regarding the recent problem of foreigners being kidnapped, he said it is new to Yemeni society but is part of the crisis the country is going through. This crisis has given tribes the chance to carry out kidnappings to blackmail the state. Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed that the security forces have taken all necessary measures to guarantee that such incidents are not repeated.
