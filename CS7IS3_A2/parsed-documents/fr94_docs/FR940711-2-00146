FR940711-2-00146 FR940711-2-00057 Southern requests authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $400 million. Any such direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof, and giving effect thereto, Southern's ``aggregate investment,'' determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of Southern's ``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule 53(a)(1)(ii). In addition, any such investment in any particular Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection with making the underlying investment in any Exempt Subsidiary (or Exempt Subsidiaries) with respect to which such Project Parent was organized or formed, taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs, and cash reserves required to be maintained in accordance with financing documents. Southern states that it will also comply with all other applicable rules under the Act, including, without limitation, such rules as may be promulgated in the future pursuant to Sections 32 and 33. It is proposed that investments by Southern in any Project Parents may take the form of any combination of the following: (i) Ppurchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable; (ii) cash capital contributions or open account advances; (iii) loans evidenced by promissory notes; and (iv) guaranties by Southern of the principal of or interest on any promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness of any Project Parent issued to lenders other than Southern. Southern proposes that any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value, and that any open account advance made by Southern to a Project Parent be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the date of the advance. Southern also proposes that any promissory note issued by a Project Parent to Southern, and any promissory note or similar evidence of indebtedness with respect to which Southern may issue a guaranty, would mature not later than 30 years after the date of insurance, and would bear interest at a rate: (a) Not greater than the prime rate at a bank to be designated by Southern in the case of any promissory note issued to Southern, and (b) not greater than 3% over such prime rate in the case of any note or similar evidence of indebtedness guarantied by Southern. Any promissory note issued to Southern by any Project Parent may, at Southern's option, be converted to a capital contribution to such Project Parent through Southern's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby. Funds for any direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project Parent (including the guaranty of any securities of any Project Parent) will be derived from: (i) The sale of common stock or the issuance of guarantees (within the limitations of HCAR No. 25980 (January 25, 1994), or in any future authorization obtained from the Commission); (ii) bank borrowings or commercial paper sales (within the limitations of HCAR No. 26004 (March 15, 1994), or any future authorization obtained from the Commission); and, (iii) available cash. Southern is not requesting the authority to issue any additional securities for the purpose of financing investments in any Project Parents. Southern states that it is currently investigating potential opportunities to acquire or construct electric generation, transmission or distribution facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. Southern believes that, in almost all cases, such facilities will qualify as facilities that a FUCO may own or operate. 1 Southern states that it has been Southern's experience, in connection with its foreign project development activities to date, including the preparation and submission of bid proposals in foreign government privatization programs, that the formation and acquisition of one or more Project Parents (usually, but not always, foreign corporations or the equivalent thereof) is necessary or desirable to facilitate the acquisition and ownership of a FUCO. For example, laws of some foreign countries may require that the bidder in a privatization program be a domestic company. In such cases, it would be necessary for Southern to form a foreign subsidiary as the entity submitting the bid or other proposal. 1 In some instances, a foreign utility facility may also qualify as an ``eligible facility,'' as defined in Section 32(a)(2) of the Act. Depending upon various facts and circumstances, Southern may in the future pursue any particular foreign utility investment opportunity as an EWG rather than as a FUCO, in which case the requisite filing or filings would be made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
