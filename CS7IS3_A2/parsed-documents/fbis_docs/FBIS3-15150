As BELINFORM was told by Uladzimir Zamyatalin, the Belarusian prime minister's press secretary, the political brakes that are hindering the creation of an economic and ruble union between Belarus and Russia should probably be looked for not in Moscow, far less in Minsk. It is not impossible that the process is being influenced by serious concern at the latest development of the Slav factor on the part of the trans-Atlantic Sovietologists shocked by the successful renaissance of Russia's foreign policy actions in Bosnia. This process, in the opinion of Zamyatalin, is so far being brilliantly frozen by the nationalist Russophobes in Minsk and the Russia's Choice people in Moscow. Their latest alliance, stressed Zamyatalin, is conditioned evidently by one aim -- not to permit any Slav merger. The integration process of Russia and Belarus, considers the press secretary, can be interrupted only artificially, but in that event the material and moral cost of the inevitable merger of the two peoples will be considerably higher.
