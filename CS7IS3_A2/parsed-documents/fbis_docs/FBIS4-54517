The council discussed the recent strikes. Discussing the strike of the workers in the budget-financed sector, the Presidential Council for Defense and National Security established that there are problems -- to a large extent inherited -- but that more effective action should be taken to solve them. The council stresses that the government has already prepared and proposed solutions, which should be implemented as soon as possible because, for example, there is an agreement that grades in the salaries of budget workers are uneven and set without a regular pattern. The council stresses that the Croatian Government and the trade unions have no other aim or purpose than solving the basic problems of the workers and all Croatian citizens, and trying to find the best possible solution to the problem, as permitted by the level of production. Better organized trade unions could also contribute to this by better and more clearly defining the specific problems and interests of different groups of workers. The council believes that we are currently at a very sensitive stage of the implementation of the stabilization program, and that renouncing financial discipline and interfering with the budget would destroy the stabilization program. In connection with this, despite opposition, it will be necessary to discontinue further financing of permanently loss-making enterprises, because of our commitment to a market and not a planned economy. We are aware of the fact that in certain instances this will cause turmoil. However, this is necessary in order to establish an overall healthy economic system. It should be stressed that the processes of economic rehabilitation or bankruptcy are in fact the processes of healing and recovery which ultimately lead to the creation of new production and employment, which are the only things that can improve the standard of living. It was reiterated that Croatia as a welfare state would secure full social benefits to all those who face difficulties in these processes. The council praised the government for the results it has achieved with its economic policy so far and concluded that work of this kind by the government was a precondition for receiving comprehensive international financial aid, which will contribute considerably to the overall economic revival of Croatia. International circumstances are increasingly favorable -- something best illustrated by the improvement of relations with the United States, which has offered a draft agreement on cooperation in the spheres of the economy, technology, and other areas, which, in the light of statements by top U.S. officials, shows that the United States is ready to develop a partnership with the Republic of Croatia in all areas. The council is aware of the financial situation in all sectors of Croatian society, both in industry and in the budget-financed sector, but warns that many people wish to use the accumulated social discontent for the political destabilization of Croatia. The council wishes to praise the prime minister, who was personally involved in the resolution of all these problems. The council stresses and supports the government's position that the budget endorsed by the assembly in the form of a law cannot be increased before the volume of overall production increases, and that a new allocation of resources from the budget for salaries through different grades can be negotiated by all budget beneficiaries, and a decision on this can be taken by the assembly and the government; this should never be a cause for petty politics and often demagogic pressures. A precondition for international financial aid is a stable political situation. For that reason the council calls on everyone to take into account the overall interests of the Croatian state. The council calls on everyone to discuss all problems in a peaceful atmosphere, and patiently and responsibly create conditions for a speedier economic recovery, and thus for the overall progress of our country and each individual.
