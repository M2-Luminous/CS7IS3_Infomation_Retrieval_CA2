The 55,000 mobilized health workers, however, threatened to stage an indefinite strike if their salary demands are not met. The health minister said that only 30 percent of all health workers participated in the strike. Workers' leaders, however, claimed that the percentage of participating strikers was larger. Services at hospital outpatient clinics dropped substantially during the three-day strike. Workers rejected the recent salary increase granted by the government, characterizing it as "miserable." Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne said the state does not have any money for new salary increases. Health workers earn an average salary of less than $150 per month. They criticized the minister for refusing to negotiate with their union, and threatened to stage an indefinite strike.
