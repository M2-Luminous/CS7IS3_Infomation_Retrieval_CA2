The weight of the North Korean nuclear problem was felt again in recent weeks as the escalating tension prompted the Foreign Ministry to hastily announce that Han is pushing up his Canada, U.S. and Mexico tour schedule. Instead of leaving on Sunday for Canada, he takes off on Wednesday first for Washington for a two-day visit. The announcement came amid a spreading mood of resignation here that patience has hit the wall in trying to talk out the nuclear problem with North Korea. Han will likely discuss sanctions against North Korea in his talks with U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali and top U.S. policy-makers. Seoul first proposed the itinerary change to squeeze in the two extra days. "Day-to-day developments are critical at the moment," said Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of American affairs, in explaining the reason for the change. The trip takes Han to meetings with the White House national security team including top Advisor Anthony Lake, foreign policy-makers including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and military officials such as Defense Secretary William Perry. The talks fall at a delicate time. When Han was planning the Washington trip last month, he was thinking about how the two countries should prepare for the next round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks that would have dealt with symbolic improvement of relations. Instead, North Korea is now threatening to break off negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on nuclear inspections. American Congressmen are calling for action, not dialogue, to resolve the problem. Press reports focus on possible military scenarios in case of war on the Korean peninsula. Han will be in or near the United States as the nuclear problem reaches the Feb. 21 "deadline," the day the IAEA Board of Governors opens its meeting. This week's Washington visit is a dip in the water, discussing various scenarios from sanctions to a shift whenever necessary. But Han, while talking about sanctions, will still pin his hopes on a last-minute backdown by Pyongyang and urge diplomatic dialogue to that end. Seoul, after all, is the last party wishing to see a clash with Pyongyang. The following week is when the two countries take the plunge, having to decide whether to really impose sanctions. Once the IAEA decides that its nuclear safeguards activities in North Korea are irreparably compromised, the Security Council will take over and naturally move on to U.N. sanctions. The time in between will be spent on mustering the support of China, the North's staunchest ally, and Japan whose severance of secretive money flowing into Pyongyang is critical in case of economic sanctions. Han's decision to spend more time with U.S. officials reflects Seoul's feeling that it's time to establish concrete plans. South Korea and the United States will have to determine when to turn these plans into action.
