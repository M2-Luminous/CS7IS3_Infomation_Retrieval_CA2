Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of §§2542.200 through 2542.260 for: (a) Conviction of or civil judgment for: (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public or private agreement or transaction; (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes, including those proscribing price fixing between competitors, allocation of customers between competitors, and bid rigging; (3) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, receiving stolen property, making false claims, or obstruction of justice; or (4) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of a person. (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as: (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more public agreements or transactions; (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance of one or more public agreements or transactions; or (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction.

(d) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present responsibility of a person. §2542.220 Procedures. The Corporation shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the procedures in §§2542.230 through 2542.260. §2542.230 Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration.

A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the respondent advising: (a) That debarment is being considered; (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based; (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under §2452.210 for proposing debarment; (d) Of the provisions of §§2542.230 through 2542.260, and any other Corporation procedures, if applicable, governing debarment decision making; and (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.
