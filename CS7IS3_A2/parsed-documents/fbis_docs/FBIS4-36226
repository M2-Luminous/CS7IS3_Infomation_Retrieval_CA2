Speaking at a Press conference in her chamber on Sunday, Ms Bhutto said the forthcoming budget would be a realistic one, but said the government would have to impose taxes owing to the ill- conceived policies and economic mismanagement of the previous government. She said the budget would be tough because of variety of reasons. She pointed out that salaries had not been increased for the last three years and the government would have to take budgetary measures to increase salaries and provide relief to the people. Dilating on the country's economic situation she said the yawning gap hetween the income and expenditures was not because of the present people's government. She pointed out that loans taken by the previous government of Nawaz Sharif exceeded the sun of loans taken by all the governments since 1947. "The government had the option either to meet the budget deficit through more borrowings or imposing taxes," she said. She said the people's government while departing from the policies of previous governments decided to take a tough decision of introducing new taxes and help recover the ailing economy. She claimed that the budget deficit during the previous Nawaz government rose from 6 per cent of GDP to over 8 per cent of GDP. It is likely to cross 9 per cent of the GDP in the coming June, she said. The present government has arrested the increasing deficit and was taking every possible step to bring it back to 6 per cent, she added. The previous government, she maintained, spent over 80 million dollars on the yellow cab scheme and stopped the Hub power project which was initiated in the previous PPP government. She said it resulted in severe energy crisis in the country which again reflected on the country's production and further aggravation of economic situation. Giving yet another reason for the government decision to impose taxes, she said the government was introducing structural reforms and tariffs. She pointed out that tariffs had already been brought down from 150 per cent to 100 per cent and intended to further reduce these. The shortfall because of the reduction in tariffs should also have to make up from other taxes, she added. However, she said the decrease in the tariffs would help accelerate pace of industrialisation in the country, which would not only provide employment but also improve the overall economic situation. Expressing determination to eliminate unemployment from the country, she said "we do not want to betray the people or want to buy time." I do not believe in making cosmetic changes," she said. Responding to a question about general sales tax in context with the Afghan transit facility, she said the government was fully alive of the situation and would certainly address to the problem. She agreed that Afghan transit facility was being abused and in the present situation without reviewing the Afghan transit facility imposition of general sales tax would strengthen the black economy. She, however, refused to disclose the details of measures the government intended to take in this behalf, and said the government wanted to force the black economy to join into the mainstream economy. Further criticising the policies of previous government she said they cut the budget of education women development, energy and other important social sectors just for the sake of laying a lavish motorway. Enumerating the steps taken by the present government during the past six months, she said it was highly unjustified to say that we had taken no steps for the socioeconomic uplift of the people. "We introduced agriculture tax, enacted anti-drug laws, set up women police station, launched anti-polio and population planning campaign," she said while adding that the economic measures taken by the present government would bear fruit before the next elections. Replying to another question about the increase in the ghee prices, she said she had already issued directives to all the provincial chief secretaries to launch anti-hoarders campaign. She said the ghee prices were increased because of the slackness of provincial administrations and not because of the government. She pointed out that the Ghee Corporation of Pakistan was marketing ghee at much less prices than private ghee units. She said the government was hiring a consultancy firm to suggest measures for checking monopoly of the private sector and regulate prices.
