This writer attended a "Working Group on Import Promotion, Improvement of Market Access, and Distribution" meeting as a member. Frankly speaking, under the present situation, I think the group can hardly hammer out fundamental deregulation measures that can meet expectations both at home and abroad. It is almost impossible to alter the government offices' attitude of defending regulations. They hardly understand the market mechanism. This time, like in the past, details of deregulation measures have been basically decided on by government offices. Regardless of whether the government offices are doing it intentionally, they always choose areas where there is little resistance from industries, where the government offices do not lose their vested interests, and where they suffer little "pain" for deregulation. This is the reason for the failure to hammer out effective deregulation measures. Although it was obvious that the result would turn out to be this way, there was no other choice but to entrust government offices with forming deregulation measures. This is because the politicians themselves have become "Zoku-giin" [Dietmen who lobby for business, industris, and particular government ministries and agnecies], and they help the government offices defend their vested interests. In addition, there is the fact that politicians are not well informed about the actual state of the regulations. Actually, it is impossible not only for politicians but also for outsiders to understand the very details of the extremely complicated regulations. Moreover, in cases where the private sector urges politicians to abolish regulations, the private sector has its own motives. As a matter of course, the private sector will refrain from talking about benefits resulting from regulations. After all, only the parties concerned can understand the actual situation of regulations. To resolve such a problem and achieve substantial results in deregulation, it is necessary to create a "situation under which bureaucrats will benefit by positively promoting deregulations." In other words, a situation where heavy penalties will be imposed on those government offices failing to promote deregulation has to be created. It is difficult to come up with brilliant ideas. In the first place, I want to suggest that the basic principle for such revision should first be clearly stated when reviewing existing regulations. One of the principles I want to suggest in respect to the spirit of the recommendations made by the Hiraiwa Economic Reform Study Council is that "the economy should be free of control in principle." Another is that "policies that can be implemented in developed countries should also be applied to Japan." In other words, it is the principle of not permitting "Japan's special circumstances" to be used as an excuse. These two principles should be clearly proclaimed, government offices should be monitored on whether they proceed with their tasks according to the principles, and then results of monitoring should be published. (These tasks are expected to be assigned to the planned third-party monitoring group, "Administration Reform Commission"). It is also important to announce concrete targets as the government's commitments to guarantee that these principles will be carried out. For example, prices of products at home are now 40 percent higher than those in other developed countries. The government should set the target of "reducing price differences by half within five years" as the concrete target for deregulation. I heard that the ruling coalition parties discussed this matter during their policy consultations. I would like the Hata Cabinet to resolutely announce this target as its official commitment. To be more precise, the government should announce these principles and targets and make the government offices assume the responsibility for carrying them out. If the Hata Cabinet upholds the target of reducing the price gap by half within five years, and the government offices assume responsibility for achieving it, public opinion will enthusiastically support the Hata Cabinet. The minority Hata Cabinet is ultimately supported not by cheap tricks in steering Diet affairs but by strong public support. Therefore, a drastic commitment like this will be a strong boost to the Hata Cabinet. Bureaucrats will surely argue that there is no clear correlation between easing regulation and the price differences between products sold at home and overseas. They are also likely to strongly oppose making a commitment to evade assuming responsibility for reducing the price gap. However, Japan's economic situation is extremely tough. If the government fails to diminish the price gap and to lower domestic commodity prices to a level closer to the present foreign exchange rate, which is 100 yen against the dollar, the Japanese economy cannot survive. To save the present Japanese economy, I think it is essential that the Hata Cabinet do something extraordinary, such as issuing a "declaration on reducing the price gap between Japan and other countries by half." While I oppose proclaiming "numerical targets" as official commitments, I support issuing this "declaration." I hope Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will make a courageous decision.
