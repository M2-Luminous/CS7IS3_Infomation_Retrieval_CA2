Stefan Savov, the group's chairman, told our reporter Antoaneta Puncheva that when a decision -- he clearly had the boycott in mind -- proves to be wrong, it has to revoked. Savov has not received any official reaction from the SDS National Coordinating Council to the parliamentary group's decision, which was reached yesterday. The coalition's political organ will discuss the decision at its meeting on Tuesday [28 June]. Stefan Savov also denied the rumor that he is supposed to become prime minister during the term of the present parliament, implying he will be prime minister of a caretaker cabinet. I have a big party behind me, he said; I am not the kind of politician fit to serve in a caretaker cabinet.
