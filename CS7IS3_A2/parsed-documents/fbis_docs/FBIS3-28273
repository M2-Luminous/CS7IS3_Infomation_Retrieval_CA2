[Onoda] We still cannot understand why insurance has been taken up as a priority area. The share of foreign insurance companies in Japan is 4.2 percent, while the Japanese share in the United States is merely 0.1 percent. The framework talks are supposed to deal with the issue of reducing the Japanese surplus. In insurance, Japan suffers from a huge deficit. We do not understand what the United States wants. [Aikawa] The United States is asking for a market share of more than 10 percent. [Onoda] Insurance policies are chosen by the individual and institutional clients. There can be no compulsion. In Japan, three-fourths of policies are individual ones, the remaining ones institutional. To achieve a share of more than 10 percent immediately, we have to give them half of the institutional insurance policies. That is impossible. [Aikawa] There should be more sales efforts on the part of U.S. companies. [Onoda] Some U.S. insurance companies which entered the market immediately after World War II, such as AIU, now have sales in Japan comparable to leading Japanese life insurance companies. For example, the American Family Insurance, which is well-known for cancer insurance, makes more sales in Japan than in the United States. A greater market share can be achieved through corporate efforts. Moreover, Japan is an open market which gives foreign insurance companies national treatment. On the contrary, the United States has different systems in individual states, and there is discrimination against foreign companies. Our company has not even been granted a license in some states. If you go by the principle of two-way negotiations, it is the United States that needs to make improvements. [Aikawa] The United States is opposed to deregulation in third sector insurance, such as nursing care insurance, where both life and non-life insurance companies are eligible to participate. [Onoda] The third sector, which lies between life and non-life insurance, is an area where some U.S. companies are relatively strong. It is totally self-serving to ask for liberalization on the one hand, while attempting to keep the regulations in areas where one has an advantage. [Aikawa] There is also criticism against "keiretsu" [a group of closely affiliated companies] transactions. [Onoda] While there are indeed instances of mutual shareholding, this makes up a negligible portion of the whole industry. We make arduous marketing efforts under free competition, and an overwhelming proportion of our business is from outside the "keiretsu." The concept of insurance is very different in the United States. In the United States, insurance companies accept insurance at a low premium. But once there is an accident, the premium immediately goes up, or the companies refuse to accept insurance. In contrast, the principle of Japanese insurance services is stability, continuity, and security. While the premium may be a little higher, a client would choose a Japanese company from the long-term point of view. It is important for U.S. insurance companies to also conduct followup visits, and adopt some Japanese business practices to gain the clients' trust. [Aikawa] What do you want the government to do? [Onoda] We hope this issue will not be brought to the summit conference table and be subject to a bold political settlement.
