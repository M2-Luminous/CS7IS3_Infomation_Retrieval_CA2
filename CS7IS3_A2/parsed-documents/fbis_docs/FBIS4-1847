Evans told journalists after a meeting Saturday with Li that he had raised the subject of Wei's detention, but added: "I can't say that the result of that particular exchange was very encouraging." It was the second time in a month that Wei -- who was attempting to return to Beijing from the nearby city of Tianjin -- had been arrested. Evans said he told Li "this added a whole new degree of difficulty in resolving the MFN (most-favoured-nation) issue with the United States and was a continuing matter of concern, a new matter for a good deal of the rest of the international community, including of course ourselves." [sentence as received] The Australian foreign minister said Li did not seem to be aware of the latest developments and responded with a lecture on "the virtues of sticking to bilateral relations and larger questions of international relations rather than internal affairs." "The premier's reaction was not forthcoming on the subject of Wei Jingsheng. It's not a subject that the Chinese Government authorities care to talk about or care to talk about in polite terms anyway," Evans said. The reason for Wei's detention Friday and his present whereabouts remain unclear. His secretary Tong Yi said she hoped he would be released after about 24 hours as he was after his previous detention one month ago. The 43-year-old activist, who was released in September six months short of a 15-year jail term for "counter-revolutionary" activities, was among more than 15 dissidents picked up in a police sweep in early March.
