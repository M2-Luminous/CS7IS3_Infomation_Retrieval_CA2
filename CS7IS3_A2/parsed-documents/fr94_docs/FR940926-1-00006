ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The purpose of this document is to announce the extension of the comment period for receiving comments on the three reports announced in the August 30, 1994, Federal Register that EPA is considering as it develops the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (Guidance). The proposed Guidance was published in the April 16, 1993, Federal Register , with corrections published in the Federal Register on August 9, 1993, and September 13, 1993. On August 30, 1994, EPA published in the Federal Register a notice of data availability and request for comments on three reports that it is considering in developing the final Guidance. The three reports made available in the August 30, 1994, notice are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has adequate opportunity to comment on whether any of the recommendations in these reports should be adopted in developing the final Great Lakes Water Quality Guidance. DATES: Written comments should be submitted on or before October 14, 1994. Comments postmarked after this date may not be considered. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Wendy Schumacher, Water Quality Branch (WQS&hyph;16J), U.S. EPA, Region V, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604 (telephone: 312&hyph;886&hyph;0142). Commenters are requested to submit one original and four copies of their written comments. A copy of the reports identified in this document are available for inspection and copying at the U.S. EPA Region V, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, by appointment only. Appointments may be made by calling Wendy Schumacher (telephone: 312&hyph;886&hyph;0142). A reasonable fee will be charged for photocopies. The three reports are also available by mail upon request for a fee by sending a written request to the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth A. Fenner, Water Quality Branch Chief, (WQS&hyph;16J), U.S. EPA Region V, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604 (telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;2079). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA announced the availability of three reports in the August 30, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 44678). The three reports are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994,'' have been placed in the administrative record for the Great Lakes Guidance because EPA is considering information in these documents as it finalizes the Great Lakes Guidance. A summary of the information provided in these three reports and the issues relevant to the Great Lakes Guidance are discussed in the August 30, 1994, notice. Readers are referred to that notice for additional details. In this notice, EPA is extending the public comment period for the three reports to October 14, 1994, to provide additional time for public review and comment. EPA believes that extension of the comment period for this limited purpose is appropriate because of the complexity of the issues raised in the three reports announced on August 30, 1994. Dated: September 20, 1994. Robert Perciasepe, Assistant Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23775 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
