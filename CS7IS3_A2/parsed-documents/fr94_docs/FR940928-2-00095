FR940928-2-00095 FR940928-2-00067 Illinois Power Company and Soyland Power Cooperative, Inc., Docket No. 50&hyph;461, Clinton Power Station, Unit No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois Date of amendment request: August 12, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would modify Clinton Power Station Technical Specifications 3/4.3.1, ``Reactor Protection System Instrumentation,'' 3/4.3.2, ``Containment and Reactor Vessel Isolation Control System,'' 3/4.3.3, ``Emergency Core Cooling System Actuation Instrumentation,'' 3/4.3.4.2, ``End-of-Cycle Recirculation Pump Trip System Instrumentation,'' 3/4.3.5, ``Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System Actuation Instrumentation,'' 3/4.4.2.1, ``Safety/Relief Valves,'' and 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety/Relief Valves Low-Low Set Function.'' These technical specifications contain requirements to perform manual testing of the associated solid-state logic at least once every four fuel cycles. This testing is in addition to the automatic testing performed by the self-test system. Due to the negative impact on plant safety caused by the need to remove systems from service to prevent unwanted actuations and the increased potential for unintended equipment actuation during manual testing, Illinois Power is proposing that the requirement to perform manual testing of the solid-state logic independently from the self-test system be eliminated. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: (1) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design. The proposed change involves only testing of the solid-state Nuclear Systems Protection System (NSPS) utilizing the self-test system (STS). As identified in Supplement No. 2 to the Clinton Power Station (CPS) Safety Evaluation Report (SSER 2), use of the STS to perform certain surveillance testing required by the plant Technical Specifications is acceptable. However, as noted in SSER 6, portions of the NSPS logic must also be manually tested during each refueling outage independently from the STS such that all NSPS trip/actuation functions are tested independently of the STS at least once every four fuel cycles. The change proposed in this request consists of the elimination of this manual testing of the NSPS logic independently from the STS. As identified in SSER 6, the purpose of the currently required manual tests is to provide a means to verify operability of the NSPS functional circuits independent of the STS, and thereby (1) detect any failures undetected by the STS and take corrective action to restore proper operation of the NSPS and STS and (2) assuming that no additional failures beyond those identified by the STS are detected during independent logic testing, confirm the validity of the STS test results. The ability of the STS to detect functional failures of the NSPS logic as designed was verified as part of General Electric's independent design verification. In addition, this capability was also verified by testing as part of the preoperational test program as described in Section 14.2.12.1.62 of the CPS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and during testing performed during the first four refueling outages in accordance with the current Technical Specification testing requirements. Thus, Illinois Power (IP) has concluded that all functional failures undetectable by the STS have been identified and the aforementioned objectives have been satisfied. Since the proposed change does not alter the plant design or operation, it cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated. This proposed change does involve the NSPS logic which is utilized to actuate systems needed to mitigate the consequences of accidents previously evaluated, however, the proposed change merely eliminates the currently required manual testing independently from the STS once every four fuel cycles. Since the proposed change does not alter the NSPS logic, does not impact operation of the STS, and continues to require adequate testing of the NSPS logic on a frequency sufficient to maintain the operability of the associated NSPS logic, the proposed change cannot impact the reliability of the associated actuation instrumentation and therefore cannot increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
