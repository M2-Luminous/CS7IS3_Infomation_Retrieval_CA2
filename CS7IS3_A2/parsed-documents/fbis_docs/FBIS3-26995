The Chinese side will step up "preparing its own package [ling qi lu zao 0659 6386 3619 3501], and will reorganize the three-tier councils on 1 July 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law. After attending a New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Spring Festival gathering yesterday, Zheng Guoxiong answered reporters' questions, saying: The Chinese side has repeatedly stated that on the issue of arrangements for the 1994-95 Hong Kong elections, the Chinese side has hoped right from the very beginning that an agreement would be reached through talks. But, as everybody knows, the British side unilaterally announced the end of the talks and tabled the political reform proposals in Legco, resulting in the termination of the talks. In this situation, whatever resolutions Legco may adopt, and in accordance with whatever resolutions the three-tier councils are to be established, their tenures will only continue until 30 June 1997. On 1 July 1997, the Chinese side will reorganize the three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. This is the Chinese side's firm position. The Chinese side will make preparations in keeping with this plan. He urged the people of Hong Kong to strengthen communication and solidarity and jointly carry out this work properly. Zheng Guoxiong reiterated: The Chinese side has consistently taken a positive attitude toward things that have a bearing on Hong Kong residents. Cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong and between Hong Kong and Shenzhen in traffic, public order, and antismuggling operations is there for all to see. He said that the Chinese side adopts a positive attitude to promote cooperation between the two sides so as to resolve livelihood problems that have a bearing on Hong Kong residents. He urged Hong Kong residents to rest assured that the Chinese side will be devoted to maintaining Hong Kong's social prosperity and stability. Asked about the financial arrangements for the new airport, Zheng Guoxiong said that the Chinese side is currently studying the fourth new airport financial proposals put forward by the British side. He held that the fact that Guo Fengmin, chief representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, recently proposed first holding a meeting of the expert group of the Airport Committee is a responsible attitude and a pragmatic practice. He said that if the two sides hold Airport Committee meetings on the basis of the expert group's studies, they are heading forward in the direction of resolving problems.
