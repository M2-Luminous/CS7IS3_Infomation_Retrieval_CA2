Antonio Navarro Wolff is also on the line. Good morning. [Samper] Good morning, Antonio. [Navarro] How are you doing? [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, how do you assess the election results? [Samper] Dario, I am very pleased with them. They speak for themselves. I think it is clear that people in the major cities, where the most independent and less committed votes are, voiced their opinions. That was the case in Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. Their votes favored us and they also favored Antonio Navarro. Most of the votes cast for Dr. Pastrana came from areas traditionally considered to be conservative. It does not surprise me that he won in the Departments of Caldas, Narino, and Northern Santander. I admit that Conservatives voted more massively there just as the Liberals voted massively in the departments that are traditionally liberal. The Conservative machinery favored the Conservative candidate and others favored me and my ticket partner Humberto de la Calle, and they also favored Antonio Navarro. [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, do you agree with Dr. Samper's assessment? [Navarro] I see something that perhaps Dr. Samper has not analyzed. The Liberal Party made an all out effort to win in the first round. A few hours before the elections, Former President Dr. Alfonso Lopez predicted there would be a knockout. That did not happen. I think that there was a technical tie. This result deserves an in-depth analysis with electoral figures in hand. I think that abstention was high. This is another fact that we must take into account. Abstention could be even higher during the runoff. This could reflect a lack of voter interest in political options, especially the most favored ones during the first round. That is the result of polarization. Yesterday's decision was virtually reduced to two choices. I would say this tie created a complicated situation for both presidential candidates. Each one has his own reasons and possibilities, but I think the key to salvation during the runoff -- and this was determined yesterday by the support received by each participant -- [pauses] it is now important to listen to the voice of minority groups, which were not heard very much during the final part of the campaign in view of the polarization that was created. [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, in this first public flirting with Dr. Ernesto Samper, would you tell us on what bases you would be willing to hold talks to present your basic proposals next Thursday before the 400 or 500 people who will be coming to discuss precisely what position should be adopted toward the two candidates? [Navarro] Let us give it another name. This is not flirting but a friendly exchange. Regardless of what the electoral result might be, I hope to maintain a friendly relationship with Dr. Samper. I think we will make a decision after very calm reflection and after consulting many people. We have the responsibility of representing 220,000 people who heroically voted for us and against the establishment. We must genuinely represent those 220,000 people, and, thus, we will first consult and listen to many people before taking even one step forward. [Arizmendi] Yes Dr. Samper? [Samper] Well, I think Dr. Navarro explained his view very well. Of course, he has won an important opportunity. I have always felt a third political force is needed and that an opportunity should be given to an option other than the Liberal and Conservative options. I think he has every right to summon the people and I think there should be broad discussion. I am sure, because I have known Antonio Navarro for many years, that he will not make that decision by thinking of short-term considerations but of long-term considerations with regard to the support for the project of political opening, as the one that has been carried out since the new constitution. Dario, a topic that we should highlight is that of the abstention rate. The fact is that we are moving from a representative democracy to a direct democracy as a result of the new Constitution. We have to continue working for the development of the structures that were established in the Constitution. Citizens' participation does not only mean electoral participation, but also political and social participation, which is what will finally enable this country to have a much stronger democracy. [Arizmendi] We inform our listeners and Drs. Ernesto Samper Pizano and Antonio Navarro that we are going to welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango now. Good morning Dr. Pastrana. [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] Colombians and Drs. Samper and Navarro are listening to you. We are very happy to have you again on Latin America's first radio network after yesterday's election results. [Pastrana] Dario, I am also very happy and pleased to be back on Radio Caracol. Permit me to greet Ernesto Samper and Antonio Navarro and to congratulate them. Yesterday, we held a first-rate democratic election. Let me congratulate Ernesto, Antonio, Regina Betancourt, General Maza, and each and every candidate who participated in yesterday's elections. I wanted to personally greet you Dario but I have an interview at 0900 with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, a man who you know has a lot to teach us with regard to the topic of peace. In any case, I wanted to greet you Dario and all my contenders, wishing them luck and success. We have to work hard these next three weeks. [Arizmendi] Thank you Dr. Pastrana for your gesture. I want to invite you to come tomorrow to our studios or to talk with us over the telephone from your house at 0730. We can talk at length about yesterday's elections and the future. [Pastrana] I will be there Dario. I would have liked to be there right now. Thank you for the invitation, so tomorrow I will be talking with all Colombians. [Arizmendi] Well sir, we will wait for you at 0730. Very nice of you to accept; have a good day, and thank you very much. [Arizmendi] It is 0834 and we continue with Dr. Samper and Antonio Navarro. Dr. Samper, what happened with the Liberals who did not vote with the sufficient zeal and profession for your party to win in the first round? [Samper] I feel I received a significant portion of the Liberal vote. One cannot regard this in absolute terms but in terms of a comparison between the congressional and presidential elections. Liberal leaders were able to get in yesterday's votes the same number of votes they got in the congressional elections. Of course, we still have to summon many Liberal sectors. In some strife-torn areas, public order problems hampered the vote of certain Liberal municipalities, like Bolivar and the municipalities in the Santander and Norte de Santander Departments. At any rate, I think Liberals are going to be much more efficient in the runoff. [Reporter] If one looks at what the Liberal and Conservative Parties have been historically, one realizes Pastrana got the vote of the Conservative party and others who rallied around his program, personality, or any other reason. Others who are not in the Conservative party joined that campaign. The same thing did not happen with you because all the Liberal Party did not vote for you, and your Alliance for Colombia group did not yield results, it seems. [Samper] On the contrary, if we did not have the support from sectors that make up the Alliance for Colombia, the amount of votes would have been less. I do not think the independent vote went to Dr. Pastrana. I respectfully tell you, I repeat that such a vote was concentrated in the big cities and the big cities voted for our ticket. I do admit that, initially, the vote was proportionally greater for Dr. Pastrana's Conservative machine. It can also be the case that in certain regions, such as the coffee region, there could have been a protest vote, a vote that went to Dr. Pastrana [words indistinct] there are surprises. I repeat, if one looks at the figures, department by department, one would see that there was no change to the historical trend. It was not a case that those who were Liberal Party supporters became Conservative. What happened is that there was a great Conservative vote turnout in favor of Dr. Pastrana and to this, we must add the vote of support by regions especially affected by the crisis in the agricultural sector. [Arizmendi] One must suppose that there will be changes in strategy or perhaps a readjustment or a strengthening of the leadership positions within the campaign. When will you make a decision in this regard? [Samper] We will analyze the figures this week. We will establish contact with the regions. We will summon those who have been supporting us. The idea is to make decisions which, of course, will not change the strategy much. This week's polls predicted a virtual tie which is just what happened in the end. Of course, we would have preferred to win in the first elections, as Navarro said. It was not possible, however. This gives minorities the opportunity to seek an understanding in order to have a great majority in the next round of elections. I think this is democratic. Runoff elections have that virtue. I am obviously willing to form that majority seeking an agreement with all the sectors that participated in yesterday's elections. [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, obviously the answer to as crude a question as the following will not be easy, but what arguments and bureaucratic reasons are you planning to use to convince Navarro Wolff to support you? [Samper] I do not expect to use bureaucratic reasons to convince Navarro Wolff to support me. I think this is out of the question because the truth is I have never reached political understandings on the basis of giving out bureaucratic positions. I think Antonio Navarro has never done so throughout his political career. We are responsible for making this country work on the basis of programmatic and ideological coalitions. It is not a matter of bureaucratic positions, but rather ideological and doctrinaire positions. I am confident we will have the chance to reach an understanding with Antonio Navarro in this arena. [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, are you willing to form a programmatic and ideological alliance on the basis of some principles with Dr. Ernesto Samper, or are you also willing to reach a kind of governability pact with his political group, should he win the 19 June elections? [Navarro Wolff] [Reporter says communication was lost] [Arizmendi] Unfortunately, we lost communication with Dr. Navarro. Let us go on with Dr. Samper. Dr. Samper, as for the 29 May elections, there are two greatly talked-about issues: Are you going to maintain your emphasis on economic openings and the agricultural sector? Do you believe it is necessary to advocate more definite policies in such areas as coffee production and urban development? [Samper] I think we must put an emphasis on the countryside. I think part of the profound crisis that was clearly expressed yesterday by the municipalities is that there is a profound agricultural crisis as never before seen in Colombian history. This is why for the past year, I have been alerting the government and authorities on the risks of failing to address this agricultural crisis, which the subversion has helped amplify. [Arizmendi] Finally Dr. Samper, I thank you for these statements to the Caracol Radio Network despite your staying up all night, the parties, the expectations, the tension, and the intensity with which you lived yesterday's events. There are many Liberal leaders -- I insist on the word many -- who were very upset with the campaign yesterday because the politicians believe they were ignored and not taken seriously. Are they going to be taken into account during these runoff elections? [Samper] I have always been in direct contact with Liberal leaders. We appreciate their work, support, and participation. We, the independent and uncompromised sectors and the sectors that do not operate through the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties, have been working hard. We will continue with this strategy and we hope to count on the leaders' support and understanding to ensure that they will gather the votes of the so-called Liberal active membership. We believe our responsibility lies in enticing the new sectors that can support our Liberal plan, and we expect to achieve this goal. [Arizmendi] You have also reported that it seems some Conservative politicians purchased votes in Atlantico Department. Will you file a report? [Samper] We have very distressing reports on an alleged vote purchase in Atlantico Department. I will personally investigate these reports this morning because any vote-purchasing accusation would be serious. I think it would be very adverse for this democratic process. [Arizmendi] Finally, it is important to note the electoral results in Santa Fe de Bogota and their meaning to you and to the city's political present and future. How would you interpret your victory here in Santa Fe de Bogota? [Samper] The first thing I see is that people put an end to the myth that the only mayor Santa Fe de Bogota had was Dr. Pastrana. The truth is that people responded generously and enthusiastically to the appeal we made. This position has a lot to do with the plans I have proposed for the city from the beginning. I committed myself to building the Santa Fe de Bogota subway, creating the Social Advisory Board [Consejeria Social] to coordinate government presence in the city, and relocating the Police. I believe this contributed to the vote of confidence the city gave me. As I said earlier, if there is a city where people voted without prior commitments it is Santa Fe de Bogota. People here never requested t-shirts, alcohol, or transportation; they only wanted a convincing message. This is what happened yesterday, and I am very pleased because in addition to those who voted for other candidates, the majority voted for us in Santa Fe de Bogota and other cities. [Unidentified reporter] It was very kind of you to grant us this interview on your first impressions of the results of the elections.
