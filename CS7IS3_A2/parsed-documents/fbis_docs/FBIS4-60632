The mass destruction resulting from the fighting between brothers -- for which the brotherly Yemeni people, above all, are paying the price -- is awakening the Arab and Islamic conscience with its ugliness. The AMU states -- while warning yet again of the risks of this escalation that will harm the brotherly Yemeni people's gain of unity, in addition to the disastrous repercussions on peace and stability in the region that will result -- again urge all the Yemeni brothers to immediately halt the bloody confrontation, to return to reason, and to act in a spirit of responsibility, so that the way is cleared for dialogue on a peaceful settlement to the crisis in order that history may record it for the faithful sons of Yemen.
