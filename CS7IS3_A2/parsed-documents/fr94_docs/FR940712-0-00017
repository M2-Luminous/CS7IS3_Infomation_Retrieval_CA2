FR940712-0-00017 FR940712-0-00006 3. In §195.2, the following definition is added: §195.2 Definitions. * * * * * Low-stress pipeline means a hazardous liquid pipeline that is operated in its entirety at a stress level of 20 percent or less of the specified minimum yield strength of the line pipe. * * * * * 4. In §195.302, paragraph (b) and the introductory text of paragraph (c) are revised to read as follows: §195.302 General requirements. * * * * * (b) Except for pipelines converted under §195.5, the following pipelines may be operated without pressure testing under this subpart: (1) Any hazardous liquid pipeline whose maximum operating pressure is established under §195.406(a)(5) that is_ (i) An interstate pipeline constructed before January 8, 1971; (ii) An interstate offshore gathering line constructed before August 1, 1977; (iii) An intrastate pipeline constructed before October 21, 1985; or (iv) A low-stress pipeline constructed before August 11, 1994 that transports HVL. (2) Any carbon dioxide pipeline constructed before July 12, 1991, that_ (i) Has its maximum operating pressure established under §195.406(a)(5); or (ii) Is located in a rural area as part of a production field distribution system. (3) Any low-stress pipeline constructed before August 11, 1994 that does not transport HVL. (c) Except for pipelines that transport HVL onshore and low-stress pipelines, the following compliance deadlines apply to pipelines under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section that have not been pressure tested under this subpart: * * * * * 5. In §195.306, paragraph (a) is revised and paragraph (d) is added, to read as follows: §195.306 Test medium. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, water must be used as the test medium. * * * * * (d) Air or inert gas may be used as the test medium in low-stress pipelines. 6. Section 195.401(c) is revised to read as follows: §195.401 General requirements. * * * * * (c) Except as provided in §195.5, no operator may operate any part of any of the following pipelines unless it was designed and constructed as required by this part: (1) An interstate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, on which construction was begun after March 31, 1970, that transports hazardous liquid. (2) An interstate offshore gathering line, other than a low-stress pipeline, on which construction was begun after July 31, 1977, that transports hazardous liquid. (3) An intrastate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, on which construction was begun after October 20, 1985, that transports hazardous liquid. (4) A pipeline on which construction was begun after July 11, 1991, that transports carbon dioxide. (5) A low-stress pipeline on which construction was begun after August 10, 1994. 8. Sections 195.414(b) and (c) are revised to read as follows: §195.414 Cathodic protection. * * * * * (b) Each operator shall electrically inspect each bare hazardous liquid interstate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, before April 1, 1975; each bare hazardous liquid intrastate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, before October 20, 1990; each bare carbon dioxide pipeline before July 12, 1994; and each bare low-stress pipeline before July 12, 1996 to determine any areas in which active corrosion is taking place. The operator may not increase its established operating pressure on a section of bare pipeline until the section has been so electrically inspected. In any areas where active corrosion is found, the operator shall provide cathodic protection. Section 195.416(f) and (g) apply to all corroded pipe that is found. (c) Each operator shall electrically inspect all breakout tank areas and buried pumping station piping on hazardous liquid interstate pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, before April 1, 1973; on hazardous liquid intrastate pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, before October 20, 1988; on carbon dioxide pipelines before July 12, 1994; and on low-stress pipelines before July 12, 1996 as to the need for cathodic protection, and cathodic protection shall be provided where necessary. Issued in Washington, DC, on July 5, 1994. Ana Sol Gutiérrez, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16720 Filed 7&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;60&hyph;P
