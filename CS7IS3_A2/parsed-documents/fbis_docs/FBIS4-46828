Murashov and V. Peremyshlev: "All Roads Lead to the Capital"] [Text] A press conference with the director of the Moscow railroad, I. Paristiy, took place yesterday in the railroad administration building. Opening the press conference, S. Bogatko, director of the Ministry of Railways (MPS) press service, told the journalists that the capital main line is a unique transport association, on the capability of which the stability of the work of the whole railroad network to a large extent depends. It must be said that the meeting, organized by the MPS press service, was very crowded for the first time in many years. One thing indeed is clear: The problem of the largest mainline in the country interests both its customers and journalists. It seems that there was a graphic example of the implementation of a currently fashionable concept--transparency of decisions, that is, of the actions of management. The conversation turned out to be frank to the utmost degree and maximally exhaustive. The work of the railroad and its current situation were presented with great clarity. The impression was created that even such specific concepts as the technological work of the stations was not only understood by the journalists but sympathetically received by them. In a brief explanation, I. Paristiy, the director of the railroad, recalled that the Moscow railroad was formed within its present boundaries in 1959. It includes 13 departments and the Board of Directors of international and tourist transportation. The length of the main railroads that have been developed consists of 13,500 kilometers, almost a third of the circumference of the globe at the equator. Seventy-one stations on the railroad handle arrivals and departures of passengers. So it turned out that attention was indeed principally paid to His Majesty the passenger. And this is not surprising since the Moscow junction is the largest in the world with respect to serving passengers. It is also the largest in the railroad network--it accounts for about 40 percent of the passenger transportation in the network. In suburban rail traffic alone, 3.5 million people make use of the services of the main line daily. And the situation today is such that you do not acquire new cars right away; the prices for new cars are such that it is very difficult to provide a complete stock of cars. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that the railroad, which in past years acquired 200-300 cars on average, last year added only 32 cars. It is true, though, that this year another 50 new cars appeared. The situation with respect to cars for suburban trains can be substantially improved over time by the Demikhovskiy plant, one of the creators of which was B.N. Yeltsin, then first secretary of the Moscow City CPSU Committee. Capacity load freight trains and long passenger trains--24 cars for long distances and cars for suburban travel--have appeared on the Moscow railroad for the first time. Under conditions of general nonpayment through mutual settlements and barter, which have already been conducted here for five years, wages are being paid without delay, housing is being built at an increasingly rapid rate, and hospitals and polyclinics are being put into operation on the main railroad line. We are not sitting around doing nothing, we are not waiting for manna from heaven, said Ivan Leontevich. And the facts bear this out: With a stock of suburban rail cars, 35 percent of which have outlived their scheduled life, the intensity of traffic is being maintained through the development of depot repair and reconstruction of repair enterprises. The tendency of local authorities, in particular capital and oblast authorities, to ignore the needs and problems of the main line has been successfully overcome; in the budget for the capital, R25 billion is being designated for acquisition of rolling stock. There was a very refreshing ring to the report about the creation on the capital main line of a sanitary zone within a radius of 50 kilometers of the city, about the fact that looters on suburban trains are subject to punishment of fines of ten times the minimum wage. It is not possible in a short report to dwell on details. But we are fully confident that readers and listeners not only in the capital and the oblast but throughout Russia will learn a lot about the work of the Moscow railroad from the reports of those who were present at the journalists' press conference. The one thing for which we can hope is that such productive meetings will be held more frequently.
