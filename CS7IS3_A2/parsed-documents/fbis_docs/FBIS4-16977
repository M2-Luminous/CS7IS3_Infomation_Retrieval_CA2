Today this document will be handed over to the president and to the State Duma, where it will be discussed. I would like to inform you that this document will now be called A Treaty on Public Accord [Dogovor ob Obshchestvennom Soglasii]. This is a truly agreed upon text. It takes into account comments made by factions, parties, and public organizations, including the comments of Communists and the Liberal Democratic Party. The text has become more specific and, if you like, milder in its political part. During the process of consultations several provisions, which can be used for confrontation purposes, were removed from it. In particular, paragraphs on sanctions against those who violate the conditions of the accords were removed. As you know, a week is left before signing. Today I spoke to Boris Nikolayevich on this topic and asked him how much he hopes for success. He said that he is optimistic. He hopes for success and believes in it. The president understands that not everyone will sign this document, but the main political forces and groups will sign it. In our view, the necessary mass of political will toward an accord will be created -- not just created, but registered as well.
