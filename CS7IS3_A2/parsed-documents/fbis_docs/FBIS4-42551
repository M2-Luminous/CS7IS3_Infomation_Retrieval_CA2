What reassurances do you think you can provide? [Biondi] This will backfire on Riina: The law on criminals that turn state's evidence will remain in force, and will in fact be stepped up; I guarantee it. The Italian people can feel confident: There will be no yielding on the government's part. [Mazzocchi] Riina talked about a "communist conspiracy" and addressed the government with unprecedented boldness and disdain. And he did so in a court of law. How was that possible? [Biondi] It is to be expected that a prisoner will complain about prison regulations and that a defendant will complain about those who accuse him. Just as it was to be expected that he would take advantage of this tense situation in Italian society to issue warnings and judgments. However, I regret that the very people who should have expected it did not do so. In prison Riina is subject to rule 41B, the toughest regulation. So the fact that a man who is guarded day and night can speak from a court of law, addressing the whole nation, if not a crime, is certainly an error. [Mazzocchi] What measures has the government adopted? [Biondi] I have ordered an inspection. I hope soon to have all the necessary information, and the Higher Magistrates Council will reach a verdict on what has happened. [Mazzocchi] What is your answer to those who are urging you to make a statement? [Biondi] I do not need to submit to any investigation either with regard to the steadfastness that I will be able to maintain, or with regard to the fact that I will not submit to Mafia intimidation. And merely to think that an institutional government could yield to Riina's threats is insulting and offensive. The struggle against the Mafia remains an absolute priority for this government, within observance of the law, of course. So I cannot fail to agree with [former chairman of the parliamentary Anti-Mafia Committee] Luciano Violante, when he argues that the struggle against organized crime must not separate the majority from the opposition. [Mazzocchi] Let us return to Riina's demands. You promised changes to the law on people who turn state's evidence. Do you not think that now they would seem like a concession? [Biondi] The fact that he demanded the abolition of the law certainly causes us some concern in this regard. But I will confine myself to examining what can be changed without being weakened. And there are no plans to eliminate or weaken the measures governing prison regulations as defined under Rule 41B or to alter the legislation on people who turn state's evidence. This, at least with regard to the ways in which evidence is gathered. However, as regards the relationship between the custody of someone who has turned state's evidence and his handling during the trial stage or the methods for establishing his reliability (not for the purposes of the trial, but for practical purposes) with a view to any rewards, I noted which points might be examined by a special committee formed by Conso. The law must be brought into line with the principles of the a constitutional state. We must be sure about what the person turning state's evidence says, so that we can submit his statements as decisive evidence in trials. [Mazzocchi] What kind of changes are you talking about? [Biondi] We must resolve certain problems concerning the management of people who turn state's evidence. Must the people who hold him in detention be the same as those who interview him? How is his reliability to be established? The solution of these and other problems does not weaken the struggle against the Mafia, but indeed strengthens it. I can therefore guarantee that the government will not take any steps that could weaken the effectiveness of the law governing criminals who turn state's evidence. And if Riina was hoping to address his warning to a weak and indulgent government, I really think he chose the wrong target. Because it will only backfire on him, as I said before. [Mazzocchi] Are you promising greater severity? [Biondi] No, he will not make me alter course; not at all. But since the public cannot fail to have been struck by what has happened, I can assure you that not only will there be no changes to guarantees of security (which is the responsibility of the interior minister) but also that the judicial judgment of criminals turning state's evidence will be carried out by the judiciary with the same instruments that they have used hitherto.
