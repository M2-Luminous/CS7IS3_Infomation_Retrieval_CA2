The ambassador told AKHIR KHABAR that Libyan-Jordanian relations are extremely good. He said there is a plot that is intended to harm Libyan-Jordanian ties, saying that the plot that is being hatched is bigger than the Arab people. He said colonialist nations seek to create problems and sow discord in order to preoccupy the Arab people with bilateral and trilateral problems, in order to peddle their solutions and policies in the region. Answering a question about any official contacts between the Libyans and the Jordanian Government, the ambassador said: The Jordanian Government knows the truth. There is no need for any contacts. It is difficult to discuss denial and confirmation between brothers. Regarding the party that leaked the information to AFP, the ambassador said: We do not know who is behind this. But imagine that the United States has recently said that Libya is conspiring against its security. Who would believe that? Imagine a Third World nation conspiring against the security of a superpower? The ambassador concluded: Reason must prevail in this region. The United States and the colonialist countries should know that we are not little children anymore. We should analyze things. Dialogue is not a bad approach.
