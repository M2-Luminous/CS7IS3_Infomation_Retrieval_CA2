In January, only 10 Sakhalin residents caught the dangerous infection. Enough vaccines and serums have been brought into the oblast for the treatment and prevention of diphtheria. To combat it, the oblast administration has set up a special operational headquarters and has allocated foreign currency for the acquisition of medicines. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the health administration of the oblast, Aleksandr Moshenskiy, that most probably the local internal affairs administration's corrective labor institutions were the source of infection; nearly one-third of sufferers are located in the labor colonies.
