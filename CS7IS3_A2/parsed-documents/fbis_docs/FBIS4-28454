I can still recall the gratitude of 28 May 1964, when the dear comrade leader visited our Haeju Cement Plant and checked the production capacity and operation status of the production equipment, and taught us about the position and importance of Haeju Cement Plant. The dear comrade leader taught us that Haeju Cement Plant should repair and reinforce the production process in the future and apply active modern calcination methods. The dear comrade leader also said production was important, but it was more urgent to build housing units to improve the workers' living conditions. Thanks to the wise leadership and warm care of the great leader and the dear comrade leader, our Haeju Cement Plant has steadily improved in a truly glorious manner for the past 30 years. The development history of our plant was only possible due to the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader. As in the past, the working class of our plant is resolved to share a significant role in carrying out our party's trade-first policy by taking only the leadership of the dear comrade leader as guidance and waging a struggle to implement his guidance with all wisdom and zeal.
