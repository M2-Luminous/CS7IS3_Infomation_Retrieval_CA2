He called the document "a good medicine for treating the civil war syndrome not only in politics but in the economy, too". In the opinion of the head of government, people "who are advancing the reforms, and by whose hand the domestic economy is being moved, remaking itself" had assembled in the Vladimir Hall of the Kremlin. Addressing industrialists, bankers, and farmers, Chernomyrdin stressed that the Treaty meets the main task "of seeking out civilized ways of bringing together personal views and approaches in order to develop the economy." In his view, this search should go beyond the field of political confrontation, "where nothing can be grown except weeds." The head of government noted that the president, government, Federal Assembly, political parties, and public movements had made considerable efforts to get going the kind of machinery which could generate ideas and bring conflicting sides together. He believes that the Treaty "is only the start of the search for accord. The most important part of this idea is still ahead." The prime minister assured people that the government had taken on specific pledges to deal with the paramount tasks "to stabilize the situation, move the economic reforms forward, reduce the inflation rate, implement structural reorganization, increase investment activity, and create the conditions for development of the agro-industrial sector". Chernomyrdin expressed the hope that active support for this would come from the entrepreneurs, bankers, leaseholders, and all businesses. He sees implementation of the Treaty only through working together. He also gave assurances that the government was obliged to pursue an active social policy aiming to target support at the vulnerable in society. "We are now at the height of the crisis, but we can already feel solid ground beneath our feet," the head of government noted. In his opinion, "we need to push off from here and move upwards. To do that we need accord and the conscientious work of every member of society". "We cannot allow ourselves to have a crumbling state," the head of government stressed.
