Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the likeliest choice to succeed Hosokawa as head of the governing coalition, political sources said. Business leaders hope a new administration led by Hata will normalize stalled Diet proceedings, paving the way for early passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and favorably affecting the domestic economy. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), expressed hope that the new government will continue to pursue a policy of political and economic reform. Officials of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) said the new government will never be allowed to abandon the reform policy in light of domestic and international situations. Some business executives, however, said the political situation remains shaky as a new round of political reorganizations seems to be inevitable.
