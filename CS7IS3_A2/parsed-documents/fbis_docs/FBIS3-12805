This is neither the first of such Zionist atrocities nor will it be the last to be committed by the hated and anti-Islamic savages in Tel Aviv. In nearly 50 years of occupation of Muslim Palestine, international organizations, charged with safeguarding the security and territorial integrity of smaller countries, have turned a deaf ear to this injustice. The illegal Jewish settlements populated by recent Russian and East European immigrants are ripe for physical violence because of social, religious, and cultural incompatibility of the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian population. It was this incompatibility that lead to the Black Friday massacre of February 25. Israel's refusal to abide by UN resolutions 242 and 338, and its subsequent settling of Russian and East European Jews in Arab lands created a common belief among the Zionist population that they can get away not only with stealing Palestine but also with the mass murder of Palestinian Muslims. The selective and totally biased way in which the UN implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for this latest Zionist savagery. The United States has been trying to create for itself the image of an honest broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict. America has been trying to convey to the Muslim world that its interest in brokering peace in the Middle East is based purely on humanitarian motives and is free of any political and financial considerations. But, the recent history of U.S. and Western European mediation in this conflict has proven that the West only acts when it is assured that the consequences of its actions are not against Israel or Western interests. Transplanting a mostly Eastern European Jewish community to the heart of Muslim Middle East in 1948 was done by the UN under orders from the United States without any regard for the rights of the indigenous people of Palestine. Considering the continued indifference of the West to the plight of the Palestinians, the time has come for the world's Muslims to take the initiative and begin implementing independent measures to resolve this historical injustice. The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East.
