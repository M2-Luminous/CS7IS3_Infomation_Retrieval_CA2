Facing declining popularity at home and the whiff of scandal, Mr. Clinton might have decided to demonstrate his machismo and secure an improvement in his popularity ratings by talking tough with the Japanese. It is equally possible that, with barely a month left for the ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations at Marrakesh in Morocco, the U.S. has deliberately decided to cock a snook at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] by reactivating a provision Act that symbolises the arrogant unilateralism of the world's richest nation. The revival of Super 301, an instrument that the U.S. government claims will be used to pry open inaccessible markets, makes a mockery of all that has been painstakingly achieved by trade negotiators at the Uruguay Round. The decision has ostensibly been provoked by the Japanese refusal to play ball. It is true that Tokyo has not demonstrated its full commitment to the principles of free trade and multilateralism that it preaches to others, particularly to developing countries like India. It is also true that the U.S. political leadership has been unable to keep pace with the deft diplomatic footwork of the Japanese. Pique, however, cannot be the basis of policy. If Washington is aggrieved that the Japanese have resorted to unfair trade practices, then the matter should be referred to GATT's dispute settlement mechanism. Developing countries, worried about their own trade prospects, are bound to ask whether the Uruguay Round was not a waste of time if the U.S. can continue to act unilaterally with impunity. While the present U.S. move is aimed against the Japanese, India, which has in the past faced the threat of action based on both Super 301 and Special 301, may have to worry about a similar response in its case. The U.S. pressure on India to liberalise the import of consumer goods is patently unjustified since the Indian government has clearly stated that it has a medium-term agenda of trade liberalisation which has to take into account the interests of domestic industry in the transition period. The Indian government has demonstrated its commitment to trade liberalisation once again in the Union budget for 1994-95. However, the pace of liberalisation cannot be increased under external pressure. Indeed, such pressure can only be counter-productive in a democracy where governments are sensitive to opposition criticism, as Mr. Clinton should know. The U.S. government must appreciate the fact that, despite its refusal to comply with the multilateral rules of the game in areas such as textiles trade, where the U.S. has bullied the world into a slower phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement, it is the developing countries which have shown a greater commitment to multilateralism despite their unenviable economic conditions and prospects.
