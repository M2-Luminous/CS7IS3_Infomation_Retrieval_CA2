The Parliament resolution said however that "the military aggression is being pursued and that Croats as well as Serbs continue to perpetrate atrocities in Bosnia-Hercegovina." Parliament called on European Union ministers and the United Nations to take the necessary steps to immediately stop Serb militias from attacking Moslem-populated Srebrenica, Zepa, Maglaj, Tuzla and Bihac. It also warned the Croatian government of sanctions if Zagreb continued to maintain troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
