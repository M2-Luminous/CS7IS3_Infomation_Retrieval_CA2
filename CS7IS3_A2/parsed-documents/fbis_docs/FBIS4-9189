Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) said it asked French President Francois Mitterrand Thursday to intervene on the matter and Mitterrand expressed his full support for the initiative, a spokesman said. "The situation has worsened tragically in Gorazde in the last few days," the group said in a statement. "Most of the wounded are dying from lack of care, the hospital is partially destroyed, water and electricity have been cut and food stocks have been shelled." Most of the 1,324 people wounded since the latest Serb offensive started against the Moslem enclave on March 29 are "civilians, women, children and old people," it said.
