"It is undeniable truth that during a joint luncheon on Friday [18 February] I informed Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec that I had drawn out my personal proposal to solve the situation in Bosnia and I gave him rough outlines of my initiative's contents," Baudys told a group of Czech journalists in Ankara, where he has been on a three-day official visit since Sunday [20 February]. The Foreign Ministry today published a statement saying that Baudys had consulted his proposal with neither the foreign minister nor the government and that the Foreign Ministry had learnt about it from its foreign partners. Baudys said that after hearing the information, Zieleniec said that "if he is asked, he will reply that he had not been consulted on the matter." Nevertheless, he tried to reach Baudys in the morning on Saturday [19 February] because he had found out that the initiative had already been dealt with by visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "Kozyrev probably got a copy of my plan from the Russian Embassy in Prague, to which I also sent the document," Baudys said. He stressed that in reaction to Zieleniec's effort to reach him he personally delivered the complete text of his proposal to the Foreign Ministry. "It is true it was in English, but the on the other hand, the Foreign Ministry had the document as early as Saturday's morning," Baudys added. Some members of the Czech delegation in Ankara said the "almost hysterical" reaction by Czech political circles had harmed his position in talks with Turkish officials. Baudys's initiative was received quite favourably by Turkish Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan on Sunday, the day of the Czech delegation's arrival in Ankara, but on Monday [21 February] Turkey's stance palpably changed and at the start of the official talks, Golhan rejected the initiative diplomatically, but unequivocally. This happened in spite of the fact that Golhan was acquainted with the initiative as early as Sunday, as he himself said, because he got it via the Turkish Embassy in Prague. According to information from the Czech delegation, it cannot be ruled out that Baudys's reception by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Foreign Minister Himket Cetin planned on Tuesday [22 February] will be cancelled. The possible excuse would be lack of time due to a government session and preparations for local elections. According to the same sources, Baudys's initiative was accepted during his talks at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Ankara and "it is not ruled out" allegedly that U.S. high-ranking officials will appreciate it.
