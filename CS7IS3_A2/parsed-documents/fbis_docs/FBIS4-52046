Stocks of the Thai grain are beginning to pile up at both the wholesale and retail stages in reflection of its unpopularity among consumers, the officials said. The step is temporary and the agency will decide on further measures after seeing how sales go, they said. Rice wholesalers said, however, it will be difficult to adjust the oversupply in Thai rice unless the government continues to cut down on its compulsory allocation. The agency has so far sold domestic rice, imported medium- to short-grained rice, and long-grained Thai rice at a 3-to-5-to-2 ratio. Thai rice has proved difficult to sell, with many consumers leaving packages at stores after unwillingly buying them in a set with other types of the grain, according to industry officials.
