This truth was recently once again proved by Leonid Kuchma, who paid a short, but rich visit to the Dnieper Region. The ex-prime minister and present leader of Ukraine's Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a claimant to the post of president of the state launched a decisive attack on the consciousness of his former fellow countrymen and associates, whose support at the forthcoming presidential elections he is seriously counting upon. At the "conference," which was hastily convened by the Interregional Block of Reforms [MBR], those present were showered with not quite radiant forecasts. In this, the people's deputy and one of the MBR leaders may successfully compete with yet another fellow-countryman -- Pavlo Hloba [not further identified]. It is true, though, that the proponent of the strong hand and single power in the state, unlike the psychic, does not specialize in collapses in the city underground or similar trifles: Leonid Danylovych [Kuchma]'s line of business is economic and sociopolitical cataclysms. However, this time, the former head of government and presently, according to him, a dissident Ukrainian politician ("I said at the news conference in the United States -- I am not allowed to go anywhere...") failed to amuse the public. Old cliches were mainly played back -- that Ukraine on its own will not be able to emerge from the crisis, that it must urgently decide with whom it is going to side, that, without Russia, former USSR republics, or CEMA countries, we will not survive, and that as early as in June there will be a social explosion, not to mention economic paralysis (therefore, it is pointless to postpone the presidential elections), that contradictions between western and eastern Ukrainian regions are on the rise, and this may lead to unpredictable consequences.... However, a number of ideas voiced by him indicated that it is too early to brand Kuchma as a steadfast political dogmatist. Since he has not been in power and in view of the new realities, his views have undergone a gradual evolution. For example, perhaps for the first time in his numerous interviews, which have abounded in eastern Ukrainian newspapers over recent months, the advocate of Ukraine's federal-land structure came out against the immediate territorial revolution in Ukraine and explained that we can get "26 Crimeas" -- in the opinion of the ex-prime minister, federal-land structure is a long-term prospect for the state. L. Kuchma also spoke harshly against elections to local councils. He argued his position with the circumstance that "due to the apparatus games of the leadership of the former Supreme Council, we tried to return the Soviet regime, but in a more monstrous form." Having destroyed the vertical structure and having thereby endowed leaders of regions with powers "similar to those of the president" in the sphere of resolving not only economic, but also political issues, the state, in the opinion of the claimant to the post of its leader, risks much. With all the ardor of the former head of the Cabinet of Ministers, L. Kuchma also touched upon prospects of the Ukrainian economy. In his firm opinion, most radical reforms are imminent there, since "70 percent of everything that we manufacture takes the form of assembly parts for CIS countries." The general of the defense industry compared Ukraine with a huge base for the building up of the Russian military-industrial complex and emphasized that Ukraine neither did nor does manufacture a single type of weapon in its finite form, and that "somebody took good care of that." For many people, the following discovery made by Leonid Danylovych, an old-time and frank proponent of "a closer union" between Ukraine and Russia, came as a surprise. "I am not calling for the return to the Soviet Union, because it is impossible. This is because in such a situation, even if, tomorrow, we were suddenly to wake up in the Union, Moscow will never invest anything in provinces. Nor can Ukraine go back to the ruble zone, although such voices do sound today among the directorate -- for this is a single policy with regard to taxation and a single emission bank. This is really a complete loss of statehood...." In short, there were enough political passages to succeed in confusing the audience on which was the true Kuchma and which the politician, counting on obtaining as many votes as possible at the elections and, in practice, constructing a pyramid of political autocratic rule in Ukraine. At that point, the audience was offered, on the rebound, a model of the following type of administration: Leonid Kuchma did not conceal either his admiration for the fact that [Yuriy] Andropov [former Soviet leader] established order in the country "without a single tank" or his disposition to "cruel" [zhorstoki] measures for establishing order in the state. "It is not a slip of the tongue," pointed out the politician, "not stringent [zhorstki], but precisely cruel" and explained that, by this, he implies unconditional fulfillment of current laws by everybody without exception. The speech and the answers to journalists' questions generally attested to the well-considered nature of Kuchma's presidency program and also to the fact that the MBR leader is seriously counting upon this victory. However, Leonid Kuchma did not sound like a candidate for the post from this specific alliance, and, in Dnipropetrovsk, he does not stress his close affinity to it, thereby giving yet another reason to think that great politicians never remain lifelong friends with losers. Instead, Kuchma did not persist in denying that his program coincides with the program of left-wing forces -- he pointed out his readiness, whenever necessary and possible, to cooperate with Communists and even with National Radicals, however, it looks like this is also up to certain point, because he does not recognize coalition governments, or governments of confidence, or such things. "I can say that I made the trip to the United States in order to ask what kind of Ukraine the Americans wanted to see," admitted the politician, having stressed yet another time that not only was he proceeding to power by the path beaten by the Russian president, but that he was also confident of victory in the elections. But will Leonid Danylovych have enough like-minded supporters?
