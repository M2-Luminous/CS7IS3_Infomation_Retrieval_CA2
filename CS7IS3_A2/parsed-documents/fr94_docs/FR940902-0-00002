FR940902-0-00002 FR940902-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Parts 920 and 944 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;920&hyph;1FR] Kiwifruit Grown in California and Imported Kiwifruit; Increase in Minimum Size Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule increases the current minimum size requirements for kiwifruit grown in California and for kiwifruit imported into the United States that are shipped to the fresh market. The minimum size requirement is increasing from Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. This rule will prevent shipments of low-quality, undersized kiwifruit from having a negative effect on the market. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule becomes effective September 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Hessel, Marketing Order Administration Branch, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2526&hyph;S, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456; telephone (202) 720&hyph;5127; or Rose Aguayo, California Marketing Field Office, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102 B, Fresno, California 93721; telephone (209) 487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling of kiwifruit grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. This final rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including kiwifruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United States are prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements as those in effect for the domestically produced commodities. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. There are approximately 65 handlers subject to regulation under the order and about 600 producers of California kiwifruit. There are approximately 75 importers of kiwifruit. Small agricultural service firms, which include kiwifruit handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers, importers, and producers may be classified as small entities. Under the terms of the marketing order, fresh market shipments of California kiwifruit are required to be inspected and are subject to grade, size, maturity, pack, and container requirements. Current requirements include specifications that such shipments be at least Size 49, grade at least KAC No. 1 quality, and contain a minimum of 6.5 percent soluble solids. The production of California kiwifruit for the 1993 season was approximately 12.3 million tray equivalents, compared to the 1992 season production of 13.3 million tray equivalents. This represents an 8 percent decrease in California kiwifruit production from 1992 to 1993.
