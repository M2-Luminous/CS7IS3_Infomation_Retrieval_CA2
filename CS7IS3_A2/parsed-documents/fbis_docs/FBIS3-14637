[Abu-Zayidah] First, this is a very serious incident. It is an unforgivable act by the Israeli undercover units. To cold-bloodedly kill six Palestinians, six Fatah members, in broad daylight is an extremely dangerous thing. [Abu-Zayid] But, the Israelis; that is, the military authorities have claimed that they were armed and masked. [Abu-Zayidah] This is nothing new. The appearance of masked men on the Palestinian streets has become a familiar phenomenon. The same goes for carrying arms. This is no reason to kill them. If the Israeli authorities want to kill whoever uses a mask or carries arms, this means that they will kill hundreds of Palestinians every day. I do not think that this would be a reasonable thing to do. [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah: How does the typical Palestinian view current developments, particularly at this point in time when Israel and the PLO are attempting to resume their talks? [Abu-Zayidah] The entire Palestinian people are deeply saddened and pained. They are shedding tears of blood on their martyrs. At present, they cannot conceive of negotiations or a peace agreement, of a resumption of the negotiations, or of a halt to them. [Abu-Zayid] Have you submitted your recommendations to the PLO with regard to resuming or halting the negotiations? [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian leadership is fully aware of even the most minute developments here. In light of these developments, the proper decision that will promote the Palestinian people's interests will be made. [Abu-Zayid] Has there been a retreat in the Palestinian people's support for the peace process? [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian people have not thus far seen any tangible result, even a modest one, from the peace process. On the contrary, since the convening of the Madrid conference, they have seen calamities. It goes without saying that this is bound to influence their convictions. Certainly, this latest incident will not help strengthen the Palestinian people's convictions regarding peace. Nonetheless, the Palestinian people hope that the Israeli Army will withdraw from the occupied territories so that peace may prevail in the region. [Abu-Zayid] Notwithstanding these incidents, do you expect progress in the peace talks at present? [Abu-Zayidah] The natural outcome of this incident should be the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza Strip in general, and from Jabalyah Camp in particular. [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, Fatah leader in Gaza Strip, thank you very much. [Abu-Zayidah] You are welcome.
