The same sources say that some time ago al-Turabi met with 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a representative of the Islamic Reform Group; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Yasin, a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood in Yemen. He persuaded them to reject the Pledge and Agreement Document signed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Jordan. The sources note that al-Turabi claimed to some Yemeni forces that the continuing political crisis in Yemen will eventually lead those he called "the Islamic forces" to control power both in northern and southern Yemen.
