Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah told an estimated 20,000 people in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern suburbs: "The (anti-Israeli) Islamic Resistance has been born anew." Nasrallah, frequently interrupted by mourners chanting Islamic slogans and calling "Death to Israel" and "Death to the United States," vowed that the guerrillas were ready for a "Jihad (holy war) until victory." He called on Lebanon to pull out of Middle East peace talks with Israel, following Thursday's raid. "Giving peace and security to Israel is forbidden. We call on all the mujahidin (Islamic fighters) in the world and in occupied Palestine to consider this cause their own," he said. Around 5,000 mourners also gathered in the Syrian-controlled town of Ba'labakk for the funeral of five fighters, while 1,500 others paid their last respects to 13 guerrillas at a ceremony in the southern port of Sidon. The coffins of 10 fighters and the portraits of two others were carried shoulder-high by mourners in the southern suburbs of Beirut. In the southern port city of Sidon, marchers chanted in unison: "War, war until victory" and vowed to liberate Jerusalem from Israeli occupation. Ahmad Manna', 60, the father of one of 13 Hizballah "martyrs" from south Lebanon, told AFP: "I still have seven sons and I will offer them for the sake of Allah and for liberating south Lebanon." Shaykh Nabil Qa'uq, a Hizballah official, said Hizballah was determined to "strike Israel anywhere and at any time." Lebanon has declared a national day of mourning and called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, branding the Israeli raid a massacre and an attack on its sovereignty. Shops, schools and public offices were closed. Radio and television stations broadcast classical music or verses from the Koran, and the authorities ordered that flags be flown at half-mast. Airport traffic was also suspended for one hour. The Iranian-backed group said 26 guerrillas were killed in the raid and 40 others wounded. But Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz put the death toll at 45 while hospital officials in the al-Biqa' said 85 were wounded.
