One of the five candidates for the post of finance minister is Mikulas Dzurinda, the main economic expert of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), a source close to the Slovak Finance Ministry has told CTK. Dzurinda is an unambiguous supporter of the market economy, and may meet with opposition from the left-wing parties. In 1991-1992 he was economic deputy to the Slovak Minister of Transport and Communications. Moravcik said on Monday that the post of foreign minister, another hotly contested seat, should be filled by a non-party "professional diplomat." CTK has learnt from a reliable source at the Foreign Ministry that most suitable in terms of experience and skills are the ambassadors Eduard Kukan (at the UN), Frantisek Lipka (Paris) and Jan Kubis (Geneva). Also "close to Moravcik," the source said, is director of the Administrative and Information Department of the Foreign Ministry Dusan Rozbora. The parties negotiating the new cabinet agree Slovak foreign policy should be coalition and not party-directed, as it has been till now. Other possible contenders for the post are director of the foreign committee of the presidential office Pavel Demes, and former Czechoslovak ambassador to Vienna, Magda Vasaryova, now head of the Slovak Society for Foreign Policy.
