After the Federal Cabinet adopted the "1994 white paper" on Tuesday [15 March], Ruehe told the press that the compulsory military service system would remain a "constituent element of the Bundeswehr." The army is underfinanced, and its duties and funds must now be harmonized, Ruehe said. The important thing is to carry out consistent streamlining schemes now. He had ordered the necessary studies, the minister said. The ratio between investments and operational spending must be improved to the advantage of investments. The Bundeswehr must remain efficient and modern. By reducing the strength of the armed forces to a maximum of 370,000 men, as agreed in a treaty concluded between Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in the Caucasus in 1990, this process will be largely concluded. Ruehe emphasized that precedence has to be given to the establishment of readily available crisis reaction forces. Germany must be able to participate in all UN tasks without any reservations. The Federal Government is ready to assume this responsibility. Clarifying the constitutional basis for all Bundeswehr missions is thus in the interest of the predictability of Germany's foreign and security policy and in the interest of the Bundeswehr. NATO's, the European Union's, the CSCE's, and the United Nations's ability for crisis-management must improve. The army needs light, air mobile, and air mechanized units for the crisis reaction forces. In addition, air transport capacities must be extended. The navy must also provide forces for crisis reaction. According to Ruehe, the Bundeswehr's "control and strategic surveillance capability" are of vital importance in this connection. It must be possible to transfer armed forces contingents over large distances by sea and air. In this connection it is also important to secure the supply for these forces. Ruehe pointed out that, since 1990, the Bundeswehr has been engaged in the greatest transformation process in its history. The white paper, due to appear on 5 April, shows that Germany's security is now higher than ever before, Ruehe said. Never before has Germany's strategic situation been as favorable as it is now. "Today we are surrounded only by friends and democracies, all of Germany is enjoying the protection of NATO and the European Union." The current document is the ninth white paper. The last report was issued in 1985 by Manfred Woerner, who was the CDU defense minister at the time. The first white paper on security policy was published in 1969 during the era of the Grand Coalition.
