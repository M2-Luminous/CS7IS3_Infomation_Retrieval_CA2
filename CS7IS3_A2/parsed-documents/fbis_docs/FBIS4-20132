The total order will be in the range of 10 billion German marks [DM]. Apparently, the supply of submarines to Taiwan is to open the door for selling a German ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed train worth DM30 billion to the Chinese island republic. Direct supply of submarines to Taiwan, but not cooperation, had been prohibited by the Federal Security Council in Bonn. HANDELSBLATT has been told that the U.S. Congress is expected to amend the Taiwan Act in the near future to create the legal possibilities in the United States for supplying the submarines produced jointly by German and U.S. firms.
