The third installment of these reports -- "Hongyun Company Builds the Bridge" -- gave an account of the role it has played as a starter in the reform of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. It was also this company that had offered the first expenses for the training of the corporation's surplus personnel, which has created a favorable "microclimate" for in-depth reform. This article will mainly brief readers on how the Beijing Match Plant, a breakthrough point of reform in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, trained and diverted more than two-thirds of its staff and workers to work elsewhere. Where lies the difficulty in revitalizing large and medium-sized state enterprises? The greatest difficulty lies in the inability to divert numerous surplus personnel to work in other units because enterprises find it very difficult to absorb these personnel by themselves and society also finds it difficult to bear the burden, as the social insurance system is still unsound. That is why people called this a "tight knot." The Beijing Match Plant, with a staff of 868 people, was a subsidiary of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. It had only 60 people left when it reorganized and moved out of the urban district to continue its match production. The surplus personnel all were diverted to other units, but none of them lodged a complaint against the plant, appealed to the higher authorities for help, or created trouble. This great event -- and in Beijing Municipality, at that -- was handled very smoothly and without causing any disturbance. How did they untie this "tight knot"? Neither society nor enterprises were in a position to bear the burden of surplus personnel. Hence, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation created an independent intermediary organization to manage its work force -- an organization that takes on the responsibility for untying the "tight knot" from beginning to end. As a matter of fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation succeeded in discovering a starter -- the Hongyun Company -- for the development of state assets and comprehensive reform. Meanwhile, the issue of relocation and placement of labor resources also was resolved, and funds for establishing a compensatory unemployment insurance mechanism have been relatively sufficient. However, who will undertake the heavy responsibility of "diverting the staff and workers to work elsewhere"? In fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has studied the solution of the increasingly serious problem of redundant personnel over the past few years. There were nearly 80,000 staff and workers in the corporation. Even if the factor of industrial structure was not considered, the rate of surplus personnel still exceeded 30 percent. A few years ago, in order to invigorate the employment system, they optimized labor organization, which resulted in a reduction of 8,000 people from among the 80,000 staff and workers. For this reason, the corporation was at the forefront of the entire municipality in this respect. However, owing to the unsound insurance system, excessively scanty amount of unemployment compensation, and the inability of the untrained personnel to enter the market, most of the staff and workers returned to their original posts one after another, and a number of new contradictions were elicited accordingly. "The diversion of staff and workers in state-owned enterprises should be resolved by way of a market mechanism, but should not wait until the perfect establishment of a labor market. Therefore, it calls for setting up an economic entity that will act as an intermediary for the development and placement of labor force in keeping with the market law." This is a consensus reached by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation through assiduous exploration of the issue of diverting staff and workers to other jobs. Consequently, when the Hongyun Investment Company -- an asset development company -- was founded, expenses needed for the diversion of staff and workers were allotted from this company to set up an economic entity with independent assets: the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company. Its duties are as follows: 1) The management of staff and workers during the removal period to redevelop the assets of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation; 2) The training of staff and workers to enhance their quality; and 3) The transition from a centralized job placement system to a new employment mechanism suited to the market economic structure through the integration of labor force employment system with labor insurance system, so as to achieve the objective of appropriately assigning jobs for staff and workers in society. This labor force management intermediary organization took overall responsibility for unemployment insurance, training for job transference, and job assignment of the asset development enterprises [zi chan kai fa qi ye 6327 3934 7030 4099 0120 2814], so that state-owned enterprises were able to perform the tasks of asset development "with light burdens." In this regard, we may say that it was the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company that untied the "tight knot." The big pot has been broken, and everyone is longing for a new and fine bowl after being trained. People hope that those in work can have more pay for more work, that those who are our of work need not worry about their food and clothing, and that those who seek new jobs will also obtain benefits. They have something to wish for and have actually gained something. Thanks to these "two wheels," the diversion of staff and workers has progressed at a more rapid pace. At the end of 1993 when the match plant, with a history of 70 years, was leveled to the ground amid the rumble of bulldozers, the staff and workers really could not calm their feelings. "I can do nothing but dip the heads of matches and package them, so I am incapable of finding a new job. What am I to live on in the future?" Just a couple of months later, the once-agitated and disappointed hearts were overflowing with beautiful aspirations. Among the 868 staff and workers, some of the elderly ones retired ahead of time, others were transferred to work in a new factory, and it was arranged for the remaining 558 personnel to receive training for other posts. On the basis of full investigation and study, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company has made training plans in line with the requirements of society and of management and service work for the small residential district built on the site of the original match plant. Here, the company started 14 training courses, including business accounting, computer science, enterprise business administration, commercial services, cooking, cosmetology, hair-dressing, gardening, driving, automobile maintenance, tailoring, and so on. After these people were released from work to receive training for three to 12 months, those who passed examinations were issued certificates certifying their qualifications for reemployment, their grades, and their standard equivalent to technical secondary school graduates. In this way, they were qualified to participate in the talent competition on the market, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of two-way selection between enterprises and individuals through training so that the superior ones were able to find new jobs. For this reason, staff and workers were extremely enthusiastic about attending training courses. Some said: "Reform did not kick us out and leave us alone. The state has spent money on our training, paid our basic salaries, and prepared us for re-employment. That is why we are most willing to learn, despite fatigue and hardships, because it is to our own benefit to learn the skills, is it not?" Some types of work -- like driving and hair-dressing -- require higher and special skills, so the trainees must pay for part of the expenses. They paid readily, without saying a word. Without doubt, the opportunity to find an occupation again, the pressure of obtaining a job based on one's own qualifications and not by assignment, and the pursuit of a new profession are powerful driving forces for staff and workers to keep their minds diligently on their studies. In addition, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company also gave consideration to appropriate interest stimulation for the job-awaiting staff and workers, who live on their salaries, through the following measures: 1) The salaries of staff and workers who persist in production are higher than their original levels; 2) Salaries during training are lower than those received when they were at work; 3) The compensation given to personnel waiting for employment is larger than social compensation; 4) Sick and resigned personnel are given a lump-sum subsidy in an amount generally equivalent to one-third of their annual income; 5) Those who suspend work and pay while retaining their posts are granted a lump-sum subsidy, but should pay unified funds for old age and management fees for keeping files; and 6) Those who resign and will find jobs on their own are given subsidies equivalent to their salary income of two and a half years. Within two weeks of the announcement of these measures, four people asked for transfers, three resigned, and most of the students in the driver training course said they would try their best to find jobs by themselves after the training. Overstaffing is not only a tough problem for asset development enterprises, but also one that state-owned enterprises wish very much to resolve. In-depth exploration is being carried out at a new level. Although students in various training courses had not obtained their graduation certificates, recruitment units in society began to call on them, one after another. The restaurant service training class would finish its course by the end of April, but a unit told the students that it would come to recruit more than half of them at the end of March. The gardening class was in similar circumstances, as a unit readily announced the recruitment of half the students.... However, personalities responsible for the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company did not dare to relax their efforts in the least. The aim of this company is to take care of the work to divert nearly 20,000 staff and workers in 32 enterprises engaged in asset development or relocating to other places. Liang Jingao, general manager of the company, proposed an even higher goal: The Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company ultimately should undertake the entire task of diverting all surplus personnel in the state-owned enterprises under the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, so that all these enterprises can shake off their burdens and "march with light packs." In light of the large numbers of surplus personnel prominently existing on the Chinese sides [xiao mu ti 1420 3018 7555] of joint ventures at present, they have decided to start with this, by using for reference the practice of diverting personnel in enterprises that are relocating. According to this practice, a joint venture pays an amount in the form of compensation to a labor service company to discharge the expenses of training its surplus personnel so that they are capable of finding jobs again in the labor market. Recently, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company began drawing up plans to train some 180 off-the-post staff and workers of a joint venture: The Convenient Foodstuff Factory.
