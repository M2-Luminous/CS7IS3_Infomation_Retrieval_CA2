Venugopal: "Kanshi Ram is a Step Ahead of Mayavati"; all quotation marks as published] [Text] Kochi, 30 March. Kanshi Ram, the BSP president, has supported party General Secretary Mayavati's criticism of Mahatma Gandhi. He has went one step ahead and accused the Father of the Nation of not being the benefactor of the untouchables, and being a supporter of a "very shrewd caste system." During his interview with The JANSATTA on Wednesday, he also accused Gandhi of being against scheduled caste leaders' entering temples. The BSP president said, "Mr. Gandhi did not permit E.V. Ramaswami Nayaker, then president of Tamilnadu Congress, to participate in the Vaikome satyagraha. This forced E.V. Ramaswami to resign from his position as the president and leave the Congress Party." To show Gandhi's archaic beliefs about untouchables, Kanshi Ram referred to Gandhi's talk with a Namboodri Brahman of Vaikome temple as written by Mahadev Desai. This talk was related to untouchables passing through the temple. This talks went like this: [Mr. Gandhi] Is it appropriate to deprive a whole group of Hindus of using a public path just because they were born in a lower caste, especially when this path is used by non-Hindus also?" [Trustee] How can we help them? They are suffering the consequence of their Karma. [Mr. Gandhi] There is no doubt about it. They are suffering the result of their Karma by being born as untouchables. However, why are you increasing their punishment? Kanshi Ram, referring widely to Mr. Gandhi's articles said that Mr. Gandhi wanted to maintain a shrewd caste system. He especially brought to our attention the following except from Mr. Gandhi's comment in the 6 March 1937 issue of The HARIJAN. ``Every person should follow his forefathers' occupation under the caste system. A person born in the family of a Bhangi [sanitary worker] should earn his living as a Bhangi. He can't do anything else...that is what I believe to be Hindu religion." Kanshi Ram said that Mr. Gandhi had insulted the untouchables by calling them Harijans [God's people]. "There is no respect for the word Harijan now. Will Narasimha Rao like it if we call him a Harijan?" He asked. He said that after Mayavati's controversial statements about Mr. Gandhi, her "price has risen from 5,000 rupees to 100,000 rupees in Uttar Pradesh." (Kanshi Ram explained that according to a U.P. custom, the people contribute a specific amount to their leader after a speech. Thus, the amount presented to a leader measures his or her popularity.) When asked if it was appropriate for him to speak against Mr. Gandhi after getting the support of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, Kanshi Ram emphatically replied, "We did not ask for Congress Party to support us. It supported us on its own." Discussing the political situation in Uttar Pradesh, Kanshi Ram said, "I have asked Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to show some results within six months. Of this time, four months have already passed. I hope that he will be able to perform better during the remaining months." When asked if he was satisfied with the performance of Mulayam Singh's government, especially in the deteriorating law and order situation and brutalities on backward group, he said, "I do not think Mulayam Singh himself is happy with it." He alleged that the Congress Party, the Janata Dal, and the BJP have joined forces in Uttar Pradesh to make problems for Mulayam Singh's government. Kanshi Ram said about Kerala that his party will focus on foundations at present and will not try to form any coalition with another party. He flatly said that he has no desire to form a coalition with the new party formed by K.R. Gauri who has defected from the CPM [Communist party-Marxist], because "She is tied to her Marxist philosophy." He added, "Mrs. Gauri has formed this new party for her own reasons. There is no ideology behind it. If she were not expelled from the CPM, she should have remained in it even now." He said, "After she has talked with the Social Justice Party that claims to support social justice and the Peoples Democratic Party about forming a coalition, then we can discuss that."
