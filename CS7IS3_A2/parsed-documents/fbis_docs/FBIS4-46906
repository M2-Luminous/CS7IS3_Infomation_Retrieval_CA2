In accordance with the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] Law "On the Minimum Living Standard in the Republic of Tatarstan" signed by the president of the RT, M. Shaymiyev, on 20 October of last year, the cost amount, make-up, and structure of the minimum living standard are periodically published in the mass information media. The republic's inhabitants should know the cost amount of the minimum living standard for the additional reason that according to the RT Law "On the Minimum Wage," the minimum amount of labor payment cannot be lower than the minimum living standard. So, according to RT Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee] data for March, the value of the minimum living standard for Tatarstan rose by 11.1 percent (at an absolute value of 3,729 rubles [R]) and totaled R37,445 as opposed to R33,716 in February. And expenditures for food rose by 11 percent and totaled R28,808 or 76.9 percent in the structure of the minimum living standard [MLS] (figure 1 [not reproduced]), expenditures for nonproduction goods increased by 16 percent and totaled R3,420 (9.1 percent), and expenditures for personal paid services rose by 7 percent and totaled R3,495 (9.33 percent). Analysis of the expenditure headings of the minimum living standard shows that in March prices for nonfood goods rose at a faster rate (16 percent) than for food (11 percent) and for personal paid services (7 percent). The cost of the minimum consumer budget [MCB] in March rose by 8.5 percent and totaled R131,984 as opposed to R121,595 in February. The structure of expenditures of the MCB: expenditures for food--R53,085 (40.2 percent), expenditures for nonfood goods--R36,077 (27.3 percent), expenditures for personal paid services--R36,750 (27.8 percent), and expenditures for taxes and other payments--R6,071 (4.6 percent). Analysis of the cost of the minimum living standard by cities and regions of the republic shows that the cities of Kazan (R40,324) and Naberezhnyye Chelny (R35,678) continued to be the most "expensive" in Tatarstan in March, while the "cheapest" were the city of Bugulma (R32,822) and Aksubayevskiy and Sabinskiy rayons (R31,437 and R31,516, respectively). Besides the consumer budgets, personal income is also classified as a basic social indicator. According to the rough estimates of RT Goskomstat, average per capita income for Tatarstan in March was R90,100, which is 1.2 times the February figure (R74,870). In studying the rate of growth in the cost of the minimum living standard and average per capita income during 1993, we saw that average income during the year rose by a factor of 9.7, while the minimum living standard rose by a factor of 7.3 (see RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN of 27 January 1994), that is to say, last year the standard of living of the average statistical resident of the republic did not decline at least. But if we study the year from March 1993 through March 1994, we get a slightly different picture. In March of last year, the MLS was R4,500 and average per capita income was R11,800, while in March of this year the corresponding figures were R37,440 and R90,110. During the period from March of last year through March of this year, average per capita income rose by a factor of 7.64, while the cost of the MLS rose by a factor of 8.32. This means that the rise in prices exceeded growth in our income and the standard of living began to fall in 1994. Here mistakes made in managing the economy most likely began to have an effect. For example, the Government just did not manage to "force" the directors of certain enterprises to comply with the law on the minimum wage and instead of R30,000 (the "minimum" in the RT since February of this year), R14,620 (the minimum for the Russian Federation) are paid. This is another example: the minimum living standard in March "stretched" to R37,400, while the "minimum" is balanced at just R30,000. But we have already written that the minimum living standard is the line where poverty begins. And that in evaluating the standing of living the cost of the minimum consumer budget must be taken as the reference point rather than the cost of the minimum living standard.
