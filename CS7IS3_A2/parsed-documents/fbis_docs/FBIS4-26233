Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, told a press conference that "there is no need for Taiwan to immediately respond to the mainland's urge to hold high-level talks or the fifth round of negotiations...because Taiwan's call for special negotiations to work out ways to safeguard Taiwan tourists on the mainland has been snubbed by Beijing." "Taiwan on several occasions urged the mainland to talk over compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in March 31's Qiandao Lake crime, but ARATS [Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait] has yet to respond to our request," Kao said. Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, faxed a message to C.F. Ku, president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Thursday recommending the two meet either in Taipei or a third place to tackle cross-strait issues. ARATS again raised the proposal in another fax to the SEF on Friday. The two semi-official organizations are authorized by their respective governments to handle private exchanges between the two sides in the absence of official contacts. Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first time to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements were signed during the historic meeting. Cross-strait relations have been severely strained due to the killings.
