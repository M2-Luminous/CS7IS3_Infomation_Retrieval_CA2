Brittan went on to add how he, personally, was greatly in favor of the proposal which had been jointly presented to the European Union [EU] by Andreatta and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In a meeting with the press, Brittan went on to say how he was "very impressed by the determination with which the Italian government has moved forward with political and economic reforms" adding how Rome's action has been "important for all of Europe." According to the EU executive commissioner, it is also essential that "Italy be a founding partner in monetary union as it was for the birth of the European Union." For his part, Foreign Minister Andreatta told the press how he and Brittan had spoken "in a very explicit way" about their expectations for this year which will see, among other things, the end of Jacques Delors' term as President of the European Commission. "I pointed out," Andreatta said, "how it will be the next Italian government which will adopt a position on these arguments... I also urged that he take part in the debate on these problems during the European election campaign, in order to clarify certain points which have made our public opinion somewhat suspicious in his regards." Brittan, in fact, in recent months took very defined positions in European matters which raised strong opinions in Italy, in particular regarding the steel industry and state aid to industry. Italian Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi this evening also had "long and cordial" talks with European Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan on the GATT trade accord, the prospects for boosting world trade, and reinforcing European Union monetary and economic integration while making sure that "national public opinion and productive sectors" share the EU governments' aims, the premier's office reported. Brittan shared Ciampi's concerns in these areas and stressed their importance for EU enlargement and trade competitiveness, the premier's office communique said.
