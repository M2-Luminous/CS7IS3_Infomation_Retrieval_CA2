Only the stabilisation in finance will make it possible to intensify investment processes in the economy which are to become the basis for overcoming the economic crisis. Andrey Shapovalyants, the first deputy Russian economics minister, said this on Thursday, addressing the international conference on oil and gas. A number of measures that the government plans to take in the financial area this year should arrest the growth of the pace of inflation, he noted. A rigid crediting policy and the course at limiting the expenditure of budget funds will stay. The issuing of credits should not increase beyond seven per cent. The first three months of the current year showed the possibility of limiting the inflation growth to ten per cent a month, he said. There is every reason to believe that this index will remain valid till the end of the first six months. If considerable seasonal expenditure from the budget is avoided, the growth of inflation in 1994 may be cut by half as compared to 1993. The government intends to preserve state regulation of prices of products of natural monopolies. This means a strict direct control over the level of prices and their change. The stabilisation of the financial situation will also be promoted by the introduction of control over the pay in the budget area, by the regulation of domestic and world prices through export-import tariffs and direct pricing of products of state enterprises that manufacture them on commission from the state.
