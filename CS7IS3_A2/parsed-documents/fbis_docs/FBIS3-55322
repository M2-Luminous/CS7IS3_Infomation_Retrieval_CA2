The Justice Ministry's statement, distributed on Thursday, says that the aim of this measure is "to announce Abkhazia as a sovereign state" despite the UN and Security Council decisions. (As is known, their resolutions reconfirm Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.) "The intention to hold a referendum at a time when ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Georgian population are underway in Abkhazia is cynical," underlines the statement. To this effect the ministry declared that "according to Georgia's laws and norms of international law, results of this referendum will have no legal force."
