Subpart A_[Amended] 3. A new §86.092&hyph;15 is added to Subpart A to read as follows: §86.092&hyph;15 NO X and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines. (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for the NO X and particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs are described in the applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. Participation in these programs is voluntary. (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, within the averaging set restrictions described in this section. (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination thereof. Credits may not be used to offset emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL. (iii) Credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year shall be used, prior to using other available credits, to offset emissions of engine families with FELS exceeding the applicable standard. (b) Participation in the NO X and/or particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows. (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall: (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NO X and particulate). (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or more of these three programs.
