FR940722-0-00059 FR940722-0-00014 North Dakota also proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(d) to provide that the applicant shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the Commission finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual coal production for all locations exceeds three hundred thousand tons during the 12 months immediately following the date the operator is issued a surface coal mining and reclamation permit. North Dakota proposed this revision of its rule in order to implement the proposed statutory provisions of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota's proposed revision of its rule at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(d) is substantively similar to section 507(h) of SMCRA and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(2). 4. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) Finally, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) to provide that the applicant shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the applicant sells, transfers, or assigns the permit to another person and the transferee's total actual and attributed production exceeds the three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons] annual production limit during any consecutive twelve-month period of the remaining permit term, and that the applicant and successor are jointly and severally obligated to reimburse the Commission. Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the recently revised corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). North Dakota's provision serves to impose reimbursement liability based upon the annual production rates for the entire term of the permit, whereas the Federal regulation only takes into account the production rate for the twelve months immediately following the date on which the permit was originally issued. Therefore, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e). 5. Summary Based upon the above discussion, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1) (a) through (e) are not inconsistent with section 507(h) or SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.12(a) (1) through (3) and is approving the proposed rules. h. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2), Small Operator Assistance_Applicant Liability_Good Faith Waiver of Liability for Reimbursement. North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) to limit the circumstances under which the Commission can waive the reimbursement obligation of an operator who receives SOAP assistance. Prior to this amendment, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) allowed the Commission to waive a SOAP applicant's obligation to reimburse the Commission for assistance whenever it found that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. North Dakota now proposes to limit the Commission's discretion by revising NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) so that it provides as follows:
