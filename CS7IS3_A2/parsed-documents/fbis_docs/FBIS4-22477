Where?"] [Text] Residents of Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, or Uglich say with a certain pride that they no longer live in an oblast but in a province, although official confirmation of the title of the region is being delayed, as usual. This upsets Yaroslavl residents because the seemingly innocent word "oblast" reminds them of the oblast party committee and its permanent First [secretary], nicknamed by the populace "tsar Fedor." The current Yaroslavl leader, however--Governor Lisitsyn--is respectfully called Anatoliy Ivanovich even in the most remote kolkhoz. During the December elections to the Federation Council, voters in the province not only cast the absolute majority of votes for the governor but also, unlike other Russian regions, did not fall for the temptation to play into the hands of Zhirinovskiy's party. [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, are you not afraid that authoritative figures on a local level, given the weakening of the center, will wittingly or unwittingly contribute to Russia's repeating the fate of the Union: disintegration into individual principalities, rural districts, provinces... [Lisitsyn] I am against the "parade of sovereignties" started by my colleagues from Sverdlovsk Oblast. And when he proposed himself for the post of speaker of the Federation Council, I spoke sharply against it. In the current explosive political situation it is enough to set a precedent, and a chain reaction will start... To allow fragmentation of the Russian state--in no matter what form--means to nullify history. [Sevryukov] The economic crisis in each region has its own local flavor. Everybody in Yaroslavl remembers the February rebellion of "red directors," who were threatening an interregional strike... [Lisitsyn] It did not reach this point. And the "rebellion" had been provoked to a large extent not by industrialists but trade unions, who constantly destabilize the situation. We were able to reach an agreement, though, and identified the principles and positions on which we must immediately support enterprises: reduce road tax and property tax. We also defined a long-term economic development policy. On this we worked together with Ye. Gaydar's institute. We prepared 37 promising programs, some of which may qualify both for federal investment and investment on the part of international mortgage banks. We plan to present this unique Yaroslavl-Gaydar program to a broad circle of businessmen and economists in Moscow from 24 to 28 May, during the Yaroslavl Oblast week in the capital. I recently visited Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod. We compared our provinces' indicators of agricultural production and discovered that Yaroslavl Oblast has experienced a smaller decline in the livestock herd and has a higher milk yield and higher average wages. As to agriculture specifically, the entire secret is that since 1992 we have been directing half of our budget money into that sphere. [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, in a recent interview to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Sergey Shakhray remarked that what is happening in society today is a battle between three elites: Moscow, regional, and sectoral. Do you agree with such a formula? [Lisitsyn] This fight is not only perceptible--it is coming to the forefront of domestic political life. If you take federal organs of administration and local organs, the problem is that the experience accumulated in the regions is being ignored by our government. The government is attempting to implement on his own a mechanism of economic reform without analyzing regional experience. All attempts from the grass roots level to have our experience finally put to use have been fruitless. I am particularly bitter about this, since I am a member of the board of the Governors Union, whose task is to propagate the regions' experience. [Sevryukov] Yaroslavl Oblast was among the first to hold elections to the oblast duma and local organs of representative power. There have been accusations, however, that the elections were undemocratic, since heads of administrations participated in them, which violates the principle of separation of power... [Lisitsyn] First, I have to tell you that these elections were held in an extremely difficult political situation. Strictly speaking, there were attempts to derail them. And the key opposition figure, sad to say, was the president's representative in Yaroslavl Oblast. When the election campaign was already in full swing, and after we had already spent about 2 billion rubles on it, he suddenly proposed to move the elections to the fall. And later urged the population not to turn out for elections altogether, not to vote. Nevertheless, the oblast duma has been elected and is now functioning. It is a group of competent people, professionals. And the fact that almost half the duma deputies are members of the executive branch does not indicate in any way that the elections were undemocratic. [Sevryukov] You have been governor for two and a half years now. Has the pilgrimage to power given you the sense of satisfaction over what has been accomplished? [Lisitsyn] Complete satisfaction--no. Especially now with the departure--again--of Gaydar, whose economic concept was the foundation of our region's development. A point of legitimate pride for the governor's team is probably the stability of the socioeconomic situation and secure civil peace. I think that to a large extent credit for this goes to the Civic Consensus Union, created under the governor two years ago; it includes representatives of all--without exception--parties and movements. Each month they all gather together--essentially, political opponents: Russia's Choice, the communists, the national-patriots... With all our disagreements, we have learned to come to agreement, because it is in the interests of the people.
