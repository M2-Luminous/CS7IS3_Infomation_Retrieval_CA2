For it is clear to even the least informed (it is clear even to Zhirinovskiy, I am sure) that the Serbs are the aggressors and the main culprits of the orgy of brutality in the former Yugoslavia. More than merely beginning to tear away Serbian enclaves from Croatia and Bosnia (and wanting prior to this to compel by force even Slovenia to remain part of Yugoslavia), they captured entirely foreign territories, expelling from and driving out of them the indigenous population with the aid of terror and violence--a practice and crime wholly monstrous at the end of the 20th century, in Europe, what is more, at the center of Christian civilization! All this is as clear as two times two is four. Yes, brutalities are being perpetrated there now by all sides, and there is no justification for this, but it was Serbia's aggression that started it, and it alone can end it, having ceased the aggression and having returned the captured territories, wholly foreign territories--in which Serbs do not live--at least. And it is further clear to everyone that this aggression was begun and continues in accordance with the wishes and under the leadership of the nomenklatura communists, who still hold sway in Serbia, and that they are doing this to hold on to power, distract attention, and appear as patriots of a Greater Serbia. And to whom if not us former Soviet people should their behavior be very understandable, we, of all people, should know of what demagogy and brutality communists are capable for the sake of power. Finally, it is clear also that the European countries should long ago have intervened and stopped this medieval war, just as it is clear that it cannot be stopped by political measures alone, without the use of military force or the decided intention of its use. And it is a disgrace that the NATO countries have not yet done this. Compare this with Kuwait! If there were oil in Bosnia and Croatia, all would have been ended a long time ago. But flowing there, instead of oil, is merely blood, which is not quoted on the world market. The democratic community of the West considers the incapacity of its authorities to halt the orgy of cannibalism at the heart of Europe the breakup, virtually, of Western civilization, capitalist civilization, I am sorry to say. And only the Russian political elite, which is represented in all branches of power, thinks otherwise, more precisely, pretends to think otherwise, and wants once again to put Russia in a position in opposition to the world's democratic community. The profound immorality of Russia's politicians, who for the sake of gaining political dividends within Russia are prepared to hamper the efforts to finally halt the bloodshed and violence in Bosnia, can be seen behind this position. Is not the shelling from guns at Bosnian cities, in which peaceful people, old men, women, and children, are dying, reminiscent of the shelling of the White House, in which there were women and children also? But the deputies of the Federal Assembly are not demanding an investigation or trial of those guilty of shelling the House of Soviets. They are demanding (of the Foreign Ministry) protection of Serbia's "Special Militia" against possible strikes, which is far easier and safer (for the deputies). We should, generally, clearly understand the cause of the clamorous attempts of all branches of power to protect the "Slav brothers" in the Balkans (as though Bosnians and Croats are not Slavs!) or the Russian speakers in the Baltic. They are caused by the fact that the authorities are incapable of protecting Russians in Russia! Incapable of protecting them against gangsters and hired killers, incapable of changing the situation engendering a tumultuous growth of crime, incapable of protecting people dying from the lack or cost of medicinal drugs and inadequate medical assistance and on account of the scant diet and polluted environment, and incapable of protecting them against state and mafia robbery. But let us imagine: Inflation has been halted, prices are headed down, production is up, housing is being built once again, crime is being suppressed. Zhirinovskiy, of course, would be shaking his fist even here (what else could he do?), but the majority of deputies and leaders of the executive would not for anything be going against the Western governments in their attempts to halt the war in Bosnia. They would have no need to earn political capital from dubious protection outside of Russia or to kindle hysteria over the dubious violation of the rights of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic (which is not comparable to what is being done against Russians in some southern republics of the CIS, where, however, Russian troops are protecting the local authorities against the opposition!). Just as there would be no need either to conduct ethnic purges in Moscow and Petersburg in order if only in this way to attempt to win sympathy among the most embittered and unethical people. But in defending the interests of the nomenklatura, the majority of members of the executive and the legislature cannot defend the interests of the people. The two are incompatible. It is necessary to deprive of power and ownership (of the means of production) either the nomenklatura or the people. The "democrats" are defending the interests chiefly of the new and center nomenklatura, the "communists," the old and peripheral nomenklatura, and the "national patriots," both and, particularly, the interests of the nomenklatura of the power departments. Under these conditions, how could they all not defend the interests of the Serbs in Bosnia? More precisely, rattle the air in their defense or not approach the hot line with Washington. The world is now anxiously conjecturing whether fascism is possible in Russia. The appearance of the majority of politicians in Russia in the wake of Zhirinovskiy against an ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia indicates that it is possible. An atmosphere of immorality and cynicism is the vital environment of any fascism and an essential condition. The unimpeded and endless decline in the living standard of the majority of the population is a complementary condition. P.S. When I had already completed this article, there came the report of a statement of Churkin, deputy minister of foreign affairs, whom this report called the personal representative of the president (!), to the effect that the Western governments were misinterpreting the latest UN resolution giving its secretary general the right to sanction the use of military force in Bosnia without Security Council confirmation. No, Churkin declared, the Security Council must on each occasion confirm such a sanction. Thus Churkin, as the personal representative of the president, has, aside from anything else, disavowed the statement of Vorontsov, ambassador of Russia at the United Nations, who had declared earlier that the secretary general was "absolutely right" and that Security Council confirmation was not required. Together with everyone else, the Russian delegation at the United Nations voted for the above-mentioned resolution, but after Mr. Zhirinovskiy had scored a success at the elections, the authorities fouled their pants somewhat and in an endeavor to keep up with Zhirinovskiy and the other national patriots in Slav solidarity are renouncing their vote at the United Nations, going back on their own word. The former nomenklatura communists and their retinue are showing the world what the rules of the game mean for them when they are to their disadvantage. All that is useful for the cause of the proletariat is moral. All that is useful for the cause of the nomenklatura, the president, and the government is competent.
