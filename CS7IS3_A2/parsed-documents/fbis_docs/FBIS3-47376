The paper of pannational workers in South Korea questioned if the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian government, and wrote that if the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian government, it should prove that it differs from the Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military governments. However, it is not different from a military regime. The traitorous nature of the civilian regime has been intensively exposed. It is not an accident that the South Korean people brand and condemn the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a fascist regime far surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republics. If the South Korean ruling bunch wants to carry out genuine civilian politics, it should first abolish the National Security Law, which infringes upon and obliterates the people's political rights and poses an obstacle to national reunification. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is maintaining intact the National Security Law -- a remnant of a confrontational era and military dictatorship that instigated anticommunism and confrontation -- and committed antireunification and antinational acts. By wielding this law, it is cruelly oppressing the people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification. One example is that in May 1993 the fascist ring, by mobilizing more than 100,000 police forces, atrociously suppressed the struggle of youth, students, and citizens demanding revelation of the truth of the Kwangju incident and punishment of those responsible for the incident, and injured people three times more than that of the Sixth Republic. At the end of May 1993, the civilian government viewed it as a crime that South Korean youth and students wanted to participate through an international telephone line in the first cochairmen delegation's meeting of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] and suppressed them by exercising the National Security Law. On 12 June, it mobilized more than 12,000 combat police to block the northward road of South Korean youth and students advancing to Panmunjom in order to attend North-South student talks, and arrested more than 370 of them on the spot. The civilian fascist regime claimed that the holding of the Fourth Pannational Rally in Seoul hosted by the South Korean reunification and patriotic forces is also a violation of the National Security Law and committed the criminal act of blocking the rally. With the National Security Law still in force, numerous reunification and patriotic figures have been imprisoned and are moaning in 222 police stations, over 3,400 police branches, and hundreds of prisons across South Korea. According to the data, which was even reduced by the authorities, the South Korean prisons are overflowing with prisoners numbering 60,000 to 70,000. That the civilian regime is only in name is also proven by the fact that the Kim Yong-sam ring, like previous military fascist dictators, has not disbanded the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] -- the general headquarters of fascist suppression -- despite the people's stern denunciation, but assumes it as a shield for its survival. Although the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, forced by the people's resistance, publicized the reduction of the NSP, in actuality, it transferred some of the NSP's functions to various offices and agencies of the administration, and posted others in research institutes it newly organized. Moreover, it newly established the Anti-North Strategic Planning Bureau and reorganized and expanded the NSP's structure, thus committing a crime. Presently in South Korea, the NSP exists as an oppressive organization supporting the civilian regime, which is in a crisis. The civilian regime is instigating confrontation between fellow countrymen, and works out smear incidents one after another. Thus, it is running amok to suppress the patriotic reunification forces. The South Korean people will never tolerate the civilian regime, which follows the tracks of the Fifth and Sixth Republics, and will sternly punish it without fail.
