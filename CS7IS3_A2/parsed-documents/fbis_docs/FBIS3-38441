The two presidents essentially discussed economic problems, according to Mario Carrera, spokesman for the Federal Department of Finance (DFF). Bern and Tashkent said they wanted to strengthen their relations, the DFF spokesman added. Switzerland and Uzbekistan signed two agreements last year, one relating to economic cooperation and the other to investment protection. The Uzbek president expressed the wish that cooperation between the two countries should not stop there. Mr. Karimov, who reminded Mr. Stich of his country's major economic potential, stressed the positive role played by the big Swiss banks in Uzbekistan, Mr. Carrera added. The two presidents deemed it necessary to continue the economic reforms in the framework set out by the IMF. Uzbekistan is a member of the voting group headed by Switzerland within the Bretton Woods institutions. Mr. Stich and Mr. Karimov also discussed the general political situation in Central Asia, particularly the case of Tajikistan. Following this short meeting with the president of the Confederation, the Uzbek president is due to go to Davos to participate in the economic forum.
