The agreement came at a time when intra-coalition discord over the new "national welfare tax" plan threatened to bring down the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The accord was reached at a meeting of the leaders of seven coalition parties who banded together to mitigate the crisis, they said. Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key coalition party, told a news conference after the meeting, "coalition parties have reached the conclusion that they should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and implement a tax cut as they could not reconcile their differences over the plans." Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect of the plan to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The new accord also calls for scrapping a plan to implement an income tax cut of 6 trillion yen. The Finance Ministry had planned to cover the cut with revenue earned from the proposed new tax, the officials said. The ministry's original plan called for issuing deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be imposed in three years' time. The crisis emerged when the largest governing party, the Social Democratic Party, threatened to quit the coalition in protest at Hosokawa's plan to impose the new 7 percent indirect tax. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference that representatives of the ruling coalition parties had not been able to reach a conclusion on the tax proposals. "Although the coalition representatives discussed various aspects of the matter, we could not reach any agreement," Kubo said. "We therefore drew up a tax reduction plan and the new tax will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more time discussing the matter." Kubo revealed that he proposed at the meeting the implementation of an income tax and that an alternative source of revenue be decided after further discussion. Asked about a possible meeting of heads of coalition parties, including Hosokawa, he said that if such talks are proposed, the SDP will make its decision based on the opinions of the party chief, Tomiichi Murayama.
