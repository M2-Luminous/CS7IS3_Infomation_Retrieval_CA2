Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that they informed Ivan Rybkin that the production slump in the oblast has "reached critical mass," beyond which "a disintegration of technological links sets in," and urged the speaker for taking "effective measures." For his part Ivan Rybkin promised to help resolve the most acute problems in order to stabilize the economic situation in the region. However, "What this help is going to be and when could it be forthcoming was hard to understand from what Mr. Rybkin said," stated Viktor Babakov, head of the oblast's Trade Union Federation. He thinks that "promises cannot improve things" today, all the more so because they were given to Novosibirsk people at various levels in the past and have not been acted upon up to now. In the meantime enterprises are grinding to a halt in the oblast one after another, forcing nearly 30 percent of the personnel to go on administrative vacations. Mr. Babakov stated in this connection that the oblast's trade unions demand that the Russian Government immediately send an authoritative commission to resolve the socioeconomic problems on the spot. The Novosibirsk trade unions intend to insist on modifying the tax policy and adopting a state employment program.
