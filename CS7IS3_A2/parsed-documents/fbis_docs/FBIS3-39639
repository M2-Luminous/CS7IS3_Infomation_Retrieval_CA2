Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, headed the UN delegation. The meeting lasted two and a half hours. In a statement after the meeting, Clark said that Kliridhis and the UN officials had a preliminary talk on all the key points and added they will do the same during their meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas this afternoon. Clark said: I do not want to define where we stand point by point. He described the discussion as useful and said it is completely in line with the positive developments and goodwill shown by both sides so far. Asked whether they discussed the map, Clark said they looked at some maps and will surely look at some more. Asked whether there was an agreement on the maps, Clark said the UN officials noted the position they were presented with and will consider it as the procedure develops. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said our side is attending the proximity talks in goodwill and a constructive spirit, aiming to reach an agreement within the four prerequisites set by the UN secretary general. He mentioned that some procedural issues were discussed at the meeting and our side explained its positions on significant issues such as handing over Famagusta's fenced-off area to UN control and the opening of Nicosia Airport. Kasoulidhis noted that our side did not make any suggestions that fall outside the four UN secretary general's prerequisites. He added that safe movement to and from Famagusta and security in Famagusta's fenced-off area during the return of residents and during the work to reconstruct the city are high on our side's agenda and are considered necessary prerequisites for the success of the talks. Our side made suggestions on these issues. Our side also raised the issue of the timeframe in which Famagusta's fenced-off area should be handed over to the United Nations, the time during which the legal residents will be able to get back their property in the first phase, and the time during which the legal residents will be able to get back their property in the second phase in conjunction with the timeframe for opening Nicosia Airport. The spokesman mentioned that our side raised various issues on the opening of Nicosia Airport, always keeping in mind the UN secretary general's four prerequisites. It also discussed with the UN envoys some of its positions on Butrus-Ghali's first document, which refers to 14 confidence-building measures. Kasoulidhis said: We have not exhausted our positions on many issues. We will do this tomorrow and we will wait to hear the other side's views. Answering a question, Kasoulidhis said that Kliridhis raised with the UN representatives the issue of Famagusta's fenced-off area map and asked that the United Nations present a more detailed and accurate map to the two sides as soon as possible so that both sides could agree on the map that would be used in the talks. The UN representatives will present the map by tomorrow. Kasoulidhis mentioned that he will release the map that the United Nations gave to the government last May, adding that it was small and did not present the area clearly and with details. In a statement before the meeting, Clark said progress has been made and added that there has been an agreement in principle on the confidence-building measures and an agreement on how we will proceed. Clark said: I hope we will be able to draw a clearer picture on how the two sides approach the key points and discuss them with the two leaders. I intend to discuss all the key points to make as much progress as possible today. I believe there is a basis for some optimism because we have made some progress. The challenge is to maintain this progress in a way acceptable to both sides. Clark said: This is just one phase of the procedure. Success on the confidence-building measures opens the door to success on the most basic issues. Answering a question on whether he will not deal with the first of the seven points on the agenda, Clark said he intends to deal with all the issues today. He said: In every meeting we will define the specific order we will follow. I believe it is important to clarify from the start that we intend to deal with all the points at every meeting. Asked whether Famagusta's map, which is printed today in some newspapers, is the true one, Clark said he did not see the map. The UN envoys will meet Denktas this afternoon.
