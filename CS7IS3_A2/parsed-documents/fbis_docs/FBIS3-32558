Students and factory workers who were protesting the 71.2-percent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline confronted Army and police units with rocks and Molotov cocktails. On Tuesday, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [Conaie], to which 3.5 million Ecuadorans of the 11 million who live in this country belong, had initiated an ongoing Indian uprising. Last Thursday the powerful United Workers Front, comprised of the country's most important labor unions, held a national strike to demand that the fuel price increase decreed on 28 January be repealed. Today other popular organizations held an "empty pots and pans march" to reject the price increase, arguing that as a result of the government's measure food prices have increased. The demonstrators -- including many women carrying posters, banners, and kitchen utensils -- gathered near Central University and at El Ejido and La Alameda parks in downtown Quito and tried to march on the Presidential Palace, shouting slogans against President Sixto Duran-Ballen. Security forces, with the support of light armored tanks, fired tear gas at the crowd to scare away the demonstrators. Conaie has reported that in the Andean province of Azuay, 310 km southwest of Quito, the Army fired on a group of Indians, wounding eight. A general state of discontent is seizing the provinces of Riobamba, Imbabura, and Carchi, on the border with Colombia, according to journalists from those regions. Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has cautioned that the public order will be protected. Official sources have reported that approximately 100 people were arrested in Quito for having allegedly participated in riots.
