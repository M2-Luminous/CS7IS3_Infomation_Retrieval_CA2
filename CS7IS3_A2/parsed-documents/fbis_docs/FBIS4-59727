The political atmosphere surrounding the pilgrimage for Iranians this year is decidedly different from the one last year. If Riyadh's attitude towards Iranian pilgrims was friendly then, this year it is a hostile one. If the Saudis were cooperative and accommodating last year, this year they are trying to make sure Iranian pilgrims would be inconvenienced. According to reports dispatched from Medina, the Saudi police has kept Iranian pilgrims under intense surveillance and they are not left alone to do their religious duties even when visiting the tombs of the members of the Prophet's household held most dear by Iranians. The Iranian pilgrims are also prevented from doing the secondary rituals that usually go with Hajj within the confines of their own religious traditions. The Saudis are imposing on Iranians their own religious interpretation. Altogether the pilgrims are complaining that the Saudi police is mistreating and insulting them. The Islamic Republic's present problem with Saudi Arabia is not limited to whether or not Riyadh should allow the Iranian pilgrims to do their religious-political demonstration, which is regarded as a duty. It is not even over the number of pilgrims that should be admitted in Mecca. It goes much beyond that. With the change of policy on Iran, Riyadh wants to register its dissatisfaction with Tehran's conduct of regional (Mideast) policy. Riyadh regards the various Islamic movements in some of the Middle Eastern countries as having been instigated or supported by Iran. It disapproves of Iran's stance toward the Israel-PLO peace treaty as well. As far as the Iranians' religious demonstration is concerned, the Saudis' refusal has been unduly inimical. Last year the Saudis' approach towards this issue was flexible. Iranian pilgrims were allowed to stage the rally within the premises of their residence in Mecca. A similar and mutually accepted arrangement can be worked out for this year as well. On the number of Iranian pilgrims to go to Mecca, Tehran argues that there has been a sudden unilateral change in the quota. The earlier agreement allowed Iran to send two pilgrims per thousand of its population. Riyadh has changed that to one now, using a contrived argument. Here in Iran there is this feeling that Riyadh has had a change of mind, from one of exercising an independent policy of its own to following the U.S. policy of trying to isolate and put pressure on Iran. Everything considered, the present course of exchanges between Riyadh and Tehran is confrontational in character. And a confrontational policy is not in the interest of either country nor that of the Persian Gulf region as a whole either. After having gone through two wars, and experienced their futility and wastefulness, what the Persian Gulf region needs is calm, understanding and cooperativeness to engage in construction. Unfriendly state of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as Persian Gulf's biggest two countries, causes friction and tension that lead to the loss of human energy that should be used on construction. They also open the way for increased intervention by foreign powers who would be asking for an ever growing share of the Persian Gulf countries' resources for what little they would give. What Riyadh and Tehran need is to engage in dialogue towards permanent accommodation of their legitimate concerns. The emphasis on ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia should be a well-studied and prudent one founded on friendship and solidarity, and not on raising fingers on each other or zig-zagging between tension and calm.
