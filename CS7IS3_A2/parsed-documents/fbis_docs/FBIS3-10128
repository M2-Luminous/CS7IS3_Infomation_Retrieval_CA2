"The foreign military force in our fatherland has been the cause of conflict and permanent disturbance in our relations with the United States, and I think we must not continue having those bases," Munoz added. Munoz pointed out to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that the approximately 5,000 workers employed on the U.S. military bases cannot decide on the economic future of the country. "The canal belongs to Panama," Munoz emphasized while adding that the proximity of the date on which the United States will return to Panama the waterway and the property that is needed has led to "some sort of a race and fight to see who is going to get part" of the same. He criticized those persons who have asked at one time or another for the military bases to stay and described this as "a humiliation, a disillusion, and a shame." Munoz, 63, is a lawyer and a pilot. His running mates are Rodrigo Bernal and Julia Suira, as candidates for the first and second vice presidency, respectively. According to the politician, the renegotiation of bases "does not at all lessen the merits of Panamanian nationality," but in order for that to occur the two parties must be in agreement, after having vacated them under equal conditions.
