In a few hours he will leave Hong Kong ending his visit to the Far East. He is pleased and said that this visit, involving business worth millions [of contos], was positive for Portugal and China. Marina Pimentel reports: [Pimentel] Business deals worth over 100 billion escudos were signed with China or are close to being finalized. The figure was confirmed by the prime minister today. [Begin Cavaco recording] Tens of millions, tens of millions contos [1,000 escudos]. If we add the contracts already signed to those contracts which could be signed as a result of declarations of intent, we will go over 100 million contos. [end recording] [Pimentel] Cavaco said this figure surpassed all his expectations. He was speaking at a news conference in Hong Kong, convened mainly for the media of the territory, which like Macao is going through a transition period to Chinese administration. Cavaco was questioned mostly about the different stances between Portugal and Great Britain in their relations with China. Unlike the situation in Macao, the Hong Kong transition process is experiencing some tension -- mainly due to the hard stance which the current governor has taken regarding guarantees of democracy in the territory after 1997. Cavaco did not tire of repeating that Portugal is not experiencing similar problems, because things were sorted out in the Joint Declaration that Lisbon and Beijing signed in 1987. Cavaco also reiterated what he has been saying throughout his visit: He does not like to discuss human rights in public, but that does not mean he did not discuss them with the Chinese authorities.
