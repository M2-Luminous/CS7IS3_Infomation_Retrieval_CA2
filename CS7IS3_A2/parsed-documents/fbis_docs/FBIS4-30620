[Central] Java -- The Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) is expected to provide loans worth 5.1 billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia this year, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said. The CGI would still discuss the exact amount of loans at its meeting to be held in Paris on July 7 and 8, he told reporters after addressing a seminar on the Indonesian Tax System for the Second Long-Term Development Drive here on Saturday. But he said the amount of loans would not be so much different from that of the previous year due to the appreciation of Japanese yen against U.S. dollar. The minister said CGl's loans to Indonesia were directed towards financing the construction of physical facilities and infrastructures, the promotion of women's role, and the implementation of a presidential instruction-based backward village promotion program. The construction of public utilities would top the list of priority in the utilization of the loans, he said adding projects which had not been completed in the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita V, 1989/1994) would be completed in the Sixth Repelita. He made it clear that some CGI-funded projects would be exempted from income tax in accordance with a joint agreement signed by Indonesia and CGI member countries. Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance/Development Supervision Saleh Afiff will lead the Indonesian delegation to the Paris meeting. The finance minister himself will not attend the meeting because he will visit several world important cities on those days.
