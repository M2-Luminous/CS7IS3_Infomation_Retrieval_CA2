EPA reasoned that diesel vehicles always operate at such lean fuel/air ratios that their idle CO emissions would always be well below the standards. The methanol rule applied idle CO standards to all methanol-fueled vehicles because the Agency was aware of diesel methanol vehicles which were throttled at idle. This same reasoning was applied to gaseous-fueled vehicles, and EPA proposed that idle CO standards apply to all gaseous-fueled vehicles, not just Otto-cycle vehicles. Summary of the comments: The few comments EPA received on this issue were in opposition to idle CO standards for engines which operate at lean fuel/air ratios. The commenters stated that lean burn engines emit very low CO levels, and that there is no need to regulate and test for emissions which are inherently low. EPA response to the comments: The Agency recognizes that lean burn engines do traditionally have much lower CO emissions than vehicles operating at stoichiometric fuel/air ratios. However, EPA believes that not enough data yet exists on diesel gaseous-fueled vehicles to justify their exemption from the idle CO standards. The Agency is especially concerned about those diesel designs which employ throttling at idle. It is likely that these vehicles will have no problem meeting the idle CO standards by virtue of their design and that, this being the case, the only burden this standard presents is that of the actual certification testing and reporting. Thus, certification testing waivers for diesel gaseous-fueled vehicle idle CO standards will be available to manufacturers that can demonstrate through emissions test data or other engineering data that a vehicle will, by virtue of its design, always emit at levels well below that of the applicable idle CO standard. 2. Crankcase Emissions Summary of the proposal: Currently, all vehicles and engines, with the exception of non-naturally aspirated petroleum heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDE), are prohibited from discharging crankcase emissions into the atmosphere. The current prohibition is not applicable to non-naturally aspirated petroleum HDDEs due to concerns that the routing of oil mist-laden crankcase gases through turbochargers and other air handling equipment may foul this equipment. With the issuance of the methanol vehicle emission standards in 1989 this prohibition was applied to all methanol HDDEs whether they were naturally aspirated or not. The reasoning was that methanol engine crankcase gases were expected to be cleaner than petroleum diesel engine crankcase gases, and closer to gasoline engine crankcase emissions which are been routinely routed through turbochargers. Given that gaseous-fueled vehicles are also expected to have cleaner crankcase emissions than petroleum diesels, this prohibition on crankcase emissions was proposed to be applicable to all gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines as well, with no exemption for non-naturally aspirated, gaseous-fueled HDDEs. Summary of the comments: In general, the comments received in this area were in opposition to crankcase controls for gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines. Some commenters suggested that crankcase controls only be applied to naturally-aspirated gaseous-fueled engines, as is currently the case with petroleum HDDEs. Others stated that, due to their inherently low emissions, gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines should be exempt from all crankcase emission provisions. One commenter expressed concern about crankcase gases possibly fouling turbochargers, and then went on to say that gaseous-fueled vehicle crankcase emissions will be inherently clean and thus do not need to be regulated. EPA response to comments: In the absence of compelling data showing that gaseous-fueled vehicle crankcase emissions are cleaner than those of their petroleum-fueled counterparts, the Agency believes it is prudent to extend the coverage of the current prohibition on crankcase emissions to include gaseous-fueled HDDEs. Additionally, EPA believes that, since the crankcase prohibition for methanol-fueled HDDEs is not limited to naturally-aspirated engines, as well as the fact that crankcase emissions are routinely routed through gasoline engine turbochargers, there is no reason to exempt non-naturally aspirated gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines from the crankcase emissions prohibition. As was noted in the leadtime discussion, the Agency expects that current technology gaseous-fueled engines will be able to meet these standards, and therefore the minimum amount of leadtime to allow for certification has been given. However, since turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs are generally derived from turbocharged petroleum HDDEs they do not tend to have crankcase emission controls. The Agency believes that, while the four year leadtime requirement in section 203(a)(3)(C) of the Act is not legally binding in the case of gaseous-fueled heavy-duty engines, in circumstances where the manufacturers must make changes to engine designs similar to those made to comply with changes in gasoline or petroleum diesel requirements, section 203(a)(3)(C) may constitute a proper default period. In order to allow for the early introduction of gaseous-fueled HDDEs, the Agency is providing four years leadtime for crankcase controls on turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs in the absence of factors indicating that another period is more appropriate. Thus, this provision will take effect for the 1998 model year. It should be noted that the four years of leadtime only applies to turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs, and that the crankcase emission provisions for all other classes of gaseous-fueled vehicles will take effect with the 1997 model year mandatory certification, as well as for vehicles and engines certified optionally prior to the 1997 model year.
