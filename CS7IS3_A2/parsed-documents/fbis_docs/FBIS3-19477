FBIS3-19477 "drweu052__a94023" FBIS-WEU-94-052-A Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 ANNEX Germany RAF Letter Denies Steinmetz Membership AU1603152294 Hamburg DPA in German 1413 GMT 16 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1603152294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Red Army Faction (RAF) has raised its voice again: In an 18-page letter to the east German daily JUNGE WELT, the terrorists denied that Klaus Steinmetz, an undercover agent of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], was an RAF member. Steinmetz was involved in the antiterrorist operation at Bad Kleinen on 27 June 1993. The RAF letter, which was described as authentic by BfV experts on Wednesday [16 March], notes; "Had our contacts with Steinmetz been as intensive and close as claimed by the state protection propaganda, we would have uncovered him as a cop." According to the RAF, there was no cooperation with Steinmetz for the blowing up of the "Weiterstadt jail" on 27 March last year. Statements claiming anything else are "lies." The "alleged membership of a cop in the RAF" is an action intended to further defame the organization in public. Such rumors were spread by the "state protection propaganda." According to information provided by JUNGE WELT, the declaration also rejects BfV claims that the RAF stayed in touch with supporters through a mailbox. The sole purpose of these statements is "to destroy the communication structures of the radical left." For the first time, the terrorist organization has made a public comment on the split between the RAF prisoners. The split was not caused by the negotiations of lawyer Christian Stroebele on easing prison conditions and the early release of prisoners, but the fact "that some prisoners had split with us long ago." The split was the result of "longstanding antagonisms that have never been clarified." The RAF wants to stick to its objective of establishing, along with all revolutionaries, a "social counterpower from below," and to dispense with attacks against leading state and business representatives. The underground organization has admitted its failure. "We are further away from the social identifiability of our struggle than in past years." The letter further states: "Since the operation of Bad Kleinen, it has been absolutely clear to us that parts of our attempt in past years to use our concrete initiative for the freedom of the prisoners, even in an era of transition to new regulations, has failed and cannot directly continue that way." Today the left "is not tangibly present, not because there are no leftists, but because they hardly try to develop a joint force." "In the developments of the past few years that culminated in the rift, we crashed on the basis of reality. As political setting prisoners/RAF [als politischer Zusammenhang Gefangene/RAF] we have not managed to build on the experience of 23 years of struggle for this process together. This is a defeat," the extensive paper further states. It is signed: "Red Army Faction, 6. 3. 1994" and bears the RAF emblem with a submachine gun against the background of the five-pointed RAF star. According to JUNGE WELT, the letter was received by the Berlin daily on 15 March.
