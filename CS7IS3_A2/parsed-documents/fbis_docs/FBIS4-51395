Mayor Zhang Lichang disclosed this before the opening of the '94 Tianjin Export Commodity Fair tomorrow here in this, north China's biggest port city. More than 300 overseas executives from many international consortiums and transnational corporations are expected to take part in the grand fair, co-sponsored by over ten provinces and autonomous regions in north and northwest China. The mayor first expressed his warm welcome to all the overseas business people who intend to attend the fair. He said he hoped that the Tianjin's economic ties with overseas firms in industry and commerce throughout the world will be further strengthened on the basis of mutual interests and benefits. Situated in the center of the Bohai Bay area, Tianjin, with a population of more than nine million people, is also an important industrial center in north China, he noted. The 55-year-old Zhang, who graduated from the Economic Management Department of Nankai University in Tianjin, said the city was one of the first group of coastal cities authorized in 1984 by the state to open to the outside world. As a port city it boasts a number of advantages of convenience in transport by air, sea and land, enormous potential for industry and scientific research, and advanced urban infrastructural facilities, he said. At the same time, he said, Tianjin has stepped up the formulation of rules and regulations concerning foreign affairs, built the country's first service center for foreign investment and streamlined the registration procedures for foreign-funded ventures. According to the latest data, by the end of March this year Tianjin had signed contracts for 6,682 foreign-funded enterprises, involving an investment totaling 7.9 billion U.S. dollars and with a direct use of foreign funds of 5.35 billion U.S. dollars. The foreign funds used in the first quarter of this year jumped to 250 million U.S. dollars. The mayor said that there are now 15 world-renowned transnational companies involved in investment in Tianjin, including U.S. firms like Motorola, Otis and Coca-Cola, the Japanese companies NEC and Honda, Germany's Henkel, Italy's Zanussi and Hong Kong's Karry. There are eight overseas banks in Tianjin, he added. Zhang said that the foreign investment in Tianjin has two distinct features: Those who have already invested in Tianjin are expanding their amounts of investment and scale of production; and the newcomers are "vying with each other in looking for investment." Zhang, formerly director of the Tianjin Economic Commission, a factory manager and a workshop director, said that the foreign investment in Tianjin is now expanding to different fields, including industry, agriculture, finance and banking, and real estate development, both in rural and urban areas. He said that the local government's policy is to "let foreign investors make money here". In addition to a good climate for investment, the mayor said, Tianjin has great potential for further co-operation. The city has, since 1983, imported more than 7,000 items of advanced technology and equipment from abroad to upgrade its old industrial enterprises. But, he added, much remains to be done because the general situation of outdated equipment and products has not changed. There are about 700 state-owned firms that need to be improved in the coming few years, he noted. As a result, more foreign funds will be needed to upgrade these old enterprises, he said. Talking about the future development of the city, Zhang said that the construction of a new development zone of 2,300 sq km on the coast has already started. He said that foreign funds will also be used to renovate the old districts of the city in the coming few years.
