FR941006-2-00230 FR941006-2-00114 With this in mind, the FHWA has decided, for purposes of enforcing Federal weight law, to allow the rounding of weight values up or down to the nearest whole number of kilograms evenly divisible by 10; this gives a margin of error of about 5 kilograms. In the example above, the 15,422.4 kilogram tandem-axle limit would, therefore, be rounded down to 15,420 kilograms. Five kilograms, just over 11 pounds, are well within the 0.1 percent margin of error allowed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a new certified truck scale. Such a scale could have a margin of error of 20 pounds when weighing a 20,000-pound single axle, 34 pounds when weighing a 34,000- pound tandem axle, and proportionally more for heavier loads. The FHWA believes that this conversion standard will ease the transition to the metric system while ensuring that the weight standards established by the Congress are enforced. We anticipate that implementation of this conversion standard will have no effect on current loading and enforcement practices, as no change in current weight regulations is intended. The FHWA also will allow the measurement of dimensional values to the nearest one-hundreth of a meter. A 48-foot trailer, therefore, would be 14.63 meters long. Since dimensions do not fluctuate like vehicle weights, the FHWA anticipates fewer problems in enforcing these limits. The rule establishing a vehicle width of 2.6 meters as the legal equivalent of 102 inches, 23 CFR 658.15(a) remains unchanged. The metric weight table (appendix A) yields values more precise than those resulting from the rounding method described in this notice. For example, the table shows that a three-axle vehicle with a 32-foot (or 9.75 meter) wheelbase has a gross weight limit of 27,216 kilograms; States may round this figure to 27,220 kilograms. The values in the table have not been rounded, however, because the FHWA will not require States to further round Federal weight standards if they choose not to do so. The metric values in the table represent the conversion of English units which have already been rounded one time as discussed earlier. This notice supersedes the FHWA's previous policy. In a May 16, 1994, letter to the Florida Department of Transportation, which was transmitted to the other States, the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers announced that the Agency intended ``to use as precise conversions as possible to determine the metric equivalent to the English unit.'' After further consideration, the FHWA has determined that the rounding methods described above are consistent with the requirements of Federal law and will reduce the difficulties inherent in switching from English to metric units. With regard to terminology, the FHWA is aware that the correct technical equivalent for an English ``weight'' limit would be a metric ``mass'' limit. However, because of its historic and widespread use, the term ``weight limits,'' when referring to commercial motor vehicles, will be retained for the present time. The FHWA will use the following conversion factors, as established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in its Standard ASTM E380, ``Standard Practice for Use of the SI International System of Units,'' to arrive at metric equivalent measurements: ‚ê£ 1Weight 1Distance and dimensions 1 pound = 0.4536 kilograms 1 mile = 1.609 kilometers. 1 Metric ton = 2,205 pounds 1 foot = 0.3048 meters. 1 Metric ton = 1,000 kilograms 1 inch = 25.4 millimeters. Conversion and Rounding When converting mixed size or weight units, e.g., feet and inches, to the metric equivalent, reduce the measurement to the smaller unit before converting to metric and rounding. For example, 10 feet, 3 inches equals 123 inches; 123 inches multiplied by 25.4 millimeter/inch equals 3,124.2 millimeters; round to 3120 millimeters or 3.12 meters. Converting Part 658 to Metric Measurements The metric equivalent of every English unit of measurement which is used in 23 CFR part 658 and which applies in all States is provided in the following table:
