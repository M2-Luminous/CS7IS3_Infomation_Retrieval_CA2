FR940725-2-00070 FR940725-2-00043 Part II_Programmatic Description and Activities, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date Program Description: CSAT will provide support for up to fifty percent (to a maximum of $50,000) of the total costs of planned meetings and conferences sponsored by new or ongoing constituent organizations or coalitions in their efforts to provide treatment for drugs of abuse. In making award decisions, CSAT will give special consideration to applications that demonstrate the potential for knowledge dissemination, interface with health promotion concepts and practices, promote appropriate resource utilization and/or consensus building, and yield a product (report or document) of specific relevance to furthering of the CSAT mission of improved delivery of addiction treatment and recovery services at the State or community level. For the purposes of this grant program, a Conference is a symposium, workshop, or any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days where persons assemble to exchange information and address information or strategy development needs in such areas as sharing new technologies, problem-solving, network-building or public policy deliberations. While a conference may result in educational experiences, this is not a program to impart training. The conference program should be consistent with the CSAT mission. Under the authority of Section 507, CSAT may sponsor regional workshops on improving the quality and availability of treatment services; however, sponsors of regional workshops may invite people from other regions in the country. The conference may be conducted at more than one site, provided that each separate workshop, meeting, etc., relates directly to the central conference topic. Conferences supported by this program are not intended to carry out research or to synthesize or disseminate research information for the non-clinical scientific research community. However, transmitting scientific information via the conference to those involved in AOD related services or in training to provide AOD services is supportable. This program addresses the HHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people served, preventing future problems, and improving services to customers through modern management approaches. Eligibility: Applications may be submitted by public and non-profit private entities. An individual is not eligible to receive grant support for a conference. Availability of Funds: It is estimated that approximately $400,000 will be available to support approximately eight (8) awards under this program in FY 1995. Actual funding levels will depend upon the availability of appropriated funds. Approved awards will be limited to a maximum of fifty percent of the total costs or $50,000, whichever is less. Period of Support: Awards will be made for a maximum of 12 months. Support for only one conference, as defined above, may be requested in any single application.
