This announcement was made by Foreign Relations Under Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza, who said Frei will leave for Cartagena on 13 June with a small delegation aboard a commercial flight. Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will leave for Cartagena on 11 June to attend the preparatory meetings at the foreign minister level to decide on the proposals to be debated by the chiefs of state and governments. Figueroa also confirmed that President Frei will meet with Spanish King Juan Carlos. He will probably meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Cuban President Fidel Castro. These meetings will depend on Frei's agenda. Insulza confirmed that the Chilean Government has approved the agenda of the summit which will center mainly on economic issues. He added that Frei will promote open regionalism, a policy which Chile has successfully developed at the trade level through bilateral and multilateral agreements. He said the Chilean Government wants a regional debate on growth with equity because it considers overcoming poverty to be the most important challenge for the countries of the region. Regarding democracy, Inzulza said Chile advocates a stronger and better democracy in Ibero-America, efficient governments, honest administrations, and modernization of the state. Inzulza added that Frei's proposals to the summit are closely linked to the general guidelines of his administration. Frei was inaugurated last March after winning the December 1993 elections with 58 percent of the vote. He chose as his government priority the fight against poverty through growth with equity. To do this he created a national commission to fight poverty, which affects 4 million Chileans; some 1.2 million live in extreme poverty.
