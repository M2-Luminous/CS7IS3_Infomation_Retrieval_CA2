Li Lanqing took part in a discussion meeting with leading cadres, teachers, and students of the university. He expressed his hope that cadres, teachers, and students of the school will continue their efforts to seriously carry out educational reform, further improve teaching quality and results, turn the school into a first-rate university in China, and train more students and create more and better capable people for the construction and development of agriculture. Beijing Agricultural University was founded in 1949 by combining the agricultural colleges of Beijing University, Qinghua University, and Huabei University. It is directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture. It has botanical, zoological, biological, resource and environment, and four other colleges with a total of 29 departments. It also has two national-class research institutes and 10 ministerial-level laboratories and research institutes. In recent years, the school has actively promoted educational reform in a comprehensive manner. While strengthening work on teaching and scientific research, the school has considered the popularization of scientific research findings and the development of new and high technologies as important functions of the university. The university has played an important role in promoting local agricultural construction, the "harvest project," and the work of helping poor areas. During the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing heard a report made by Shi Yuanchun, president of the university, and suggestions from professors and experts on the reform of education. Li Lanqing fully affirmed the work of the university in training people to meet the needs of agriculture and developing and popularizing scientific research findings. He said: The key to China's agricultural development lies in having advanced agricultural science and technology, and advanced agricultural science and technology in turn rely on having trained people. Our agricultural colleges and schools should become bases for scientific research as well as bases for training people. Beijing Agricultural University as a university with great influence should shoulder a greater responsibility. He pointed out that we must not overlook the study of basic agricultural science because a good foundation in basic science can further promote the development of applied agricultural science and technology. At present, agricultural colleges and schools with good conditions should start research on important subjects, seek breakthroughs, and use their findings to promote agricultural development. Li Lanqing pointed out: The current reform of higher education should place emphasis on raising the quality and results of education. Therefore, we must change the past pattern in running schools. We should avoid advocating small but complete and should encourage colleges and schools with good conditions to cooperate and jointly run schools so as to give full play to the advantage of a group and create greater social benefits. He said: Beijing Agricultural University has conditions to cooperate with other schools in developing education. Taking itself as the center, Beijing Agricultural University should work together with related colleges and schools to make more reasonable teaching arrangements and to raise the quality and results of education. Li Lanqing said: The training of agricultural technicians should be conducted at various levels. The Ministry of Agriculture should place emphasis on running well one or two key universities to cultivate high-caliber professionals at an advanced level. Meanwhile, it should also improve the existing agricultural colleges and special and technical secondary schools through reform and develop vocational and adult education to promote the development of agriculture, science, and education. Prior to taking part in the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing inspected an exhibition on scientific research achievements, the library, and the agrobiology technology experimental station of the university. Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang; Xu Zhijian, State Council deputy secretary general; and Wang Mingda, State Education Commission vice minister, also took part in the discussion meeting.
