"There will be no return to shock therapy because the prepared measures do not have the nature of a shock," Moravcik stressed. He said the planned increase in the value-added tax imposed on some kinds of food and reduction of subsidies to farming should not "affect citizens markedly," but the lower-income strata might be affected. They would get compensation in order to ensure the transformation's social tolerability, Moravcik said. The government will try to "maintain the deficit on an acceptable level so that we do not run into problems similar to last year's. The deficit of the state budget then was almost twice as big as the level acceptable from the point of view of our ties with international financial institutions," Moravcik said. In consequence the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has postponed the signing of an agreement on a new loan for Slovakia. Moravcik recalled that the IMF would not grant Slovakia a loan unless it keeps the deficit below 4 percent of its gross domestic product. Slovakia had a deficit of 23 billion Slovak crowns (about $696 million) or 6.8 percent of the GDP last year. The state budget is also burdened by the 5.8 billion Slovak crowns deficit on the clearing account used in trade with the Czech Republic, and by debts in the health, education and other spheres which altogether exceed 6 billion crowns. According to the Moravcik government's programme statement the government sector's net debt had risen to 60 billion crowns. Moravcik said the government wanted to take further steps to remedy the Slovak economy. "First of all we would like to markedly accelerate privatisation. During the six months of our tenure (the government was appointed on March 16 and early elections are to be held on September 30-October 1), we want to create the conditions for (a second wave of) coupon privatisation so that it can be launched after the elections. At the end of the second wave, more than half of state property could be in private ownership," Moravcik said. The first wave of coupon privatisation was carried out still within the Czechoslovak Federation and ended in January 1993, shortly after the country split. "Concrete measures will not probably be reflected in the economic sphere and in our citizens' living conditions within the six-month period. Nevertheless we would like to push through steps to give a new dynamic to Slovakia's economic life. But their effect will probably be evident in its entirety only after the elections," Moravcik said.
