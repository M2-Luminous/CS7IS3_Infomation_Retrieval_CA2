High-ranking leaders of the CPP attending this meeting were His Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin, the party's honorary chairman; H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the party Central Committee; H.E. Hun Sen, vice chairman of the party Central Committee; members of the standing committee and of the CPP Central Committee; and thousands of CPP members. Furthermore, personalities representing a number of political parties taking part in the May 1993 general elections; representatives of international organizations; ambassadors of some countries in Cambodia; and representatives of the clergy, intellectuals, students, workers, farmers, ethnic groups, and the armed forces were also invited to attend. Speaking at this big meeting H.E. Heng Samrin, CPP honorary chairman, stressed that we always remember the great and energetic movement of our people throughout the country under the banner of the front for national salvation of Cambodia and the leadership of the CPP that helped save the nation and the motherland and won back the rights, freedom, and hope that were lost. As a result, conditions were created for the revival of various achievements that had been brought about after national independence 40 years ago. H.E. Heng Samrin affirmed that without the 7 January 1979 victory day, the history of our country and nation -- famous for building the wonderful Angkor civilization -- would have been very unjustly concluded. H.E. Heng Samrin said proudly that we now have a progressive constitution genuinely born of the people's aspiration. We have rebuilt the Kingdom of Cambodia under the banner of Nation, Religion, and King, which is the the symbol of solidarity, peace, and progress. Under the roof of the constitution, our land and people are united; no person or force can break up our land and people. Going against this goal is a crime that can destroy the nation -- one which the Cambodian people cannot tolerate. At the end of his speech H.E. Heng Samrin stressed heavily that: [Begin Heng Samrin recording] The brilliant results achieved by our people are certainly most worthy of pride. However, this is only the preliminary and necessary basis for our motherland's long process. Although vigorous demands to raise economic and social living standards are being made, many large obstacles, and minor ones, confront us. If we are negligent and lack vigilance or make any mistakes, this can certainly push society and the nation back to the great disaster of the past. Therefore, all of us should clearly understand the significance and the main goals of this historic phase. We should strive to hold aloft the banner of national independence and the banner of great national solidarity to unite the nation with the aim of vigorously rallying all kinds of forces from all circles to defend the nation; building peace, unity, and stability; and promoting social rehabilitation and development. On this solemn occasion, on behalf of the CPP, we would like to appeal to the clergy, all religious followers, intellectuals, pupils, students, civil servants and officials, workers, employees, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, the national police, artisans, artists, traders of all ethnic groups, and all citizens in and outside the country to unite around the king; firmly abide by the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia; actively take part in successfully implementing the political program of the Royal Government; and strive to defend the social and national achievements in order to reinforce the foundation of happiness and prosperity of our nation. We appeal to various parties, all social forces, and various political forces to sincerely cooperate in implementing multiparty liberal democracy by putting the supreme interests of the nation and people above everything else. We appeal to all countries the world over, international organizations, and various nongovernmental organizations to continue providing all manner of assistance and support to the poor Cambodian people to help them restore and rebuild the land. The 7 January spirit will forever remain in the soul of the people. It is a voice reminding all Cambodians to strive to preserve national solidarity in order to defend and build their history and make it shine. The 7 January spirit has again linked us to the nation's past glory and has created a new revival force moving toward a brilliant future. The 7 January spirit is an excellent example of our nation's genuine patriotism. Without the 7 January 1979 day, there would be no life today. [end Heng Samrin recording) [applause]
