The Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali, expressed his pleasure for the first high raking American meeting about the field of defence. He conveyed to the U.S. delegation the greeting of the Albanian president and general commander of the Armed Forces of Albania, Mr. Sali Berisha. "This meeting is very important," Mr. Zhulali said, "for the fact that it is being held right after the NATO summit, in which the idea of Partnership for Peace was presented. This is brilliant idea," he said further on, "which we support unreservedly. We shall be totally committed to it, thus realising cooperation with all democratic countries, especially with the U.S.A. In this way, we will contribute to creation of the conditions for Albania to become a NATO member. Mr. Zhulali said that Albania is playing an important role for the peace and stability in the Balkan region. "The latest message of President Clinton conveyed to us by Ms. Albright is encouraging and supports the bilateral cooperation between Albania and the U.S.A." Mr. Josef Crusel said that he was pleased to be in Albania in the lead of a high ranking delegation. "Through the photos of former Secretary Baker during his visit to Albania we created the image for the overthrow of the dictatorship in Albania. This gives Albania a special place among us, Americans," Mr. Crusel said. "I hope that our discussions will be very productive regarding bilateral relations in the field of security," Mr. Crusel said.
