The opposition considers the new government to be based on a national consensus. Nicolas Mayugi is the leader of UPRONA [Party of National Unity and Progress]. He spoke to Monique Mas: [Begin recording] [Mayugi] If every Burundian can now relate to this government, it is largely because the last government was perceived as the government of a party that had just won. Today, the government is perceived as a government that brings people together. [Mas] Is it seen as such by the parties that lost the elections? [Mayugi] Yes, we are in a crisis, and we are trying to come out of it. I think that we can return to concepts like winning and losing later. Now, we need to rebuild our country and bring back peace. Perhaps this is also why the political parties have agreed to a political truce. [end recording]
