Sanko, candidate of military sciences and docent, and Colonel (Res) A. Shakin, doctor of technical sciences and docent] [Text] The methods are intended for operational calculation of the volumes of obstacles in a large unit's zone of advance, the required number of lanes, and the necessary amount of forces to cross them. To make the calculations, the chief of the engineer service will require the following initial data: --the enemy grouping in the zone of advance; --the battle formation of the large unit (unit) of our troops; --the offensive front; --the length of armor terrain; --the available forces and assets for clearing lanes in obstacles. 3.1. Determining the Volumes of Obstacles and Rubble Placed by the Enemy in the Zone of Advance The opposing enemy grouping is determined in percentages of a division and is adjusted using the coefficient of accounting of the enemy (Table 3.1). Depending on the reinforcement of the enemy division with engineer units, the volumes of obstacles in the zone of advance are determined according to Table 3.2. The distribution of obstacles by lines is determined by multiplying the obtained values by the coefficient of obstacle distribution (Table 3.3). Formula 3.1. is used to determine the density of minefields (conventional and remotely installed) being erected by the enemy to the depth of defense of the first-echelon division depending on the day the engagement is conducted (Table II.3.4). D[.sup]mflddef[/]-(L[.sup]mfld[/]+0.5xL[.sup]rmfld[/]) xK[.sup]cap[/]/L[.sup]acc[/]. (3.1) The density of the minefields on the lines of the enemy defense is determined by formula 3.1 by multiplying by the corresponding coefficient of distribution of obstacles by lines (Table II.3.3). D[.sup]i[/]-(L[.sup]mfld[/]xK[.sup]i[/][.sup]mfld[/]+0.5x L[.sup]rmfld[/]xK[.sup]i[/][.sup]rmfld[/])xK[.sup]cap[/]/ L[.sup]acc[/]. (3.2) In expressions 3.1 and 3.2: L[.sup]mfld[/] and L[.sup]rmfld[/] are the length of conventional and remotely installed minefields, respectively, in km; K[.sup]cap[/] is the coefficient of the decrease in enemy capabilities for erecting obstacles depending on the day the engagement is conducted; K[.sup]i[/][.sup]mfld[/] and K[.sup]i[/][.sup]rmfld[/] are the coefficients of distribution of obstacles by lines; L[.sup]acc[/] is the length of the zone of advance accessible for troop operations. 3.2. Determining the Required Number of Lanes in the Minefields Depending on the density of the obstacles erected by the enemy and the battle formation used by the large unit, tables 3.5 and 3.6 are used to determine the required number of lanes in minefields in front of the forward edge and in the depth of the enemy defense. 3.3. Determining the Required Amount of Forces for Clearing Lanes in Minefields and Rubble The number of combat engineer platoons (mineclearing platoon) necessary for clearing lanes in minefields in front of the forward edge of the defense and in the depth of the enemy defense is determined from the calculation that one platoon simultaneously makes 2-3 lanes and 6-8 lanes in a day. The number of combat engineer platoons (mineclearing platoons, obstacle-clearing platoons) for assignment to the obstacle-clearing team (obstacle-clearing detachment) is determined according to the number of battalions (regiments) in the first echelon at the rate of up to a platoon for one obstacle-clearing team and one to two platoons for one obstacle-clearing detachment. Assessing the Effectiveness of Crossing Obstacles To assess the effectiveness of crossing obstacles, it is necessary to determine the coefficient of supply with engineer subunits, equal to the ratio of the number of available platoons (N[.sup]ep[/]) to the required number (N[.sup]er[/]: K[.sup]supp[/]=N[.sup]ep[/]/N[.sup]er[/]. (3.3) Table 3.7. is used to determine the coefficient of the decrease in the rate of advance, the relative losses of armored equipment on the obstacles, and the time for accomplishing the day's mission.
