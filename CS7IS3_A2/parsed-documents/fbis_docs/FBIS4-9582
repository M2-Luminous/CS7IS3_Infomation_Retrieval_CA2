[Kovac] I believe that what both sides consider the most important is that we should put an end to mutual accusations and mistrust between the Slovak Republic and the Hungarian Republic as soon as possible. This is the basic condition for our being able to develop cultural and economic relations at the level of the various organizations, institutions, and citizens as well. So, the elimination of mistrust is at the top of the list, and every step promoting this is given priority. I believe that the signing of the basic treaty that lays down good-neighborly relations is included in this. The principle of the inviolability of the borders has to be laid down just as that of the political solution of issues affecting the national minorities. If we manage to achieve this, then afterward what we must strive for is to remove gradually from people's consciousness the suspicion and mistrust inherited from the past. Once the basic conditions have been created for shaping a new type of relations, enormous possibilities will open up before us--first and foremost in cross-border cooperation, which is by no means at the level made desirable by the economic, cultural, and technical endowments and requirements of the region's inhabitants. [Nagy] During their visit to Bratislava last week, Gabor Kuncze [head of the parliamentary group of opposition Alliance of Free Democrats] and, before that, Gyula Horn [chairman of the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party], also, spoke optimistically about the future development of Slovak-Hungarian relations. Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak head of government, also sees a chance for improvement. Do you share this opinion? [Kovac] Yes, I support this opinion. And I trust that, in the election campaigns, the so-called Slovak and Hungarian cards will become superfluous--in other words, that it will not be possible to play these against each other. On the contrary, it will become apparent that the most rational way to resolve issues is to approach them in a sober, objective manner, without suspicion, be it a question of Gabcikovo, water distribution, the legal status of national minorities, or anything else--in other words, that everything can be resolved if it is not unnecessarily overpoliticized. Incidentally, I consider this to be a sickness that has raised its head not just in our country but elsewhere, too. It is obviously connected with the fact that real democracy in our region is still only in the developmental phase, the political situation has not yet settled down, and an unnecessarily large number of issues are brought onto the political level as if they were trying to forge capital for themselves from this. But I also see signs of the opposite of this: the effort to try to remove obstacles from the path of our relations. I consider looking to the future the important thing, and to make people aware that European integration is an attractive objective for which it is worth working with joint forces so as to achieve it more quickly. [Nagy] Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, you managed to find the common note a long time ago with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. You mentioned that, in the course of your earlier meetings, too, you had managed to get attuned. [Kovac] Yes, that is so. This has shown that the presidents of republics, who are infrequently dragged into daily politicizing, look at events from above. Their hands are not tied, and they can express an opinion without prejudice, without ulterior motives, about certain issues. This is what we need: that this approach should pass down from the president's level to the executive power level. I do not doubt that this will happen because, also in Hungary and here, too, we have already taken steps in a direction serving the aim of depoliticizing. Once people's everyday interests come to the forefront, that will bring with it the necessity of sober solutions. [Nagy] In your view, what role can the minorities play in the shaping of bilateral relations? I am thinking, in our case, of the Slovaks living in Hungary and of the Hungarians living in Slovakia. [Kovac] In general terms, it can be said--and this relates to both the Hungarian and the Slovak situation--that it is in the interest of every country to create for its minorities conditions in which they can feel at home, so that they will strive, in their own interest, to integrate and become fully valuable members of the given society, while being able to retain their particular characteristics, their language, their culture, their traditions, while being given the possibility to study in their mother tongue. However, it is a general interest that the use of the mother tongue should not impede the minority in becoming integrated in society and the individual in getting on. We must change this outlook, which still lives on, that a minority means nothing but trouble for a country. We must reinforce the view that it can also mean richness. So far, we have done little to achieve this, but perhaps not only in relation to Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, too, what people see is the disadvantages of the minorities issue rather than the richness the minorities represent for a country from the viewpoint of culture, of the multicolored mix of languages. We have not sufficiently weighed the possibility of making use of this opportunity provided by the minorities for the purpose of getting closer to our neighbors, in our case toward the south, making our relations closer with Hungary.
