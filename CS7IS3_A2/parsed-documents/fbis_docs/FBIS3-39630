This is shown by the latest estimates from the EU Commission. This means that Finland will receive more from the EU budget than it pays in. According to the Commission's estimates, Finland's net contribution will amount to around ECU100 million, corresponding to something over 600 million markkas. This is due to the seriously weakened Finnish economy and the large payments that are expected to be paid back to Finland for agriculture and regional policy support. But a spokesman for the Commission stressed that this figure should be taken with a pinch of salt. As long as membership negotiations have not settled the chapters on agriculture and regional support, the calculations are unreliable. The other three countries -- Sweden, Austria, and Norway -- will be net contributors in the event of membership -- that is, they will pay more into the EU budget than they will receive in return in payments from the EU's various funds. And Sweden will be the biggest net contributor, with probably the highest membership fee per inhabitant.
