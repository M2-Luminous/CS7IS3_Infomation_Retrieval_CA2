Though Japan had invested a historical total of 400 million dollars in Vietnam as of the end 1993, Doan Duy Thanh, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Japanese investment should "dramatically increase." Thanh cited construction materials, cement and food processing as promising areas for Japanese corporations considering investment in Vietnam. Thanh said Washington's February 3 lifting of its 19-year trade embargo against Vietnam may increase the number of rivals for Japanese companies. "But Japanese firms, well versed in Vietnamese business practices through years of dealing with the country, have an edge over companies from other countries," Thanh said. "Japanese companies have the capability to make products well-tailored to the needs of Vietnamese people." Thanh said he would like to see Japan boost investment particularly in central Vietnam. The infrastructure of the area is still "poor" compared with Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and this problem could hinder quick recovery of investment in the area, Thanh said. But due to a vast amount of untapped natural resources, investment in the region should prove "highly lucrative" to foreign companies in the long run, Thanh said. Thanh said Vietnam hopes to introduce a rice-breeding technique from Japan with an eye toward rice exports in future. He said Vietnam's infrastructure is insufficient, calling that the main factor in discouraging foreign investment in the country. Thanh said Vietnam is doing its utmost to improve the situation, using Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds. Vietnam is also upgrading its legal and administrative framework to smooth international business deals while striving to infuse a market mechanism through economic restructuring, he added. On overall economic development, Thanh said Vietnam needs to raise between 45 billion and 50 billion dollars within this decade, including 15 to 20 billion dollars in foreign investment and aid. Japan's cumulative investment in Vietnam was the sixth largest as of the end of 1993 after Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and France. When figures so far this year were taken into account, Japan might have surpassed Australia and France on a cumulative basis, becoming the fourth biggest investor in Vietnam, Thanh said. He welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its trade embargo but said relations between the two countries could still be improved. Vietnam hopes the U.S. will soon grant most-favored-nation trade status, he said. Thanh said that in the first one month and a half since the removal of the U.S. embargo, the number of U.S. businessmen who came to Vietnam reached 25 percent of the total number for the whole of 1993. He said that Hanoi is now formulating an investment guideline on the U.S. and other countries with particular emphasis on foreign interest in such sectors as heavy industry, machinery, food processing, forestry, mineral development, light industry and tourism. Thanh came to Japan for a business conference sponsored by the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). The three-day meeting of top businessmen from 12 countries in Asia ended Monday.
