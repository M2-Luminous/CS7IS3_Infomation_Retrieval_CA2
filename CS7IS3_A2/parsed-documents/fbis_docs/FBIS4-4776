FBIS4-4776 "dreas065_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 South Korea Institute on Ability To Counter DPRK Attack Institute on Ability To Counter DPRK Attack SK0504080694 Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean 5 Apr 94 p 2 SK0504080694 Seoul SEOUL SINMUN Korean BFN [Text] It has been learned that the war capacity of the ROK forces, including the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK, is 71 percent of that of North Korea, and a simulated war scenario has come to a conclusion that in the event North Korea commits a full- scale southward aggression, ROK forces are capable of defending themselves for 10 days after the commencement of a war without additional U.S. troops. Attending a forum of ruling and opposition party lawmakers regarding the North Korean nuclear issue held at Academy House in Suyuri, Seoul, Chong In-kyun, president of the Defense Research Institute explained countermeasure scenarios against aggression by North Korea. He said, "However, approximately 350,000-strong reinforcement troops must be quickly deployed after 10 days. The ROK and the United States have discussed a deployment plan for immediate deterrence troops using the early warning system to complement such weaknesses." President Chong also said, "The immediate deterrent troops will be Navy and Air Force troops in the initial stage. Four hundred to 500 ultra-modern Air Force planes can take off from U.S. bases in Japan to secure air supremacy within three days after the commencement of the war. A carrier-based naval force can also be deployed within a week. A substantial reinforcement of ground forces could take one to two months but the airborne forces and marine brigade should be deployed sooner." Regarding the assumed damage in the first 10 days after the commencement of the war, President Chong estimated: "The friendly forces will lose 15 percent of the front forces and the aggressor forces will lose 20 percent of the committed forces." President Chong added: "Even if North Korea had nuclear weapons, it would never use them unless it is determined to cause common destruction. The 1,000-tonnes of biochemical weapons are more of a threat than nuclear weapons."
