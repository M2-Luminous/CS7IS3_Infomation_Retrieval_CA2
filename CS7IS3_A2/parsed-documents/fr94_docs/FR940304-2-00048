In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to Section 5( l ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45 ( l ) or any other statute enforced by the Commission, respondents shall similarly consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking a civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5( l ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by the respondents to comply with this Order. B.

The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of respondents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures of acute care hospitals. If respondents have not opposed, in writing, the selection of any trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to respondents of the identity of any proposed trustee, respondents shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. The trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority, subject to the prior approval of the Commission, to divest HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center. 3. The trustee shall have eighteen (18) months from the date of approval of the trust agreement described in Paragraph III.B.8 of this Order to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the eighteen-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be accomplished within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or by the Court for a court-appointed trustee; provided, however, that the divestiture period may only be extended two (2) times. 4. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities relating to HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center, or any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondents shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any delays in divestiture caused by respondents shall extend the time for the divestiture under this Paragraph III in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or the Court for a court-appointed trustee. 5. Subject to respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price and the purpose of the divestiture as stated in Paragraph II of this Order, the trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available with each acquiring entity for the divestiture of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center. The divestiture shall be made in the manner set out in Paragraph II of this Order; provided, however, that if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities selected by respondents from among those approved by the Commission. 6. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of respondents, on such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a Court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ, at the cost and expense of respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business brokers, appraisers, or other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the sale and all expenses incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the Court, of the account of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of respondents and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement contingent on divestiture through the trustee.
