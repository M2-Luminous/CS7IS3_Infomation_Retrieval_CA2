At a ceremony marking the book's publication, Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: In urban development, we must pay heed to long-term benefits. We must not pursue only speed and economic benefits, disregarding environmental benefits. Li Ruihuan said: The publication of "Wan Li on Urban Development" marks a major event in China's urban and rural development. Following the republic's founding, the focus of our work shifted from rural to urban areas. Although we were not totally ignorant of urban planning, development, and administration, we were indeed not very well informed. After 40 years of real experience, we have scored tremendous progress and accumulated a wealth of experience in this regard. At the same time, we have also learned quiet a few lessons. Comrade Wan Li had many years of leadership experience in urban development. "Wan Li on Urban Development" -- a collection of 48 speeches and written instructions on urban development written by Wan Li between 1956 and 1993 -- offers an incisive summing-up of the republic's good and bad experience in urban development. Li Ruihuan said: Every comrade in charge of urban development work, leading comrades in particular, should carefully study this book and use it as guidance in summing up our historical experience and solving the immediate problems. Li Ruihuan stressed in his speech: Historical experience shows that we are more prone to mistakes when we carry out massive economic construction and accelerate urban development across the board. There are indeed cadres who are rather ignorant of urban planning. Unwilling to put in some efforts to study it or listen to people's criticism with an open mind, they often pay attention only to local, immediate interests to the neglect of long-term interests. They stress only economic benefits and not environmental benefits, only the utility functions and not the aesthetic effects, and they blindly imitate foreign styles and belittle national traditions. In some cities, too many high-rise buildings were built and their layout was irrational. Shoddy outward embellishment will cause endless trouble in later years. The colors used were incongruous and no attention was paid to balance. The green areas are small and untidy. All these phenomena are worrisome. Urban development has a great impact on overall national development and on the immediate interests of hundreds of millions of people. A blunder in urban planning often cannot be corrected in a short time, some cannot be corrected at all. Leaders and administrators of all types of cities at various levels must, out of their sense of responsibility to the state and future generations, earnestly sum up experience, constantly raise their levels of performance, and tackle the problems in urban planning with a positive yet modest approach. A graduation ceremony for the 18th training class for mayors was held simultaneously with the book launching ceremony. Chen Xitong and Hou Jie spoke at the graduation ceremony.
