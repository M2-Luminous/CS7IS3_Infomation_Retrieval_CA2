A responsible source at the Interior Ministry told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the president's order covers citizens, party organizations, and Internal Security Forces personnel who capture car thieves. The source urged police departments and party organizations to submit the names of those entitled to the award to the Presidential Council after the crime of car theft is legally proved. He stressed that this noble gesture will effectively contribute toward curbing the phenomenon of car theft. He said the award provides an incentive for the Internal Security Forces personnel to do everything possible to remove this phenomenon.
