Therefore, the RPK leader is hopeful he will be able to come to an agreement with President Kravchuk and develop relations between the Crimea and Ukraine in accordance with current legislation and the norms of international law. In the event of his election as president, Yuriy Meshkov added, one should not fear that interethnic relations would exacerbate.
