The Cabinet of Ministers must then confirm them. I think there still are, however, some ambiguities. Other countries--some of them that have even congratulated Latvia on such an outcome to the talks and are satisfied--at the same time, are they satisfied? [passage omitted] Mr. Birkavs, are these other countries, after all, aware of how many troops will remain here and of what this process will be like? [Birkavs] Mrs. Grinberga, you immediately grab the bull by the horns very strongly. [passage omitted] I would very much like everyone to feel secure and stable about the future during this heated time. Precisely during the present day, however, our state's boat or our state's ship is being rocked quite heavily in connection with the agreement between Russia and Latvia. Moreover, it is being rocked in such a way that all the values that we possess and that we have achieved and for which we are striving may collapse. We, of course, are very thoroughly evaluating each sentence in the agreement. The agreement is the result of two years of difficult talks, in which a compromise in one place gave an opportunity to move forward at another place. The heart was heavy before signing this agreement, but the agreement is a guarantee. It is a guarantee for our future: that the troops will definitely leave, that Skrunda will definitely be eliminated, and that military pensioners will definitely be controlled in our state. This is because one of the component parts of the agreement are the lists of pensioners, of the militarists; 22,000--that is a big number--but we will know them all. At the present moment, we do not even know them all. We will know exactly who those 599 military persons will be who are to be located at the Skrunda facility. When we know all those persons--in the near future we are forming an immigration policy--then we will find much more easily the superfluous ones. We will much more easily isolate them and much more easily extradite them from the state. Therefore, we must very thoroughly weigh in, but the movement toward signing the agreement is absolutely necessary. I think that the attitude of the world toward signing of the agreement is comparatively unequivocal in principle; it is positive, because the world sees that we are using a civilized method. [passage omitted] [Grinberga] Is it, after all, really ethical to lay down in such detail those social guarantees for the military people who will be considered pensioners and will be considered retired. These minute concerns that have been laid down in one of the agreements, why is it necessary to do so in that much detail, to do so very thoroughly? [Birkavs] You see, in one of the agreements all the minute concerns have been laid down that are being implemented until 31 August. After 31 August, both these minute and major concerns will end for us because the troops, and their family members, and the military persons who retired after this agreement was concluded are being guaranteed definite rights until they leave. That is those who retired after 28 January 1992; in fact, it is from the moment when Yeltsin recognized the former USSR troops as their troops. Until that moment that all the complex of military persons leaves, they are being guaranteed definite rights--comparatively minute, yes, but so it is. This is until the agreement's ... [pauses] until the troops leave. Another agreement relates to the stay in Latvia of military persons, of retired military persons. Of course, if we would be able to get rid of these retired military persons easily without an agreement--and they would leave with the troops--this would be an ideal version. I would be the most glad of all. This is not possible, however; therefore, it is laid down in the agreement that they cannot and never will obtain Latvian citizenship under any conditions and that they must subjugate themselves to the laws of Latvia. They have those minute concerns for themselves, as you said, to be allowed medical services, to visit the dentist, on general grounds. So that their apartments will be warm--although the apartments of Latvians, as they usually are, are cold--this has been laid down in the agreement. So, neither more nor less is given to them than to others, but these were the demands by the Russian side. This is what they insisted on, as a result of which we have arrived at the agreement that will rid us of them after all. [Grinberga] So, would you also please tell us with what means will the Skrunda radar station be dismantled--those buildings--with what money? [Birkavs] I think that--although hatred and anger against Skrunda is so great that the radar station might collapse by that alone--nevertheless, the U.S. Senate will decide on 15 April on allocating 10 million dollars in order to make use of technical means for dismantling the Skrunda radar station. Dismantling can begin, dismantling of the new radar station can begin at the moment the agreement is signed. I have already spoken with people about whether they would be ready to drive there with tractors, although a tractor will not suffice. Actually, the Skrunda radar station, the new one, must be levelled to the ground. Also, the foundations must be blown up. No kind of a temptation must remain there for Russia. If foundations were to remain, then building the top--that big one--could be done very quickly. Therefore, at that moment when there will be nothing--neither the foundations nor the top--we will be fully convinced that Russia will not make any kind of investments for building a new radar station. They will, evidently, invest that in Belarus, at Baranovichi. [passage omitted]
