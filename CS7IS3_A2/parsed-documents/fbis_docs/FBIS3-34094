Reports also say the U.S. secretary of state is planning to visit the region next month in a fresh bid to advance the peace process, especially on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The United States apparently attaches great importance to the current Washington talks, due to its firm conviction that peace in the Middle East is impossible without Syria and that reaching a Syrian-Israeli agreement will open all the doors of the region to a just, comprehensive, and durable peace. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton centered on the essence of Middle East peace. It concluded that there is a need to establish a real and firm peace accepted by the peoples of the region -- a peace that reflects positively on their countries and that can withstand successive developments. President al-Asad called such a peace the peace of the brave, in accordance with which occupation will end and Arab rights will be restored. For its part, Syria has announced it will continue to seek a just and comprehensive peace. Perhaps the best evidence of its belief in peace, and in efforts to achieve it, is the talks it is holding in Washington, despite public Israeli pronouncements that reflect no change in the Israeli position, even after the Geneva summit. The summit tossed the ball into the Israeli court. It proved Syria really believes in peace and is struggling to achieve a just, honorable solution accepted by current generations and safeguarded by future generations -- peace that enables them to devote their resources to development and progress. We say this because Israeli officials, especially the head of the Israeli government, have recently cast doubt on Syria's intentions and sought to undermine its role and status in the region. They did not conceal their concern about the U.S. shifting toward Syria because it is the key to peace in the region. President Clinton and the U.S. secretary of state said Syria is an extremely important country that has a pivotal role to play in the peace process. By casting such doubts, the Israelis seek to circumvent the objective of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Such peace requires full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and all occupied Arab territories, and the implementation of Security Council resolutions to the letter. It is no coincidence that the head of the Israeli government has raised the idea of a referendum on the Golan, contrary to all international resolutions, charters, and principles. The Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. There can be no peace without its full return to the mother homeland. Threatening to conduct a referendum is only a maneuver to circumvent the objective of a just and comprehensive peace. It is also an attempt to contain the U.S. position and conviction that Syria is the key to the Middle East peace process. The current Washington talks will be a decisive test to Israel. The whole world expects a decisive shift by the Israeli rulers toward peace and an end to the policy of maneuver and procrastination that has so far prevented substantive progress leading to genuine, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
