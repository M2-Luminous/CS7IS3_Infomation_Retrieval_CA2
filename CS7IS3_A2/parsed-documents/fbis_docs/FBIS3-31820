With facts, figures, and sound arguments he explained to the deputies that the 11.6-billion-leva army budget could only cover the Armed Forces' needs for the next few months, until summer, unless personnel is cut by half, namely to 40,000 men. The military budget is the price our people have to pay to defend the country. It is determined according to the extent to which the country's security is threatened. This is the basic criterion. It is followed by resources for the tasks the military units are expected to accomplish in order to cope with the threat, and last but not least, by the forces in charge of the aforementioned tasks. The military budget consists of four components: Current expenditures for the maintenance of the army; the supply of armaments and technical equipment; the building of defense facilities and facilities for the troops; and finally, theoretical research and developments in the military sphere. The experience of the last few years shows that most resources are spent on soldiers' everyday needs and for routine tasks of military service. The proposed budget excludes all possibilities of purchasing new technical equipment and armaments. Some 200 of the 230 existing barracks are in urgent need of major repairs. The condition of military equipment is absolutely desolate. Not even one officer has submitted a paper for an academic title in the last four years. In 1989 the military budget represented 4.06 percent of GDP, while in 1990 it dropped to 3.2 percent; in 1991 -- to 3 percent; in 1992 -- to 2.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 2.6 percent. In 1994 the percentage is expected even to drop to 2.4 percent. The downward trend is determined both by the country's serious economic crisis and by the inability to adapt the budget to the acute shortage of funds. In these circumstances the social problems in the army are likely to get worse, and morale is likely to fall because of the hopeless revenue policy, which in the long run will further delay the army reform. Turkey's 1994 military budget amounts to $8.601 billion in addition to the $2 billion in military aid from the United States. Greece's current military budget amounts to $28 billion, which represents 8 percent of the national budget, in addition to $1 billion in military aid from the United States and 340 million marks from Germany. The Romanian military budget amounts to $560 million, which represents 8 percent of the country's budget. States in the same desolate financial situation as Bulgaria still manage to find resources for their army because they consider it a vital institution. It is not a problem of one or another political force, of the government, or of a certain ministry. The problem affects our national security, without which the transition to democracy would be a mere exercise in rhetorics. At the plenary session of the National Assembly General Petrov reportedly said that the General Staff cannot bear responsibility for the proposed military budget. He called for an additional 11 billion leva. Only a few National Assembly deputies, in their statements, supported the demands of the army leadership. Hence, it would be quite normal for parliament to assume responsibility for the state of our national security, in the event the requested resources for the army are voted down, because national security is even more important than parliament.
