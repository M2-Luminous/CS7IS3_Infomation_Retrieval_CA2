Belgrade is demanding that the United Nations impose an immediate ban on NATO air strikes. This was reported on Tuesday by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic in an interview with DE VOLKSKRANT. "I do not see how we can continue to cooperate with the United Nations in the same way," he said. Until Sunday evening, when at the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] request, NATO fighter jets brought the Serbian offensive on the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde to a standstill, Belgrade had cooperated closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees "on the execution of its noble task of helping people," Jovanovic claimed. However, in the wake of "this unforgivable outrage perpetrated by the United Nations," as he described the action, "it is difficult to imagine that our attitude would not change." Four out of six sites designated as "safe areas" by the United Nations, including the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica, Zepa, and Gorazde, are provided with supplies from Belgrade. The minister listed a number of requirements which the United Nations must fulfil. Only then, according to the minister, can the peace talks be resumed. "First of all, UN envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi must state that no further NATO air strikes will take place." The UN secretary general's special envoy has just threatened to call for more air strikes if the besieging Serbian forces continue to threaten the densely populated city of Gorazde, whose population numbers 65,000 or so, and the aid workers who remain there. Step two will involve launching a study that Jovanovic believes should result in "self-criticism" by the UN forces. "The United Nations must admit, even if it is too late, that it has made a terrible mistake," the minister dictated. Because NATO had bombed targets just 20 km from the border, Jovanovic warned of the "possible dangers" of combat aircraft dropping bombs on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro by mistake or violating the country's airspace. According to him and Western observers, the latter would happen on a regular basis, simply because Gorazde is too close to the border for aircraft to swoop down without leaving Bosnian airspace. Minister Jovanovic suggested that such violations could unleash a response by the Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro. "We have already had to restrain ourselves several times," he said. Although Jovanovic is lending his full support to the Bosnian Serbs, who are continuing to refuse to speak with UN Commander in Bosnia Michael Rose, he does not believe that the prospects of peace have been lost for good. "However, at this moment in time, the war option has the upper hand. The consequence of the NATO action is that the Muslims and Croats now believe that they can win the war on the battlefield." Meanwhile, he does not trust the proposal submitted by Russian negotiator Vitaliy Churkin, to station 800 Ukrainian UN troops, who are already on hand, in the enclave as soon as the Serbs have withdrawn. "The Russians have good ideas, but no power," he said. According to him, the presence of Russian UN troops in Sarajevo and Tuzla had not managed to restore the "impartiality" of the United Nations. The minister, who was a career diplomat who wrote poetry in the evenings, believes that the United Nations has played itself out. "Long before the air strikes, it had abandoned its impartiality by taking the side of the Muslims," he said. He pointed out that Gorazde never was a "safe area," because the United Nations has not yet started disarming those people who are defending the enclave. "Worse still, under the knowing gaze of UN observers, Bosnian Government troops have used the hills around Gorazde to prepare for a spring offensive," he continued. The push by Muslim troops, which should have started three weeks ago, was met with a counterattack by the Bosnian Serbs. "Just when they seemed about to overrun their enemy, the United Nations once again suddenly started shouting murder," the minister said. Jovanovic, who describes himself as a humanist, democrat, and socialist, believes that there is a conspiracy. It has been claimed that only two mortar bombs have landed in Gorazde over the past few days, not the "eight per minute" reported by UN observers. Apparently, UNPROFOR Commander Rose, who initially dismissed the reports by his staff as "emotional" and "exaggerated," later received an order from Washington to clear the way for a NATO air strike. According to him, the use of combat aircraft had just one objective: "To guard the Muslims against defeat." Mr. Jovanovic believes that Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his envoy Akashi, and Lieutenant General Rose have gone over the head of the UN Security Council, "thereby losing the United Nations any prestige it might have had."
