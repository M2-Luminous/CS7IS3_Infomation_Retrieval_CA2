But the experts will tell you not to change the line-up in the middle of a critical game. Has Mr. Redha Malek, who succeeds himself in the position he has occupied since last August, been retained because on balance the new president rated his government's record of accomplishment the last five months as positive? Or was it rather to allow him to finish the internal and external work he took such great pains to launch? Perhaps both reasons came into play in the decision. In the view of many observers, Mr. Redha Malek's continuation as head of government is no real surprise, despite rumors about his possible departure and possible successors. What history will judge most important about the "old-new" prime minister was a symbolic gesture that shows there has been a change for the better in Algerian politics: Mr. Redha Malek hastened to submit his government's resignation as soon as Mr. Zeroual took the oath of office. As for the government's record of accomplishment, although it is difficult to give a meaningful assessment of a government team so soon after its inception, Mr. Redha Malek does have to his credit a number of achievements, which it will be up to him now to consolidate. It is above all in the economic sphere that the head of government's style contrasts most sharply with his predecessors' orientation. Accelerated movement--to all appearances quite resolute--toward a market economy was what most notably distinguished the Redha Malek government. The path ahead is thus well marked. His reinstallation as head of government under Mr. Zeroual is first of all a confirmation of a commitment shared by the new leadership. In the social sphere, Mr. Redha Malek has succeeded where his predecessors failed.
