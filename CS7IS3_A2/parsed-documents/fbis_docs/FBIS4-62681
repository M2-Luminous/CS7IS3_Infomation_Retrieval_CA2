The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry told INTERFAX that the date of the station's new launch was unclear as financing the works remained unsettled. However, Yerevan is to entirely finance all works on the station carried out jointly with Russia in accordance with the 17 March treaty. According to the treaty, Russia committed itself to take part in examining, reactivating and bringing on-line the station's main installations as well as additional activities to ensure its safety. Moscow also said it would supply the station with nuclear fuel. In late April, Armenian Vice Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan said his republic had completed preparatory works on the station closed down in March 1989 under heavy public pressure which followed the December 1988 earthquake. Yerevan plans to launch the station by the end of this year. Taking into account Armenia's highly unstable seismic conditions, the station must withstand an earthquake of force nine on the Richter scale. To reactivate the station, a minimum of $70 million is needed. The republican government decided to bring the station on-line again as it used to cover more than 40 percent of the republic's energy consumption as far back as a year ago. At present, power is mainly produced by hydroelectrical stations which are capable of covering only 25-30 percent of the demand.
