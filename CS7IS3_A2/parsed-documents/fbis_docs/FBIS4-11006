A poll conducted by the S.C.

The other six candidates obtained 6.7 percent support, while 27.6 percent of the voters have not reached a final decision. Elections will be held on 21 August in Mexico to choose the next president of the republic and to renew the Chambers of Deputies and Senators. The third preelection poll published this Monday by EL NACIONAL newspaper revealed that there is confidence in the electoral register and that people feel voting will be respected in the upcoming elections. As part of the 63-question survey, some 1,100 people were polled in 17 states throughout the country between 7 and 10 April, in accordance with a multi-period [polietapico] survey through which it was inferred that 75 percent of those polled considered the new electoral register reliable. Zedillo, who replaced former PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio -- murdered on 23 March in the border town of Tijuana -- "enjoys the support of a clear majority of the supporters of the ruling party," the newspaper reported. "Despite the magnitude of the tragic events leading to the assassination of Colosio, the voting intentions of citizens were hardly affected," EL NACIONAL added. Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party, Rafael Aguila for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, and Jorge Gonzalez for Mexican Green Ecologist Party are also participating in the elections, as are Alvaro Peraza for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, Cecilia Soto for the Labor Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero for the National Opposition Union. The survey also found that 53 percent of those polled termed President Salinas' administration positive, while 7 percent described it as unfavorable.
