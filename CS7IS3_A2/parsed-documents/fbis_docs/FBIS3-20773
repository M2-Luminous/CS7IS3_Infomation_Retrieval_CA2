The two conflicting currents, instead of holding a united Congress, remain separate, so for all practical purposes the PDP is split into two parts. The "joint" delegates who were in the Palace of Culture for their Congress elected Arben [Arber] Xhaferi as chairman while the part of the party which was transferred to the Tetovo Commune Committee elected Dr. Xheladin [Djeladin] Murati as chairman in a parallel Congress. Immediately after the congresses, the two chairmen claimed that they were legitimate, on the basis of the fact that they had a sufficient number of delegates. We talked with the two chairmen about this competition and asked them the same questions. [Sallaj] After its second Congress, which was held ahead of schedule, the PDP has been split into two parts: parallel party organs and two chairmen have been elected. Which chairman is legitimate and why? [Murati] There is no doubt that the first Albanian political entity in Macedonia has split. This is a permanent split. The status-quo that existed has been eliminated. Points of agreement have diverged once and for all. It is a question of legitimacy. The early Congress of the PDP, which was attended by the majority of those representatives in whom the people placed their trust, has the natural right to legitimacy. I am referring to the deputies, the members of the Central Assembly and of the Central Presidency who have resigned, the PDP ministers in the government, where, together with the delegates elected at the Congress, they reviewed the overall work and activity of the PDP between the two congresses. An activity report was presented which objectively expressed the problems and dilemmas, the deficiencies and shortcomings, the successes and failures through the prism of a clear view of the work and activity of the party in the future and the advancement of the status and course of full equality. Which chairman is legitimate? This is a provocative question. There is one chairman and one Congress. The others are only an informal group and a self-proclaimed chairman. Time and the future will prove this; now we can only be anxious. This will be addressed by others, the membership, those who look at the PDP objectively, and not those who view the PDP unilaterally, superficially, and with contempt. The PDP Congress, of which I am the chairman, does not have careerist aims. It does not close the circle of our collective activity; it does not desire to place a political protectorate over those who think differently. We are carrying on an indigenous party policy; we are not directed by others and we are not the puppets of others; we are in favor of genuine cooperation with every political entity; we respect dialogue and we express the aspirations of the people whom we represent. We are open to all who struggle for equality, peace, and understanding, for the well- being of the Albanian people in Macedonia and their state-forming status. This is the truth and our consistent commitments are our legitimacy and my personal legitimacy. [Xhaferi] The PDP was not permanently split into two parts at its early second Congress. The Council of the Congress, which was formed on the basis of an agreement of representatives of the two councils, which was reached earlier in Tirana, called the Congress and it was held where it was decided at the most recent meeting of the Council. Therefore, the PDP Congress was held at the Palace of Culture. Documents which are normally approved at congresses were approved there; the Central Assembly was certified and the leadership was elected. Something which should have been done much earlier was done; a process which was degenerating the political substance of Albanians in Macedonia was ended. There was a congress-like atmosphere in the Palace of Congresses, with certified delegates, with politically important guests, with an agenda and with documents approved in the Council. I do not want to comment on the motives and the way in which the other Congress, which you call parallel, was held, and the political and ethnic results, because I do not want to provoke any unnecessary labeling and groupings among the people. I think that the police and judicial organs should rule on the legitimacy of one current or another. You should not go near the wolf in his own lair. [Sallaj] Why did the compromise achieved by the two councils in preparation for the Congress fail and, in your opinion, who did not keep the agreement and what, do we suppose, has been achieved by observing statutory norms? [Murati] The objectives of the agreement were not achieved because one of the parties desired, under any circumstances, to achieve, as soon as possible, the narrow position of a voting body, while the other party -- which was part of the council preparing for the Congress -- wanted respect for statutory norms and criteria. Unfortunately, the so-called Assembly of Gostivar demonstrated that it was too rigid to show its support for the PDP Congress which would be in the interest of all its members and supporters. The establishment of the Joint Council of the Congress gave hope that the work would be over. According to what I know, positions were not coordinated and positions were imposed. [passage omitted] The lack of a consensus and the lack of understanding of the meaning of compromise are two essential factors in the failure of the agreement which was to lead to the convocation of a congress of unity and that unity was also fictitious. The third factor was the failure to observe the statutory norms, that is, Article 37 of the Statute stating that members of the Central Assembly, the resigning leadership, and the supervisory council, the bodies which give legitimacy to the Congress, should take part in the Congress. [Xhaferi] After the meetings of the two councils, in Tirana, Prishtina, and Tetovo, and after the constructive pressure of the people and of the intelligentsia, a constructive climate for cooperation, not to say compromise, was created. The Joint Council which called and organized the Congress came out of this climate. We can say, without going into political evaluations, that all the members of the Gostivar steering council were present at the last two meetings while the full membership of the other council was never present. As a result, there was an atmosphere of victory in the spirit of the Gostivar group. Some people did not accept this superiority and organized another Congress and left the most recent meeting of the Council. However, one deputy minister, a commune chairman, and representatives of the Debar and Kercovo branches stayed. So there was a forum, with the members of the two Councils, to approve the documents of the Congress. The program was approved without any dissenting votes, in the presence of all, and the Statute was approved with 20 affirmative votes and two abstentions, after some members left the Council. The public will have an opportunity to verify all these documents. [Sallaj] Many people believe that the split is related to the civil and ethnic vision of the party. Is this accurate or are the differences of another nature? [Murati] The PDP is a civil party which is also fighting for the achievement of ethnic demands which are continually denied, disrespected, and not satisfied. The PDP is committed to work for the natural rights of the Albanians and, for this purpose, it carried on extraordinary struggles at various levels within the party, within republic institutions, and on the international level. It was committed to and it offered options and mutual guarantees for creating full equality. Therefore, the PDP fought, with the greatest sincerity and with persistence, for the achievement of its planned aims, first of all, the achievement of equal status. So, the friction, the dissension, and, finally, the split (which someone imposed and approved) are not the result of the civil or ethnic vision but of something else, something more basic which I have not yet determined. There must be a thorough analysis and certainly the analysts wil carry it out. Albanians in Macedonia are quite divided in regard to political options and none of the political parties has the right to cause any new splits among the Albanians as to who is for the civil or ethnic option. This split which somebody likes is both damaging and ironic. We have aimed and pledged to obtain the right for the Albanians to be a state-forming element in Macedonia so as to advance our status. Division into civil or ethnic camps only diminishes the power of political activity and weakens the political force of our activity. [passage omitted] [Xhaferi] In the old Program and in the new one drawn up the members of the two Councils, the PDP is defined as a party of the citizens. There is a tendency for one wing to be characterized as ethnic and the other as nonethnic. Recently, arguments have been increasing in this direction. Now, the conflicts are being explained as rear guard attacks on the program and not disrespect for the statutory norms because the two sides both approved of the program's contents. If there had not been this cooperation, the program certainly would have been different. [passage omitted] [Sallaj] The two sides claim to be heirs of the PDP. What are the arguments and could a court solve this mater? [Murati] Yes, we Albanians really like the courts. I would like this even less. Nevertheless, since we have become accustomed to agreeing that we cannot agree, perhaps the court is the essential instrument for resolving conflicts. The heritage of the party is its membership, the road taken so far by the party from the village of Xhepcishte to all the branches in the entire world, the materials which it left everywhere it went, the documents which it prepared and sent to institutions inside and outside the country. Nevertheless, the heritage is irrelevant for me. The important thing for me is the legitimacy, legality, and validity of the Congress. The Congress to which I belong has these three elements. Therefore, the greatness of the Congress verifies the legitimacy of the PDP. We can reach an agreement through democratic means of resolving conflicts... However, it is necessary to... [Xhaferi] I would not be the one to defend the legitimacy of the Congress which was held in the Palace of Culture. The base, the membership, delegates, and assembly members who voted will make it legitimate. This has nothing to do with the courts, since it is an internal party and political issue which has other dimensions. Any outside interference would mean the loss of the political integrity of the party. It would result in delays which would paralyze the work of the party. [passage omitted] To offer this satisfaction now, on the eve of the census and other important activities, is political shortsightedness. Certainly we will refuse the offer of good services on the part of the authorities. [Sallaj] On the basis of the reports of the commission for the verification of mandates, it appears that both congresses were legitimate since they had a sufficient number of delegates. But, how do you explain the fact that in the two congresses (taken together) there were more delegates that the number specified for a "joint" Congress (244)? [Murati] I was satisfied with the fact that 244 delegates were called to the Congress but the hall of the House of Culture has 700 seats which means that more than 400 more people were "delegates" or guests for a specific purpose, with the exception of officially-invited guests who were seated in the front row. Threfore, our Congress, the legitimate congress which was held in the modest hall of the Communal Assembly of Tetovo, and without the accompanying solemnities, had the majority of the delegates but not the guests. This is the basic difference which should be respected. [Xhaferi] Such reports are not my responsibility. They are the responsibility of the appropriate commissions. Soon, many things will be cleared up, whether I or anyone else like it. The phenomena must be perceived with objectivity. [Sallaj] Who "destroyed" the PDP and how do you see the future of this party? [Murati] The PDP has not been destroyed. It has been split apart which means the formation of a new party. But I do not think that this will be beneficial to our ethnic interests. The others know this better than we do because they wanted it. Who knows why? The following conclusion can be drawn: the people who destroyed the PDP are the ones who wanted to prove to Europe and to draw its attention to the fact that Albanians are not for democracy, they are not for politics, they are not for the government and the state, and that they are only terrorists, secessionists, irredentists, who are endangering the territorial integrity of the state, destabilizing the well-being of the people, endangering peace and coexistence. These are dark forces, for short-term use, whom the people identify with anti-Albanians. Unfortunately, there are such forces and they have demonstrated what they are. The Albanians in Macedonia do not deserve this. But this should not sadden and demoralize us. This enriches the variety of Albanian life and the political structure and increases the competition of political opinions. This is normal and it will be normal when another party Congress confers on it a sign of distinction or a sign of recognition on the part of the PDP. This is its future, a movement which will provide ways and means of cooperation for the good of the membership which it represents -- the Albanian people in Macedonia and Albanian policy, in general. [passage omitted] [Xhaferi] The PDP was destroyed earlier. The former chairman of the PDP is trying to explain, in retrospect, the atmosphere which brought about the collapse. If there had not been certain relationships in the leadership and other party structures, no one would have been able to destroy the PDP. This is an objective finding which no serious person can disregard. Any other explanation, especially the one which talks about outside interference, only intimidates the public and stifles opinion. Fear always obscures reason. All of us, if we do not realistically confront the political problems and other problems which disturb the Albanians, will be transformed into illusionists who produce phantoms and then are frightened by them. I must emphasize that the attempts to involve Albania as a negative factor in this conflict are very dangerous, especially now when the regenerating processes there are near completion.
