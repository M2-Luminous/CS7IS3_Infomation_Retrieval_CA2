Boumaza: "Strike in Guelma"] [Text] Interurban transportation in the Guelma Governorate is being quite seriously disrupted, not to say paralyzed, by a strike that was started on 25 March--the day before the resumption of classes--by private carriers, who carry over 50 percent of the traffic. In their strike notice dated 22 March, the 43 carriers affiliated with or belonging to the UGCAA [General Union of Algerian Merchants and Artisans] (32 out of a total of 68, according to the governorate's Directorate of Transportation) are demanding that individual fares be raised following the recent increases in fuel prices. In fact, several of them had been working since 16 March with a new fare schedule instituted by them. A copy of the new schedule was submitted to the Directorate of Transportation, but the latter did not give its approval. Result: about 10 of the carriers had their operating permits revoked. The Directorate of Transportation says, with proof to back it up, that "their demands have been sent to the supervising ministry, so there is no reason to stop work and violate their moral contract, especially in this period when we are experiencing crises of all kinds." By means of this "unlimited strike," the private carriers in Guelma are reacting to the new increases in fuel prices, and they have decided to keep their buses stopped until their demands are met because "operating costs are becoming very high," they explain. Last, and as always, it is the citizens, most of them students, who are paying for the strike while waiting to pay the price of a ticket, which is certainly going to rise.
