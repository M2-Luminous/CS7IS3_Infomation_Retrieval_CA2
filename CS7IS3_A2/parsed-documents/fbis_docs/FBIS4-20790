The recent price hike saw the Opposition in full cry today as Parliament began its Budget session with a boycott of the President's address by the National Front and Left parties, and a BJP-led (Bharatiya Janata Party) walkout in both Houses. The Opposition leaders, cutting across party lines, accused the Government of attempting to "bypass" Parliament by raising prices on the eve of the Budget. After the NF-Left (National Front) alliance had set the ball rolling in the morning by staying away from the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma's address in the Central Hall of Parliament, the BJP launched the second offensive when the two Houses later met separately. The walkout in the Lok Sabha was led by the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, and by his counterpart, Mr. Sikander Bakht, in the Rajya Sabha. The Government was clearly on the defensive, as the Opposition repeatedly charged it with "lowering" the dignity of Parliament and of rendering the Budget presentation "meaningless." Some Congress(I) members in both the Houses tried bravely to take on the Opposition, but quickly retreated in the face of a sharp counter-attack. The "action" began as soon as members returned to their respective Houses after the joint sitting. In the Lok Sabha, Mr. Vajpayee rose to protest against the price hikes immediately after the House had made obituary references to its five former members who died recently, and the Prime Minister had introduced the two new Ministers -- Mr. Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav and Dr. C. Silvera. `Budget rendered meaningless': Mr. Vajpayee pointed out that the Budget presentation had a certain "sanctity" about it, and the people waited for it with a sense of anticipation. By raising prices of a wide range of essential commodities, a few weeks before the Budget, the Government had rendered the Budget "meaningless." Charging the Government with having committed an impropriety, Mr. Vajpayee urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, to pull up the Government. What the Government had done amounted to an "insult" to Parliament, he argued, insisting on a ruling from the Speaker and warning the Treasury benches that the Opposition would not let them get away with it. The ruling party may have managed a majority in the House, but this did not mean that it could ignore Parliament.
