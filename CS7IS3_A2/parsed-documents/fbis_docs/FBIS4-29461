Hiroshi Oki of the Liberal Democratic Party, discussing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), said: "I think Japan has the capability to possess nuclear arms, but it has chosen not to possess them to cooperate (with the NPT). What do you think of this view, prime minister?" To that question, the prime minister replied, "I am completely of the same view." Later on, he told reporters in the Diet, "Certainly, Japan has the capability to possess nuclear arms, but has not produced them because of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty." The government so far has totally denied the possibility of using nuclear power for military purposes, insisting that "Japan's use of nuclear power is limited to that for peaceful purposes." A person close to the prime minister admitted: "We cannot help if someone claimed his remarks deviated from what the government has said so far." As a result of the suspicions regarding the DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear development, there are now people in some circles in Asia and the United States "talking about Japan acquiring nuclear weapons." That being the case, the prime minister's office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are trying to dampen the excitement arising therefrom, saying, "The remarks can bring useless misunderstanding at home and abroad." Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a news conference on the evening of 17 June, revised the remarks of the prime minister, saying, "the prime minister's remarks were somewhat inadequate. Japan's nuclear power is limited to peaceful use." Frowning to the reporters, he said, "I must explain these things to the prime minister properly." The prime minister looked as if he were surprised by such reaction within the government. Asked later in the evening by reporters to give his view again, he said, "Did I really say that? I do not remember." He then said emphatically, "What I am stressing is that although we have the capability, we are against nuclearization. I did not mean to say that we have the capability but do not use it. [sentence as received] We will never have nuclear weapons, from the standpoints of nuclear non-proliferation as well as from the three nonnuclear principles. There is no question about that." He thus in fact retracted his remarks, but this matter is likely to make waves, in a subtle manner, at home and abroad.
