The Banking Association joined the strike by offering its services only three days a week during this period, even though they did not attend the meeting where the private sector organizations decided to step into the political scene by staging the strike. "If we do not close now, for several days, they will impose on us a definite shutdown. We must demonstrate that we are decided on playing an important role in our country," one of the strike's promoters declared. The strikers explained: "This is not a political action, we only want to express our indignation for the international community which has imposed on us an unfair embargo." The Industrialists Association that did not respond to the first strike call continues to keep its distance. Nevertheless, some of its members were present at an assembly that was held on the first day of the strike, 28 January. The Association leaders said they do not understand what this movement is seeking, as according to them, no clear goal has been set. The politicians in charge are asked to reach a settlement but the strike's promoters do not indicate with whom that settlement must be made. The Chamber of Commerce as well as the great majority of those who participate in the meetings, supported the coup d'etat staged in 1991. Nevertheless, according to explanations given by participants in the meeting that prepared the strike, some of these have changed their position and currently they criticize the Army, accusing it of being corrupt and incapable of negotiating the Haitian political crisis. The supermarket owners agreed today to open their stores four days a week while the pharmacies work normally. Hotels have decided to "make the foreigners feel the weight of the embargo" by closing down the bars and reducing electricity supply. Meanwhile, the nation's five most important union organizations have rejected the private sector strike. "They have made a unilateral decision. The businessmen only want to dodge their responsibilities with the workers," declared a union leader.
