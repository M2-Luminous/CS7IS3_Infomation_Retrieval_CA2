The situation was dangerous because the terrorist was shouting hysterically and would have released the pin of the explosive device hidden in his clothing had any attempt been made to challenge him. He demanded to be taken by car to Rostov, where an aircraft was to be made ready for him at the local airport. During the long journey from the Ukrainian city representatives from both republics' security services and Ministries of Internal Affairs took every opportunity to negotiate with the terrorist. He watched over his hostages with constant vigilance in the ambulance that was made available to him. He would not remove the black stocking he was wearing on his head, and he threatened to pull out the pin whenever the situation seemed dangerous to him. In Rostov he spelled out his demands: $500,000 for himself, food and potties for the frightened and crying children, and an airliner made ready for a long-haul flight along the route Minsk-Kaliningrad-London-United States. Attempts to dissuade the terrorist from carrying out his criminal plan came to nothing. Suspiciously, without letting go of one of the boys, he took a preliminary look around the aircraft. The group boarded the aircraft in the following manner: The nurse led the way with the first young hostage; the terrorist followed a step behind her with the other. The woman had already stepped off the gangway into the cabin when someone brusquely pulled her and the child aside. Somebody else shielded them on the floor from a possible explosion. At that very moment the criminal was "grabbed" so tightly that even if he had wanted to execute his desperate plan, he would not have been able to move and activate the charge. He was neutralized by officers from a special section of the Rostov Internal Affairs Administration Department for Combatting Organized Crime.
