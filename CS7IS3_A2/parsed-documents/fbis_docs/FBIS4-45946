FBIS4-45946 "jptnd012___94038" JPRS-TND-94-012 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 12 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA INDIA Items of `Sensitive Nature' for Sale Items of `Sensitive Nature' for Sale 94WP0088B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 12 Apr 94 pp 1, 9 94WP0088B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Advertisement Smacks of Scam"] [Text] New Delhi, April 11--An advertisement placed by the defence ministry in specialised national and international aviation journals inviting global tenders for sale of certain Indian Air Force equipment has left a trail of unanswered questions, hinting even at a possible scandal. Among the listed items in the advertisement placed by the Special Surplus Stores Disposal Committee (SSSDC) of the Ministry of Defence are approximately one lakh pairs of blue grey winter uniforms comprising trousers and tunics with belts and brass buckles. Surprisingly, all these uniforms are stated to be in an absolutely new and unused condition of various sizes. Enquiries, however, reveal that the number is much more. The figures of these winter uniforms are in fact 94,000 full pairs (tunics and trousers) and 38,000 tunics. The other items, which indeed are of sensitive nature, are 161 lines comprising electronic equipment for the Russian made Surface to Air (SAM-II) missiles guidance system, 126 serviceable missiles, 35 SAM-II launchers, and missile liquid propellants--namely 92 litres of "O" fuel (nitric acid), 53,124 litres of "G" fuel and 20,785 litres of IPN [expansion not given]. The "O" and "G" fuels are used in the Intermediate Range `Agni' and surface to air Prithvi missile programmes. It is not clear whether the IAF [Indian Air Force] has applied its mind to the possible violation of the country's policy of not exporting missile technology or materials. As a senior IAF officer pointed out, "This could well tantamount to adding to proliferation of such dangerous and sensitive equipment," adding "how can we be sure that it won't unwittingly end up in Pakistani hands. After all it is a global tender and the Pakistanis can buy it, if not directly, through indirect means." Among the miscellaneous aircraft spares are 596 line items of the U.S. origin B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft which interestingly was phased out of the IAF in the mid-1960s. Among the 10 AN-12 transport aircraft put up for sale are two such aircrafts which have flown just 171 and 671 hours each after their last overhaul. But then this compares better with the 140 indigenously developed HE-24 Marut ground attack aircraft which was sold as scrap in the early 1980s. Of these 140 Maruts, 40 of them had flown just 20 hours each. Rather than have further developed on the HF-24, which had cost the IAF Rs 69 lakh a piece, its replacement in the form of the British Aerospace manufactured Jaguar had then cost the state exchequer Rs 8 crore a piece. Today the price per piece of the Jaguar is over Rs 60 crore. What has raised special interest in defence circles is the large number of winter uniforms in new and unused condition. While the Royal Air Force (RAF) of Britain has never changed its uniform since its inception, changes have been introduced into the IAF uniforms by almost every air chief. However, generally speaking, the IAF which provides free uniforms to the 75,000 to 80,000 airmen, allows for a long changeover period in order to ensure complete and proper utilisation of its stocks. On the other hand IAF officers are not provided free uniforms and are instead entitled to a uniform allowance of Rs 3,000 every seven years. When contacted an official spokesman of the IAF said that the uniforms in question were up to 34 years old dating back to 1960 and had been accumulated over a period of time. Enquiries with the SSSDC, however, revealed that the uniforms were up to 18 years old. But there is no convincing answer as to how and why such a large number of uniforms have been lying, to quote the advertisement, in a "new" and "unused" condition for so many years. Does it not amount to an unnecessary loss to the state exchequer?
