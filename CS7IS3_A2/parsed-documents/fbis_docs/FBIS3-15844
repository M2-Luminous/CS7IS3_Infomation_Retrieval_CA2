MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS reported earlier that as of 22 February, Lefortovo prison had been placed under the jurisdiction of the General Prosecutor's Office while remaining on the Federal Counterintelligence Service's books. Now Yeltsin's secret directive hands over Lefortovo remand unit, as of 1 March, to the financial care of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. From now on, the Ministry of Internal Affairs owns all Lefortovo property -- the building, weapons, and vehicles used in the remand unit. Simultaneously, all Lefortovo personnel have been transferred to serve in the Ministry of Internal Affairs system. This decision was of course called for by the recent scandal around the release of the October revolt leaders from the prison. Yeltsin seems to want the prison to be controlled in the future by people he trusts explicitly -- that is, [Internal Affairs Minister Viktor] Yerin and his team.
