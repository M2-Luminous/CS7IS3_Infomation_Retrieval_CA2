In an impromptu speech at a forum here yesterday, he said that a "comprehensive understanding" of Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the development speed and economic returns is essential to maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy growth of China's economy. He said that the country's economy is now growing vigorously, while initial successes have been made in macro-economic control. The whole Chinese nation is trying hard to push China's economy to a new height by following the principle of seizing the current opportunity for development, deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development and maintaining stability, he told the forum on Deng Xiaoping's ideas concerning the improvement of economic returns. Bo Yibo also called attention to the fact that low economic returns nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the composite index for industrial economic returns fell at the end of 1993. He warned against the bad tendency rising in some localities toward blindly undertaking construction projects, overextending the construction scale, blindly seeking development speed and neglecting economic returns. "The scale of fixed assets investment is so large as to exceed what China's financial capabilities can withstand," he said. He criticized some mass media organizations for failing to highlight the importance of improving economic returns. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to spread Deng Xiaoping's ideas on combining the development speed with economic returns to make sure that high speed and high economic returns promote each other. Over the past ten-plus years, Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed that the development speed must be combined with high economic returns, he said. "We must try our best to achieve a relatively high growth rate," he told the forum. According to Bo, it is both "possible and necessary" for China to achieve an annual growth rate of eight to nine percent in line with its economic strength, financial capabilities and materials supply. "We must combine development speed with economic returns, product quality and market demand," he noted. He opposed what he called a low development speed and underproduction which he said will adversely affect the improvement in China's overall economic strength and living standards. Meanwhile, he also warned against excessive stockpiles and redundant construction. Inventories of manufacturers covered in government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of last year, he added. He said that the combination of high speed with high economic returns serves as an "inevitable road" for China to achieve modernization in three phases. "This is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue," he said in conclusion.
