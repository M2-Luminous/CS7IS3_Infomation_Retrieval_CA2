FR940907-1-00017 FR940907-1-00006 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this proposal will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
