It can be said that the first question was "routine": Reports from officials responsible for the implementation of the 9 March government decree "On the Situation of the Russian Economy and the Prospects for Its Development in 1994" were heard. In recent times, weekly accounts of work done have become a tradition at Presidium sessions. But it was Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who delivered the report concerning the main question: "On the Draft of the Basic Guidelines for the Social Policy of the Russian Federation Government for 1994." Social problems the government intends to tackle in line with the "Basic Guidelines" are as follows: the fall in living standards for the bulk of the population; the dramatic intensification of social stratification; and the increase in the extent of hidden unemployment, and the threat of its escalation into overt unemployment.... The government intends to resolve these problems within the framework of preserving (and ultimately improving) correlations between the minimum working wage, pensions, grants, and benefits, and the size of minimum subsistence requirement. As the Ministry of Labor sees it, this can be achieved primarily by "protecting the fixed incomes of the population from inflation on the basis of various forms of indexation of the pay rates and salary scales of workers in budget-financed sectors." (It is typical that the intention is to "protect" from inflation, and not to fight it.) Admittedly, there is one condition -- that protective measures should be implemented "with due account of the financial possibilities of the state." But it is proposed that "urgent assistance to those categories of the population whose per capita income is lower than the minimum subsistence requirement" be given to the regions. Along with this, the need to create economic and legal conditions providing an incentive for high labor productivity by the country's able-bodied sector is pointed out. The Ministry of Labor also proposes to perfect the system of taxation for consumption funds and the revenues of individuals, which, according to the evaluations of certain experts, may culminate in the drastic wage control. For the purposes of averting "wholesale, mass unemployment" it is proposed to implement a Federal Employment Promotion Program for 1994. Incidentally, this program was also examined at the Government Presidium session. The Ministry of Labor also proposes setting in motion a mechanism for the regional regulation of employment on the basis of socially permissible levels of unemployment, which will be defined by each Federation component. When this level is reached, it is recommended that special measures, including administrative measures, be taken to restrict unemployment. What is interesting is that the Ministry of Labor believes that the funds envisaged by the 1994 Budget for social needs will be sufficient to implement the proposed program. Provided, of course, that the financial resources of enterprises and extrabudgetary funds are also harnessed. After a discussion, the government approved the "Basic Guidelines for Social Policy for 1994."
