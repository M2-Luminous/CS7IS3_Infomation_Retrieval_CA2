FR940620-1-00016 FR940620-1-00006 Our guidelines consist of the following steps: Step 1_Policy Information. The agency obtains information on all group health plans available to the Medicaid recipient. The Medicaid recipient is responsible for providing the State with all the necessary plan information and reporting changes with respect to plan benefits. This information must include the effective date of the policy, any exclusions to enrollment, the services covered under the policy, the employee's share of premiums paid to the health plan and other costs that may be necessary for enrollment in the plan. Step 2_Average Medicaid Costs. Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), the agency obtains the average total annual Medicaid costs of persons having characteristics similar to the applicant (age, sex, categorical group and geographic data). Step 3_Medicaid Costs for Included Services. The agency determines the amount of the total yearly Medicaid expenditures for services covered by the specific group health policy. Compute the percentage of expenditures for group health plan services to expenditures for Medicaid services. Then adjust the average total annual Medicaid costs specified in step 2 by this percentage. This is the ``Medicaid average covered expense amount.'' Step 4_Group Health Plan Costs for Included Services. The agency adjusts the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount calculated in step 3) for the higher prices employer plans typically pay. The agency may use a single State-specific factor derived from experience with third party liability (TPL) claims or use group health plan specific information. Alternatively, the agency may use a national average factor which HCFA supplies and updates periodically. The Medicaid covered expense is multiplied by this factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer health plan. This is the ``health plan cost.'' Step 5_Adjustment for Coinsurance and Deductible Amounts. The health plan cost (amount from step 4) is multiplied by an average employer health insurance payment rate to obtain the ``employer recognized covered expense'' amount. The agency derives the average employer health insurance payment rate from State specific tables, if available, or group health plan specific information. Alternatively, for State agency use, HCFA supplies and periodically updates national tables. This health insurance average payment rate number will vary in relation to the amount of the average employer recognized covered expense.
