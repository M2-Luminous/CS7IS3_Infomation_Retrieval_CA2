Laar, answering a question by opposition Centrist Party MP Andra Veidemann before the parliament today said that the shortcomings discovered had been "not essential" and that they by no means negatively affected the combat effectiveness of the weapons. Laar said the faults in some cases, for instance, were just that a gun was having no bayonet or clip, or that plastic bottles and oilcan corks were partly missing. "Those who claim that Estonia bought 60 million dollars worth of weapons that cannot be used are lying. None of the shortcomings discovered make it impossible to take the weapons into use," the premier said. Laar said the supplier, the Israeli company TAAS, was to deliver the missing parts in the near future. Coalition Party deputy leader and deputy head of the parliament's defense commission Peeter Lorents in his comments said he had seldom heard "such a brassy lie." He said the shortcomings discovered had been of much more serious character. For instance, none of the Israeli light mines tested in Estonia had properly worked, and a grenade shot from a antitank gun had fallen 1.5 meters lower than what was shown in product specifications. The prime minister after Lorents' remarks said the MP should politely bring his apologies and choose his words in the future, and warned that in the opposite case legal action could be taken against him. Centrist MP Olav Anton in his comments on Laar's explanation of the issue said "such kind of foggy talk the prime minister should use with his defense minister, who has not served in the army." Opposition has also alleged that the old 23-millimeter anti-aircraft guns, found to be substandard by Estonian experts, were part of the arms deal and not simply a gift as was claimed later. Israel's national company TAAS at the end of January brought as a gift to Estonia more than 20 million kroons worth of trophy weapons seized in its wars with the Soviet-backed Arab countries. The shipment included 23-millimeter Soviet-made guns, as well as RPD and PKT machine guns. The prime minister today reasserted his claim that the shipment was a gift and stood apart from the arms deal. "The Israeli party feels the responsibility to bring into order the consignment delivered by it to Estonia," Laar said. MP Juri Toomepuu claims he has seen the text of the agreement signed between Estonia and the Israeli company and that the document defines 23-millimeter guns as part of the deal. Kuno Raude, chairman of the Rural Union party, in his remarks said that "each country has its honor and dignity, and in this case Estonia has been cheated."
