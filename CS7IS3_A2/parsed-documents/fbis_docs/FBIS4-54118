By this, President Kim filled all the nine posts of four-star generals of the ROK Armed Forces with the generals he himself promoted and appointed. Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said, "All the three-star generals who number over 20 are also those whom President Kim promoted." The three- and four-star generals reported their promotion at Chongwadae [presidential offices], with President Kim himself affixing the badge of rank to them. Therefore, all the senior generals of the Armed Forces have become 'President Kim's generals.' Spokesman Chu said, "A considerable number of two-star generals have also been promoted or appointed to their present posts by President Kim. This shows how rapidly reform in the military has been carried out." Spokesman Chu added, "This concludes the personnel actions for military reform." President Kim, receiving a report from Navy Chief of Staff Kim and sharing coffee with him, said, "I am gratified that the military is keeping step with the new order of reform and change and is carrying out its duties well in a stable condition." He added, "Only the Navy's chief of staff was a three-star admiral, while the chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force were four-star generals. This imbalance has now been resolved."
