During the trial, families of the victims and Taiwan crime experts will be allowed to attend, and the relevant departments will report details of the case to the court. A few days ago, the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait invited Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and relevant experts to come to Hangzhou before 4 May to listen to reports on the case. Hong Kong's WEN WEI PO reported that Beijing's high-level leadership has paid close attention to the Qiandao Lake case and has taken it into serious account: it has meticulously attended to the entire investigation process. When the relevant department reported the verification of the suspects' identities, it produced particular evidence which had been obtained through identifying their fingerprints. Because the Hairui had been burned and sprayed with water and the scene had been seriously destroyed, it was very hard to obtain fingerprints. But after careful checks on the entire ship by experts, the suspects' fingerprints, which had been left on the ship when they climbed over from their motorboat, were found.
