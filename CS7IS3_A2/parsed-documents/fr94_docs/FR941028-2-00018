I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and service. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement List.
