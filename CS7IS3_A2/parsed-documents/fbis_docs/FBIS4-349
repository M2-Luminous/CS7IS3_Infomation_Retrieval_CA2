FBIS4-349 "drafr068_a_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Kigali Erupts in Violence; Ministers Killed Kigali Erupts in Violence; Ministers Killed Prime Minister Killed LD0704193094 Paris Radio France International in French 1830 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704193094 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Excerpts] The assassination yesterday of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi has plunged the Rwandan capital into total chaos. [passage omitted] The Rwandan prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyamana, has been killed in the center of Kigali, near the presidential palace, but the circumstances of her death remain unclear. The UN mission, UNAMIR, has not been allowed to inspect the site of her death. Some sources said this morning that she had tried to take refuge in the UN Program for Development headquarters, while others say that she was killed while under the protection of Senegalese blue helmets. [passage omitted] There are reports of house-to-house massacres, and small groups of youths have been seen roaming the streets armed with machetes and clubs. The Jesuit community in Kigali also seems to have been specifically targeted. Seventeen Jesuit priests were savagely murdered at the Christos Center. A group of soldiers divided those present, separating the Rwandan priests from the foreigners. A jeep full of officers arrived a few moments later, and then the soldiers gave the order to execute the Rwandans, both Tutsis and Hutus without distinction. This is what we were told by one of the surviving priests. This evening, we have also heard from UNAMIR that members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who had been billeted in the compound of the former parliament since the Arusha accords, have come under attack from members of the gendarmerie. There has been hand-to-hand fighting, but we still do not have any toll for today's violence.
