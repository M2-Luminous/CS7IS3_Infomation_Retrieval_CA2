The Argentine foreign and economy ministers, Guido Di Tella and Domingo Cavallo; the Brazilian foreign and finance ministers, Celso Amorim and Fernando Henrique Cardoso; the Paraguayan foreign and finance ministers, Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner and Crispiniano Sandoval; and the Uruguayan foreign and economy ministers, Sergio Abreu and Ignacio de Posadas, today met in Buenos Aires to discuss this goal. In a joint communique, the Mercosur ministers agreed "to discuss every available option to promote a comprehensive regional economic integration on the basis of the Brazilian proposal" to create the South American Free Trade Association (ALCSA). To this end, the ministers decided to meet again in Buenos Aires on 25 March "to make headway toward making ALCSA compatible." At that special meeting, "the continental projection of Mercosur will be evaluated." They agreed on stating that "bilateral or multilateral agreements with other South American countries" with a view to furthering free trade in the region "will be concluded despite other integration agreements those countries may have entered with other countries in Latin America or elsewhere in the hemisphere." They also agreed to "maintain close coordination regarding ALCSA and other proposals" as a way of "promoting the participation of Mercosur member countries in agreements relating to them so that a common policy can be implemented." The Mercosur ministers also expressed their "support for the full deregulation of trade among all South American countries as an ultimate objective and as a way to promote the incorporation of the region into the world's and hemisphere's economy." The ministers reaffirmed their support for "compliance" with the Mercosur implementation timetable "as far as the establishment of a common external tariff is concerned."
