He revealed the proposals at the forum "How to Have Confidence in Venezuela," which was organized by the Metropolitan University Student Council. The forum, which is taking place at the Consolidated Cultural Center, will conclude today. He stated that "at the Thought and Action Foundation, we have been studying the country's economic and social crisis. A few days ago, Harvard University invited me to a seminar to discuss the economic and social situation in Latin America. Countries that are achieving success, like Chile, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico, were cited as examples there. Venezuela is not yet on that list of successful countries." Fernandez asserted that "Venezuela can be just as successful as other countries, if not more so, if we do things right." The 10 proposals put forward by Eduardo Fernandez are the following: 1. Restructure public finances. This includes, of course, a reform of the tax system to expand the base of taxpayers paying moderate rates. In other words, a value-added tax throughout the chain of commercial sales, that is, all the way to the final consumer. The countries that have achieved success have done it this way. 2. Pursue a serious privatization policy that will open up opportunities for new and better investment, both national and international. 3. Defend workers' wages and middle class income. Because this is so necessary, the battle against inflation and the high cost of living must be a top priority. Part and parcel of this effort is support for the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) in its defense of the country's foreign reserves and its efforts to stabilize the bolivar. Confidence is not the exclusive responsibility of the BCV. There must be harmony between monetary and exchange policy and fiscal policy. 4. Work to create jobs and wealth. To deal with unemployment, both actual and potential, we need a policy of openness to domestic and foreign public and private investment. At this time, Venezuela is not on the list of countries where international advisers are recommending investment. Other countries are making investments that could come to our shores and help create jobs and generate wealth. I have talked to people associated with international financial centers, and they acknowledge that with a coherent economic policy, Venezuela could once again be an attractive place for investment. New investment will come in when we have clear and stable rules of play. We must not forget that new investment represents new jobs, new job opportunities, and new economic resources for the country. 5. Continue to be an oil-producing country. The Investment Plan of Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. (PDVSA) is ready. This program must be given broad national support. We must also support the strategic partnerships that have been designed to contribute to the development of our oil potential. 6. Move ahead decisively to create pension funds and modernize the reform of social benefits with a view to giving Venezuelan workers a comprehensive and modern system of social security. The Thought and Action Foundation organized a seminar on this issue a few weeks ago, and I have no doubt that the climate is right for reaching a broad consensus in this regard. 7. Complete the clean-up of the Venezuelan financial system. To achieve this goal, I propose a policy of openness and competition. Only in this way will Venezuela's development be assured of enough solid financing to make it competitive in the world economy. By opening up the system and encouraging competition, we will help reduce interest rates, which is necessary to stimulate investment in projects that are of interest for economic growth. 8. Adopt a policy of openness to international trade and integration in increasingly larger economic spheres. In the long run, the objective should be for our country to join a hemispheric free trade pact extending all the way from Alaska to Patagonia. In the short run, we should strengthen our subregional accords and our compliance with the obligations we have undertaken by joining GATT. 9. Negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Multilateral Agencies to profit from all the advantages offered by these organizations. In particular, we should seize the opportunity to strengthen our international reserves. 10. Make educational reform a national priority. It is particularly important to emphasize the training of human resources to ensure that Venezuelan workers will have access to better jobs and higher pay. The 10 points I have proposed here could be reduced to three very specific proposals: - Produce more foreign exchange. - Manage it better. - Ensure that everyone will have a share in our national wealth, primarily through education. I contend that "a climate of understanding among all the players on the national stage will contribute to the development of this program." "If we do things right, and if we tell the country the truth right up front, we will win the confidence battle, and we will put Venezuela on the road to economic progress and social prosperity," he concluded.
