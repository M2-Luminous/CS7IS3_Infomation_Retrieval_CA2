The Military Are Concerned by the Economy, Not by Politics"] [Excerpt] None of the journalists who came yesterday to the defense minister's press conference knew for sure what had prompted the event. Representatives of the mass media asked Pavel Grachev lots of questions concerning the problems of the Armed Forces that they were interested in before the purpose of the press conference was clarified. Mr. Grachev denied rumors that the Army had been put on alert and that some of his actions were allegedly politically motivated. In the view of many observers, one of the reasons for the rumors was the postponement of Pavel Grachev's announced visit to the Leningrad Military District. Some time ago the defense minister said that he would stay in Moscow as long as the president and the General Staff chief are away from the capital in order to exercise day-to-day command and control of the strategic nuclear forces. In the press conference, Pavel Grachev flatly denied any political bottom line of this decision, saying only that such is normal practice and that one of the three must always remain in Moscow. Today, when General Staff Chief Mikhail Kolesnikov is returning from France, the defense minister will leave for Kaliningrad. Pavel Grachev also denied rumors that there are units in the Moscow Military District that had been put on alert. He reaffirmed that the Army does not interfere in the political struggle and it is not going to do so, but that it will act decisively if it senses the threat of civil war. [passage omitted]
