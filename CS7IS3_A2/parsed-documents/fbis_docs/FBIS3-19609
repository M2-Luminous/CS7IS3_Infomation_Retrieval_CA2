Mr. Balkany, the mayor of Levallois-Perret [Hauts-de-Seine], who also has close links with [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, has deliberately stirred the rivalry between Mr. Balladur and Mr. Chirac. He made his declaration at a time when the head of government's rating is dropping in the opinion polls, while Chirac's backers, who have been very dejected over the past few months, seem to be regaining hope. "All together behind Edouard Balladur!" Balkany wrote in an article published in LE MONDE. According to the Hauts-de-Seine deputy, "it is time for Edouard Balladur to announce his intentions for the presidential election" to quench the "cacophony" which currently reigns within the majority. Without actually calling them by name, Balkany severely lashed out at Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he said that "the French are tired of and fed up with the eternal disputes between the leaders of the two main majority parties." "It is time that a playwright finally writes the last chapter of the adventures of Plic and Ploc (nickname sometimes used for the leaders of the RPR and UDF [French Democratic Union])." `Cacophony' Last December, defying Mr. Balladur's "instructions" [not to raise the issue of the presidential election], Social Affairs Minister Simone Veil and Defense Minister Francois Leotard pleaded in favor of the prime minister's candidacy. These declarations provoked some commotion within the majority and further deteriorated the relationship between the head of government and the RPR president. Mr. Balladur is sticking to the policy he adopted on entering the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]: not to talk about the presidential election this year and to ask his ministers and the majority to make the least possible mention of it. Mr. Balkany's declaration is not likely to put an end to the "cacophony" which he denounced in his article. In an interview with today's LE FIGARO, Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR and a well-known supporter of Chirac, responded by recalling that Mr. Balladur's appointment to the Matignon originated in "a sort of pact" between the prime minister and Jacques Chirac, whose "completion" would be Chirac's election as president. [passage omitted] Pasqua's Voice? The fact that a deputy from the majority is urging that "ranks be closed" behind the prime minister is nothing abnormal; that he expresses his support for Edouard Balladur's candidacy in the presidential election is, after all, his right. But the fact that it is Patrick Balkany, whose links with Charles Pasqua are well known, makes the issue particularly important. Could it be the views of the interior minister which were expressed in the LE MONDE column by the deputy and Levallois-Peret mayor? The question is worth asking. Nobody has given an answer so far. But the reaction within Jacques Chirac's entourage clearly indicates that Patrick Balkany's declaration is not being considered as simply an inconsiderate statement by a rank-and-file deputy. It should be admitted that the Levallois mayor did not act with great subtlety. Thus far, it has only been within the UDF camp, through the declarations of Simone Veil and Francois Leotard, that voices were heard openly calling for the head of government's candidacy for the presidency. That such a call is now being made from within the RPR is all the more annoying to the Rue de Lille [RPR Headquarters]. It has immediately led to an open letter being sent to Patrick Balkany by three Chirac supporters, accusing him of divisive action within the majority and "cordially" inviting him "not to become the Gaston Lagaffe of the RPR." All this will not contribute to a better atmosphere within the majority, and leads one to ask what the atmosphere will be within the majority in the months to come.
