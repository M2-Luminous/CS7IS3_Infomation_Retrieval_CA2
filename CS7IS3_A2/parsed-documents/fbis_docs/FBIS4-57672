A total commercial embargo against Haiti will begin this evening (0401 GMT Sunday) to force the military coupists to restore power to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom they ousted on 30 September 1991. Endara, who assumed power on 20 December 1989 after the U.S. intervention in Panama, stated he is closely following events in Haiti, and he said the invasion "is coming." Moreover, the Panamanian president deplored the way in which former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was arrested and taken to prison because he was president of his country on two occasions. Endara, who said he feels a lot of sympathy for Perez whether or not he perpetrated any crime, said the case should have been handled differently because it involves a friend of the region. Endara added that another measure should have been adopted, for example "house imprisonment." Likewise, Endara said he will travel to Tegucigalpa on Tuesday to meet with his Central American counterparts and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The purpose of the meeting is to analyze the agenda for the "Summit of the Americas," to be held in Miami in December. Endara, who will leave his post on 1 September, explained he has already talked with his successor, Ernesto Perez Balladares, to review everything that will be discussed in next week's meeting with Gore.
