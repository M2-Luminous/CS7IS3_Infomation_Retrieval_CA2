He was met at the Belgrade airport by Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime minister. In a statement for journalists, Papoulias did not announce new ideas for peace, but stressed that the European Union will remain, as he said, dynamically present in the continuation of the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Jelena Vidic reports: [Vidic] Journalists meeting the Greek foreign minister at the Belgrade airport asked him whether the European Union was disturbed by the monopolization of the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the United States and Russia. Papoulias answered the following: [Begin Papoulias recording in Greek with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] A political factor such as Europe is not disturbed. In any case, we want to maintain our presence together with other powerful factors such as the United States and Russia. However, no one should forget the European Union's contribution so far, nor the ideas in the program of activities of the European Union. These ideas are today still the most important ideas. [end recording] [Vidic] Papoulias said that Bosnia-Herzegovina will be discussed at the informal meeting of the European Union's ministers at the end of this month. He said that the possible dispatch of Turkish soldiers to Bosnia is currently of interest for all Balkan countries, because they had agreed not to deploy their troops on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. However, if the Turkish troops are deployed in Bosnia, Greece will consider the possibility of doing the same, Papoulias said. Here is now what Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime minister, said about expectations from talks with the Greek foreign minister today. [Begin Simic recording] From today's talks we expect the speeding up of the process of settling the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Balkans in general. In this sense we will hold talks with Mr. Papoulias with pleasure. We are very familiar with the stand of Greece, which is investing enormous efforts toward the peaceful settlement of the crisis, and toward the settlement by political means of all problems affecting the Balkan Peninsula.
