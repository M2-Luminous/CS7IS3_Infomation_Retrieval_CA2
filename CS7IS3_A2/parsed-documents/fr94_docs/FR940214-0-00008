ACTION: Suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document suspends for the months of July and August 1994 provisions of the Georgia Federal milk marketing order that provide for payments to producers on the basis of a base and excess payment plan. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 1994, through August 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued December 7, 1993; published December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action will encourage milk production during the months of July and August, which are months of declining milk production. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900). Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, and arguments thereon. Three comment letters were received in response to the proposed suspension. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that for the months of July and August 1994 the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 1. In ยง1007.32, paragraph (a). 2. In ยง1007.61(a), the words ``of September through January''. 3. In ยง1007.61, paragraph (b).
