FR940906-0-00020 FR940906-0-00012 5.C. Verification of Continued Attainment Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Huntington area depends, in part, on the State of West Virginia's efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of West Virginia will track the status and effectiveness of the maintenance plan by periodically updating the emissions inventory every three years. West Virginia has committed to perform this tracking on an annual basis in order to enable the State of West Virginia to implement the contingency measures of its maintenance plan as expeditiously as possible. The State of West Virginia annual update will indicate new source growth, as indicated by annual emission statements. The State of West Virginia will continue to monitor ambient ozone levels by operating its ambient ozone air quality monitoring network in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. 5.D. Contingency Plan The level of VOC and NO x emissions in the Huntington area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS. Despite the State of West Virginia's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the Huntington area may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, West Virginia has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of future ozone air quality problems. In the event that exceedances of the ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated at any of the three monitors in the Huntington-Ashland area, or in the event that periodic emission inventory updates or major permitting activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in ozone precursor emissions has occurred or will occur, West Virginia will accordingly select and adopt additional measures including one or more of the following to assure continued attainment: 1. An extension of the applicability of 45CSR21 (VOC/RACT rule) to include source categories previously excluded 2. A revision to new source permitting requirements requiring more stringent emissions control technology and/or emission offsets 3. NO X RACT requirements if such requirements are not already applicable 4. Regulations to establish plant-wide emission caps (potentially with emissions trading provisions) 5. Stage II Vapor Recovery regulations 6. Highway Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program One or more of these regulatory revisions would be selected and a draft regulation(s) developed by the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) for adoption as an emergency rule(s) within three (3) months after verification of a monitored ozone standard violation. WVDEP's adopted emergency rule(s) for the selected control measure(s) will be implemented within six (6) months after adoption and will be filed as legislative rule(s) for permanent authorization by the legislature as required under West Virginia law. 5.E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten years. EPA has determined that the maintenance plan adopted by the State of West Virginia and submitted to EPA on November 12, 1992 along with additional information submitted on February 22, 1994 and August 10, 1994 meets the requirements of section 175A of the CAA. Therefore, EPA is approving the maintenance plan. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective October 21, 1994 unless by October 6, 1994, adverse comments are received. If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on October 21, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving the ozone maintenance plan for the Huntington (Cabell and Wayne counties) area of West Virginia submitted on November 12, 1992, as revised on February 22, 1994 and August 10, 1994 because it meets the requirements of Section 175A. In addition, the Agency is redesignating the Huntington area to ozone attainment because the Agency has determined that the provisions of Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation have been met. The Huntington portion of the Huntington-Ashland nonattainment area is subject to the Act's requirements for nonattainment areas until and unless it is redesignated to attainment. Because it is a nonattainment area, on January 15, 1993 EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for the Huntington portion of the ozone nonattainment area. Similarly on January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor that West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% plan for the area. These findings commenced the sanctions process outlined by section 179 of the Act. The 2:1 offset sanction will be in effect in the Huntington area as of September 6, 1994 as a result of the January 15, 1993 finding. Upon the effective date of this final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request and maintenance plan, the requirement for West Virginia to submit a basic I/M program and 15% plan for this area will be lifted. Upon that same effective date, both findings will be automatically rescinded in the Huntington area and any sanctions imposed as of that date will be lifted. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request will not affect a substantial number of small entities. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP Approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 255&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.
