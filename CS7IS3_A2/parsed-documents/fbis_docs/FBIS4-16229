At a meeting with chief editors of the Russian mass media at the ITAR-TASS news agency on 12 April he came across as a person who is open for discussion, independent, but complex. Ivan Rybkin acknowledged that he still has differences of opinion with Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's Aministration, on the question of social guarantees for former Russian Federation people's deputies. "Filatov and I spent four hours discussing this problem until midnight last night," Ivan Rybkin said. As is well known, in accordance with the president's edict of 6 October 1993, Sergey Filatov and the commission headed by former Russian Federation deputy Aleksey Surkov drew up a list of 151 people's elected representatives of the previous parliament who have been denied the one-off monetary grant equivalent to a year's salary based on their monthly salary at the time their deputies' powers ceased. This is equivalent to approximately 3-4 million rubles per person, to be allocated, of course, from the state budget. The question of transferring to the ownership of those deputies Moscow apartments previously allocated to them for the duration of their term in the former Supreme Soviet remains in dispute. In an interview with your ITAR-TASS observer, Sergey Filatov noted that the housing question will be resolved on an individual basis. Meanwhile, as Filatov said, "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not the kind of man who would give municipal apartments away to anyone free of charge," apartments worth $60,000-$70,000 each at market rates. "Otherwise it will be hard to explain to Muscovites why we are retaining housing in the capital for people who instigated civil war," Sergey Filatov believes. Unlike Filatov, Ivan Rybkin believes that "magnanimity discourages one's opponents." In his opinion, the transfer of Moscow apartments to the former Russian Federation deputies "will not result in great losses, and if we are concerned about civil peace this measure must be taken." Moving on to an assessment of the past three months of the Duma's activity, Ivan Rybkin noted that "the chamber has not accepted the implementation of the principle of a formal majority in decisionmaking," and added that in Russian history it was often the minority which was in the right. In establishing the structure of the chamber the deputies have managed to give the Duma the status of a mini-parliament in which every draft law is "tested out first," which significantly eases the voting procedure, the speaker noted. As an illustration he cited the voting on the set of amnesty decisions and put forward the paradoxical thought with regard to the events of August 1991 and 3-4 October 1993 that "the idea of consigning things to oblivion is very important because without it there can be no progress toward the conclusion of the Agreement on Civil Peace."
