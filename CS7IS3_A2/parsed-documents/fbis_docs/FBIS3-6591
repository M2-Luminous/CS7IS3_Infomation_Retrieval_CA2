The meeting discussed the analyses of the present situation by the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], the National Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of National Defense [MND], and discussed measures to cope with the situation. The meeting analyzed that there is little likelihood of North Korea making actual armed provocation, but decided to formulate preparatory measures for all the potential developments, including the North Korean armed provocation against the South. At the meeting President Kim stressed that the ROK should defend peace on the Korean peninsula and that the ROK is capable of doing it, and requested the participants in the meeting to take all necessary measures to establish the posture to cope with any contingency. The meeting assessed that North Korea will keep up even steeper tensions on the Korean peninsula in the short run, and decided to have an unidentified number of Patriot missiles deployed soon and get the Team Spirit joint military exercise resumed in April. The meeting also extensively discussed ways to build up the ROK-U.S. combined defense capability. Initially the meeting was supposed to decide the timing of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise watching North Korea's attitude, but since "even tougher steps," such as the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and replacing fuel rods, can be taken by North Korea, the meeting concluded that the Team Spirit exercise has to be conducted in April. The meeting concluded that in view of the North Korean side's attitude of rupturing the envoy exchange on 19 March, the inter- Korean dialogue will have to be suspended for the time being, and confirmed the principle that the ROK will intensify international alliances by such means as participating in international sanctions by the IAEA and the UN Security Council. The meeting decided that the ROK will closely cooperate with Japan and China to this end and that President Kim will take the matter up intensively during his visit to Japan and China. The meeting decided that the ROK will explain to China--which is persistently advocating its principled position that the North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully--that international sanctions are unavoidable for peace and security in Northeast Asia. The meeting decided to request China to persuade North Korea in this connection. The meeting also agreed that international sanctions will be reconsidered if North Korea admits its mistake, completely permits the IAEA inspections, thereby ensuring the nuclear transparency, and sincerely comes to the inter-Korean dialogue for envoy exchange, before the UN Security Council decides sanctions. The meeting, however, on the basis of its reflection that the appeasement policy toward the North brought about the North Korean insincerity and misjudgment, decided that the ROK will maintain a resolute position. President Kim noted that North Korea intends to take advantage of the crisis atmosphere inspired by its raving about not hesitating a war despite the extreme economic difficulty it is suffering, and instructed the participants in the meeting to establish a military posture of countermeasures and to intensify public information activity for the people to prevent the people from turning restless. Participating in the security-related ministers meeting held for the second time at Chongwadae [presidential residence] this year were Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang; Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB; Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu; Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; NSP Director Kim Tok; Chon Yong-taek, director of contingency plans; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Pak Kwan-yong, secretary general of the Presidential Secretariat; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs; and Chu Ton-sik, presidential spokesman.
