FR940802-2-00091 FR940802-2-00054 II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Amendment to Section 3 of the Code The current provisions of Section 3 of the Code provide for the appointment of a Director of Arbitration by the NASD Board of Governors to perform all administrative duties and functions in connection with matters submitted to the NASD for arbitration. The Director has, on occasion, found it necessary to delegate certain functions of the Director to other senior management employees of the NASD's Arbitration Department, especially as a result of the significant growth in the Department's staff and workload. The NASD believes this delegation power is inherent in the authority of the Director to manage the functions of the NASD's Arbitration Department. Nevertheless, the NASD is proposing to amend Section 3 of the Code to expressly provide for such delegation. The proposed rule change to Section 3 provides that the duties and functions of the Director may be delegated as appropriate by the Director. Further, in the event that the Director has been incapacitated, resigned, removed or has been permanently or indefinitely disabled from the performance of the duties and functions of the Director, the proposed rule change provides that the President of the Association or an Executive Vice President may appoint an interim Director to perform the functions and responsibilities of the Director. The purpose of this rule change is to clarify the lines of authority and delegation powers of the Director under the Code. The amendment also specifies that the power to delegate functions resides with the Director unless circumstances occur which render the Director permanently or indefinitely unable to perform the duties and functions of the Director. Amendment to Section 15 of the Code The current provisions of Section 15 of the Code specify that claims or controversies are not eligible for submission to arbitration where 6 years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the matter. Section 15 does not specify the party responsible for determining whether 6 years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the matter. As a result, there have been conflicting decisions over who possesses such authority; the Director, the courts or arbitrators. In addition, the current provisions of Section 15 do not provide a procedure for a respondent to challenge the eligibility of a claim, and there is no requirement that the event or occurrence establishing the eligibility of a claim be identified. Express Grant of Authority to Director to Determine Eligibility The NASD is proposing to amend Section 15 to add six new subsections giving the Director the authority to determine whether the claim alleges that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy and filing of the claim. Under the proposed rule change the Director's eligibility determination will be final and will not be subject to review by the arbitrators under Section 35 of the Code. Further, by placing the authority to make final eligibility determinations, as a matter of the contract to arbitrate, in the hands of the Director, the proposed rule change is intended to foreclose attempts by parties to an arbitration to seek different eligibility rulings from the courts or arbitrators. The NASD believes that this amendment is consistent with recent court decisions on the question of arbitrability. It is beyond dispute that, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the courts, not the arbitrators, determine if a contract to arbitrate exists between the parties. See AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, 649 (1986). Thus, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the courts determine the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for arbitration on subject matter, timeliness or other grounds. Id. (emphasis added). The NASD expressly intends that the proposed amendment to Section 15 will constitute the agreement of the parties to have the issue of eligibility decided by the Director of Arbitration. Arbitration agreements are contractual obligations which are governed by general principles of contract interpretation. Haviland v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 736 F.Supp. 507 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); Nilson v. Prudential-Bache Securities, 761 F.Supp. 279 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). Therefore, unless the purpose or provisions of the agreement to arbitrate run counter to the Federal Arbitration Act or public policy, parties may agree to any terms they desire ( See, e.g., Apollo Computer, Inc. v. Berg, 886 F.2d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 1989) (``Parties may .␣.␣. agree to allow the arbitrator to decide both whether a particular dispute is arbitrable as well as the merits of the dispute.''), and the courts must give effect to such freely negotiated terms. See Snyder v. Smith, 736 F.2d 409, 419 (7th Cir. 1984). Because Section 15 does not specify who has the authority to determine if a claim is eligible for submission to arbitration, the courts have construed that term of the agreement and have routinely held that it is a question of fact relating to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate and that such questions of fact are for the courts to decide. See, e.g., Edward D. Jones & Co. v. Sorrells, 957 F.2d 509, 514 (7th Cir. 1992), citing as controlling, AT&T, supra, at 649. The NASD, however, is expressly intending that under amended Section 15 the Director will make eligibility determinations; the effect of the amendment being that the parties to an agreement to arbitrate before the NASD will have agreed that the Director alone will determine if the claim is eligible for submission to arbitration before the NASD. In addition, current Section 15, entitled ``Time Limitation on Eligibility,'' is proposed to be retitled ``Eligibility'' and renumbered Subsection 15(a). The language of current Section 15 (proposed new Subsection 15(a)) is also being amended to eliminate the provision that states that the six year eligibility limitation does not apply to cases directed to arbitration by a court. Therefore, a court order directing the parties to arbitration is not a determination that the matter is eligible for arbitration under the rules of the NASD. These changes are intended to further clarify the distinction between issues related to eligibility, which the forum is entitled to control, and statutes of limitations, which are governed by applicable law. The relationship is discussed in more detail below.
