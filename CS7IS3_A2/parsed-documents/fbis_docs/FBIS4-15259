Quite recently it was a facility surrounded by barbed wire, which even some of the commander's deputies were prohibited from entering. But after it was visited by the U.S. secretary of defense and by FRG, Chinese, Indian, and North Korean delegation heads, it was the turn of journalists. Admittedly, Russian journalists, not foreign journalists contrary to the present tradition. What is the Moscow Air Defense District command post? The three-story bunker buried 20 meters in the ground with a two-story building on top resembles an officers' club. The command post can withstand a direct hit by an atom bomb, and can operate on stand-alone for 10 days without depending on the city's electricity and water supply networks. According to Lieutenant General Pavel Kuznetsov, Moscow Air Defense District chief of staff, the district monitors an air space of 1.3 million square km, the territory of 24 Russian oblasts, the district's 4,000-km border, and over 140 highly important military-state command and control and economic facilities, including those where there is a danger of radiation. There are eight of them -- nuclear electric power stations. It can track and fire on 500 targets in flight at once. Although during a conversation with journalists Colonel General Anatoliy Kornukov, commander of the Moscow Air Defense District, attributed the unusual openness of the district's secret installations to the military's sincere desire not to keep secrets from their people where there should be none and to the traditional meetings with the public on the eve of Air Defense Day, there is another reason for the journalists visiting the main command post. There has been talk that air defense is unnecessary and of the need to cut the already small military budget by disbanding the Air Defense Forces. Gen. Korunkov said that no one has any intention of disbanding the Air Defense Forces. Strangely enough, it is far cheaper to keep them in a state of high combat readiness today than to cut them, and the need for them still exists.
