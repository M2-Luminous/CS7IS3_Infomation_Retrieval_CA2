Shcherbakov: "The Sowing Is Approaching and the Reorganizers Again Have an Itch"] [Text] Why do politicians and reformers of different stripes prefer to perplex the peasants and disrupt their fortunes exactly in the spring and, without fail, before the sowing? You will recall that both collectivization and the reforming of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in 1992 were quite suited to those times. Seemingly, counting on the fact that the land would remain a strong umbilical cord, the peasant would go to the field just the same, summoned by a primordial instinct during the passionate springtime no matter what happened. Politics and the reformers' capers are not for him at this time. The analytical center of the Russian Federation president's administration recently prepared a memorandum on the final elimination of kolkhozes, sovkhozes and even newly established joint-stock companies before the start of the spring sowing. The memorandum was sent to all Russia's regions and, one must say, caused much commotion. In response to this memorandum and also the campaign of lies and slander unleashed by the mass information media in regards to the Russian peasantry, which is being accused of almost all the economic misfortunes, the Agrarian Party of Russia faction in the State Duma issued a statement on 15 February. This document provides a well-grounded rebuff, in particular, to the leaders of the Russia's Choice union who think that the peasants are receiving excessive financial infusions from the state. In their opinion, it is this that is causing the present inflation. However, let us nevertheless examine just how generously the state is helping the village. As is known, the Russian Federation Government's decree, which was adopted 23 February concerning the economic conditions for the functioning of the agroindustrial complex during 1994, allocates 5 trillion rubles during the first half of the year; during January-March, that is, during the spring sowing -- only 1.3 trillion rubles. Meanwhile, specialists have calculated that rural commodity producers should spend 1.2 trillion rubles for fuel, lubricants and mineral fertilizer alone prior to the sowing. This leaves only 100 billion for everything else. However, 24 percent of the tractors, 27 percent of the plows and 28 percent of the sowing machines have still not been repaired. Moreover, in the words of V. Shcherbak, the Russian Federation's first deputy minister for agriculture and food, even if all the equipment manages to be put into the drive, the present pool of machinery will not cope with the sowing. This means new equipment is required. It is standing ready in factory yards. You see, however, one must pay for it. No one gives the peasant anything on credit, you know. They only permit themselves to take from him and not pay for the products. For example, the state still owes the rural commodity producers 600 billion rubles for the grain delivered in the fall. Let us point out that no one is planning to adjust the fall calculation for inflation. Meanwhile, prices grew threefold-fourfold during this time. Incidentally, credits are being issued to the village at 213 percent interest according to that same government decree. Thus, who is subsidizing whom: the state -- the village, or the village -- the state? We call your attention to the fact that March is already ending and a considerable portion of the allocated sums has not gotten to the village. Last week, a meeting of the Russian Federation Government's Commission for Operational Matters was held under the chairmanship of O. Soskovets, first deputy of the government, during which urgent measures to prepare for and carry out the spring sowing were discussed. During it, Vice-Premier A. Zaveryukh said right out that a portion of the monetary and preferential credits allocated to the village are walking about Moscow, replenishing the super-incomes of commercial banks and that the Russian Federation's Ministry of Finance "cannot" catch anyone. Incidentally, the presentations of the directors of the ministries, departments and enterprises and of the bankers cited quite a few cases of irresponsibility and clear procrastination. However, none of them mentioned the specific names of guilty persons or hinted at where they could be found. O. Soskovets, who presided, repeatedly interrupted the speakers with a demand to personify the criticism; however, everyone with surprising stubbornness recouped themselves using nameless "cases." When closing the meeting, O. Soskovets completely rejected the prepared draft of the decree and demanded that it be completely done over again within two days, clearly formulating an effective plan of action for all ministries and departments connected with the sowing and that control over the document's implementation, especially the part on personal responsibility for allocating the credits as designated and on time, be toughened.
