Nemec said the U.S. authorities would have to give their consent to move the radio station from Munich to Prague and to fund it. Nothing is changed by the fact that on April 15 the RFE's Board of Directors and the Liberty radio station recommended the station to be moved to Prague, Nemec said. He added that RFE will be moved to Prague only after Congress's decision has been made and providing it is funded exclusively from the U.S. state budget. "If RFE were financed from several sources and on a commercial basis, the Czech Government could not lease the federal parliament building on a non-commercial basis," Nemec said. At present, the building is financed from the state budget. It costs annually 45 million crowns (about 1.5 million USD). The Czech Government recently decided that if Congress does not approve the RFE's move to Prague by the end of April the parliament building will be leased on a commercial basis. Nemec said the government had postponed decision-making on the building three times, as it wanted to comply with RFE's wishes. The Prague Stock Exchange, the National Museum and several art institutions have shown interest in using the building, Nemec said.
