"Economic and administrative reforms now under way are indispensable in establishing an economic society open to the world. For that purpose, I and the cabinet as a whole will continue to make efforts to solve Japan-U.S trade friction, promote economic deregulation, and slash the trade surplus," Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of Representatives. "Japan has been asked to play a more positive role as the Uruguay Round of trade talks has concluded and the world is shifting to new trade rules," he said at the start of a three-day question-and- answer session at the Diet. Hosokawa was responding to Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who said that Hosokawa's seven-month-old coalition government has completed its mission. Kono criticized Hosokawa for delaying compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to this year, scuttling a "national welfare tax" scheme, failing to reach an accord in framework trade talks with the United States and giving up a recent plan to reshape the cabinet. "As a reason for reshuffling the cabinet, you said you'll establish an economic reform cabinet as political reform is nearly complete...(but) the failure of the cabinet shake-up means discarding the bid to promote economic reform," Kono said. "Japanese society and the Japanese economy are facing historical turning points in every respect...The Hosokawa cabinet has finished its mission," Kono said. Hosokawa rebutted Kono's remark, saying "the historical change of society and the economy need a new political power and the reason for the birth of the coalition government lies there. The Japanese people expect the coalition government to carry out its mission to implement a comprehensive economic reform." Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition government last August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-long grip on power. Asked how to improve strained economic relations with the U.S., Hosokawa reaffirmed Japan's commitment to further opening its markets to U.S. firms even though the summit talks with President Bill Clinton early last month failed and led to the reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade provision that gives the U.S. Government broad powers to impose sanctions. The government "is doing its utmost to draw up voluntary measures within March to further open the country's markets," Hosokawa said. He also reiterated Japan's opposition to setting numerical targets to measure the penetration of imports into the Japanese market, saying "it will be against deregulation to force firms to set numerical targets." The premier also said the sagging economy will be back on recovery during fiscal 1994. On the North Korean nuclear issue, Hosokawa echoed Kono, who said Japan should deal with the matter in cooperation with the U.S. while taking into account the views of South Korea and China. Hosokawa also expressed his intention to continue efforts to resume the stalled negotiations with Pyongyang aimed at establishing diplomatic ties. The negotiations hit deadlock in November 1992, when North Korea walked out over a dispute on the alleged abduction of a Japanese woman by Pyongyang. On political realignment, Hosokawa reiterated his initial stand that political parties would be absorbed into a moderate multiparty system after several elections, thus denying recent speculation that he is tilting heavily in favor of a two-party system advocated by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito.
