In this connection RF Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev gave an interview to MN diplomatic analyst Irina Lagunina on the fate of the Partnership, Russia and NATO. "We have nothing against the framework document as such, nor did we have anything against it from the very beginning. It is a different matter that it is not quite sufficient. Our public opinion, perhaps thanks to the mass media, tends to believe that the Partnership means very serious relations for many years. In fact, however, this three-page framework document is not only not a wedding, but not even an invitation to the movies. "When a crisis broke out around Gorazde, man in the Duma started saying: we are signing a treaty on the Partnership, but NATO has not even consulted us over air strikes. But in fact the framework document does not even make provision for such consultations. "Thinking of how to combine the expectations generated by the very words Partnership for Peace with the real content of the program, we have come to the conclusion that there is a need to speak about closer cooperation with NATO. Moreover, as we see it, it is Moscow that must draw up a more in-depth program of relations -- in the given case it comes forward as the "customer" and singles out the lines which it considers to be the most interesting and useful for itself. "Now such a document has for the most part been created. However, it still calls for discussion in NATO and with the other states-partners in order to build relations on the basis of reciprocity. As regards the main lines of cooperation in which Russia is interested, they are as follows: "First, cooperation between military departments, commands and headquarters on account at the fact that these are relations between the two mightiest war machines with global potential and global responsibility. "Second, the problems of conversion. Moscow has a stake in getting both additional investments and technological exchange in the framework of partner relations with NATO. The current Partnership for Peace program, however, envisages at best seminars on conversion. "Third, expanded cooperation in fields such as the maintenance of peace, the conduct of joint maneuvers and exercises. And, lastly, political consultations and, possibly, mutual coordination of positions." MN Commentary It should be presumed that it is these four points that form the basis of the protocol drafted by Moscow. The most heated debates will undoubtedly be triggered by the last point, as political consultations are not envisaged in the Partnership for Peace program. However, the latest Bosnian crisis has shown that they are indispensable, especially if NATO intends to continue engaging in peace-keeping activities. All the signs point that the draft protocol has been compiled jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. On the whole it runs counter to the sentiments of some Russian circles which still believe that after the disbandment of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, NATO must also dissolve itself, and therefore it is not worth strengthening this organization through a partnership with Russia. The document is rather consistent with the directly opposite view: there are still many threats in the world, and if there is a military structure possessing sufficient organization and might for combatting them, there is a need to find a role for this structure. Contrary to expectations and rumors, Kozyrev makes no mention of Russia's "special responsibility" in the CIS. Moscow has evidently decided not to introduce into the protocol additional points of dispute. All the more so since many member-states of the CIS have already signed the Partnership. A realistic analysis has shown that the North Atlantic Alliance is not yet ready psychologically, organizationally or physically to spread its military-political influence to the space of the former Soviet Union even if the CIS states wished this. The additional protocol will be presented to NATO for consideration by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on May 24 during his visit to Brussels. The problem for Moscow that, have delayed the signing of the framework document, Russia now simply cannot confine itself to this step alone, and the signing of any other agreement is not envisaged in the framework of the Partnership. Judging by the results of the meetings in Geneva between Andrei Kozyrev and Warren Christopher, the United States understands this problem. This does not mean, however, that any easy time will be in store for the Russian protocol in Brussels.
