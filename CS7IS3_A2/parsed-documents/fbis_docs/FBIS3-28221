Hyundai Motor Co. has led the industry, followed by Kia and Daewoo in that order since 1990, but Daewoo caught up with Kia in the second half of last year. And Daewoo is expected to keep the second place firmly this year, the sources said. Kia and Daewoo have been neck and neck in domestic car sales last year, but Daewoo's sales went over Kia's by 3,000 cars in November and December. The gap further widened by more than 8,000 units in January with Daewoo selling 23,735 cars and Kia shipping out 15,042. In sales of all kinds of automobiles at home, Daewoo sold 27,909 units in January and Kia sold 25,062. Kia entered the car market in 1987, selling its Pride model, and gained the second rank in 1990, with sales of 140,400 cars, relegating Daewoo to third place. Kia has maintained a 25 percent share in the domestic car market, but its ratio fell to 19 percent recently. But a Kia official claimed Kia will recover car sales at home in March, when a modified model of Pride is scheduled to be on sale.
