These achievements include the following: development of 160-element and 60-element long-wavelength linear-array photoconductive HgCdTe IR detectors, development of a 128-element InSb CID [charge-injection device] linear focal plane array (FPA), research on 60-element high-power throttling cooler technology, and research on 60-element and 32-element microdewars. The two HgCdTe IR detectors meet late-80s international standards (main performance indicators), while the InSb CID FPA is at the domestic state-of-the-art. The 60-element high-power throttling cooler technology study is on a par with advanced foreign standards and includes the first domestic use of an Ar-N[.sub]2[/] gas mixture in a cryocooler. Finally, all technical indicators for the all-metallic-structure 60-element and 32-element microdewars meet or exceed contract requirements; the 32-element model is designed to be used interchangeably with the igF5.2 self-regulating throttling cryocooler.
