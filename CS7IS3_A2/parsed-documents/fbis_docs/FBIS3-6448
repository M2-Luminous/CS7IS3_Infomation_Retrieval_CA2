The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] adopted the report at a meeting of the panel on 16 March. The panel is a private panel for the chief of the MITI Industry Policy Bureau. The report, pointing to the drastically growing demand for visual information in the individual entertainment and office work sectors, estimates the visual information market will grow from 15 trillion yen in 1992 to 71 trillion in 2015. The report points out that for the market to expand in the future, it is important to deregulate and upgrade the current information and communications infrastructures and to establish an intellectual property rights system to protect copyrights. Visual information uses computers to transmit images and sounds to the human visual and auditory senses. For this reason, the report predicts that visual information will make it easy to get information, and the demand for visual information will grow drastically, especially in the exchange of information between individuals and enterprises. The report analyzes that the demand for information in the medical, education, and distribution sectors will grow. The report estimates the visual information market will grow from 15 trillion yen (3.2 percent of the GNP) in 1992 to 25 trillion yen (4.2 percent of GNP) in 2000, and to 71 trillion yen (8.3 percent of GNP) in 2015. The report points out that for the visual information industry to develop in the future, it is necessary to upgrade the current infrastructure, create an information and communications network, establish a center where visual information is stored and utilized, and establish a visual information industry complex where related industries are concentrated. The report advocates the need to provide financial assistance to entrepreneurs eager to participate in the visual information industry.
