According to the Labor Affairs Ministry, 812 firms or 14.8 percent of the total 5,483 companies employing more than 100 workers have concluded labor-management wage negotiations as of Tuesday. The percentage represented an increase of 3.2 percentage points over the same period of last year. A Ministry official said the faster settlement was attributable to the fact that a central labor-management wage agreement came earlier than last year, and many industries had affirmatively accepted the wage agreement. The wage hikes agreed on thus far averaged at 5.3 percent, which compares with the average 5.2 percent of last year. By area, service firms topped the list with 24.1 percent followed by electricity, gas and water works (22.7 percent), transportation, warehouse and communications (20.5 percent), manufacturing (12.1 percent), construction (10.9 percent) and financing and insurance (5.1 percent).
