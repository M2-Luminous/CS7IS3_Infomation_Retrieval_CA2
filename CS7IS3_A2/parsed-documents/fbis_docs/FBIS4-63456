"We have agreed to hold joint consultations in case of any unforeseen developments," Zlenko told reporters on Saturday [21 May] commenting on a telephone conversation he had had with Kozyrev the same day. Zlenko said the conversation had made it clear that "Russia will refrain from any interference in the current situation in Crimea." He expressed the hope that Ukraine and Russia "will manage to set in motion a negotiation mechanism that would help find a solution to the problem." Ukraine will not use force in Crimea "unless the other side provokes it," he said. Some sources told INTERFAX-Ukraine that, following the last telephone conversation between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, a Ukrainian government delegation, led by acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, was leaving for Moscow on Monday to discuss the division of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, a friendship and cooperation treaty between the two countries and the Crimean problem. On Friday, Zlenko said in a letter to Kozyrev that the Crimean legislature's decision to restore the Crimean Constitution approved on 6 May 1992, jeopardized political stability in Ukraine and might cause tension between Ukraine and Russia. He said that, in case of further trouble in Crimea, Ukraine might take all measures allowed by its constitution and legislation to preserve its territorial integrity. Kozyrev, in a reply to Zlenko, said the possibility of Russian-Ukrainian tension over Crimea was bound to cause concern. But it is important "to respect the sovereign will of peoples, show restraint and rule out the use of force. All problems arising between Ukraine and the sovereign Republic of Crimea -- forming part of Ukraine -- must be settled solely by political means," the Russian minister said. "The situation in Crimea once again proves the need to solve the problems of the Black Sea Fleet as soon as possible, on the basis of the agreements between the presidents of the two countries. Russia is ready for this," Kozyrev said
