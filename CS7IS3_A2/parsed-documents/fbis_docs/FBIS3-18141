We understood that immediately and we captured it with the trap of a free-market alignment [polo liberista]," he said. He then made a direct appeal to voters: Beware, within the freedom alignment [the alliance with Berlusconi], there is only one free-market group: The League. Bossi made his forecast: In a month's time, the League will have 120-150 members of parliament. The first bill we will present will be the expropriation of the assets that parties gained during Bribe City.
