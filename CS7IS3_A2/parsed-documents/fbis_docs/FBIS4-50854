The editorial affirms the statement issued on 17 May by Wang Daohan, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and appeals to both sides to discard prejudices over some side issues and to decide on the date for the second Ku-Wang meeting as soon as possible to overcome the stalemate between the two sides arising from the "Qiandao Lake Incident." The editorial says: ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan on 17 May issued a statement on the "Qiandao Lake Incident," which pointed out that the two sides should put national interests first, and earnestly draw a lesson by viewing the case and issues cropping up in the process of handling the case rationally, calmly, and objectively. As Wang Daohan suggested, in the wake of the incident, the ARATS and the Strait Exchange Foundation should especially step up contacts and increase dialogue between top-level officials so as to eliminate misunderstandings. The editorial deems this as the mildest and most reasonable statement issued by the mainland since the occurrence of the incident. The editorial clearly points out: Regardless of the complexity of the case, the "Qiandao Lake Incident" is, after all, an incident related to public order. It will be a grave mistake to use this case to negate the mainland's existing social mores or even the entire Chinese nation's blood relationships. The editorial says: It is definitely impossible to dismiss overnight the more than four-decade-long separation, confrontation, and hostility between the two sides. However, at the least, we should not let this misunderstanding and alienation continue and should actively seek ways for gradual and reasonable solutions. For this reason, we place high hopes on the second Ku-Wang meeting. We deeply believe that the cross-strait relationship is a historical question and naturally can be solved through a tortuous course. The "Qiandao Lake Incident" has further complicated this course. Now is the important time for us to straighten out facts and analyze twists and turns to increase common understanding. It is hoped that the authorities of both sides can make good use of the time.
