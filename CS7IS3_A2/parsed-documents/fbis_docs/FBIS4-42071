One of the most powerful men in the GDR died of cancer today at age 81 in his Chilean exile, Santiago de Chile. The news of the death of the man who had been ill for a long time has "come as no great surprise," government spokesman Dieter Vogel said in an initial statement. Honecker failed in his political objectives. His policy meant suffering for innumerable people in Germany. However, respect for the dead makes it appropriate "to say but little" at this particular moment about his role in the German postwar period.
