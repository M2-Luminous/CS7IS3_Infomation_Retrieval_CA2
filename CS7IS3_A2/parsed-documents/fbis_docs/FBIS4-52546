FBIS4-52546 "dreas091_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 North Korea Yi In-mo Writes to Daughter of Kim Pyong-chu Yi In-mo Writes to Daughter of Kim Pyong-chu SK1105004194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1511 GMT 10 May 94 SK1105004194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Ex-war correspondent of the Korean People's Army Yi In-mo who was embraced in the bosom of the DPRK on March 19, 1993, sent a letter of sympathy today to Kim Chi-hyon, the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, his old comrade-in-arms, who is suffering from a serious illness in South Korea. Kim Pyong-chu was an old comrade-in-arms of Yi In-mo, who together with Yi fought for the reunification of the country during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950-July 1953) and Kim and his daughter looked after Yi In-mo with utmost care in South Korea. In the letter Yi said that, reading an article by Yim Su-kyong, "the flower of reunification", carried by NODONG SINMUN, he learned that Kim Chi-hyon who is in the hospital attached to the Hanyang University for her serious illness was going to leave the hospital, worried about the doctor's fee and her younger brothers, though her illness is severe. Yi said he still remembers the days when Kim Chi-hyon washed his face and put spoonfuls of thin rice gruel into his mouth for two months, temporarily leaving her work. "My diseases over which you were so much concerned have been completely cured like a miracle in Pyongyang and I am even making a tour in health," Yi said, and continued: "It is the dear leader General Kim Chong-il who called me the incarnation of faith and will, me who was called by prisoner number instead of my name in prisons of South Korea, took all measures so that I could be embraced in the bosom of the DPRK, took the utmost measures for medical treatment when I returned to Pyongyang and is showing deep loving care for me." Noting that the bright rays of the great love of dear general Kim Chong-il have reached Kim Chi-hyon, Yi In-mo stressed: "The DPRK is now making every possible effort to bring your brothers and you who are suffering from diseases in poverty, treated coldly for the mere reason that your father was an unconverted long-term prisoner who was taken prisoner while active as a guerrilla, and to give you medical treatment and look after you". Yi said they should fight it out with confidence, earnestly appealing to the South Korean Red Cross and other human rights organisations to help them come to the North and get medical care.
