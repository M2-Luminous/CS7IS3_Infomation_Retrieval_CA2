The introduction, at the last moment, of a set of amendments by the parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], after the draft bill had been worked on for a long time by the specialized commission of the Chamber of Deputies, testifies to an attempt to either delay the legislation process or (if the amendments would be accepted by the plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies) to the desire to totally and effectively acquire these two public services -- radio and television. Not only because of certain provisions that limit the independence of the radio and television and their staff but also through procedures proposed for the appointment of the Consultative Council, the Management Boards and their chairmen (by the government and the presidency respectively), the PDSR amendments violate the principles stipulated by any democratic audio-visual law, including the recommendations made to our country by the Council of Europe. Bucharest, 2 February 1994
