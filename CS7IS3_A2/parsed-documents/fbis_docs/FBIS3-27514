The Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] today passed the first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will also submit the second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for discussion. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that last December, before the Chinese and the British sides had reached any agreement on the district board election arrangements, the British side submitted the first-phase draft of legislation to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus directly causing the termination of the talks between China and Britain. Now, in disregard of repeated dissuasion by China, and the aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong for a settlement of the question concerning the 1994-1995 election arrangements through negotiations, the British side has had the first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election arrangements passed by the Hong Kong Legco and also decided to submit the second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for discussion. The spokesman said: "This fully shows that the British side does not have sincerity to solve the question through cooperation with the Chinese side, and is bent on moving further on this erroneous path. "The door of negotiation has been closed by the British side," he said. "The responsibility for the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely with the British side," he said. He noted that the Chinese side reiterates that without an agreement between China and Britain, the framework of the three-tiered political system established through British Hong Kong authorities legislation cannot last beyond June 30, 1997. The British side today published a white paper to disclose the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks. An understanding not to disclose to the public the contents of the negotiations was reached between China and Britain before the talks began last year, he said. Today's act by Britain "is against the understanding," he said. "The Chinese side cannot but make due reactions," he added. Asked about Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, in a recent TV interview in Australia, expressing strong support for the political package of Chris Patten, the spokesman said that what was now at issue between China and Britain on Hong Kong "is not whether Hong Kong should have democracy, but whether commitment is to be honored." He said that there were a series of agreements and understandings between the two countries on the evolution of Hong Kong's political system. "But the British side is now trying to repudiate them and have its own way. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side," he said. "In the more than one hundred years during the British rule, there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong," he said. "It is with ulterior motives that Britain pushes a Chris Patten package in Hong Kong before it leaves. It will be futile to defend the package. "The maintenance of Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity is not only in the interests of China and Britain, but also of those countries that have economic interests in Hong Kong," he said. "The question of Hong Kong is a matter between China and Britain before June 30, 1997, and from July 1, 1997, it will be purely an internal affair of China," he said. "It is inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on the political affairs of Hong Kong."
