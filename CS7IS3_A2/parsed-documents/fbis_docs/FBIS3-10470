This would be just a routine item on the political agenda if today's Brazil did not have on one side an administration that is disoriented within the Congress, with no dependable support from the parties and vulnerable to surprises with every vote; and, on the other, a candidate for president--Luis Inacio Lula da Silva--who dominates the opinion polls but does not control his own party. Furthermore, as backdrop we have the history of a deposed president who restricted the concept of governability to his ability to simply get elected. The concern for governability is in proportion to the difficulty the parties are having in laying the foundations for election-year alliances. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], for example, have made no progress in their talks because of internal indecisiveness. Orestes Quercia announced his candidacy, as he puts it, precisely to prevent such an alliance from prospering. That antipathy is reciprocated within the PSDB--which, incidentally, was born out of opposition to Quercia by PMDB dissidents. Quercia, in turn, is having trouble reaching an agreement with Sao Paulo Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho, whose favorite candidate is himself, and whose second choice would be Deputy Antonio Britto. Since Quercia announced, Fleury seems more inclined to finish out his term as governor. Whether he stays or goes, he is unwilling to lift a finger to help Quercia. Even so, Fleury finds it hard to take a more aggressive position toward Quercia. With the governorship of Sao Paulo in hand, he still has been unable to build his own following or exercise strong leadership either within or outside the party. No matter how much improved the conditions may be for Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to remain as finance minister until the Itamar administration leaves office, the PSDB still considers him its favorite candidate. If Fernando Henrique is not nominated, the party has three other names: Mario Covas, Tasso Jereissati, and Ciro Gomes. Covas does not want to run for president; he would rather be governor of Sao Paulo. He is the strongest of all the candidates who have showed up at the gate of Bandeirantes Palace so far. Tasso is the only name in the group of Ceara tucanos who could defeat Juraci Magalhaes, the PMDB's extremely popular candidate for governor of that state. As for Ciro Gomes, he has the reputation of being good with a megaphone, but not very skilled in the whispering needed to forge alliances. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] is taking the opposite approach. Because it has no names, it is starting by developing a platform, while leaving plenty of room for coalitions--Maluf and Maluf, and Brizola and Brizola. Either of these men is stronger individually than their parties or any alliances the parties could put together. From now on, we will see names emerge that although they may not establish themselves as candidates for the presidency, could at least be good campaign workers. One of these is banker and former Minister of Industry and Commerce Senator Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, who is working on becoming the candidate of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] with the support of the PP [Progressive Party]. After a lengthy and intense barrage of criticisms from Governor Roberto Requiao, Andrade Vieira wondered how his image was faring in his home state of Parana. He commissioned a poll and found that of nine national political figures, he was the one least rejected by respondents; he even did better than Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He popped a few champagne corks and started organizing his campaign. Although a millionaire, Andrade Vieira would not need to work too hard to come off as a day laborer in terms of accent or the way he cooks and debones a pacu (a fish from the Pantanal), or in the bravado with which he opens a beer bottle with a table knife. But he has to work harder when it comes time to discuss Brazil's problems. In his head is an empirical vision of Brazil's problems--"I have had it up to here with the experts," he says, passing his right hand across his neck like a razor blade--and with simplistic models of government. He thinks he can solve everything with partnerships or sectoral chambers. After all, he was one of the masterminds of the sectoral chambers that, among other things, were successful early in the Itamar administration in getting the auto industry growing again. His principal credential will become a slogan. It is The man who gets things done, a reference to a TV commercial his bank produced to honor small entrepreneurs. In this field, he is very practical. He can tell us right away how he would govern. He would reduce the government to 10 or 15 ministries, would fire through the press those ministers who dissent with his administration, would close a whole bunch of state enterprises (except for two private banks that he does not identify), would not allow his few cabinet ministers to waste so much time receiving visiting deputies who come "begging" as he puts it, and would call on businessmen to get together and figure out how Brazil should grow. But if he cannot get that far, Andrade Vieira would accept an invitation to serve as finance minister.
