But studies have established that the percentage of immune populace in a region is better reflected by the activity of natural foci than by morbidity indices. Also important is the immune structure of the population, which indicates the degree of risk of infection among individual groups, the data for which cannot be obtained in morbidity analysis, because not all infected individuals have clinically expressed symptoms. Owing to that, the researchers here set out to study immune structure in order to screen individuals at elevated risk in the most active natural foci. RIA was used to study a total of 9,176 serum samples from individuals over the age of 15. The data obtained was analyzed for sex, age, and occupation. The percentage of individuals immune to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome was greater among men than among women, but the difference was smaller than the difference between men and women diagnosed with the illness. Among the children, they found, there were virtually no individuals with immunity. Up to 40 years of age, the percentage of immune individuals grows slowly, to 11.8 percent from 9.6. Only after 40 does it rise appreciably, to 16.2 percent. Individuals at higher risk are foresters, tractor operators, oil workers and prospectors, livestock breeders, drivers, and builders.
