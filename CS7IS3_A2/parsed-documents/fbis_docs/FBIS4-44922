A number of Israeli institutions and Palestinian businessmen have announced the founding of holding companies to help rebuild the occupied motherland, even before agreement was reached in Washington last September on the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. There have been recurring press reports of "huge" projects being planned to expend "billions of dollars" in the West Bank and the Strip. A great many of those plans, however, did not materialize and may never see the light of day. Information available so far would indicate that the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation (PDIC), incorporated in Amman at the end of last month, has the financial, managerial, and technical clout to do the difficult job ahead. It would also seem that it has adopted a more tangible strategy to deal with current conditions and possible future developments. AL-HAYAH had the following interview in Amman with Raja'i al-Masri, the company's official spokesman. [Bishtawi] Now that the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation has been incorporated in Amman and its 16-member Board of Directors elected, what remains to be done before operations can begin in occupied Palestine? [Al-Masri] The next step is to appoint a managing director for the company after his job description is stated. The company's administrative structure has already been defined and a number of individuals have already been named to certain positions. Legal counsel has already taken steps to establish the company's regional headquarters in Amman as discussions continue with regard to its main offices in Palestine. The final location of the latter is yet to be determined, but they will be initially located in the West Bank, in or close to Jerusalem. Additional offices will be opened in Gaza City. [Bishtawi] What are the broad investment strategies of Palestine Development and Investment Corporation? [Al-Masri] Conceptually, the company's activities will primarily be a function of its nature as a funding company in the sense that it will be a financing vehicle, even though it may play a limited role in the transfer of technology. I am not referring to pure or basic sciences; rather, to the transfer of the technology of various types of systems. The company will engage in constant contacts in an endeavor to foster world-wide financing relations with private and other institutions such as the European Community and the International Finance Agency. The latter is a World Bank agency concerned with private sector investments. Meanwhile, we continue to seek and identify others with which we can open dialogue and cooperate and from whose experiences we can benefit. The company, after completing feasibility studies for the projects it targets for investment, plans to invest initially through companies operating in the West Bank and Gaza, including al-Ruwwad Palestinian company, which is yet to be founded even though it has been registered in Ramallah and several founders culled from among West Bank businessmen. The parent company (Palestine Development and Investment) will own 49 percent of al-Ruwwad's estimated capital of $50 million. This is the maximum investment ratio allowed under current laws in the occupied territories. It is currently planned that local Palestinian founders put up 25 percent of capital and offer the remaining 26 percent to public subscription in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The company's total investments in the interior could be in the vicinity of $200 million. [Bishtawi] There are expectations that the company may begin operations in occupied Palestine within six months. What type of project could the company undertake or invest in? [Al-Masri] There are a number of essential projects that are important both strategically and as investments. Preliminary studies have already been made on one such project that focuses primarily on the construction industry. It will be implemented in several stages. Certain projects involve the construction of fully integrated housing complexes outside the cities in order to help alleviate stifling population densities. Each complex would comprise 1,000 housing units. There is a political dimension to this that must be dealt with first, because it has to do with the land privatization issue. It is common knowledge that land ownership is in dispute, and the subject of Palestinian land is therefore extremely sensitive and complex. Other plans call for the construction of three- and four-star hotels in a number of Palestinian cities. A number of industrial and productive projects aim at creating employment opportunities, [Bishtawi] How will the company raise the capital to finance all the aforementioned projects, which may cost $1 billion? [Al-Masri] The company seeks to raise $200 million through a private subscription. About half of that amount has already been pledged. I don't foresee a problem in raising the entire amount since the deadline for the private subscription has been extended for three more months ending this coming 30 June. Since the subscription is private, the minimum investment amount has been set at $100,000 and the maximum at $1 million--the latter being 1 percent of capitalization. That would guarantee that no one party could gain control of the company and would ensure the widest possible investor base by giving everyone an opportunity to subscribe. [Bishtawi] Why didn't the company hold a public subscription as the Lebanese company Solidaire did? There are a large number of Palestinian investors who are able and willing to finance this vital project. [Al-Masri] I believe it is because the maximum investment amount was set at $1 million. There is a considerable number of Arab and Palestinian investors abroad who are able to subscribe such an amount. Another reason is that the intention was to raise needed capital as rapidly as possible in order to coincide with the opening of the West Bank and Gaza to investments. Furthermore, the legal structure of the parent company and its possible subsidiaries provides for the future broadening of the subscription base in order to enable the largest possible number of Arabs and Palestinians to contribute to the development of Palestinian lands. [Bishtawi] Does the strategy of establishing a holding company to engage in private sector investments mean that the political leadership has given its support or has acquiesced to the fact that the Palestinian economy will be open, private, and free-market-driven rather than be government directed or controlled? [Al-Masri] There is considerable dependence on the private sector in the effort towards development and social and economic revival in Palestinian lands. The private sector accounts for 85 percent of Palestinian economic activity, according to World Bank figures based on the finest field studies. The public sector played no major role during the 26 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, during which the private sector had to contend with extremely difficult conditions and cope with impossible regulations, oppressive martial law, and other factors that helped instill in it the spirit of individual enterprise, initiative, and awareness. The free-market concept is therefore taking hold as a tradition. We must build upon something positive and that economic convention is positive without a doubt. [Bishtawi] Am I to understand then that there has been stated or unstated prior agreement with the Palestinian political leadership to abstain from government controls and refrain from the partial or full nationalization of future projects and institutions in Palestinian lands? [Al-Masri] It is not my place to verbalize the viewpoint of the political leadership. However, the political leadership has been consulted and it gave its blessing. The company's orientation has been stated in its articles of incorporation and it varies considerably from those of many other Arab companies founded in the past 20 or 30 years. The articles emphasize that the company will engage in medium- to long-term investments and that its stock will not be traded during the first few months or even the first few years. The articles also call for adding capital gradually over four years. The objective is not quick profit as proved by the fact that it was not made easy to trade the company stock early on. It can be said, generally speaking, that some company activities will fall under the development plans instituted by the political leadership, including those plans contained in studies prepared by concerned organizations such as the World Bank and others. It should not be forgotten that sound investments mean projects that are feasible and profitable. [Bishtawi] The plan to establish the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation is based on two basic assumptions. The first is that peace is inevitable and that it will at least allow for industrial and commercial activity. The second is that relations between Jordan and Palestine are predetermined and known? [Al-Masri] It goes without saying that the huge investment and economic capabilities of all Arabs and Palestinians outside Palestine should be enlisted to seize all opportunities for capital to contribute, with a reasonable degree of efficacy and freedom, in correcting the grave imbalances, deviations, and distortions that afflict the economic structure of Palestinian lands as a result of the Israeli occupation. Despite the complexity and fluctuations of political conditions, and despite the diversity and disparity of the many visions for the future, this recruitment of capital would lay the ground work for social and economic development in order to create jobs, raise incomes, improve expertise, and develop the skills of the overwhelming majority of our working people in the Palestinian lands. That goes hand in hand with realizing for investors worthwhile returns on capital. Success in that endeavor is supposed to anchor the people to the Palestinian lands. Furthermore, it is immensely important for the Palestinian economy to refrain from close ties with and almost total subservience to the Israeli economy. Opportunities should be created to facilitate the restoration of wider economic exchange and the launching of joint ventures between Palestinian lands and the sister Arab states. [Bishtawi] Were you asked by the Jordanian Government to defer the incorporation of the company, for instance until the relationship between Jordan and the Palestinian entity takes its final shape or until a propensity emerges for certain projects and not others? [Al-Masri] The Jordanian Government has not intervened in the slightest at any stage of founding the company. At the inaugural celebration held at the Amman Chamber of Industry and addressed by PLO representative Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), Jordan announced in the person of Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information, that it would extend all possible assistance to guarantee company success and enable it to realize its objectives. It was clear by his statement that Jordan would not interfere with the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation. We must at this point emphasize the unity of the two peoples and the similitude of their interests. [Bishtawi] Even though the situation has eased somewhat, there remains a great deal of ambiguity, for instance about the nature of the administrative institutions with which the Palestine Development and Investment Corporation and similar establishments would deal in the West Bank and Gaza? [Al-Masri] This is true but the objective at the moment is to attempt to mobilize human and financial resources in order to have manpower and financing ready and waiting when the situation becomes clearer. I can say that the company endeavors to skirt the many deficiencies of the present by wielding the weight it has achieved thanks to the caliber of its investors. It is a given that the vagueness and uncertainty that characterize this period in time would tend to discourage individual private capital from investing in Palestinian lands. That prompted the creation of the company in order to undertake that important wide-scale assemblage of investors from among leading institutions and distinguished senior businessmen, thereby assigning private sector contributions a leading and innovating role. The Palestine Development and Investment Corporation, as it now stands, has the necessary clout that--coupled with efficient management and the adoption of modern advancement systems--would enable it to be doubly effective in achieving targeted objectives within a reasonable time frame. [Bishtawi] Palestine Development and Investments Company is not the first firm founded for the development of Palestine and for undertaking projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Are you coordinating with other companies in order to avoid duplication and competition for the limited number of projects? [Al-Masri] There is no coordination per se. The company will be primarily active in strategic projects. We will not be involved in small projects except to offer support. There are industrial projects undertaken either by individuals or by a small group of businessmen, and these need financial, technical, managerial, and marketing support. It is in those areas that support can be offered, but not for the purpose of control or full or even substantial ownership. The company will therefore specialize primarily in the implementation of strategic and medium-range projects that would be untenable for individual investors. [Bishtawi] In which currencies will the company deal? [Al-Masri] The company's capital is in U.S. dollars but investments will be denominated on the basis of capital invested into local companies in the domestic currency. But there will companies like al-Ruwwad which chose to put its capital (50 million) in U.S. dollars. [Bishtawi] Have you considered, for instance, hedging contracts that would protect the company against sharp fluctuations to which investments in local currencies may be exposed? [Al-Masri] This is something for the future into which we have not yet looked. It will be considered on a case-by-case basis as it comes up. The reason is that in most of the investments being considered, capital will not be recouped for a period of perhaps three to five years before distributions of profits are made. They will therefore be self-stabilizing and hedging would be short termed. [Bishtawi] The premise underlying all this, as we understand it, is that Israel will withdraw from the West Bank and the Strip or you would not have considered the establishment of this company; and that there will be stability, otherwise there will be no development since it is a function of stability. Are these and other developments a consideration in the company's operating strategies, or would you be able to halt operations at any stage that suffers a specific setback and go back to the planning board? [Al-Masri] The laws under which the company was incorporated as well as its articles of incorporation give it enough flexibility. I reiterate that political developments are beyond our control, but indications of a peaceful solution do exist. [Bishtawi] As an international expert in economic and financial affairs, would you advise the Arab or Palestinian venture capitalist in the diaspora to invest in a company like Palestine Development and Investment Corporation? [Al-Masri] Palestinians primarily, and Arabs to a lesser degree, are invited at this time to assume the long-delayed role that is incumbent upon them to play. We all agree that we are currently passing through a period of uncertainty. The path is not clearly marked, and the difficulties are numerous. But it is this type of situation that generates deeper commitment and a more urgent call for involvement. Our people in the lands of Palestine have the ability and determination to dust off backwardness and bring about an ever-increasing development that is sustainable through our own potential and abilities once occupation ends and artificial legislative and legal restrictions are lifted, and heavy-handed political domination is removed. Perhaps our greatest asset, without giving in to narrow chauvinism, is the human resources in Palestinian lands, be they resolute businessmen or stone-throwing children, as borne out by recent World Bank studies. All this will inevitably generate numerous worthwhile economic and investment opportunities, and it stands to reason that Palestinian and Arab investors should share in their rewards. [Bishtawi] Some international experts expect peace in the Middle East to create conditions that would transform the region into one of the most prosperous areas of the world. How do you see this? [Al-Masri] That is our target and hope. I am a resident of the West who has traveled extensively in Asia over the past three years. I have dealt with the so-called economic tigers (such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea), and I have always felt deeply anguished. We should never give in to negativism, because the world is moving at a tremendous pace, and the gap between us and the developed world is widening rapidly. We have no alternative but to build, but we must have available to us certain markets and a certain degree of integration in order to play an effective role in developing the economy, raise the standard of living, and catch up somewhat with world development. The company, by virtue of its stated purpose, is attempting to play such a role, but this would depend on the political will. The presence of political will, along with awareness and education, is of the essence. All this is a function of people's convictions, customs, and habits, as well as of existing laws and of the need for economic liberalization. There is no other way. [Bishtawi] How do you describe Raja'i al-Masri? [Al-Masri] Raja'i al-Masri is a Palestinian who was born in 1948 in Nablus on the West Bank. He graduated from Wisconsin University in the United States with a degree in electrical engineering. I hold an MBA from a university in France and am a CFA international fellow [as published]. I held positions with the Banque de Paris, an investment bank in Paris, as well as with the Royal Bank of Canada and with Procter and Gamble. I presently live in Montreal, Canada, with my Lebanese wife and three sons. I am fluent in French and English and I know some German.
