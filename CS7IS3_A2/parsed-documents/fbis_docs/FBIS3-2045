Two dissidents, Zhou Guoqiang, an outspoken member of the political reformist Peace Charter group, and Yuan Gongbing, an editor of a banned book, were arrested in the past two days for alleged illegal activities. The arrests come at a time when a U.S. official in Beijing has claimed Chinese leaders may be considering again whether to abolish a law by which thousands of people have been made political prisoners. Dissident sources said police also picked up Qian Yumin, a fellow member of the Peace Charter group, early Wednesday morning and activist lawyer Wang Jiaqi. The detention of Mr. Zhou was confirmed last night by the semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency, which said he was being investigated for his contacts with hostile overseas forces and anti- government activities. Mr. Yuan, a Beijing University law lecturer, was arrested on Wednesday at his home in the city by police after a recent petition to the law committee under the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC). He was alleged to have committed criminal offences, a Chinese source told THE HONGKONG STANDARD. Analysts believe the detentions are related to the opening of the legislature, which in the past has been marked by a tightening of security. The news agency said Mr. Zhou had planned to distribute "cultural T-shirts" with slogans airing grievances at next Thursday's opening of congress. In 1992, Mr. Yuan sued the government for banning his book, The Tide of History. The court refused to accept the case. The arrests coincided with the current visit by United States Assistant Secretary for Human Rights John Shattuck to Beijing. [passage omitted cites THE NEW YORK TIMES]
