The government, Camacho Solis said, accepted the agenda proposed by the rebels that consists of seven points: economic demands, social demands, political demands, democratic progress, an end to the hostilities, an end to violent confrontations, and the establishment of guarantees for the two parties. At a news conference in the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, about 750 km southeast of the Mexican capital, Camacho Solis pointed out that the conditions for peace are present, but he added that it is not known whether negotiations with the rebels will start soon. The commissioner admitted that the Indians are facing "serious living conditions" besides racism and isolation and promised to open "legal opportunities for the participation" of the armed rebels in society. To end the hostilities, the commissioner proposed "negotiation, agreements, declaration of a definitive end to the hostilities, disarmament with guarantees for the two parties, reconciliation, and return to work and open participation in political life by the rebels." The commissioner said that "only facts will create new conditions and added that they (the rebels) must define their positions and be consistent with them." Camacho Solis said that the nation is headed for political change and added that the 21 August presidential election will be held in peace. "We either settle the problem in Chiapas correctly, promptly, seriously, and honestly, or a conflict bringing only destruction, greater poverty, and isolation will take root," he added. The commissioner pointed out that "there are no middle-of-the-road points here; we either attain peace or Chiapas will not achieve economic modernization and social tranquillity. We need to reach peace through democracy and determination." Although Bishop Samuel Ruiz, official mediator of the conflict between the government and the rebels, announced that Camacho Solis and the EZLN command would meet "very soon," the commissioner said he does not know when this meeting will take place or "if it will take place at all." He added that the peace negotiations should establish an agile mechanism to apply the recently created Amnesty Law for freeing the rest of the hostages and prisoners, reach agreements on the sentences that are applicable to the Indians who participated in other social struggles, and establish ways to apply the pardon. Camacho Solis said that he sent a note to the rebels on the points that were complied with for the release of former Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos, who the insurgents want to exchange for jailed EZLN members. Finally, Camacho Solis asked the media in San Cristobal de las Casas to choose a group of 15 reporters from the most representative media to cover a possible meeting. In the past days Camacho Solis exchanged numerous communiques with the rebels in an attempt to start peace negotiations as soon as possible. The population is awaiting these negotiations "with anxiety," the local media reported. The EZLN rebelled against the government on 1 January in the State of Chiapas and clashed with the armed forces during the first 10 days of the conflict. This produced an official toll of 108 dead and thousands displaced.
