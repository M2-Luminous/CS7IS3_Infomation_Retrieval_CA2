FR941110-0-00275 FR941110-0-00017 E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence The existence of only four populations consisting of approximately 125 individuals of Poa mannii increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance, a disease, or predation could destroy an entire population and a significant percentage of the known individuals of the species. In the steep areas where Poa mannii grows, erosion and landslides due to natural weathering can result in the death of individual plants as well as habitat destruction. This process especially affects the continued existence of species or populations with limited numbers and/or narrow ranges, such as Poa mannii , and can be exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices. Competition by alien plant species is a threat to Poa mannii . Brought to Hawaii as a cultivated herbaceous plant, daisy fleabane has become naturalized in wetter regions of four islands (Wagner et al. 1990). Daisy fleabane has invaded Kalalau, Koaie, and Waialae Valleys, three of the four areas where Poa mannii occurs (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). Lantana, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming shrub that can now be found on all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, disturbed habitats (Wagner et al. 1990). Lantana threatens all known populations of Poa mannii (D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Prickly Florida blackberry, an aggressive alien species in disturbed mesic to wet forests and subalpine grasslands on four islands, is considered a noxious weed by the State of Hawaii (Smith 1985, Wagner et al. 1990). Prickly Florida blackberry threatens the Kalalau and Waialae Valley populations of Poa mannii (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). Fire is considered an immediate threat to the rare plants of the cliff faces and valleys of the Na Pali Coast, where the largest known population of Poa mannii occurs. Under dry conditions, human-set fires would spread rapidly and could destroy these plants, due to the strong prevailing winds and dry fuel load on cliff ledges. Fire could destroy dormant seeds as well as plants, even on steep cliffs (Clarke and Cuddihy 1980). The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in finalizing this rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list Poa mannii as endangered. This species numbers only approximately 125 individuals in four known extant populations. Threats to the continued existence of the species include habitat degradation and/or predation by goats, competition from alien plants, fire, landslides and erosion, and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws that become effective with this listing action. Small population size and limited distribution make the species particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because Poa mannii is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. Critical habitat is not being proposed for Poa mannii for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this final rule. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for Poa mannii . The publication of a map and precise description of critical habitat in the Federal Register , as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline. The listing of this species as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plant and, thus, can make it attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowner have been notified of the location and importance of protecting the habitat of this species, which will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known natural habitat of this species. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely to aid in the conservation of this species.
