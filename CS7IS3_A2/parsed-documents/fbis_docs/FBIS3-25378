A communique issued by the military command says some of the agents have entered Cabinda through the Chimbuande border post in Lower Zaire, while others have crossed the Matadi and Boma border posts toward M'banza Congo. The intention is to cause unrest behind UNITA lines and to link up with units of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] involved in the Bengo offensive. Details of the enemy plans were gathered from an agent captured by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA]. Agent (Ndombasse Garcias de Jesus Vicente) was trained in Cuba and integrated a five-man sabotage team. He said the operation is backed by Zaire's intelligence services in coordination with the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] embassy in Kinshasa. The military command says the agents were behind the recent attacks on fishermen in Quissanga. The Northern Front's General Staff has advised the Zairian Government not to let its territory be used as a springboard for attacks on UNITA as this would internationalize the conflict. FALA says it will not tolerate any provocations, though measures have been taken to prevent any incidents. The communique reiterates UNITA's willingness to establish and strengthen good relations with all its neighbors. Meanwhile, FALA's Eastern Command today denied reports carried by the government-controlled JORNAL DE ANGOLA according to which UNITA was attacking FAPLA positions. The command says the report fits within the framework of communist regimes' strategy of fabricating evidence. The source noted that Luanda wanted to convince the world that UNITA was involved in a general offensive, but when the MPLA-PT regime realized that relief operations depended on security, the Eduardo dos Santos group changed its tune and called for aid from every quarter. The fact is that there has never been any clashes in the region. UNITA has assured the World Food Program and other relief agencies that they can safely distribute aid in areas controlled by the MPLA or in UNITA-administered territory. The source added that independent sources can confirm the situation.
