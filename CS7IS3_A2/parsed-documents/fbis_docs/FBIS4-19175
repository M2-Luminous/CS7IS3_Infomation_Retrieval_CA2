Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn this evening that the two sides agreed that efforts to solve the conflicts in the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia must be resolutely continued. Kohl and Butrus-Ghali assessed the recent UN-sponsored NATO operations against Serb positions in Bosnia as "necessary" and "appropriate." These were in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolution. The two sides spoke in favor of energetically continuing the peace process with the inclusion of the United States and Russia. Kohl underlined Germany's readiness to assume responsibility in the United Nations as a permanent member of the Security Council in the future. Ghali confirmed that the transfer of the UN volunteer program to Bonn is envisaged as the first step. Kohl underlined the German Government's offer to have other UN bodies located in Bonn. Eberhard Brecht, deputy foreign policy spokesman for the Social Democratic Party [SPD], admitted in a statement that Germany is still "not up to the international community's expectations of our country." The Social Democrats share the UN secretary general's view that Germany's commitment to the United Nations still does not match its performance in the various political spheres. The SPD supports the demand made of the German Government by Butrus-Ghali for "a high level of commitment in all the organization's activities," Brecht said.
