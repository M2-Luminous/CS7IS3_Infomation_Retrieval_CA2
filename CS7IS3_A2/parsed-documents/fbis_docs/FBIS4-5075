FBIS4-5075 "dreas067_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 North Korea ROK-U.S. War Games on 4, 5 Apr Denounced ROK-U.S. War Games on 4, 5 Apr Denounced Moves Termed Provocative, Reckless SK0704050594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0444 GMT 7 Apr 94 SK0704050594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on April 4 brought overseas-based E-3 early warning plane, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes, AV-8 VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and KC-135 tanker planes to South Korea for provocative joint air war exercises against the Northern half of Korea, military sources said. Exercises, such as a surprise bombing on ground targets, air attack and support of ground attack, were staged with the skies above Chungju, Tanyang and Pyongchang as operational theatres. They involved hundreds of fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes belonging to the U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce. In another development, the South Korean puppets on April 4 and 5 fired shells and volleys of large-calibre machinegun and automatic rifle bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone in Yonchon and Paju Counties, Kyonggi Province, and Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province. On the 5th of April, formations of helicopter gunships and transport helicopters of the puppet Army staged missile strike and airlifting exercises, making low- and ultralow-altitude flights in the skies above Paju and Yonchon areas. Warplanes mobilized in various air war games against the North which were staged in skies above South Korea in two days totaled more than 700. Very ill-boding are provocative military moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets which are becoming all the more reckless. They must act with discretion, clearly mindful of the seriousness of the tensions created on the Korean peninsula.
