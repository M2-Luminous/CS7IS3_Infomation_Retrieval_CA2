"We would like to have the British with us for industrial reasons -- the manufacture of the wings -- commercial reasons -- a potential British order for 60 aircraft -- and for the sake of the Airbus system's credibility," Gallois stated, "but we could still do it if they do not join us". The FLA project -- for which pre-feasibility studies were begun at the end of 1993 by the four partner countries in the Airbus consortium (France, Germany, Britain, and Spain) as well as by Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium, which are all members of the Euroflag consortium -- recently received funding in France worth 2 billion French francs [Fr], allocated by the military planning legislation for 1995-2000. This military transport aircraft, which should allow the Europeans to remain independent and not have to purchase American equipment -- the Hercules C-130J manufactured by Lockheed -- or Russian aircraft -- the Antonov-77 -- has a market estimated by Aerospatiale at 300 aircraft: 60 to 80 for France, 75 for Germany, 40 to 50 for Italy, 39 for Spain, 33 for Turkey, 10 for Portugal, between 13 and 18 for Belgium, and around 60 for Britain. The British must in fact choose, before the end of the year, the name of the aircraft due to replace half their fleet of aging C-130s. The members of Euroflag, including British Aerospace, naturally support the FLA against the C-130J proposed by Lockheed, which is available at an earlier date. "If they buy 30 C-130Js in the first phase, the industrial effect of keeping a uniform fleet will be so great that they will be persuaded to take the EC-130 for the second phase, especially since they will have enabled Lockheed to restart its production lines," Gallois predicted. In addition, "if Britain does not come to us, it will not be possible to assign the work to British industry. Taxpayers in continental countries would never put up with the idea of financing work being carried out in Britain". In response to accusations of excessively high prices, Gallois said that the manufacturers "were setting themselves the challenge" of offering 300 aircraft at the same price as the C-130J (an estimated Fr300 million).
