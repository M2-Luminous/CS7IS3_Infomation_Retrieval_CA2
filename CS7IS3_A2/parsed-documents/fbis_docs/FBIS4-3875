President N.A. Nazarbayev presided over a grand ceremony at the airport to welcome Li, the first top Chinese leader to visit Kazakhstan. Li has toured three other Central Asian nations, including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. Li's entourage includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council. A written statement by the Chinese premier was released upon Li's arrival at the airport. Li, describing China and Kazakhstan as "joined by the same mountains and rivers along a common border of over 1,700 kilometers," said that the ancient "silk road" was written into the annals of Sino-Kazakhstan friendship and today's Euro-Asia continental bridge closely links the two peoples. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, such ties have gained satisfying expansion, Li noted, saying that President Nazarbayev's visit to China last year "made important contributions for the promotion of friendship between the two peoples." According to Li the two countries have wide prospects for developing bilateral relations and the Chinese Government attaches great importance to the growth of its relations with Kazakhstan. "There is a sincere hope to develop a long-term, stable, and friendly relationship of mutual beneficial cooperation," he added. Li also said he expected his visit will help promote friendship, expand cooperation in all fields and boost bilateral ties to a new high.
