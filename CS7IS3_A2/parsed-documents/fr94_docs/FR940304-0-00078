FR940304-0-00078 FR940304-0-00019 Zanthoxylum hawaiiense typically grows in 'ohi'a-dominated Lowland Dry or Mesic Forests, and Montane Dry Forests, often on aa lava, at elevations between 1,800 and 5,710 ft (550 and 1,740 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Stone et al. 1990). Associated species include Antidesma platyphyllum (hame) on Kauai, Pleomele auwahiensis (hala pepe) on Molokai, Streblus pendulinus (a'ia'i) on Maui, and mamane and naio on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1991x1, 1991x5, 1991x9, 1991x11, HPCC 1990b; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). A threat to Z. hawaiiense on Kauai is competition from alien plant species such as lantana and Melia azedarach (Chinaberry) (HHP 1991x11). On Molokai, competition with alien plant species, grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by feral goats are threats (HHP 1991x5; Lyman Perry, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, in litt., 1993). On Maui, competition with Kikuyu grass, which forms a continuous mat in many areas, and grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by cattle and goats are threats (A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1992; A. Medeiros and Lloyd Loope, Haleakala National Park, in litt., 1993). The major threats to the species on the island of Hawaii are competition from alien plant species such as fountain grass; grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by feral goats and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (CPC 1990, HHP 1991x10, HPCC 1990b). In addition, the species is threatened by stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing individuals. Previous Federal Action Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia peleana, Colubrina oppositifolia, Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii (as C. carlsonii ), Cyanea shipmanii, Hesperocnide sandwicensis, Ischaemum byrone, Nothocestrum breviflorum (as N. breviflorum var. breviflorum ), Portulaca sclerocarpa, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (as Z. hawaiiense var. citriodora ) were considered to be endangered. Cyrtandra giffardii, Silene hawaiiensis (as S. hawaiiensis var. hawaiiensis ), and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (as Z. hawaiiense var. hawaiiense and Z. hawaiiense var. velutinosum ) were considered to be threatened. Clermontia pyrularia, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum (as N. breviflorum var. longipes ), and Tetramolopium arenarium (as T. arenarium var. arenarium, T. arenarium var. confertum, and T. arenarium var. dentatum ) were considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication.
