This is the most important binational project between the two countries. The oil pipeline will increase oil transportation to 120,000 barrels daily, which will represent $500 million a year of Argentine oil exports. Chile hopes to save $25 million through the reduction of oil import costs by buying directly from Argentina. The financing of the oil pipeline involved YPF [Government Oil Deposits], which provided 57.75 percent of the capital, the Bank of Rio with 30 percent, and the Chilean National Petroleum Enterprise (Enap) with 12.25 percent. [passage omitted] Argentine Mining Secretary Alejandro Hales said the oil pipeline was built in 15 months with an investment of $220 million, and that "this is a clear example that borders are geographical divisions that should not separate but unite." The pipeline will carry from 6,000 to 8,000 cubic meters of crude daily in the first stage and eventually will reach 17,000 cubic meters, about 100,000 barrels daily, that will be refined in Chile. YPF President Jose Estenssoro said this "is the largest" project built by the two countries and "an important day" for the two.
