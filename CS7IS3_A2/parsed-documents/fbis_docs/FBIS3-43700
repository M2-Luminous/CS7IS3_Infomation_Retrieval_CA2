"I see no reason for our negotiating teams to continue to sit around tables for a month-and-a-half restating over and over things which we have discussed ad nauseam since July 2, 1993." Mr Buthelezi did not spell out what his idea of opposition politics was, although he briefly referred to mobilising against elections. He was addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly caucus in ulundi in his capacity as chief minister. "I believe it is time for us to move from a reactive to a proactive mode and to develop our own political initiative." He said the IFP and kwaZulu government faced two choices: "either we continue to negotiate with the ANC for another month-and-a-half...or we call their bluff now and we say enough is enough." By opting for the first alternative, Mr Buthelezi said, precious political time would be wasted. By pulling out of talks, the IFP and kwaZulu would gain the time needed to develop "political alternatives and bring to the country a clear message of opposition". The IFP president reiterated his "total commitment" to a negotiated constitutional settlement but said the government and ANC had "our balls in their court (sic)". The IFP and kwaZulu's demands were minimal and it was up to the ANC to indicate whether or not it wanted to discuss them. Mr Buthelezi accused the ANC of negotiating merely to manoeuvre itself into a position from which it could avoid any substantive discussions on the IFP and kwaZulu's amendments to the constitution. "Their major political goal is to ensure that they can drag us along with the process after the date of elections. By doing so, they can reduce the strength and the effect of our opposition politics and ensure that we can not mobilise against elections if we choose to do so."
