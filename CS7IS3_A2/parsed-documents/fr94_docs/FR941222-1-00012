FR941222-1-00012 FR941222-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 676 [Docket No. 941250&hyph;4350; I.D. 112894A] Foreign Fishing; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed 1995 initial specifications of groundfish and associated management measures; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes initial harvest specifications of groundfish and associated management measures in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for the 1995 fishing year. This action is necessary to carry out management objectives contained in the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). DATES: Comments must be received by January 20, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments must be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802&hyph;1668 (Attn: Lori Gravel). The preliminary Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report, dated September 1994, is available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kaja Brix, 907 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672, 676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. This action proposes for the 1995 fishing year: (1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; and (8) seasonal allocations of the halibut PSC limits. A discussion of each of these measures follows. Comments on the proposed 1995 specifications are invited from the public through (see DATES ). After again consulting with the Council, NMFS will publish final specifications for the 1995 fishing year in the Federal Register . 1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and Reserves Under §672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the Federal Register proposed specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These proposed specifications indicate apportionments of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category. The sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons (mt), established for these species. Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under §§611.92(c)(1) and 672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea. TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995 fishing year. The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and ``other species.'' If necessary, these reserve amounts may be set aside for possible apportionment to DAP and/or to JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not apportioned to DAP or JVP may be reapportioned to TALFF. Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned all the reserves to DAP. Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks. The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November. New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish. Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch (POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994 SAFE Report. Substantial changes to the 1995 acceptable biological catches (ABCs), compared to 1994 ABCs, occurred for pollock, Pacific cod, POP, arrowtooth flounder, and shallow-water flatfish. Changes to the 1995 ABCs also occurred for deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, other rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, and Atka mackerel. The 1995 ABCs for rex sole, shortraker/rougheye and northern rockfish remain similar to the 1994 ABCs. The Plan Team recommended an ABC for pollock of 65,360 mt, down from 109,300 mt in 1994. The Plan Team chose a more conservative exploitation strategy for this stock because of recent trends in poor recruitment of GOA pollock and because of ecosystem considerations. The stock biomass for pollock has been declining for a number of years and even with the more conservative exploitation strategy, the biomass is still likely to go below the threshold for sustainable yield. The Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) concurred with the Plan Team's recommended ABC and the Council accepted the SSC's recommendation.
