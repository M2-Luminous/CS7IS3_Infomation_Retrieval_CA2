ANC Senior Legal Representative Penwell Maduna told SAPA an agreement with police had been reached to cordon off the area. The bodies of the nine people killed nearby had already been removed. Internal Stability Unit members aimed their guns at the two buildings until the situation seemed normal while pedestrians and journalists sheltered behind pillars and in doorways. Running battles continued at a nearby taxi rank. About 200 people armed with sticks and wooden planks entered the taxi rank, shouting "ANC, ANC". Almost immediately at least eight armoured SADF [South African Defense Force] personnel carriers pulled up and troops were deployed from the vehicles. A shot was fired and the crowd dispersed only to regroup soon afterwards. A peace monitor intervened to calm the situation. SADF Witwatersrand Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said army units had been called out to assist the police in Johannesburg to restore calm in the city centre. Soldiers were gathering at a Witwatersrand Command rallying point and "were awaiting further orders", Maj Visser said. Maj Visser declined to give details on the number of troops in the area.
