FBIS4-30499 "dreas124_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 Thailand Official Says No `New Armed Group' Operating Official Says No `New Armed Group' Operating BK2806084794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 28 Jun 94 p 6 BK2806084794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The head of the office of southern border administration, Wisut Singkachonworakun, said yesterday there is no new armed group operating in the southern provinces. Mr Wisut's comment was made after a news report from Malaysia that a powerful Malaysian Islamic missionary group, the Al-Arqam movement, was operating in Thailand, and that the group has maintained 313 armed men in Thailand including Bangkok. "We checked with all our intelligence units, especially in the five southern border provinces of Thailand, and there is no report about the Al-Arqam movement existing." said Mr Wisut. He said he has submitted an official report to the Interior Ministry on the issue. "The report is inaccurate. We have thoroughly investigated and tried to find out about the movement of this group. But no report about it exists," he said. According to Mr Wisut, the main problem in southern Thailand now is the economy, especially in the growth triangle area. "We should push the economy to grow in this triangle," he said. However, he admitted that in the past there was a lack of qualified public relations facilities to inform the public of events. One of the main obstacles, he said, is a lack of cooperation between the government officials concerned. The centre has tried to improve things by bringing district officers and police chiefs from all areas to discuss the problem, he said. Future policy on the five southern provinces will include developing intelligence reports, tackling poverty, providing security and dealing with border conflicts between Thailand and Malaysia, he said. Meanwhile, Malaysia's ambassador to Thailand will be summoned to clarify a claim that Bangkok was used as a base for training an armed Muslim suicide squad, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday. Thailand would take the opportunity to make clear its stance on the issue, Mr Surin added. Thai Ambassador to Malaysia Suraphong Posayanon last week put on record in Malaysia that there was no evidence to back a claim by the Islamic Centre in Kuala Lumpur that Al-Arqam was training a suicide squad in Bangkok. The envoy also confirmed Thailand's readiness to cooperate in solving the issue. Al-Arqam is an Islamic group headquartered in Malaysia, with branches in 15 other countries including Thailand. The group promotes religious as well as business activities, including the purchase of agricultural products for farmers. A Thai government source said it made no sense for Bangkok to be the training ground for a suicide squad. The claim emerged after Thailand caught Iranians, suspected of involvement in an attempt to bomb the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, re-entering the country from Malaysia about three weeks ago, the source said.
