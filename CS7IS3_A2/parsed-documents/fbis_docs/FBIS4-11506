One of the highlights is that Venezuelan Petroleum will give 10 percent of its shares to its employees. Other major points include an emphasis on decentralization and private investments. Various sectors support the plan and think President Caldera is on the right track. Time will tell, however, and we have to wait and see how the economic plan proposed by the Caldera cabinet works. [Gonzalez] It is worth mentioning that a large number of people from all sectors--namely, CTV [Confederation of Venezuelan Workers], Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce and Services], and Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]--have gathered here at the Eurobuilding Hotel, as you can see your screen, to discuss and review the entire economic program. As you rightly pointed out, Ligia, the opening to private investment is one of the highlights of this strategy, and, in some way, it has grabbed the attention of all sectors of society.
