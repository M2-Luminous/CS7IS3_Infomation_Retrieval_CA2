This follows from a letter that FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) wrote to the top economic associations. The negotiations on a regulation for dual-use goods in Brussels are now entering their final stage, Rexrodt wrote. The partners do not support the stringent German export control system, he said. Rexrodt announced that Germany's previous additional rules have therefore to be changed. This applies, for example, to goods that are not on a control list and are only checked because of their use in the military sector. Here the reduction of the controls to the few countries that have isolated themselves in the international community has to be considered. Rexrodt wants to examine whether the controls for services and the transfer of sensitive knowledge that are not contained in the Brussels regulation are only to be valid for a hard core of countries and for products to be more precisely defined. As the single market continues, one should be increasingly exacting regarding the maintenance of additional national rules. The German economy called for the harmonization of the export rules for dual-use goods without any national exceptions, so that the competitive disadvantages resulting from the strict German rules are eliminated. There will not be a general change of course on real arms, Rexrodt affirmed. However, the Federal Government will soon adopt measures that will make the authorizing policy clearer and more predictable for international cooperation on the level of enterprises so that faster decisions can be expected.
