While Longuet told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that he hopes Japan will not yield to Washington's stance of force, Hata said Tokyo will neither yield nor respond to talks supposing retaliation, the officials said. Longuet said in a 40-minute meeting that France will be unhappy if major powers like the United States use force against Japan and achieve major results in Japanese markets, they said. Hata told Longuet he has repeatedly urged U.S. officials not to take "unilateral" moves. The U.S. Government reinstated the Super 301 trade provision which gives it broad powers to impose sanctions against countries it judges to have unfair trade practices. Longuet was quoted as saying France is steadily trying to promote exports to Japan and has made progress in certain areas such as pork and helicopter exports. Hata praised French efforts to promote exports to Japan, such as its business-boosting campaign called "Le Japon C'est Possible," and said he is sure steady efforts will promote bilateral economic ties, they said.
