The following is a brief of the news conference: [Unidentified reporter] What do the ROK and U.S. Governments think is the reason North Korea is not allowing nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]? [Han Sung-chu] There are various analyses. First, the restriction posed by the North Korean political and policymaking structure may be the reason. Second, it may be North Korea's negotiation strategy. In this case, it is possible that the situation will dramatically be reversed right before the IAEA Board of Governors meeting to be held on 21 February. The situation, however, would be pessimistic if we are under a fundamentally limited situation [kibonjok hangye sanghwang] (this seems to mean in case North Korea possesses nuclear weapons or feels uneasy for fear of the disclosure of its nuclear development), in which it is impossible to resolve the nuclear inspection issue. [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to refer the issue to the UN Security Council? Does the ROK agree on this? [Han] It is hard to ignore any possibility at present. We will continue dialogue to the last, but will seek an alternate effort [tarun chawonui noryogul moseakhal kosida] if our effort for dialogue ultimately comes up against a wall. We will respect the international agency's decision on the North Korean nuclear issue. [Unidentified reporter] Have you delivered our protest against U.S. media reports on rumors about a crisis on the Korean peninsula? [Han] It is unreasonable to make a protest to the U.S. Government against those reports because they were made by independent U.S. media. However, I will express our concern about the fact that some media reports can make people misunderstand the current situation. [Unidentified reporter] Do the United States and North Korea have any intention to resume their contacts in New York? [Han] The possibility of their exchange of opinion through New York remains open, but not the resumption of contacts. They may use some means of communication. They just think that this is better than nothing in order to improve the situation. The United States will, however, hardly attempt dialogue on its own initiative. [Unidentified reporter] There is the rumor that the U.S. State Department's recent attempt to resume contacts with North Korea in New York has failed because of the objection by the U.S. Department of Defense. Is this true? [Han] As far as the ROK Government knows, it is not true. [Unidentified reporter] Could you confirm, through a series of talks, the confrontation between the hardliners and the moderates inside the U.S. Government? [Han] It is not right to divide all matters into toughness and moderateness. The ROK and U.S. Governments have invariably maintained the position that they will try to solve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, and if this method does not work, they will carry a stick, too. The mobilization of strong measures is being made by the international situation, not by the will of the ROK and U.S. Governments. [Unidentified reporter] How will the situation develop after the referral of the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council? [Han] The effort for dialogue will be continued even after the issue is referred to the UN Security Council, but the reality will make it difficult. Two methods are being considered. One is the gradual increasing of sanctions beginning with light ones, such as the adoption of a resolution urging North Korea to allow inspections and diplomatic sanctions, and the other is applying certain sanctions during a short period. They have not decided yet which one to choose. [Unidentified reporter] Do South and North Korea have any intention to attempt direct dialogue between themselves? [Han] We have insisted on and urged holding South-North dialogue on the nuclear issue. North Korea, however, has not acceded to it. [Unidentified reporter] What will be discussed if North Korean-U.S. dialogue is resumed at North Korea's request? [Han] There are various possibilities. North Korea may demand that the United States lessen [wanhwa] the scope of nuclear inspections by the IAEA or that the United States confirm the inspections are not to be conducted as an obligation under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The U.S. position is, however, that this is what has been agreed between North Korea and the IAEA. North Korea may also demand that the United States remove tension caused by U.S. moves, such as the reinforcement of its combat strength on the Korean peninsula, and guarantee the validity of the U.S.-North Korean agreement reached in New York late last year.
