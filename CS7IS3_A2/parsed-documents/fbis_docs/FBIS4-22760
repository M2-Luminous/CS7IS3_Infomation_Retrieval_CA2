The Skeptics Will Say `It Was That Close'"] [Text] Finally! After many assemblies and much debate, members of the Russian Trilateral Commission signed the General Agreement Between the All-Russian Trade Union and Employer Associations and the Russian Federation Government for 1994. A cheerful atmosphere prevailed in the well-known building at Old Square; in what has become a tradition, champagne was served (for the third time). Actually, there are enough reasons to be cautious in evaluating the events, apart from the desire to malign and "cloud." First, this fundamental document in the life of our society was too long in coming. Given that it overflows with phrases such as "prepare proposals" and "develop drafts," when is its effect to be expected? Second, it is known that pickets are posted in front of the White House continuously, simultaneously with the meeting of the RTK [Russian Trilateral Commission]: Nuclear industry workers take over from miners; yesterday, textile industry personnel joined in, and today--students. We must admit that there is a measure of discord in this. Will the discord weaken or disappear? The feeling is that the RTK aspires to this. FITUR [Federation of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia] Chairman Mikhail Shmakov, head of the trade union delegation within the commission, stated this for RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers: "The very fact that an agreement was signed is positive: As the economic crisis continues to worsen and passions in our society are seething, a step is being taken that makes confrontation less likely and safeguards peace in our house. "Furthermore, we succeeded in incorporating into the text of the General Agreement a sufficiently large number of the proposals by trade unions which are designed to protect the material interests of the working people. I will say right away that this is not all we wanted, but rather the maximum of what was possible in reaching a compromise. In particular, a provision is included that did not exist before: Decisions to use foreign labor in Russia will only be made with the findings of associations of trade unions and employers taken into account. "This is the wording of one of our main demands: 'A set of measures shall be taken to provide coordinated regulation, including by the state, and control over prices (rates) for energy resources, individual socially significant foodstuffs (regulated at the regional level), principal types of medicinal preparations and drugs, the services of passenger and freight transportation, communications, municipal and other services to the population, and products (goods, services) of monopoly enterprises.' "The General Agreement includes a new section concerning obligations of the parties with regard to social security and social insurance which provides protection measures for millions of working people: procedures for payment of temporary disability benefits, preservation of the technical and legal inspectorate of trade unions, as well as their certified physicians, provision of reduced-price sanatorium vouchers for low-income categories, and so on. "We did not succeed in pushing through the demand to bring the size of the minimum wage to 70 percent of the subsistence minimum by the end of the year. (In the last agreement, "to 50 percent" was laid down, but actually this remained merely a benign wish.) "However, as I see it, the main point is that representatives of all the three parties are now proceeding in the common direction--toward comprehensive cooperation." Let us knock on wood at this point. At the same time, let us recall (inappropriately?): "He is blessed who is a believer...." Oh, I nearly forgot! As the first item, the RTK heard a presentation by Deputy Minister of Railways I. Besedin concerning a raise in railway rates. Valeriy Ochekurov (Trade Union of Forest Rangers) asked him a question: "Can you bring down prices for tickets following our discussion here, or have we missed the train?" Besedin just threw up his hands, and everybody felt somewhat awkward because of their tactless colleague.
