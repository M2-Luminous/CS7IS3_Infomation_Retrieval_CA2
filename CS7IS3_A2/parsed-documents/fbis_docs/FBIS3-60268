The environment there is already threatened enough by uranium mines, settling basins for uranium ore dressing, and a storage facility for galvanic sludge, representatives said. Even the income and the jobs that the construction of a storage facility would bring to the region, whose unemployment rate is above the average for the Czech Republic, would not make up for the threat to the environment. In the spring a meeting of all the mayors of communities on whose territories the storage facility might be constructed is to take place.
