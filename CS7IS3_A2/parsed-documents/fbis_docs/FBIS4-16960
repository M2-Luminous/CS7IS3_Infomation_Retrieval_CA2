All Oil Roads Lead to Moscow"] [Text] The results of a mission to Tehran by Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko that ended yesterday have disappointed both sides. The contracts on deliveries of Iranian oil to Kiev are recognized as dead and buried. Ukraine could not after all get "black gold" either by the oil pipeline running across Azerbaijan or by tankers across the Black Sea because the Turkish side would not let them pass through the Bosporus. Oil contacts with Tehran that saw the light of day as a result of Kiev's seeking economic independence from Moscow called for the supply of 5 million tonnes of "black gold" as early as 1992, and another 4 million in 1993. There were plans under which the "Iranian oil for Ukrainian metal" barter scheme was supposed to have reached the $7 billion level. There was also talk of a really pipe-dream project, of a direct oil and gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine. But it was perhaps not fated. Mr. Zlenko has characterized the situation with failed deliveries as a stalemate. Now there is a new deal in the offing. Iran intends to buy from Kiev military hardware manufactured in Ukraine, in particular Antonov-type military transport planes and spares for them. Since there are no diplomatic constraints for such bilateral relations, this understanding appears rather realistic. A bilateral commission to coordinate economic cooperation was formed. As for political ties, Tehran has so far offered to Kiev mediation in freeing Ukrainian POW's in Afghanistan (there are nearly 80 of them).
