The conclusions are that the platform on future talks remains the same and that any possibility of the Srpska republic joining the Croat-Muslim federation is ruled out. However, the possibility of forming links with the newly created entities remains open, but only after the strategic interests of the Serb nation are realized. The session of the Srpska republic people's assembly resumed work at 1800 with discussion of internal policy. This part of the session is held behind closed doors.
