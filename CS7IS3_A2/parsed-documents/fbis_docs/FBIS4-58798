Dr. Ziyad Fariz, the minister of planning and acting minister of industry and trade, who chaired the Jordanian side to the meetings of the preparatory committee, read a press statement, saying: "In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A press statement: On this blessed morning, praise be to God, the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee concluded its meetings at the Prime Ministry under Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, prime minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, prime minister of the Arab Republic of Egypt. "The two sides stressed the importance of these meetings within the framework of their quest for cooperation, coordination, and joint action launched by the two countries years ago in order to lay the foundations for developing relations between the two fraternal countries in all fields. "During these meetings, there was a review of Arab, regional, and international developments, as well as the role of the leadership in both countries, and their fraternal relations, in promoting joint Arab action and achieving Arab interests in the face of challenges and threats to the region and the problems and disputes this region is suffering, which could subject it to foreign intervention and ambitions. "The two sides called for efforts to resume the drive for Arab solidarity and for organizing inter-Arab relations through resolving Arab differences in accordance with a pan-Arab perspective that focuses on the Arab nation's common interests and concerns. "Out of the awareness of the two sides of the critical and important nature of the current stage being experienced by the Arab nation and the region in general, in addition to international changes, such as the emergence of influential regional economic blocs, the two sides stressed the importance of a comprehensive review of the Arab situation, in terms of its political, security, and economic aspects, to help in facing the emergent challenges. "The two sides expressed their intense concern and distress over the serious, fast-paced developments in Yemen. They urge the brothers to stop fighting immediately and return to political dialogue to settle the crisis. This would preserve the unity and interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. "The two sides also expressed hope that the problem of inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound vessels would be settled in a manner that safeguards Jordan's interests. "The two sides stressed the importance of activating the work of the committees studying the relations of various sectors in the two countries, as well as the need for these committees to meet to ensure continued dialogue and coordination between the two sides on all levels. "The decisions also provide for cooperation in all fields, the most important of which are: Political coordination: The two sides stressed the important role that Egypt and Jordan can play to restore Arab solidarity and create a unified Arab position on various issues. This is in addition to coordination and consultation on various regional and international issues, and facing the new developments on the regional and Arab levels. They also welcome the signing of the Cairo agreement for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as a step down the road to reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in the region." In the economic field, the statement notes an agreement to form an economic working team to devise a joint mechanism to discuss regional and international issues and cooperation and coordination in these fields. The two sides also reviewed the status of the Egyptian-Jordanian Investment Company and its plans in both countries. The statement also notes an agreement to implement Trade Protocol No. 1 that stemmed from the agreement signed in 1992. The two sides stressed the importance and need for coordination and exchange of expertise in financial affairs, planning, energy, mining, agriculture, water, transportation and communications, health and medicine, tourism, culture and information, in addition to activating a cooperation agreement in the field of manpower. In the field of higher education, the final statement says: "It has been agreed that the Jordanian Ministry of Higher Education will set aside 100 seats annually for the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education for the first university degree in various specialties. In return, the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education will set aside 110 seats for the Jordanian Ministry of Higher Education for graduate studies, in addition to 15 seats as scholarships for graduate studies and 300 seats annually for the first university degree at Egyptian universities." After the press statement was read, Dr.al-Majali and Dr. Sidqi replied to journalists' questions. On his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn yesterday, Dr.'Atif Sidqi said: "The truth is that I was honored yesterday when His Majesty King Husayn received me and my colleagues, the members of the accompanying delegation. We spoke with all clarity and frankness about the present Arab state of affairs, the state of affairs the Arab nation is experiencing. His majesty's viewpoints and those of the prime minister are nearly the same as our viewpoints and analysis in Egypt, both of His Excellency President Husni Mubarak and the government. Of course, there is always a complete agreement on these issues. "However, the main problem, the topical issue during this meeting was the question of Yemen -- of course, you all are following this issue -- and the efforts Jordan has exerted to reconcile the two Yemeni sides, as well as the efforts Egypt has and is still exerting in this respect. These efforts were also discussed. The objective of his majesty the king and of Jordan is the same as that of His Excellency President Mubarak and of Egypt. "There were also His Majesty King Husayn's statements about the relations between Egypt and Jordan. I would like to emphasize to you that these relations have always been good. His majesty the king visited Egypt. God willing, His Excellency President Husni Mubarak will do the same, will visit his brother in Jordan. Thanks be to God, we overcame the susceptibilities that used to exist. I say that I sensed during my meeting with his majesty the king that his policies are pan-Arab and in the interest of the entire Arab nation. His majesty is fully concerned that we emerge from the present differences in the Arab arena to a state of affairs that will bring good through peaceful and objective methods." Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali replied to a question on the nature of the Jordanian-Palestinian relations, saying: "The Jordanian-Palestinian relationship is a unique relationship that stands out. We were not satisfied with the coordination because we always felt and believed that coordination should always be on all levels and in the best of circumstances. But, at the same time, we excused the brothers because they were busy with major political issues in their negotiations with Israel. There was no opportunity for coordination as we had wished. However, the coordination, to some extent, was good. Now that the signing has taken place, we hope and I explained this to His Excellency President Yasir 'Arafat -- and His Majesty King Husayn has also told brother 'Arafat -- that the time has come to have the various committees meet because it is essential to do so. We believe that the reasons that may once have stood in the way of good coordination no longer exist after the signing. We ask God that this takes place in the near future." In response to a question concerning developments on the Jordanian-Israeli track in the peace process and the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, especially after His Majesty King Husayn's recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Dr. al-Majali said: "Concerning the siege of al-'Aqabah, I have recently noted that, since that meeting, no inspections have been carried out. But is it over? We are still awaiting the final word and final decision. We hope that we will receive word soon. There are still some complications regarding the way matters will be conducted. As to what extent this issue will influence the course of events, I told you that we cannot have intensive participation in the multilateral talks, in which the main focuses are economic and social, at a time when we are still under the economic pressure of the siege. "However, in such matters, we do not believe in secrecy, threats, or warnings. We have pursued a cultural approach. We have participated in multilateral negotiations, but at a low level. This is because we want the entire world to hear that we are being wronged. I believe that the world has heard us. We have noticed interest by all parties. A short while ago and during the meetings, his excellency the brother [Egyptian] prime minister clearly expressed concern over the situation to which this siege has led. We will collectively work to make sure that the siege will not be maintained or reimposed. "The bilateral talks, I believe, were suspended because of what had happened in Hebron. After the signing of Palestinian agreement in Cairo, I believe the two cosponsors will make sure that these negotiations are resumed. Of course, we always believe in the need for a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we hope that there will be progress on other tracks, besides the Jordanian track, so that we can arrive at a comprehensive, just solution. "By the way, I want to answer a question that has not been posed. Some people, misunderstanding the situation, believe that the Palestinians have reached a separate solution. For the next two years, it should be noted, the brother Palestinians will be negotiating what we started negotiating two years ago. The issue they are negotiating differs from the issues that we, the Syrians, and the Lebanese are negotiating. Therefore, I believe that what they have arrived at is an essential step. God willing, this step will be so positive that they will need less than two years and they will begin negotiations on the final status as soon as possible so that all these tracks can move with relatively equal pace." On the positive steps being taken to achieve Arab reconciliation, Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said: "It is official Egyptian policy that Egypt welcomes Arab reconciliation. Therefore, we have welcomed the Arab League's efforts in this regard. Arab reconciliation has started, but we have not reached the end. We must be frank with ourselves. We must not bury our heads in the sand. A reconciliation must be effected." [Al-Majali] "If his excellency the prime minister permits me to interrupt, I would like to say that the appropriate approach would be to declare that we [the Arabs] will solve our differences, but over a specific number of years [Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi is heard saying "exactly"]. The first three to four years would serve as a grace period, during which we would not raise this issue, but look for points of agreement. We should have a collective stand on the new regional order being planned for this region. If we can do so and put off the differences until a later stage. Then, differences will be examined and everyone will be told whether he is right or wrong. This may be the key. The Arab League will then call on all brothers to put off their differences. We cannot tell them forget these differences all at once. [Sidqi is heard commenting "this is impossible"] Rather, shelve them for a while until we cross the very serious bridge lying ahead of us, for fear that we all might be drowned." [Sidqi] "Also, with the permission of His Excellency 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, please allow to reaffirm that this is the best approach. We should go into this process step by step. Sharp differences can be shelved. We can start from the points of agreement. This is the practical and sound approach. I believe this is the approach that is being pursued."
