Our sources said that in its courageous attack, the Islamic resistance used 120mm mortars against the regime's artillery batteries, ammunition, and personnel positions, leaving the regime forces horrified and unable to move. Our sources said the regime suffered heavy human and material losses. Eyewitnesses said they saw columns of flames from far away and heard explosions of ammunition in the storehouses for 48 hours. After the operation, our sources added, the regime placed all its forces in the south on maximum alert and closed main and secondary roads linking al-'Amarah with the other governorates in the south. The regime forces also launched extensive searches for the heroes of the Islamic resistance, who returned safely to base. It should be mentioned that large areas of al-'Amarah marshlands were targeted by the regime's large-caliber artillery deployed at the IV Army Corps command near the city of al-'Amarah. The shelling destroyed hundreds of houses, caused heavy property damage, and forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the marshlands and seek refuge in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in other regions inside Iraq.
