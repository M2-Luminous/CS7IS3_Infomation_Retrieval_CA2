Addressing the annual meeting of the Civil Defense Course Association, Ahtisaari said that the expansion of the EU is the most important factor for the consolidation of European stability and a vital process for joint security. According to Ahtisaari, EU membership creates a new kind of action framework for Finland in foreign and security policy when it is a member of the chief group influencing international politics. Ahtisaari said that he expected much from the civic debate preceding the EU referendum, adding that the Finns must make it clear to themselves and others in which direction they want to take this country.
