The report states "projects as a whole have achieved desirable results." However, it also points out the need for conducting a preliminary study of problems connected with individual projects. The survey was conducted in fiscal 1992 for a total of 159 projects carried out in 46 countries. In addition to Japanese diplomatic missions in foreign countries and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, civilian experts and organizations were invited to take part in the survey. Among future tasks listed in the report are: how to grasp accurately the needs of recipient countries; how to settle the issue concerning management shortages, training, and other funds, after the completion of projects; and how to help them improve the management system. The report cites various problems connected with individual projects. For example, a considerable number of facilities built in suburban Islamabad, Pakistan for rural area development have been left unutilized, and the X-ray film developing equipment provided for promoting the anti-tuberculosis campaign in Yemen has not been used for over two years.
