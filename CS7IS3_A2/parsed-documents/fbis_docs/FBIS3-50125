The PSM believes that the negotiations between the PUNR and the PDSR should be continued and concluded. Regardless of their outcome, those negotiations have had a beneficial effect so far in the sense that they have highlighted the need to clarify relations among the ruling party and the parties that support the government, Mohora emphasized. As far as the PSM is concerned, that party is not interested primarily in who the new members of the government will be, but rather in the way the new executive will govern. In that sense, the PSM has said that an agreement should be concluded in writing among all the parties supporting the new government. The document should establish the way and the means by which they will support the act of governing. The PSM has also requested that an anticrisis program should be urgently elaborated. During the talks that concluded last Friday they also proposed the establishment of a political pact that should be open for all parties, regardless of whether they are represented in parliament or not, which should comprise a number of political ideas that are acceptable for all, without, however, being connected to the act of government. Mohora also mentioned the fact that, during the talks last Friday, the idea emerged to set up an alliance of the parties that support the government and they discussed the possibility of establishing a multi-color government in the long run. In the conclusion of the news conference Mohora announced that PSM Chairman Ilie Verdet is currently in Paris, where he is attending the proceedings of the French Communist Party congress. During their stay in France the PSM leaders intend to contact left-wing political groupings from other countries, our correspondent Anca Ionescu reports.
