The strategy will be ready by the end of February and will also be aimed at improving Finland's reputation in forestry circles, according to Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen. The strategy will be adapted to the environmental program for forestry that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is currently drafting. The forest strategy will be the Environment Ministry's position on how Finnish forests should be managed and protected and as such, according to Pietikainen, it will provide guidelines for both state and private forestry. She does not think a decision in principle at the government level is needed on this issue. ``The Environment Ministry is the authority that is responsible for forest management and biodiversity, therefore the ministry's position is the same as Finland's position,'' Pietikainen said. Behind the need to draw up an integrated strategy on forestry and the protection of old forests in our country lie both the principles Finland is committed to in accordance with the UN's Rio conference on the environment and development and the reorganization that is currently under way at both the forestry and environmental administrations. In addition the recent discussion of forest policy both in this country and abroad revealed a lack of knowledge that could damage Finland's reputation on forestry issue, the environment minister said. Some 727 of the endangered species in this country, 43 percent of the total, live in forests. To preserve the abundance of species it is important to also preserve the old primeval forests, and the working group that has reviewed the need to protect old forests has proposed protecting 23,000 hectares of forestland in all. Last Friday the first specific areas were protected in accordance with the group's proposal, a unified area in Talaskangas and scattered areas in western Finland. Next year a supplemental proposal will also be presented on the protection of old forests south of Uleaborg on both state and private lands. By the end of October 1995 another proposal on protecting forests north of Uleaborg will be ready. Currently there is a shortage of protected areas in southern sections of Lapland, according to the Environment Ministry. Kajanaland and northern Lapland have more protected forests. Some 30,000 hectares of old forest in southern Lapland and Kajanaland are protected and less than 10,000 hectares of this kind of forest are protected in southern Finland. Finland has 41,500 hectares of protected forests in all, representing 2.3 percent of the country's forest area. However, the Environment Ministry points out that it is not enough to protect forests; scattered protection areas do not guarantee the survival of species. Forest management also plays a central role and education in sound forest management that is more compatible with nature is included in training programs in forest districts.
