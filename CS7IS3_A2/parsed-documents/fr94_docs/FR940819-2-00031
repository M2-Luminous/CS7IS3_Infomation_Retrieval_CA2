FR940819-2-00031 FR940819-2-00011 Department's Position: We disagree with RIMA. RIMA's suggestion that the company's problems relate to having only one week of preparation time after receipt of the verification agenda is completely erroneous. The verification outline was in fact released to counsel for RIMA on October 28, 1993, and verification of RIMA's cost response began on November 13, 1993. Thus the agenda was available more than two weeks prior to the start of verification. Further, the verification agenda merely indicates the Department's approach to performing the verification. Any suggestion that the company did not realize the Department intended to review the underlying source documents is unsupported. The fact that the Department is particularly concerned with each company's methodology for linking the cost response to its cost and financial accounting system is indicated in the Department's questionnaire (September 1, 1992), which requires the company to provide detailed explanations of this connection. The questionnaire also instructed company personnel to contact the Department if for any reason they did not intend to rely on the company's cost accounting records to prepare the response (September 1, 1992 at page 53). RIMA's further assertions that the company's problems related to conducting verification on a weekend and a lack of verification experience are not persuasive. Company personnel and their counsel knew well in advance of the need to schedule verification time on the weekends; in fact, counsel for each of the respondents, including counsel for RIMA, provided input in setting the verification schedule for this case. It should also be noted that the Department's personnel conducting the verification noted no improvement in the company's ability to provide verification support as the verification progressed into the regular work week. Indeed we know of no reasons why it would improve on a particular day of the week since the information the Department requested should be available within the company, and all of the company personnel who participated in the verification were available on the weekend. It is not unusual for a respondent to be unfamiliar with the verification process and the Department does not expect such experience. However, if company personnel are unable to explain the methodology followed in preparing the response and provide the source documents which were relied upon, we are not able to conclude that this is simply a result of being unfamiliar with the verification process. Comment 31: RIMA argues that it used a reasonable methodology to report quartz and charcoal costs. RIMA contends that it used its financial accounting system to price these inputs because (1) its cost system does not use replacement values, and (2) the cost system was subject to distortions that were known to RIMA's management. Moreover, RIMA argues that the variations between these two cost systems were minor, and that RIMA provided the most accurate information in its COP/CV response that it could. RIMA argues that the COP/CV verification report indicates that RIMA's production standard specifies the use of specific types of charcoal and quartz. However, RIMA, in practice, sometimes used other types of these materials, depending on availability. RIMA contends that use of these other materials resulted in a lower calculated cost than RIMA reported in its COP/CV response. Department's Position: We disagree with RIMA's assertions that its reported material cost were overstated. As discussed in the cost verification report, the monthly replacement costs noted for certain of the materials actually used in production were higher than the unit costs for the specific materials which RIMA had indicated were used in production. Thus these unit prices were understated. Comment 32: RIMA asserts that it provided ``critical source documentation'' concerning the quantity of inputs used in the production of silicon metal, contrary to the assertion of the Department's verification report. RIMA contends that during the verification it made the ``underlying statistical measurements'' available for inspection by the verification team. RIMA argues that it should not be expected to produce daily or hourly source documents because of the great volume of papers involved. Department's Position: We disagree with RIMA's contention that it provided source documents. We also disagree with RIMA's assertion that we expected the company to provide daily or hourly source documents. RIMA was expected to provide an accurate response to the Department's specific requests for information. As discussed in the Department's verification report (December 22, 1993), prior to verification RIMA completely failed to indicate the true nature of its cost and financial accounting systems, and even stated that the systems reflect the same costs. RIMA also indicated that its cost accounting system was relied upon in preparing the submitted cost information. We found each of these assertions to be inaccurate. Although RIMA was able to provide pages of graphs which purportedly reflected the actual material consumption, RIMA was unable to reconcile this information to either the cost or financial accounting system. Thus, the reported material consumption quantities were presented to the Department quite literally in a complete vacuum, merely a handful of graphs, unreconcilable to any other recorded measure of material consumption. This was the extent of the underlying statistical measurements which were made available to the Department for inspection. As discussed in our response to comment 24, the discrepancies noted in the material quantity input together with other significant inconsistencies have caused us to reject RIMA's cost submission.
