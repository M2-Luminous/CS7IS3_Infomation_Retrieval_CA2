FR941221-1-00035 FR941221-1-00012 V. Proposed Rule After considering the comments and petitions for reconsideration that were filed, and following an examination of the issues surrounding the transportation of infectious substances and RMW, RSPA is limiting the proposals in this notice to those issues concerning infectious substances and RMW that must be addressed in the short term to ensure safe transportation of these materials without unduly impacting the regulated industry. RSPA intends to address other pertinent issues, such as harmonizing the HMR with international regulations, adopting bulk packaging provisions for RMW, and evaluating the adequacy of existing Federal regulations for biological products and diagnostic specimens, in future rulemaking action. Although these issues are important, they are complex and may result in additional requirements or substantial changes to the HMR. Thus, it is not appropriate to include them in this notice, except to discuss them in terms of future action. The ``long-term'' issues are discussed further in Section VI of this notice. In this NPRM, RSPA is proposing to amend the provisions of the HMR applicable to Division 6.2 materials to enhance the effectiveness of the HMR and minimize costs incurred by industry. Interested persons are invited to comment on these proposals. A public meeting will be held on January 17, 1995, at which oral comments are invited. A. Definitions Several commenters requested confirmation of their understanding that the provisions for RMW do not apply to sterilized medical wastes or wastes that do not contain an infectious substance. This understanding is correct. As stated in the preamble to the January 3, 1991 final rule, if a medical waste has been treated so as to eliminate its hazard as an infectious substance, then it is not subject to the HMR. No additional processing of the waste for aesthetics, such as that formerly required by the EPA under the MWTA, is required. To clarify this point, RSPA is proposing to revise ยง173.134 by adding exceptions for any material that contained an infectious substance but has been treated to eliminate the hazard. In addition, consistent with EPA-provided exceptions under the MWTA regulations and based on RSPA's own initiative, RSPA is proposing to clarify that the following materials are not considered RMW: (1) EPA hazardous wastes; (2) household waste; (3) corpses, remains, and anatomical parts intended for ceremonial interment or cremation, and (4) animal waste generated in animal husbandry or food production. Based on commenters' requests and RSPA's initiative, RSPA is proposing to simplify the definition of RMW by adopting a criteria-based definition, rather than a list-based definition. The definition in Appendix G to part 173 did not specify that a category of waste, such as ``unused sharps,'' was only regulated if the waste contained an infectious substance. RSPA never intended to regulate medical waste that does not contain an infectious substance. Therefore, RSPA is proposing to revise the definition of RMW to remove the Appendix G categories and replace them with a generic definition. RMW would be defined as a waste or reusable material, other than a Class 7 (radioactive) material or a culture or stock of an infectious substance, which contains an infectious substance and is generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals, research pertaining thereto, or the production or testing of biological products. Another issue of concern to RSPA was whether waste cultures and stocks should be treated as RMW or as infectious substances for the purposes of packaging and hazard communication for transportation. Several commenters recommended that waste cultures and stocks should be treated as infectious substances rather than as RMW. One commenter stated that the hazards posed by these materials are the same regardless of ``whether the untreated cultures and stocks are to undergo further manipulation or are destined for disposal.'' Another commenter stated that cultures and stocks demand very careful packaging and handling. The commenter added that packagings required for most RMW are not adequate for untreated cultures and stocks. Some commenters stated that cultures and stocks should be handled as RMW because optimal conditions for growth are no longer present in the waste stream and most of these materials are sterilized before transportation. In the case of the generators that cannot sterilize on-site, the Texas Water Commission asserted that the quantity of these materials in the waste stream is probably insufficient to make the waste significantly more infectious than other forms of RMW.
