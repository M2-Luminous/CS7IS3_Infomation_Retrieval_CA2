Troubles are created by groups of bandits in uniforms who are stricken by poverty. The Thai Army has no intention of causing trouble in Cambodia. Cambodia's internal affairs should be solved among the Cambodian people. Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit was interviewed by newsmen in Nakhon Ratchasima this morning: [Begin Wimon recording] The situation now is not as serious as in the past. Otherwise, more people would have fled into our country again -- there have been no refugees these days. There is some trouble for our people being created by the bandits in uniform; we are trying to suppress them. We are coordinating work with unit commanders on the other side of the border to solve the problem. If they cannot get their bad elements under control, we will have to resort to tough measures to suppress them. I notice that those people are very poor. They have small salaries, and sometimes there was a delay in salary payment, and so on so forth. So those who lack discipline created trouble for our people. Sometimes, the problems stemmed from cheating among themselves since they are involved in arms and cattle smuggling. We are not responsible for all the troubles, but they are responsible. In this connection, the Army is ready to take the strongest measure to deal with those troubles and will not allow them to go on like this. I would like to stress here that the Thai Army has never caused trouble in Cambodia. We want to see peace and prosperity, and to see our neighbors live happily. We do not want to see killing between Cambodian factions. But that's their duty to solve the problem. We have nothing to do with it. [End recording]
