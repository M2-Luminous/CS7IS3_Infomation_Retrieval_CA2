FR941222-2-00105 FR941222-2-00090 When implemented, TVA will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security personnel through the use of a badge and hand geometry verification system. The numbered picture badge identification system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area. Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would provide a positive verification process. The potential loss of a badge by an individual as a result of taking the badge offsite would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas. IV For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by TVA, i.e., contractors, who are authorized unescorted access into the protected areas at the Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, and Watts Bar Nuclear Plants can take their badges offsite. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant adverse environmental impact (59 FR 61351). For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 24, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama (for the BFN Plant), and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 (for the SQN and WBN Plants). This exemption is effective upon issuance. It is expected to be implemented for each plant separately when modifications, procedures, and training are completed at the respective plant. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 15th day of December 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Steven A. Varga, Director, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
