Yielding to pressure from Opposition as well as ruling party members in Parliament, the Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, has announced some more concessions for the small-scale sector. He, however, stuck to his stand on not to reintroduce general excise exemption for this sector. The reliefs were announced by the Minister while piloting the Finance Bill 1994 in the Lok Sabha today. The Bill is expected to be passed on Friday. Lower excise on vehicles catering to the rural population, a lower excise on split air conditioners for tourist buses, a reduction in customs duty on medical equipment and some changes in presumptive tax on transport operators are among the reliefs extended by the Minister for the automobile sector. Dr. Singh has also changed the dates for furnishing returns in the case of companies and non-corporate assessees. Though the Minister did not give the quantum of revenue, loss on account of the concessions, sources indicated that the loss would be marginal and below Rs. 50 crores. He also announced the constitution of a group to collect district-wise data from States in order to arrive at a uniform national set of criteria for industrial backwardness and to identify districts which are extremely backward. On the basis of the new criteria, the question of providing tax holiday for new industrial units in backward districts would be considered. Product-specific Exemptions Recounting the measures taken by him to remove the difficulties faced by the small sector, the Minister told the House that removal of the product-specific exemptions and extension of the general small scale industries (SSIs) scheme for excise concession would give the small sector a real competitive edge vis-a-vis the larger units. This was because under a general excise exemption, both the large and small units were treated at par whereas under excise, the small units could get the benefit of concessional rates. Having said that, Dr. Singh went on to announce complete exemption from excise in the case of soap made without the aid of power. Similarly, umbrellas have been exempted from excise duty as well as corrugated boxes and cartons since these are mostly made in the unorganised sector. For the automobile sector, the Minister has said that excise duty on vehicles with gross vehicle weight of less than 2,700 kg. which was proposed to be levied at the rate of 40 per cent, will now attract 25 per cent duty. This has been done because vehicles satisfying this criterion had been designed to cater to the needs of rural transport and should not attract 40 per cent duty which is the rate for cars as well. Furthermore, he said that in view of the administrative difficulties faced by utensil manufacturers, he was exempting the circles used captively in the manufacture of such utensils. He also proposed the extension of proforma credit of yarn duty to manufacturers of narrow woven fabrics as well as proforma credit of woollen yarn duty to woollen fabrics. On knitted and crocheted fabrics, he proposed a uniform duty of 10 per cent against the rates of 5, 10 or 20 per cent depending on value. On split air conditioners, Dr. Singh had proposed in his Budget a shift from specific to ad valorem rates. He said he had received representations that imposition of 60 per cent ad valorem duty on split air conditioners for buses had resulted in a sharp increase in the incidence of duty and as this would go against the interests of the tourism industry, the ad valorem duty was being reduced to 30 per cent. Similarly, on representations from members of Parliament, the Finance Minister has enlarged the list of imported life-saving medical equipment exempt from payment of customs duty. The list of goods attracting 15 per cent customs duty was also being enlarged. Spare parts for such medical equipment which attract 15 per cent plus nil countervailing duty (CV) and 40 per cent with CV duty would now generally attract a uniform rate of 15 per cent plus CV duty. (The CV will be equivalent to excise duty on domestic producers). Similarly, excise duty on medical furniture which were to attract 20 per cent duty will now attract 5 per cent only. Dr. Singh also promised to look into representations seeking enlargement of the list of life-saving drugs which do not attract any duty. In the case of direct taxes, the Minister has reduced the estimated income in case of truck operators from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 1,800 per truck per month for light and medium commercial vehicles and from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 2,000 per truck per month in the case of heavy trucks. In response to another demand, the Minister has now indicated that the due date for filing returns for companies would be November 30 instead of the earlier proposed date of October 31. Likewise, for non-corporate assessees who are required to get their accounts audited or are required to furnish an accountant's report in support of claims for certain deductions, the due date will continue to be October 31 and will not be changed to August 31. This has been done in view of the complaints that changes in dates would result in bunching and heavy pressure of work on the audit profession. Besides, the amendments would have created difficulties in the case of non-corporate assessees who claim deduction under Section 80 HHC and 80 HHD, since they are allowed to bring in the export proceeds in foreign exchange by September 30 and thereafter furnish evidence of such remittance.
