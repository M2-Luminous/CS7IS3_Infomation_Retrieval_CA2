Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and executive vice mayor of Tianjin, gave speeches. Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Li Huifen, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Zhang Haosheng, Wang Dehui, Li Changxing, Huang Yanzhi, and Zhang Guanwen. In his speech, Gao Dezhan reviewed and appraised Tianjin's anticorruption work carried out in the previous period. He said: Party committees and governments at all levels in the municipality have conscientiously implemented the central guidelines and the arrangements of the municipal party committee and government, remained firm in attitude and quick in action, adopted realistic measures, and carried out plenty of work. The vast number of party members, cadres, and the masses have shown wholehearted support and actively participated in the anticorruption struggle. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all fields, Tianjin has created a good trend in the anticorruption struggle, developed it in a healthy manner, and by and large met the central requirements, thus achieving good results for that period. 1) Good results have been achieved in waging special campaigns to tackle specific problems and in correcting unhealthy trends. Tianjin has started early and exerted earnest efforts in the work to check collection of unwarranted fees, fines, and donations and thus has achieved notable results. It has conducted thorough investigations on the problem of travelling abroad and beyond the border with public funds. Meanwhile, it has drawn up clear stipulations to ensure strict examination and approval, thus preventing some groups from visiting abroad in violation of the stipulations. The work to examine the businesses developed by party and government organs is being carried out in an active and prudent manner, and about a half of the business entities have severed their ties with these organs or have been closed down. Other unhealthy trends have also been effectively checked. 2) Leading cadres have gained more initiative in remaining honest and self-disciplined. Leading bodies at and above the county or section level in the municipality have extensively held inner-party democratic meetings to examine and correct themselves in line with the five regulations on honesty and self-discipline. Problems, such as holding concurrent jobs in economic entities of various types, accepting money and marketable securities as gifts, applying for membership cards and credit cards with public funds, and buying enterprise shares to be sold within the enterprises only, have been solved. 3) Substantial progress has been made in investigating and handling major and serious cases. Discipline inspection commissions at all levels investigated 852 discipline breaches committed by party members in the whole year, and concluded 680 of them. Procuratorial organs investigated and handled 330 major and serious cases on embezzlement and bribe-taking and publicly pronounced judgments on nine major economic criminals. The initial success in Tianjin's anticorruption struggle has enhanced people's confidence in opposing corruption and their trust in the party and government, thus playing a positive role in safeguarding social stability, promoting reform and opening up, and facilitating economic development. Although fairly good results have been achieved in the anticorruption struggle for the previous period, leaders at all levels should remain clearheaded and never overestimate the results. Our work is still falling rather far behind when considering the existing problems and the demands of the masses. Development of work has been uneven in different departments and different units. Some good results have yet to be consolidated, and any slack efforts might lead to a setback. We should not only realistically affirm the achievements in the previous anticorruption struggle, but also we should note that corrupt phenomena are still serious, and we should continue our painstaking work and never take them lightly or slacken our efforts, even in the slightest degree. Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand on Tianjin's 1994 anticorruption work is that we should persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, take the initiative in subjecting ourselves to and serving the overall interest of the work of the entire party, continue to implement the central decision on the anticorruption struggle, carry out the new content of the struggle put forward by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission while consolidating the achievements already won, and continue the anticorruption struggle in an in-depth, sustained, and more effective manner. Regarding its anticorruption struggle for this year, Tianjin should continue to do a good job in cadres' honesty and self-discipline, in investigating and handling major and serious cases, and in correcting the unhealthy trends in various trades and, based on the characteristics of the situation, add new content to these three aspects of work and conscientiously carry them out. First, regarding leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, leading cadres at and above the county (section) level of party and government organs in the municipality should strictly enforce the various regulations of the party Central Committee and the State Council on improving party style and honesty in performance of official duties. The five regulations on honesty and self- discipline put forward by the party Central Committee last year should be further implemented. Comrades who did not conduct self-examination and self-correction based on the regulations and those who had problems but did not report or correct them should take remedial measures. Regarding the problems exposed after the self-examination which have not been addressed, we should step up efforts to properly deal with them in line with the relevant documents of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. The above-mentioned work should be conscientiously carried out by the end of April. After this, all violations of the "five regulations" which are not reported by the persons concerned after the self-examination and self-correction, but are exposed by the masses and those committed again after the issuance of the "decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on the several tasks of the anticorruption struggle to be successfully carried out in the near future" should be strictly dealt with. While continuing to enforce the "five regulations," we should conscientiously enforce another five regulations put forward by the central authorities this year. 1. It is prohibited to purchase cars in violation of regulations or replace them with imported luxury ones; it is prohibited to abuse power to exchange cars with and borrow cars from enterprises or subordinating units or collect money from them to buy cars; it is prohibited to use loans, the money collected from people, and funds for special projects to buy cars for leading cadres; and district and county party and government leading organs and units which owe wages to their staff members and workers are prohibited from buying cars. 2. It is not permitted to buy houses at reduced prices in violation of the State Council regulations on housing reform; it is not permitted to abuse power to provide preferential terms for oneself or one's children, relatives, and friends to buy houses; and it is not permitted to decorate one's house in excess of the established standards with public funds. 3. Leading cadres should use simple cars and take few people with them during domestic official activities, and their accommodations should not exceed the local standards for reception; and no special dance parties should be held for them. 4. It is not allowed to take the opportunity of the marriage, funeral, job transfer, birthday, and house moving of oneself and one's family members to give lavish parties and spend without restraint, still less to use public funds and materials for such activities or to earn money from them. 5. It is not permitted to abuse power to refuse to return public funds; and it is not permitted to use public funds to buy or build houses for oneself and one's relatives and friends and to engage in profit making. Leading cadres at and above the county (section) level should earnestly conduct self-examination and self-correction based on the above-mentioned five regulations. We should hold the democratic meetings at high standard, refrain from vague, general discussions, and conscientiously address problems. We should immediately conduct examination of our own accord and rapidly correct mistakes if any. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions should also remain honest and self-disciplined, abide by laws and discipline, and oppose abuse of power for selfish gains, embezzlement, bribe-taking, spending without restraint, and numerous negative and corrupt phenomena. Leaders of loss-making enterprises, in particular, must share weal and woe with their staff members and workers and receive the same treatment with workers concerning wage decreases and basic living expenses. Loss-making enterprises unable to pay wages to their workers are strictly prohibited from buying high-class cars, and their leaders are prohibited from going abroad for inspection or giving parties in excess of the established standards. Second, regarding investigations and handling of cases, we should concentrate efforts on major and serious cases, particularly the cases on embezzlement, bribe-taking, and abuse of power for selfish gains committed by leading cadres, the malpractice, bribe-taking, and other law and discipline breaches committed by law- and discipline-enforcing personnel, and the law and discipline breaches committed by legal persons. We should step up efforts in handling cases and speed up the progress. We should, in particular, step up efforts to investigate and handle the major and serious cases involving leading cadres and never procrastinate. Third, in correcting the unhealthy trends in some trades, the general demand is that we should consolidate and develop the achievements won last year in correcting the unhealthy trends and, on this basis, correct three unhealthy trends thoroughly and effectively in line with the new arrangements of the central authorities. 1) We should conscientiously correct the practice of the personnel of party and government organs who abuse power to use, without compensation, the money and property of enterprises to suit the purposes of their organs or of their own. 2) We should investigate the allocation of enterprise funds in various excuses to serve as the private coffers of units and the indiscriminate issuance of bonuses. 3) We should resolutely check the unhealthy trend of asking for donations from enterprises in various excuses. All departments should adopt effective measures to solve their problems well. We should also make great efforts to check the lavish wining and dining and vulgar gift-giving that the masses bitterly hate and achieve good results in this. Gao Dezhan urged: Leading comrades at all levels must study and master the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, deepen their understanding of the importance of the anticorruption struggle, and have more initiative in this work. They should deepen their understanding of the importance of opposing corruption from the perspective of upholding the party's nature and its basic purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, the perspective of consolidating the party's position as a ruling party, and the perspective of ensuring the overall interests of the work of the entire party and entire work. Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should conscientiously strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle and study documents well. Leading bodies of departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, bureaus, enterprises, and institutions should devote enough time to the study of the speeches of central leading comrades, the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, and the arrangements of the municipal party committee and government. Meanwhile, we should organize well the study of the cadres at and above the county level. Through the study, we should enhance understanding, master the guidelines, and have a good command of the overall situation and policies. Party and government leaders should make concerted efforts. Party committees and governments at all levels should continue to list the anticorruption work high in their agenda, and their principal leaders should attend to it personally. Every level should be responsible for the work of the next lower level to ensure implementation of work at every level. We should stress realistic results, check vague generalization, and oppose perfunctory work. We should conscientiously extend the system of responsibility for the anticorruption work targets. We should exert earnest efforts to tackle knotty problems and put forward specific time limits, progress, and work quality requirements. We should have a strict command of policies and conscientiously implement the guiding thoughts and the series of principles and policies defined by the central authorities. The anticorruption struggle should be geared to the overall interests of the work of the entire party and serve the promotion of reform, construction, and development and the safeguarding of social and political stability. We should intensify investigation and study, have a strict command of policies, and correctly distinguish and handle the two different types of contradictions. We should firmly rely on the masses in waging the anticorruption struggle, but we should not launch mass movements or have everybody make self-criticisms. We should encourage the people to report crimes. We should give full play to the role of democratic parties and the personages without party affiliation, organize them to participate in the implementation of the tasks related to the anticorruption struggle, and give more attention to their opinions and suggestions. The anticorruption struggle should be coordinated with the work to develop healthy trends. We should keep education in view and aim at improvement. Opposing corruption and advocating honesty is a strategic measure for the enduring order and stability of the country, not a stopgap measure. We should intensively and persistently educate party members and cadres on the basic purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly and the traditional work style of plain living and arduous struggle, maintain and develop the fine tradition of honesty in performing official duties and diligence in serving the people, and develop honesty and diligence simultaneously. This is the necessary demand on the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. Only with honesty can we have stability, and only with diligence can we have hope. We should combine self-examination and self-correction with supervision. We should first strengthen the inner supervisory mechanism for opposing corruption and advocating honesty and, in the meantime, strengthen the supervision and restriction by the masses and various circles of society. We should persist in both stopgap and radical measures. Regarding the problems exposed, we should stem loopholes in a timely manner, improve systems, strengthen management, and establish and improve various policies and rules. We should fully develop the functional role of discipline inspection and supervision departments. As discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for the anticorruption struggle, they should step up efforts to improve themselves and continuously raise their ideological and work levels. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for and support the work of discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial departments, coordinate the relationship between various sectors, check buck-passing, and rally their forces. In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: The situation we are faced with is very good, and our tasks are very arduous. We should firmly implement the basic principles for and the overall interests of the work of the entire party, unite more closely round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, conscientiously carry out the various arrangements of the party Central Committee and State Council, and continue to work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. In this way, we will continue to score new and greater achievements in Tianjin's reform, opening up, development, stability, anticorruption work, and the work to build a clean government. Li Shenglin gave specific opinions on the work to correct unhealthy trends in some trades. He said: We should further consolidate and develop the achievements in this work. First, we should continue the great efforts in checking collection of unwarranted fees. All departments in the municipality should include this in their targets for management and have those in charge hold the responsibility for it. If problems arise, those in charge of the pertinent departments should be held accountable. Second, we should do a better job in severing the ties between party and government organs and the economic entities they run and make sure that this work is by and large completed by the end of June this year. Third, we should continue efforts to check the unhealthy trend of travelling to outside the country (the border) with public funds. Fourth, we should do a better job in reducing the burdens on peasants and never restore the unreasonable burdens that have been canceled as stipulated in explicit orders. Li Shenglin pointed out: We should thoroughly and effectively correct these three unhealthy trends in line with the new requirements of the central authorities. All departments and units should make specific arrangements based on their reality. We should coordinate this work with leading cadres' endeavor to remain honesty and self-disciplined, with the endeavor to do practical work for enterprises and their workers, and with the endeavor to educate cadres on professional ethics and the awareness in the legal system. We must never allow continuous emergence of the unhealthy trends or refusal to correct them, still less must we allow retaliation against the enterprises and individuals who have reported problems.
