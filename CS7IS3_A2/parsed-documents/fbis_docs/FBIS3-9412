The diplomatic and press circles were already conducting such analyses, although the "pax Americana" for Bosnia was not taken for granted, even less so as a definitive solution. These analyses evince an almost undivided view that hardly any good could come from this for the E.U., providing the U.S.-Russian initiative brings peace to Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia. The fact that it lacked the strength, unity and skill to resolve the problem of the former Yugoslavia, not only confirmed a lack of unified E.U. policy, but could well be the seed undermining the Maastricht creation, which aspired to well-nigh turn into a federal state by the turn of the century. As European Commission President Jacques Delors set out, the case of former Yugoslavia could "Balkanize" the E.U. itself. This "seed" of different interests in the E.U. ranks went back to the time of the beginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Today, even some of the E.U. member-states admit that Germany forced the recognition of secessionist Yugoslav republics and that this led to eruption of war. Ironically, at this time, when this drama assumed tragic proportions, life seems to be squaring accounts also with the E.U.: As it played a significant role in breaking up of Yugoslavia, so now the E.U. was forced to watch from a distance someone else building peace. Things were nevertheless not as simple to such a degree as to have us believe that the U.S.-sponsored peace process in Bosnia was unfolding completely without the E.U. It was quite possible that the Americans, aided by the Russians, were working in favor of one of the E.U. members, which at first wanted to place under its "umbrella" the entire Bosnia, and now were satisfied with what was possible and realistic, i.e., half of Bosnia. The peace process, which was yet to be joined by the Serbs, would show where this U.S.-Russian peace was going and what links its strived to establish or sever on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. One thing was, however, rather clear: In the new world order too, if it in fact existed, the dominant role of the super powers remained. At this time and in this case markedly more prominently that of the U.S. than Russia, but undoubtedly of both. The European Union would have to by all means draw the conclusions from this.
