The House is of the view that the historic speech by His Majesty King Husayn on completing the first phase of the third Hashemite restoration of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of Rock has again emphasized Jordan's firm pan-Arab policy on the Palestinian cause, the peace plan, and Arab and humanitarian issues. The House expresses its full support for the Jordanian position on the concept of a just peace in the region, based on the rights of the Palestinians in their Palestinian homeland and the return of Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem, in harmony with international legitimacy and human rights. The House of Representatives reiterates its rejection and utter denunciation of any Israeli or Western accusations or threats under the pretext of supporting what Israel calls terrorism, and holds the Israeli Government responsible for the results of hindering the peace and stalling the implementation of the UN resolutions known the world over, and and circumventing these resolutions by exploiting U.S. support for it and the weakness of the Arab position and Arab coordination. The House expresses its strong support for the struggle and steadfastness of the Palestinian Arab people in their legitimate defense of their land and rights and stresses its stand by our Palestinian people in their just struggle and jihad, which is guaranteed by all international norms and agreements, the Geneva Conventions, and human rights charter. The House highly appreciates His Majesty King Husayn's personal backing for the restoration of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock and values his majesty's efforts to preserve the Arab city of Jerusalem, the symbol of peace, and the Muslim and Christian holy places in it, from any tampering whatsoever. The House also expresses its denunciation and condemnation of the continuous U.S. aggression against the Arab nation, represented by the continuing unjust U.S. blockade on the Gulf of Aqaba with the aim of putting all kinds of pressure on steadfast Jordan, to deny it the freedom of national choice, to compel it to abandon its firm pan-Arab policies, and force it to sign a separate peace with Israel in order to serve the Israeli and U.S. objectives of controlling the region and its wealth. The House voices its denunciation of the U.S. blockade against the fraternal people of Iraq and the continuing denial of food and medicine to Iraq.
