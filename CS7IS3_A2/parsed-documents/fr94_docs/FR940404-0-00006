FR940404-0-00006 FR940404-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;03; Amendment 39&hyph;8863, AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CT58 Series Turboshaft Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CT58&hyph;110 and &hyph;140 series turboshaft engines. This action supersedes priority letter AD 93&hyph;10&hyph;09 that currently requires inspection of the forward and aft cooling plate locating groove or channel (rabbet groove) of stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels for cracks and minimum radii, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable turbine wheels. In addition, that AD reduces the cyclic life limit of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels based on the cycles since new and the rabbet groove radius. This action retains the inspection requirements of the current priority letter AD, but adds an additional eddy current inspection of the stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels, accelerates the inspection schedule, reduces the cyclic life limit of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels below the published limits and those imposed by the priority letter AD, and provides for the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels. This amendment is prompted by an extensive analytical study performed by GE as a result of an uncontained stage 2 turbine wheel failure on a GE Model CT58&hyph;140&hyph;1 turboshaft engine. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective April 19, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 19, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;03, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Company, 1000 Western Ave., Lynn, MA 01910. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Ganley, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7138; fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 20, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued priority letter airworthiness directive (AD) 93&hyph;10&hyph;09, applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CT58 series turboshaft engines, which requires inspection of the forward and aft cooling plate locating rabbet groove or channel of stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels for cracks and minimum radii, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable turbine wheels. In addition, that AD reduces the cyclic life limit of stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels to 4,200 cycles since new (CSN) for wheels with 3,000 or less CSN on the effective date of that AD, and that, upon inspection, have a rabbet groove radius of less than 0.010 inches. That action was prompted by an investigation into a stage 2 uncontained turbine wheel failure on a GE Model CT58&hyph;140&hyph;1 turboshaft engine. That condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.
