Vogel in Tunis: "'Arafat Increasingly Under Pressure From PLO Grass Roots"] [Text] When PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat convened a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee after the massacre in Hebron, only eight of 18 members came to Tunis. From Amman Sulayman al-Najab, secretary general of the formerly communist "Palestinian People's Party," let it be known that the Executive Committee had "not achieved a quorum" and was incapable of coming to a decision. Previously, al-Najab had been one of the advocates of the Oslo agreement, even though he was not one of the closest friends of 'Arafat's, whose leadership style he increasingly disapproved of. He finally distanced himself from 'Arafat when the PLO chairman initialed an interim agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 10 February. The formula, which 'Arafat agreed to at that time -- special protection of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, in return for Israeli-Palestinian control of the border-checkpoints between Jericho and Jordan as well as Gaza and Egypt -- "means a new prison for Palestinians," al-Najab told DER STANDARD. However, 'Arafat has not just lost followers. Some of his former critics have jointed him in these difficult days. One of them is "Foreign Minister" Faruq Qaddumi. In December he had listed the weaknesses of the Oslo agreement. Now he fully supports his chief. Marwan Kanathani, 'Arafat's press spokesman, says that there is a certain temptation for his boss to stop the negotiations: "If 'Arafat were to say that this entire damned process is over, he would become absolutely the most popular person among the Arabs again." And "if 'Arafat were to feel that he is losing control over the PLO leadership and the Palestinian people, he will do everything to remain in power. This includes a freezing of the peace process."
