SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in the meeting said the responsibility of the SDPJ as a member of the coalition parties is great. He asked for cooperation of the party members, saying the party must be resolved to answer the expectations of the people on pending political issues. Chairman Murayama said he will not think about resigning but will continue to lead the party. He said the party leadership will continue efforts to have the bills approved in the current Diet session. In talks with coalition member parties and in discussions in the joint conference of two houses of the Diet, he said, his party will continue to insist that the prevention of political corruption should be the main theme in the political reform. The party Central Executives Council in the meeting today decided the upper house members who voted against the political reform bills should be strictly disciplined. The leaders of the SDPJ group in the upper house also met today, and decided to urge four of the rebel members, who belong to the SDPJ's upper house floor group but are not formally affiliated with the SDPJ, to leave the group. Regarding the rebels who are formal members of the party, the leaders agreed to request the party Central Executives Council to consider dismissing them from the party. The council will make a decision on whether to remove them from the party's upper house pact by 27 January. Meanwhile, in the SDPJ Kanagawa Prefecture chapter, officials of the chapter decided to resign en masse, taking responsibility for a SDPJ upper house member from the chapter voting against the bills. Apparently, the impact from differences over ways of dealing with the reform bills is sending ripples to local chapters as well. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata gave a speech at Fukuoka City today. Speaking about how he thinks the political reform bills should be handled, he said he cannot accept any proposal to limit the reform to that aimed only at preventing corruption. Noting some people are talking about enacting only the bill relating to political corruption, he said if these people are serious about the political reform, they would not be saying such a thing. In the speech, Hata claimed the cause of the political corruption problem lies in the current election system enabling political parties to field many candidates in each of the electoral districts, thus forcing the parties to use so much money in campaigns. As long as that issue remains unresolved, the political scenes will never change, he insisted. He thus made it clear that he will not accept the idea of narrowing the reform efforts to only those concerning corruption as now being talked about by the Liberal Democratic Party and some of the SDPJ members. Regarding the possibility of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosoakwa's assuming political responsibility in case the political bills fail to be passed by the Diet in the current session, Foreign Minister Hata noted that public opinion polls showed more than 50 percent of the people support his cabinet. If Hosokawa decides to do that, Hata said, it will only incur the anger of the people. Each and every member of the Diet should be held responsible for this situation, he insisted. Within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], in the mean time, there are now growing voices that the bill on prevention of corruption should be acted on first. But there are also some who think a compromise plan should be worked out in the joint conference of the two houses. Ryutaro Hashitomo, chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, spoke in Nayoro City, Hokkaido, about the political reform bills, and said Prime Minister Hosokawa and all the cabinet members should think where the problem lies. He said he wants them to feel responsible about the abusive way they run the Diet and about their dialogue intended as only a show performance. Noting that it is clear that the political reform bills cannot be passed as they are now, Hashimoto urged the government to change its way of thinking. Hashimoto indicated he wants to be cautious in responding to proposed talks with the coalition to discuss a new compromise. Meanwhile, Keizo Obuchi, former general secretary of the LDP, who heads the Obuchi faction, delivered a speech in Gunma Prefecture. According to him, a general agreement by members of both houses in the Diet must be a precondition to holding the talks to discuss a compromise plan. He said the party should be cautious about agreeing to a compromise plan. Another LDP leader -- former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe -- spoke in a commercial television program this afternoon, and said the polical reforms should start from measures on preventing corruption and controlling political funds. He insisted that enough time must be given to discussions on the political reform. In another scene, the group of the LDP members supporting the political reform -- the Dietmen's Union for Promotion of Political Reform -- decided to launch a signature collection campaign within the party in a call to urge the party leadership to positively participate in the joint conference of the two houses to come up with a new compromise plan.
