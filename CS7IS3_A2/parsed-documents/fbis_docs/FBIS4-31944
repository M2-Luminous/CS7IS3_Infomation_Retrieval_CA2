Yesterday, he briefed correspondents on his new political movement, New Slovakia [Nove Slovensko] (established on 6 May 1994), whose aim is to reverse the unfavorable development and to renew the citizen's faith in the legislative and executive bodies. The New Slovakia movement acknowledges the basic principles of modern liberalism, founded on the inviolability of democratic values, and affirms an effective market economy that provides social guarantees. The movement will join the preelection campaign and is counting on getting into parliament. So far, it is represented in about half of the districts in the Slovak Republic.
