Slowness in the processing of the information has resulted in the fact that the data as of 1 January 1994 (with the final turnovers, which is fundamentally important) have become known only recently. Analysis of the state of affairs of the banks of the "first 100" and of the "first 20" has allowed economist MIKHAIL DELYAGIN to draw a number of interesting conclusions: about the reduction of the concentration of assets in the largest banks (which means a growth of competition in the banking sector), about the continuing rise of Moscow as a financial center and about the rearrangements in the upper echelons of the banking community, the esence of which is in the relative weakening of the "whales" among the former specialized banks and the rise of young "tigers" based on trading and financial-industrial groups. The first thing that needs to be noted is that all the ratings of commercial banks being published, regardless of the procedures being used, are rather arbitrary. Moreover, because of the unwillingness of a number of large banks to submit information about themselves all ratings are incomplete. One can somewhat reduce the indeterminacy that occurs in the process, in our opinion, by examining only the very top of the banking "pyramid"--the very large general-purpose banks which already have gained considerable weight. According to the latest data, the dividing line of this "top" can, again with a certain amount of arbitrariness, be drawn under the first 20 banks, the assets of which have exceeded the half a trillion ruble boundary. The probability that any of them suddenly "will sink into insignificantness" is small: these banks are already able to not fear either a private nor a state criminal racket. That is why it makes good sense to consider the situation of the first 100 and first 20 banks in parallel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Share of the Assets of the 20 Largest Banks in the Aggregate Assets o-| |f the Banks of Russia | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Position |Name |Share in the Assets of Russia's Banking Sys-| | | |tem () | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | |1 Jan 93 |1 Jul 93 |1 Jan 94 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.

In practice this signifies a certain levelling-out of the forces of the commercial banks and the strengthening of competition. Thus, if on 1 January the 100 largest banks of Russia (not counting the largest bank--Vneshtorgbank RF [Russian Federation Foreign Trade Bank]) represented 5.8 percent of their total number and had 60.6 percent of the banking system's assets, then on 1 July the indicators mentioned came to 5.4 percent and 71 percent respectively, and on 1 January 1994--4.95 percent and about 56 percent (in the last two cases--already taking the Russian Federation Foreign Trade Bank into account). The tendency towards a decline in the level of concentration of bank assets for the first 20 banks is even more noticeable: as of 1 January 1993 their number and assets came to 1.2 and 40.3 percent of the total amount respectively (not counting the Foreign Trade Bank), as of July--1.1 and 63 percent, and as of 1 January 1994--1.0 and 38 percent. However, as the quantitative concentration has decreased, a regional concentration is occurring, primarily around Moscow. Some 38 Moscow banks were among the first 100 as of 1 January 1993, including 13 in the first 20. As of 1 July the "Moscow presence" had increased to 39 and 16 respectively. As of 1 January 1994 Moscow banks represented almost half of Russia's largest banks (47) and completely made up "the upper 20" by themselves. There are no financial centers in Russia comparable to Moscow. The greatest number of banks that have been part of the "upper 100" from other cities--three each--are registered in Saint Petersburg, Ufa, Chelyabinsk and Krasnodar. Ufa should be especially noted. Based on certain characteristics Bashkortostan is becoming one of the most dynamic and attractive centers of Russia. It is altogether not without reason that the Union of Swiss Banks has chosen precisely it for the setting-up and practical realization of a clearing system of mutual settlements based on the most up-to-date technologies. The table cited briefly illustrates the recent past of these banks. The Rossiyskiy kredit bank, which has climbed from 63rd to eighth place in the bank table of rank during the year, has achieved the most rapid take-off. Its leadership realized almost before all the rest the strategic advantages of a large charter fund and concentrated its efforts on increasing the latter even prior to the introduction of the open currency position, when this was at variance with its current business interests. Most-bank, which jumped from 77th place to 19th in six months, is close to repeating Rossiyskiy kredit's "record." This bank's success is to be explained in many respects by its support by a powerful financial-industrial group. By and large precisely the banks created by large financial-industrial or trading structures were the most dynamic in 1993. Apart from Most-bank their number includes Alfa-bank, which has stepped right away from beyond the limits of the first 100 to 26th place, Neftekhimbank, Avtobank, and, certainly, Natsionalnyy kredit bank. The undoubted success of Sberbank (Savings Bank) should also be noted. The share of the population's deposits in Sberbank has dropped by a third during the past year--from 90 to 60 percent of their total volume--but the bank has been able not only to compensate for the losses incurred but also to strengthen its position--apparently through the activization of directions of activity that are not traditional for it, primarily the expansion of currency operations and operations on the inter-bank loans market. Such large and well-known banks as Inkombank and MENATEP are moving steadily upwards. However, reputation bears fruit only in combination with aggressive marketing. Otherwise, the fate of recent leaders, which are slowly but steadily being pushed aside, would have befallen these banks. The latter include Agroprombank, Mosbiznesbank, TOKObank, Moskovskiy industrialnyy bank (MIB), Kredobank and Unikombank, not to mention those which have vacated the "top 20," among which Elektrobank, which has slipped from 11th place to 23rd in 1993, as well as Agroprombank from Rostov-on-Don and Chelindbank, especially stood out. At the same time it is for now too early to say that the trend towards the relative weakening of the former specialized banks being observed in the "first 20" is also true for the Russian provinces.
