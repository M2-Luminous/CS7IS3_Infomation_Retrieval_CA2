The main political bloc within the Chamber of Deputies, the socialist bloc, is adhering to the parliamentary plan waiting to be ratified in the Senate of the Republic. Daly Valet who had an interview with the president of the socialist bloc, Deputy Duly Brutus, tells us more: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The Easter season had a calming effect on all the political sectors that were pressuring the parliament to implement Article 149 and close the file on the 16 December [1991] president. The Easter season has ended and the political battle has resumed. No new solution has been proposed. The same ideas are being discussed. The political leaders are ruminating over the same proposals. Thus, the plan of the Action Committee for National Reconciliation, the Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress, and the Mobilization for National Development, which have formed an alliance, has a chance of being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies this week. This plan, which provides for the formation of an ad hoc government, has every chance of being rejected in the Chamber of Deputies because the principal political blocs remain attached to the parliamentary plan that was approved by the Chamber. On that score, the position of the president of the socialist bloc is quite clear. [Brutus] As president of the socialist bloc, I can tell you that for the time being, our position remains unchanged. [passage omitted] Our position remains the same; that is, we are supporting the plan that was accepted in Washington among parliamentarians and was ratified in the Chamber of Deputies. [Valet] The U.S. Government's arbitrary position, that is, involving itself in getting a plan signed that it will later boycott, has caused some parliamentarians to be apprehensive. These parliamentarians say they cannot understand why the U.S. Government says it supports the parliamentary plan, but has proposed a new plan called the synchronous plan. But in the opinion of other parliamentarians, like Duly Brutus, there is not much difference between the parliamentary plan and the U.S. plan. If there is any difference, the deputy says, it is in the way the two plans have been written and in their length. [passage omitted] [end recording]
