Said Saadi has recently set up a new movement, the Movement for the Republic [Mouvement pour la Republique] in order to advocate an ideal that is different from that of the Islamists. [passage omitted] [Pomponne] You are a priori rather against a dialogue with Islamists who are said to be moderate. [Saadi] I do not know many. Those said to be moderate have aligned themselves with the stance of the extremists; it is a movement of extremists that falls within the framework of violence and is a movement that necessarily tends toward one-upmanship. Anyone who wants to be relatively moderate is condemned by the very dynamism of this movement. Kebir, who was said to be the soft version of the fundamentalist movement has recently been obliged to join the stances of armed groups in order to stay in the race. It is not I who reject the debate, unfortunately it is the fundamentalists, who, for the moment, slit throats and kill, and it is the only form of communication they choose to address the people. It cuts short any form of speculation. Dialogue is a will to respect the life of others first and their ideas second. This has never been the intention of fundamentalists. [Pomponne] Is this the way you analyze, for instance, the communique published by the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] recently, which advocates the continuation of the armed struggle? [Saadi] This communique has only one interest: It is the first time that the FIS, which was said to be a political organization, that up to now has not followed armed action and acts of violence in general, has ended up by advocating this bloody demonstration that it has imposed on the country. I personally have never believed in the slightest possibility of an organized evolution of the FIS, even as political authorities. I was often in prison with them, I know all their officials, and I know exactly what they are planning to do. [passage omitted] [Pomponne] You said that you think that the Army could play a more important role. According to you, what is the role it must and can play? [Saadi] I have not said that the Army could play a more important role. The Army already plays an important role and has been doing so since 1962, the date of independence. I say that I did not know whether the Army could now adapt to change well, when the matter is not simply a military operation. The Algerian crisis is not military but is above all political. Will the Army take the positions it should in very complicated situations? Will it handle the current situation; knowing that up to now it has already found people who use it as a front, as a political shop window, while keeping power. I do not think that this scenario is now possible. [Pomponne] What do you want it to do? [Saadi] That the Army remains a republican institution that shoulders completely the republican state whose institutions it has the duty to defend and not to make.
