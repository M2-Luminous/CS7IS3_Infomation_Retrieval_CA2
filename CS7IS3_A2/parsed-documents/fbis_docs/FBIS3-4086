Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the New China Hong Kong Group Ltd., made the remark at a contract-signing ceremony on the building of a four-lane 90-km express highway linking Chengdu, capital of south-west China's Sichuan Province, with Mianyang city. Tsui is also a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and an adviser on Hong Kong affairs to the State Council, China's highest governing body. The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the nearly 1.4 billion yuan (about 160.9 million U.S. dollars) total cost of the freeway project, which is the largest cooperative project between Sichuan and overseas investors. Tsui was of the view that at present most overseas businessmen tend to put their money into China's coastal areas, and into the real estate sector in particular, and that such an investment pattern is improper anyway. It will only result in greater discrepancies between rich and poor areas. He believed that responsible and farsighted industrialists had better invest in China's broad inland areas to improve local infrastructure facilities by building more highways, ports and similar facilities, and they would certainly get profitable returns. Taking Sichuan as an example, Tsui said that the province has a population of more than 100 million, and its annual retail sales total is only next to Guangdong, one of the economically booming provinces in China. In addition, Sichuan has abundant mineral resources and various other products, together with an industrial, scientific and technological might. An upgraded infrastructure would certainly lead to the province's fast economic growth. Previously, Mr. Tsui has established an automobile company and an investment and development company in Sichuan Province, both of which are running well. He said that while investing more in the inland areas of China, he will also motivate more other overseas funds to these areas. Together with Tsui, an inspection group of some 70 people, including 15 representatives of large Hong Kong banking firms, showed great interest in investing here.
