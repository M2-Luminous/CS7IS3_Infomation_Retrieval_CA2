Professor V. Yakovlev, former deputy of the Moldovan Parliament known for his orthodox communist views, is the leader of the union. V. Yakovlev and representatives of other political organizations opposed the promotion of market economic reforms in Dniester and the introduction of private ownership of land and privatization in general. Appeals to restore the Soviet Union could be heard during the rally. Yakovlev declared that recently an initiative group had been created to bring about the creation of a union of unrecognized states. It is assumed that alongside Dniester, Abkhazia, Karabakh and another breakaway regions will be members of this union. The rally attracted about 1,000 people, most of whom were elderly. People carried red flags and sang the USSR's anthem. Local observers note that the rally was not obstructed by militia although the emergency state prolonged by Igor Smirnov [Dniester president] forbids such manifestations.
