Yesterday, the president was very clear when he called on all participants in the conflict to sit down and negotiate by Monday at the latest and agree on a solution to all problems and conflicts that could worsen the already tense situation in Chiapas State. Nevertheless, aside from the negotiations which will take place on Monday and which have caught the attention of the entire country, something else occurred today that has caused a great stir. Francisco Martin Moreno, a journalist and the author of "Mexico Negro" and "La Disculpa," today published on EXCELSIOR's frontpage an article entitled: "The Reason I Resigned: The Rules of the Political Game." In this article in today's edition of EXCELSIOR, Francisco Martin Moreno, without mentioning any names -- this must be made clear -- and always writing in the first person, as if it were a letter, says: It has been said that the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State has decided to resign from his post for the following reasons: 1. His peace efforts have been considered a factor of political distortion, which affected the candidacy of Luis Donaldo Colosio and could do the same to the candidacy of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 2. It also has been said, according to Francisco Martin Moreno's article, that he garnered more headlines than the PRI's [Institutional Revolutionary Party] very own presidential campaign, thereby hurting his party and Mexico. The author continues by explaining that if this was indeed the case, it was because events in Chiapas State monopolized the attention of all Mexicans. 3. Nearly a month after he was considered a political cadaver, he is still said to harbor ulterior motives in his dialogue with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. In this connection, Martin Moreno explains in his article, which is fiction [de ficcion], that it has been perversely said that the peace commissioner resisted resigning in the hope that an electoral triumph by the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] on 21 August would create the possibility of a provisional presidency that would require special elections in which the winner could be the peace commissioner. Martin Moreno says that for this reason, the resignation was needed to demonstrate that the peace commissioner in Chiapas was not attempting to take advantage of a post-elections conflict. The peace commissioner supposedly said, according to Francisco Martin Moreno in this fictitous article, that on two occasions he lost his candidacy for presidency by playing by the rules of the game of Mexican politics, even though he cannot stop asking himself why it was not him instead of Colosio in the first place, and later, instead of Zedillo. For all of the above reasons, says Francisco Martin Moreno's article in EXCELSIOR, the peace commissioner reflected and arrived at the conclusion of presenting his alleged resignation to avoid that his name destabilize and encourage uncertainty within the PRI. This is the end of a brief summary of the article that appears today on EXCELSIOR's frontpage, which, as we said at the beginning, Manuel Camacho Solis' name is never mentioned, even though it is perfectly clear that it is a hypothetical resignation, which Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, should present. This article is by Franciso Martin Moreno, who, you will recall was among other things our consul in Barcelona. Francisco Martin Moreno was a Finance and Public Credit Secretariat official, until one day he decided to leave everything for peace and do what he likes best -- to write and investigate. He became a full-time investigator. This yielded, among other important works, his book called "Mexico Negro," where he tells all about the black history of Mexico's oil, and everything that Lazaro Cardenas' had to do with oil expropriations and the oppressive actions of the so-called Seven Sisters -- those companies that exerted pressure on the Mexican Government from all sides -- both politically and economically. "Mexico Negro" is a splendid book and a splendid bit of investigative work carried out by Francisco Martin Moreno -- a man who was a bureaucrat and became an intellectual. Now, Francisco, a man I hold in high esteeem and respect because he is my friend, published in the EXCELSIOR newspaper this alleged resignation by Manuel Camacho, and all hell has broken loose. Juan Carlos, how are you? [Santoyo] Good afternoon. You are right, an uproar has been created, and naturally there is reaction. Of course, Camacho Solis has reacted. He is here in San Cristobal de las Casas, and today he met privately with San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz. Since the start, the question was: What about the letter? Was it his? In the beginning, he did not want to say anything. Later, he said he did indeed have something to say, and this is what he said: [Begin Camacho recording] Someone told me about an article that outlined my reasons for resigning. This person then asked me: Are you resigning from the commission? The article, however, was not signed by me, but by Francisco Martin Moreno, a friend of mine. We are dealing with an editorial written by someone else -- someone who, by the way, writes very well and is an intelligent man. I will comment on the article, because it may represent the opinion of not only Francisco, but also of someone else. It is very worrisome to me that at this stage there are still people who are unaware of what is going on in the state of Chiapas. The negotiation process in the state of Chiapas is being taken lightly. [end recording] [Santoyo] Camacho also said: The situation in Chiapas has not yet been settled. The deep-rooted causes of the problem are still there. We are still not in a position to determine terms for resuming the talks. Camacho, smiling and at ease, also said: Casting doubts on the dialogue process would be politically irresponsible. [Begin Camacho recording] The problem has not been resolved. The deep-rooted causes of the problem are still there. We cannot even determine terms for resuming the talks. Casting doubts on the dialogue process would constitute political irresponsibility, which, fortunately, is not shared by any of the country's political forces -- all of which have backed the negotiations. This position also is not shared by Dr. Zedillo, who summed up this subject and offered full support for the negotiations process. Neither is this position shared by the Catholic Church, which supports the efforts to resume the talks, or intellectuals, or members of civilian society. Francisco's opinion must be respected, as must every writer's opinion, but I am concerned about such a cursory analysis of what is going in Chiapas. [end recording] [Santoyo] Camacho continued: First of all, let us see how the talks will be resumed. If we succeed in resuming the talks, that would be good news for the entire country. Moreover, I think this is the time to figure out what is truly important in Mexico. Camacho said there are two basic concepts in Mexico: first, to promote peace and uphold public opinion; and second, to continue to nurture democracy. These two things go hand in hand. I will continue to work on these things from my humble home in San Cristobal de las Casas, Camacho concluded.
