These illusions, which vanish almost as soon as they are born, constitute the basis of new worries that emerge before the international community on the future of the world and the danger of the so-called globalization of politics. This is a sort of pretension establishing that everyone must act the same in accordance with a predetermined script. Those objectives, evidently, were always behind the phrase "the new world order." The United Nations, with its current 184 members, could not remain detached from this new trend in international politics, and soon the practical results of this trend began to be applied in the United Nations. Perhaps, the first warning signal to UN members came from the Security Council, one of the seven main UN bodies, whose major responsibility, according to the Charter adopted in 1945, is to look after the preservation of international peace and security. The true symptoms of the practical implementation of the new order include the lack of transparency in its endeavors, the schematization, the routine in the reports of the General Assembly, the unofficial consultations behind closed doors among its 15 members, and an increase in peace-keeping operations. The leading complaints made by most countries, especially those in the Third World, revolve around three aspects: an increase in the number of Council members, the elimination or the limitation of the use of the right to veto, and a greater transparency in its decisions and interrelation with the General Assembly. These grievances might appear fair and -- why not -- even modest to anyone. A task force, however, created by the General Assembly to analyze all aspects related to perfecting the United Nations, is involved in a new "diplomatic" battle, as many have labelled the situation, a battle consisting of smiling in public, playing with words in speeches, and lobbying intensely among those with kindred thoughts to impose ideas. None of the five current permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, Russia, France, China, and the United Kingdom) is willing to relinquish their right to veto, judging from their discussions, although the advocates of a more democratic new world order, as they are recommending, are among them. There is more. While they agree with the rest of the world on an eventual increase in the number of members, they argue that, for the sake of the organization's efficiency, no more than three countries should be added. They are firmly favoring Germany and Japan. At least, they are suggesting that the selection take place through the so-called kindred groups, a category aimed at eliminating the effectiveness of existing regional groups and also at undoing the principle of equitable representation by geographic areas at every UN specialized agency. As for the veto, many Third World countries are proposing to limit its use to cases related to very relevant issues only. For instance, Mexico advocated limiting its use to the imposition of penalties to those countries that violate international order. There are even countries that propose adopting a mechanism consisting of two vetoes in order to block a resolution. The U.S. position is clear. Karl Inderfurth, alternate permanent representative, recently said he is convinced the current status quo of permanent members should remain the same, even the right to veto. As for the suggestions to curtail or regulate this privilege, he emphasized that the use of two vetoes, as well as the enhancement of procedures under which a veto is unenforceable, are unwise solutions to nonexisting problems. In all these discussions, two Latin American countries, namely Mexico and Cuba, have maintained clear positions in harmony with the opinions of the majority, which favors democratic changes within the UN. Ambassador Victor Flores Olea, permanent Mexican representative, has been permanently active in the task force. He pointed out that the original political circumstances that created the right to veto were already surmounted; this is why we cannot make the same mistake of granting this right to potential new Security Council members. Both Mexico and Cuba agree it is time to eliminate the Council's provisional and operational guidelines in effect for the past 50 years and support the adoption of permanent statutes, including proposals for procedural reforms and methods of work. To that effect and due to the increasing number of issues being discussed at the Council, many state-members are questioning the ever-increasing use of the closed-door method of dealing with unofficial issues. This situation is leading the rest of the UN members to have a limited knowledge of transcendental peace-keeping and international security issues, because secrecy and covert agreements have become the rule. Mexico and Cuba maintain that, by opening new channels of communication with other UN members and by devising new mechanisms for their participation, the Council's authority will be enhanced and the states will feel truly committed to and responsible for the Council's decisions. The growing trend among the Council members to adopt strong measures -- as stipulated in Chapter VII of the UN Charter for matters that threaten peace and international security, thus failing to exhaust the mechanisms for peaceful solutions to conflicts, as stipulated in Chapter VI -- is also worrisome. This is why the United States is more inclined to deploy troops to the four corners of the earth and to resort to military operations -- an image very removed from the principles upon which the United Nations was instituted, precisely as a result of the end of the 1945 military actions. It is still not uncommon to listen to hard-line lingo uttered by some representatives of large countries, even from permanent members of the Security Council, without exhausting the arsenal of recommendations stipulated by the Charter to seek bargained solutions. This behavior proves we are far away from realizing the beautifully depicted dreams of the post-Cold War world. Seeking equality and the democratic enforcement of international law is also a UN goal. For the time being, it is difficult to forecast how the Security Council will be redesigned to align itself with the reality of our times. It is very clear, however, the path to accomplish this goal is not exactly a bed of roses.
