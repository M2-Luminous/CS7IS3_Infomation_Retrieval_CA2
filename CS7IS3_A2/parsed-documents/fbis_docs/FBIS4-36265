FBIS4-36265 "drnes110_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Transportation Dispute Results in U.S. Sanctions Transportation Dispute Results in U.S. Sanctions TA0606171694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 6 Jun 94 p A6 TA0606171694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by tourism affairs correspondent Ilan Shehori] [Excerpts] Senior Transportation Ministry officials are examining the possibility of abrogating the present aviation agreement between Israel and the United States and demanding that a new aviation agreement be negotiated with the Americans. The sources claim that the conditions of the present agreement discriminate against Israel and enable the Americans to carry out an unlimited number of flights to Israel. Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar yesterday held an emergency meeting after U.S. aviation authorities announced their decision to implement sanctions against Israel by canceling three weekly El Al flights to the United States starting two weeks from today. This will reduce the number of weekly El Al flights to the United States from 20 to 17. U.S. aviation authorities also plan to ban El Al from flying to various destinations inside the United States. The Americans announced their intention to impose sanctions against Israel after the Israeli Transportation Ministry refused the request of U.S. airline World Airways to hold three regular weekly flights on the New York-Tel Aviv line. Qeysar summoned El Al director general Rafi Harlev and the heads of the Civil Aviation Administration to the consultation. The ministry's legal adviser also attended the meeting. In the meeting, Minister Qeysar sharply criticized the manner in which Israel was informed about the sanctions against El Al. He said that last week a representative of the American airline came to his Knesset office, and that even before he was able to brief the airline management about his meeting with Qeysar, the U.S. Department of Transportation decided to announce sanctions against El Al. Following the consultation Qeysar decided to send a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena requesting that, in accordance with U.S. law, a 30-day extension be granted before the sanctions against El Al are implemented. The same law states that another 60-day extension is possible before sanctions are implemented. [passage omitted] The transportation minister will travel to the United States for talks with the U.S. transportation secretary and other senior administration officials late this month. In these meetings Qeysar will apparently demand that the current Israel-American aviation agreement be abrogated. [passage omitted] Qeysar said yesterday: "Approximately two weeks ago the U.S. transportation secretary and myself agreed that no steps be taken against El Al until our meeting in Washington late this month, but unfortunately this did not help." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 6 June carries a recorded passage of Minister Qeysar answering a question about the dispute with World Airways, in which he says that "we are now negotiating to find some compromise. We just finished a conversation overseas with the representative of World Airways, and we are going to reach a compromise. We don't want any war with the Americans, because they are our best allies. We have no reason to have a conflict with the Americans."] [passage omitted]
