These are the production of the rocket for launching the Hong Kong communications satellite "Asia-Pacific Number Two", a 70,000-ton cargo ship ordered by Norway and a Pakistan-ordered training aircraft. Export credits needed for the three projects are estimated at some 500 million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars). According to IEBC President Lie Zuhua, the bank has met strong demand from domestic big machinery producers for export credits since its founding two months ago. So far it has received formal applications for export credits for over sixty items, involving a total of 10 billion yuan. "The strong demand shows the huge potential the domestic machinery industries hold for export," said Lie. "But it has also placed our bank in a bind." Although the bank was set up to boost China's exports of machinery products by providing low-interest rate loans to the producers, its credit line for the whole of 1994 is limited to between 2 billion yuan and 3 billion yuan. The bank has a registered capital of 3.38 billion yuan. But the funds will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance in several batches during the next couple of years. The fund gap will be filled by bonds issued to domestic financial institutions and on the international capital market. Lie said that preparations are in hand for the first issue of one billion to 1.7 billion yuan worth of bonds this year. The bank is not likely to issue bonds overseas this year, Lie noted. China exported large machinery worth of 27.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, a quarter of China's total exports. To cope with the huge demand for export credits, Lie said, the central authorities may in the future allow foreign banks to provide export credits to Chinese exporters. The lending amount will be decided in the light of the government-controlled external debt limit. The Import and Export Bank will then provide credit guarantees for the domestic exporters. The IEBC president noted that as a policy-oriented bank, the new financial house will not be run for profit. In fact, the interest rate on one-year loans by the bank only stands at 9.54 percent, compared with the 13.98 percent rate for the same period loans from commercial banks. To offset the loss, IEBC will gradually expand its business in export credit insurance, credit guarantee and other more lucrative areas, Lie said.
