This was stated by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on the sidelines of a sitting of the Bundesrat defense committee in Warnemuende on Monday [16 May]. Contracts totalling almost a billion marks will be awarded to the construction industry this year for the seven large-scale Bundeswehr projects in eastern Germany, including establishing a marine technology academy in Parow near Stralsund and the planned move of the marine office to Warnemuende. Ruehe also announced that troop numbers would be increased according to plans in the east, increasing from the present 19,200 to 23,000 soldiers and almost 7,000 civilian employees. The figure of 20,000, by which the Bundeswehr is to be cut over the next few years, will mainly be saved in the states of the former West Germany, the defense minister said. [passage omitted]
