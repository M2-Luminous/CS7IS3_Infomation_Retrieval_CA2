FR940304-1-00055 FR940304-1-00011 Furthermore, the concentrations of any hazardous constituents dissolved in the runoff will tend to be lower than the levels in either the TCLP or MEP leachate analyses reported in today's notice, due to the aggressive acid medium used for extraction in the TCLP and MEP tests. The Agency believes that, in general, leachate derived from the waste is unlikely to directly enter a surface water body without first travelling through the saturated subsurface zone where further dilution and attenuation of hazardous constituents will also occur. Significant releases to surface water through erosion and runoff of landfilled BSC's waste are unlikely due to the solidified concrete form of the waste. Furthermore, in the unlikely event that BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake reached surface water, the stabilized form of the waste would mitigate any impact. Leachable concentrations provide a direct measure of the solubility of a toxic constituent in water, and are indicative of the fraction of the constituent that may be mobilized in surface water, as well as ground water. The reported TCLP and MEP extraction data show that the metals in BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake are essentially immobile in aqueous solution. For example, the maximum leachable chromium level was 0.10 ppm, which is less than 0.0002% of the chromium present in BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake. Therefore, BSC's waste that might be released to surface water would be likely to remain undissolved. Finally, any transported constituents would be further diluted in the receiving surface water body due to relatively large flows of the streams/rivers of concern. Based on the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that contamination of surface water through run-off from the waste disposal area is very unlikely. Nevertheless, the Agency evaluated potential impacts on surface water if BSC's waste were released from a municipal solid waste landfill through run off and erosion (see the docket for today's proposed rule). The estimated levels of the hazardous constituents of concern in surface water would be well below health-based levels for human health, as well as below the EPA Chronic Water Quality Criteria for aquatic organisms (USEPA, OWRS, 1987). The Agency, therefore, concluded that BSC's chemically stabilized waste is not a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and environment via the surface water exposure pathway. E. Conclusion The Agency believes that BSC's descriptions of its stabilization process and its characterization of waste composition, in conjunction with the proposed delisting testing requirements, provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the petitioned waste will be substantially reduced, and thus, that BSC's petition for an upfront conditional exclusion should be granted. The Agency believes that the sampling procedures used by BSC were adequate, and that the samples are representative of the day-to-day variations in constituent concentrations found in the stabilized filter cake. The Agency believes that data submitted in support of the petition show that BSC's proposed stabilization process can render the dewatered filter cake immobile and non-hazardous. In addition, under the testing provisions of the conditional exclusion, BSC will be required to re-treat or dispose of as hazardous any batch exhibiting extract levels at or above a specified level ( i.e., ``delisting level'') (see Section F_ Verification Testing Conditions ). The Agency proposes to grant a conditional, upfront exclusion to Bethlehem Steel Corporation, located in Sparrows Point, Maryland, for the stabilized filter cake described in its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. The Agency's decision to exclude this waste is based on process descriptions, characterization of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization process. If the proposed rule is finalized, the petitioned stabilized filter cake, provided the conditions of the exclusion are met, will no longer be subject to regulation under Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of Part 270. F. Verification Testing Conditions As proposed, verification tests are to be conducted in two phases, initial and subsequent. The initial testing requirements apply to at least the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake as described in its petition. Upon approval by EPA, the subsequent testing requirements apply to the stabilized waste generated after the initial verification testing period. The proposed conditions also include an annual testing requirement. If the final exclusion is granted as proposed, BSC will be required both to verify that the treatment system is on-line and operating as described in the petition, and to show that, once on-line, the stabilized filter cake continues to meet the Agency's verification testing limitations ( i.e., ``delisting levels''). These proposed conditions are specific to the upfront exclusion petitioned for by BSC. The Agency may choose to modify these proposed conditions based on comments that may be received during the public comment period for this proposed rule. This proposed exclusion for BSC's stabilized filter cake is conditional upon the following requirements: (1) Testing: Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed according to SW&hyph;846 methodologies. If EPA judges the stabilization process to be effective under the conditions used during the initial verification testing, BSC may replace the testing required in Condition (1)(A) with the testing required in Condition (1)(B). BSC must continue to test as specified in Condition (1)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that testing in Condition (1)(A) may be replaced by Condition (1)(B) (to the extent directed by EPA). (A) Initial Verification Testing: During at least the first eight weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, BSC must collect and analyze weekly composites representative of the stabilized waste. Weekly composites must be composed of representative grab samples collected from every batch during each week of stabilization. The composite samples must be collected and analyzed, prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake, for all constituents listed in Condition (3). BSC must report the analytical test data, including a record of the ratios of lime kiln dust and fly ash used and quality control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 60 days after the collection of the last composite of stabilized filter cake.
