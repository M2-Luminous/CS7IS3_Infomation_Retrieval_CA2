In those years the average annual rate of growth of the gross social product fell from 3.0-3.5 percent to 1.5-1.8 percent. But beginning 1991, the rate of growth became negative (about 5 percent per year), and after 1992 ailments of the crisis came to light with the beginning of the structural, inflationary, and monetary-financial stresses that forced hitherto slumbering sociopolitical forces to stir. The reasons for such a long-term crisis are the internal contradictions of the system of economic management that was built in the years of the Stalin-Brezhnev regime. The crisis became an expression of the disparity between the macrostructure of production and the macrostructure of consumption, the disparity between the proportion of distribution of social capital according to branches and the needs of its productive functioning, disparity in the level of applied technologies in small and large systems and the demands that the modern world economy poses. The crisis bares these disproportions and technological backwardness, and gives society and the nation the chance to engage in a search for a solution and to dismantle an obsolete economy and transform it into a new and highly technological one with a progressive structure. But this is only a chance. The question is how and when we can take advantage of it. For the time being, there is no answer to the first part of the question. The crisis is proceeding as a destructive phenomenon, wrecking enterprises and lowering the standard of living of the population. It is an unprecedented phenomenon in the speed of the drop in production, 9 percent. It is also unprecedented in the depth of the decline (30 percent in these years): This is 1.5 times more than in the great U.S. depression at the end of the 1920's. According to the branch spectrum, the drop in production was highest in the fuel complex (approximately 45 percent, and something like this is fully justified) and in the sphere of everyday services to the population (more than 50 percent). Right after them come light and furniture industries (40 and 37 percent, respectively), and agriculture. This assortment of the most injured branches makes it possible to assume that not only structural disproportions and technological backwardness are to blame for their crash, but also other reasons that do not result from the objective preconditions of the crisis. If we are talking about the consumer goods and services branches, the course of the crisis in them was essentially deepened by a sharp drop in the effective demand of the population. The level of real incomes of the population fell in the last three years by a minimum of 35 percent. But inasmuch as the people's monetary savings practically dwindled (the remaining deposits in banks in real calculations were reduced by a factor of no less than 10-12), the effective demand fell by a factor of two. The population's demand also has a structural cross-section. While up to 1991 the majority of the population had moderately low incomes that basically met the standards of "Soviet" goods and services, by the end of 1993 the majority of the population (most of all the unemployed and those working in state enterprises) began to receive extremely low incomes with which people were not in a position to acquire domestically produced goods. This accelerated the drop in the latter, and commodity turnover began to be filled by high-quality imported products and items intended, however, only for 5-8 percent of the most well-off people in our society. Why did this happen? Why were efforts not made to support the incomes of our fellow citizens and support production and the demand for products, which were not satisfied? Why were there principal failures in these key points of our system? Moreover, as we see, the drop in consumer incomes accelerates the drop in the output of products for the population, and the reduction in goods and services devalues people's money and incomes. In a general case, this may be the answer: The organization of the national economy was not reformed, and the organization of the activity of individual enterprises was not reformed. In the Soviet system, the main direction of financial redistribution was for the benefit of branches of heavy industry. This kind of organization of public financing, in fact, continues to operate right now. Light industry and agricultural branches remain the stepchildren in the family of the state economy. But the organizational backwardness of the enterprises predetermines excessive costs and the need for their noneconomic and nonmarket financing (this is the root of the escalation of inflation). However, there is one more powerful factor. This is the nonequivalence of turnover with countries that are not members of the CIS. The payments balance in this direction is obviously positive. Moreover, a large part of the hard currency earnings of our exporters does not return to Ukraine. This has already been going on for several years. In 1993 only 20 percent of the expected foreign hard currency from exports came into the country. The annual pumping out of billion-dollar sums reduces the possible standard of living of the people by about 15-20 percent. In aggregate, the financial-credit, export-hard currency factors, and the monopolism of the commodity producers incite a price inflation that is unprecedented in postwar Europe (it is higher only in warring Serbia). In 1992 the level of inflation reached 4,000 percent (up by a factor of 40 for the year, averaging 35 percent per month), and in 1993--9,000 percent (up by a factor of 90 for the year--45 percent per month). We will note that in its nature, an economic crisis in the downturn phase (that is, as we have now in Ukraine) lowers the absolute price level, and only relative prices increase. The inflationary dynamics of prices naturally is the dynamics of relative prices. The question arises: How are the crisis and inflation correlated? And does inflation not have an effect on the ability to overcome the economic crisis? If it is taken into account that the inflationary high price dynamic does not permit the implementation of operations to renew fixed capital, not to mention the new construction of industrial or transportation facilities, it becomes clear that inflation is a very serious barrier to structural reorganization in social production on the path to pulling out of the crisis. But if inflation is at an extremely high level (more than 50 percent a month), it is not only a barrier but also an independently operating destructive factor. In completing the picture of the economic crisis in Ukraine, taking into account the hyperinflationary trends, it can be said that the decline in production has still not reached its very lowest magnitude. If it is not possible to defeat hyperinflation, the minimum volume of production in the long-term cyclical crisis we are experiencing will get lower and lower. It is possible to suppose that by balancing between the different interests the current government will be able to maintain average rates of inflation in 1994 at the mark of 55-65 percent per month. Consequently, technological renewal and structural changes will not be started. The introduction of new organizational forms of economic management in enterprises, evidently, should also not be expected from the government of Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy. Under such conditions, stabilization of the volume of production will also become impossible--the drop in the volume of gross domestic product for the year will to all appearances amount to not less than 15-20 percent. Thus, the crisis we are experiencing does not have some kind of "bottom" (a low point in the decline) that is preset in advance. We can achieve stabilization and begin the climb earlier and from a higher point, or later and with an ever lower and lower wrecked "production platform." The role of the Government of Ukraine in curbing or aggravating the breakdown of the economy is becoming increasingly significant. A great deal depends on when the change in today's government will occur and whether its new staff will be capable of starting anticrisis operations. Policy is again a millstone on the economy. However, it is already clear now that the first half of 1994 in any case will inherit the inertia of the preceding period (the very same government strategists are developing the programs and budget). That is, the drop in production and the periodic multiple jumps in prices will continue. In the second half of the year, if the new unified reform budget of the Cabinet of Ministers begins to work, the drop in the volume of production will decrease somewhat (up to 8-10 percent), and inflation can be reduced substantially--by a factor of two to three. In addition, there will be an upswing in wages and pensions. But by the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, the economy should achieve a lower point of decline. After this, stabilization and a rise in production will start. How long the preparations and the beginning of the upswing will take will be determined by the effectiveness of the reforms, and most of all by whether the Ukrainian monetary unit will be convertible and whether privatization of state enterprises will be implemented. It should also be said that not all state enterprises will be able to survive the long-term economic blow (idle capacities, departure of qualified workers, contraction of the assortment of products, and the chronic credit indebtedness against the background of hyperinflation). Some of them will not be restored in their former capacity. This will create the preconditions for high social costs--unemployment and inadequate budget resources for large investment, ecological, or social programs. The government will be obliged to provide for such consequences of the crisis in its programs. As for the private sector, after the economy reaches the low point of the decline, and given price stabilization, it will receive very favorable opportunities for growth in Ukraine. Favorable conditions will be associated with difficulties in the state sector and the absence of competition. For this reason there will be a wide selection of manpower, and low prices for equipment, building, and land parcels. Because of the totally unsettled situation there will not be many foreign investments, and it will be necessary to rely on our own capital. The greatest opportunities will open up for multiprofiled private firms and privatized enterprises that will engage in the acquisition of new markets. Their faster development will also become the main source of the economic upswing in 1995. [begin boxed item] Attention Residents of Kiev and Other Cities!
