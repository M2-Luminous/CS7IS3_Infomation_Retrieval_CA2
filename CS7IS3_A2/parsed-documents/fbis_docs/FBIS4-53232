The major opposition Democratic Party (DP) charged that Kim distorted history by calling the May 16 coup a "military revolution." "It is absurd for the chairman of the DLP, which alleged it succeeded to the spirit of the April 19 Revolution, to say that it succeeded to the May 16 military coup, too," Pak Chi-won, DP spokesman, said. He further said, "Kim's remark was a mockery against history, a deceit against the people and a challenge to President Kim Yong-sam, who concurrently heads the DLP." Saying that the Pak Chong-hui regime self-disintegrated because of inner contradictions of dictatorship, Kim Su-il, spokesman of the splinter United People's Party, said, "Kim Chong-pil should retire from the political world." In a lecture to students in a high school in Seoul Friday, Kim said what he terms the May 16 revolution was planned and carried out to develop the nation's economy above all else as a precondition for enhancing democracy. The late President Pak, then an Army major general, and his military followers including Kim ousted the then democratic government led by Prime Minister John M. Chang through a coup on May 16, 1961, and took power. The Chang government was founded based on the student revolution of April 19, 1660, which overthrew the Syngman Rhee dictatorship. Last November, President Kim, who was inaugurated in February 1993 after about 30 years of authoritarian rule by military general-turned-presidents, defined the May 16 incident as a military coup while the April 19 uprising was termed a revolution.
