Jiang made the remarks during a half-hour meeting with the new French ambassador, Francois Marcel Plaisant, who was presenting his credentials. Plaisant was given the rare privilege of being received privately by the head of state. Normally a brief ceremony is held at which several ambassadors present their credentials at the same time. Paris and Beijing issued a joint statement Wednesday normalising their relations and in which France undertook not to sell arms to Taiwan. Beijing claims sovereignty over the nationalist island. Relations between Paris and Beijing had been in the doldrums for more than 14 months following France's decision to sell Mirage 2000- 5 jets to Taipei. Jiang, who is also general secretary of the communist party, said that he admired French skills in the economic and technology fields, the diplomatic source added. He also evoked the upcoming visit of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to China, expected to take place next month, and an official visit to France by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Qian is currently on a tour of east Africa and is expected to visit Paris at the end of January.
