[passage omitted] Jose Manuel Martin Meden reports on this visit: [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] Menem arrives in Madrid with his political horizon clear after the agreement with the opposition for a constitutional reform that will enable him to be re-elected and to govern until the year 2000 if he wins a majority in 1995. In statements for Radiotelevision Espanola, the president of Argentina confirms his good health and his readiness to continue as president. [Begin Menem recording] I am much better than before the operation. I shall face it with the same passion, the same enthusiasm, the same spirit with which I have done everything in my life and, of course, with a small quantity of ability. [end recording] [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] President Menem says that he is convinced that, through negotiation, in the year 2000 the Malvinas [Falkland] Islands will be Argentine again. [Begin Menem recording] I have the intuition -- and in intuition there is also some share of of intelligence, of wisdom -- that in the year 2000 the Malvinas Islands will be in the possession of Argentina again.
