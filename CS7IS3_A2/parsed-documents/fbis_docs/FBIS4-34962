French Ambassador Jean-Raphael Dufour confirmed the report for PRENSA LATINA today, saying that this credit stands at $120 million and that he is satisfied with the positive evolution of relations between the two countries. During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the ambassador said the first part of the 30-million-franc donation (in excess of $6 million) to Cuba for use in basic industries is practically complete. Dufour mentioned a French corporation's drilling for oil in Cuban offshore waters, particularly the first well drilled in Cardenas Bay, as one interesting aspect in the field of bilateral cooperation. He said that French businessmen constantly travel to Cuba, and some of them are interested in the banking and sugar sectors. A new working session of French businessmen and Cuban authorities will be held in the next few months as a continuation of the general negotiations held at the beginning of the year, when a large group of French businessmen came to Havana. The ambassador described as very important a July meeting in Cuba of more than 600 French language professors from Latin America, Europe, and Africa to discuss the teaching of this language in Spanish-speaking countries. He added that this event is endorsed by Cuban authorities and the University of Havana and that several Latin American countries will be well represented. Brazil and Argentina will send some 90 delegates. We make realistic progress in developing ties with Cuba. We think it is the best way to develop those ties, Ambassador Dufour concluded.
