He said that he met today with the French ambassador in Cairo, because France came up with the initiative of sending troops and observers on a humanitarian mission to Rwanda. Regarding the meetings of the Damascus Declaration countries' foreign ministers in Kuwait on Tuesday, 28 June, 'Amr Musa said that all the countries in the Damascus Declaration support a cease-fire in Yemen. Egypt will declare its stand on the matter from this perspective. He added that some working papers will be presented to bolster cooperation among the countries of the Declaration. He affirmed that the Damascus Declaration is in better condition now than it was before. All the member countries now want to activate and revitalize this Declaration; to increase coordination and bolster cooperation among the countries, especially since this grouping consists of eight countries that are members of the Arab League. These countries meet within the framework of the Arab League's charter and the charter of Arab economic cooperation. He clarified that it is important and necessary for such a grouping to discuss all the problems in the region and the Arab world and to attempt to find a common approach on how to deal with these problems. 'Amr Musa said: We agree with the need to stop the fighting in Yemen and to start a dialogue. On the possibility of further measures being taken by the Security Council with regard to the Yemen problem, Musa said that the issue depends on the secretary general's report, which he will submit to the Council. The secretary general's report will be based on the report he receives from his special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in light of the discussions he recently held in Cairo. The foreign minister affirmed that the continued fighting in Yemen, despite the Security Council's calls to stop it, constitutes a problem. This is what makes the intervention of the Security Council probable. On the possibility of convening a mini-Arab summit to discuss the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister said this has not been proposed so far. Answering a question on protecting the lives of Egyptians in Yemen, 'Amr Musa said that protecting Egyptians in Yemen and elsewhere is one of the major duties the Foreign Ministry is shouldering. He added that the Foreign Ministry works in coordination with the cabinet to secure the return of Egyptians from Yemen because the issue pertains to the whole country. Answering a question on whether Egypt had received a Palestinian or Israeli proposal to host the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo, 'Amr Musa said that Egypt had not yet received such a request. He said it is ready to host the negotiations should the two sides ask it to do so.
