The trade regimes, the volumes and conditions of mutual deliveries, and methods of tariff and nontariff regulation were defined. The creation of Russian trade representations in a number of states of the Commonwealth was envisioned. Agreement was reached with virtually all the CIS states on employing a free trade regime. At the same time, however, an export tariff on certain goods, as an exception to the free trade regime, acted as a regulator of Russian export. Export duties are imposed on the export from Russia of food, mineral raw materials and fuel, ferrous and nonferrous metals, chemicals, timber and pulp and paper goods, leather and textile raw materials, aviation equipment, and weapons. Motor vehicles, equipment, and other output are exported duty free. On the whole, for most goods of Russian export on which export tariffs were imposed, duties were from 10 to 30 percent of the level of world prices for these goods. The need to satisfy Russia's economic interests accounts for the existence of duties on goods exported from Russia to the CIS countries, since prices for many hard currency types of output on Russia's domestic market are lower than world prices. However, the decision was made to supply energy media from Russia at prices oriented to world prices. Tariff and nontariff regulation of Russia's trade relations with the Commonwealth countries enabled trade exchange to be normalized and balanced. But the crisis situation in the economy, the drop in production, and the reorientation of enterprises' economic ties to the distant abroad caused Russia's trade turnover with the CIS states to continue to drop. The trade volume in 1993 totaled only 50 percent of the 1991 level. The mechanism used to supply state needs for the major types of output and ensure mutual benefit in trade is a mechanism of equivalent deliveries on a balanced basis, which is figured on the basis of the price levels of the world market. In 1993, using this mechanism the overall trade turnover with the CIS countries totaled about 7 billion dollars. In 1993 Russia had to regulate payment relations with the CIS states by instituting correspondent accounts of central (national) banks in the Central Bank of Russia. This prevented the uncontrolled release of circulating rubles into the Russian market, which was a powerful source of inflation in Russia. Payment-credit relations were also put in order and sums of technical credits granted by Russia were converted to state credits with liquidation conditions close to world conditions. The debts of the CIS states owed to Russia which were converted to a state debt totaled R2.3 trillion (roughly 5 billion U.S. dollars). And the possibility of paying off some of the debt by transferring property rights (stock, securities, and the like) to enterprises and objects which were of interest to Russia was envisioned at the same time. Questions related to allowing payment-accounts relations between the states' enterprises is of definite significance in Russia's economic ties with the CIS countries. At the end of 1993, the overall debt of enterprises and organizations of the CIS countries for goods supplied under direct ties from Russia totaled about R3.5 trillion, and of that roughly R1.5 trillion made up the debt to enterprises of Russia's fuel and energy complex. (Above based on Goskomstat [Committee for State Statistics] of Russia data). When the Issue Was Being Composed The large debt of Ukraine and Belarus to Russia caused a number of serious problems with deliveries of natural gas to these republics. If the debts are not repaid in a very short amount of time, a substantial reduction in these deliveries is possible. Change in Proportions of Main Trade Partners in Russia's Nonpayments Have Gone Beyond the Borders of Countries and Encompass Enterprises Working Under Direct Ties By the start of 1994, overall creditor debts at enterprises of industry, construction, transport, and agriculture totaled R47.0 trillion. That included R16.4 trillion or 35 percent overdue. Debtor debts totaled R43.8 trillion, which included R18.1 trillion or 41 percent overdue. Accounts with enterprises of the Russian Federation accounted for the largest part of the overdue creditor debts, R16.0 trillion or 98 percent. Accounts with enterprises of the CIS and the Baltic Region under direct ties accounted for R0.3 trillion or 1.5 percent. Overdue debtor debts under accounts between enterprises of the Russian Federation came out at R16.5 trillion, or 91 percent of its total amount. Overdue debts of enterprises located on the territory of the CIS countries and the Baltic Region under direct ties with enterprises of Russia totaled R0.6 trillion, or 3.4 percent. The following data characterize the condition of payment-accounts relations of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, transport, and agriculture of Russia under direct ties with enterprises located on the territory of the countries which are members of the CIS and the countries of the Baltic Region: Overdue Debts, (in billions of rubles) Country Debtor Debts Creditor Debts As of 1 As of 1 As of 1 As of 1 October 1993 January 1994 October 1993 January 1994 Accounts of Russia's Enterprises with Enterprises of the CIS Countries and the Baltics Overall 479.7 619.5 224.5 252.9 Including with Enterprises of the Following Countries: Ukraine 172.3 208.5 95.8 96.5 Belarus 71.2 96.2 22.4 24.5 Uzbekistan 45.8 50.0 11.3 12.2 Kazakhstan 115.8 169.2 72.8 85.4 Georgia 6.1 2.7 1.3 5.6 Azerbaijan 7.7 11.7 3.0 4.8 Moldova 0.1 11.6 1.6 3.4 Kyrgyzstan 6.7 7.6 1.5 1.1 Tajikistan 8.0 11.6 4.0 2.8 Armenia 2.3 2.7 3.7 4.2 Turkmenistan 19.1 29.1 3.0 3.9 Latvia 8.7 11.7 1.7 3.6 Lithuania 4.7 4.1 1.6 4.2 Estonia 1.2 2.8 0.8 0.7
