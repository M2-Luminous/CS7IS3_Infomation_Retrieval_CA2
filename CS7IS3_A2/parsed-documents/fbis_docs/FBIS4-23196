These negotiations under the mediation of the United Nations are aimed at achieving a cease-fire. Concerning today's negotiations, let us listen to the views of RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba: [Begin Gawumba recording] Talks are also necessary to stop the massacres still prevailing in the country. We have always said that meetings between the RPF and government forces could help to stop the massacres and we continue to believe so. If there is a possibility of stopping the massacres to enable the people to live in security, well we believe it would have a positive effect on our country. [end recording] While negotiations continue at Amahoro Hotel in Kigali, fierce fighting is taking place in the Rwandan capital.
