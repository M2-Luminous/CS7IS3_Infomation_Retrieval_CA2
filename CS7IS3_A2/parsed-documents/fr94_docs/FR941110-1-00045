FR941110-1-00045 FR941110-1-00010 A joint venture is one whereby several persons contribute resources to a single endeavor to produce and market a Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop. In such venture, one party may be the farmer who contributes one or more factors such as labor, time, production facilities or cultural skills, and the other party may be a handler who contributes money and cultural, harvesting, and marketing supervision. Normally, a husband and wife operation would be considered a partnership. Any individual, partnership, family enterprise, organization, estate, or other business unit currently engaged in the production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for market would be considered a producer under the order, and would be entitled to vote in referenda and committee nominations. Each party would have to have title to at least part of the crop produced, electing its disposition, and receiving the proceeds therefrom. This control could come from owning and farming land producing Walla Walla Sweet Onions, payment for farming services performed, or a landlord's share of the crop for the use of the producing land. A landlord who only receives cash for the land would not be eligible to vote. A business unit would be able to cast only one vote regardless of the number and locations of its farms, but each separate legal entity would be entitled to vote. A number of producers in the production area own or operate packing sheds. A producer who owns or operates a packing shed should not be precluded from qualifying as a producer under the order. The term ``Varieties'' should mean all classifications, subdivisions, or types of Walla Walla Sweet Onions that are commonly recognized by the trade and officially recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Testimony indicated that only Walla Walla Sweet Onions or subdivisions or varieties thereof would be subject to any regulations issued pursuant to the proposed order, and that varieties of onions grown in the production area not possessing characteristics of Walla Walla Sweet Onions would not be included. Varieties not included would include hybrid varieties of the sweet Spanish storage type onion. The term ``Committee'' should be defined to mean the administrative agency known as the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee established under the provisions of the order. Such a committee is authorized by the Act, and this definition is merely to avoid the necessity of repeating the full name each time it is used. The term ``fiscal period'' should be defined to mean the annual period for which the committee would plan the use of its funds. This period should be established to allow sufficient time prior to the time Walla Walla Sweet Onions are first shipped for the committee to organize and develop its budget for the ensuing season. However, it should also be set to minimize the incurring of expenses during a fiscal period prior to the time assessment income is available to defray such expenses. The Notice of Hearing proposed that ``fiscal period'' mean the 12-month period beginning June 1 and ending the following May 31. Record evidence indicates that the harvesting and marketing cycle for Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the production area begins in June and ends in August. The fiscal period should coincide with the Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop year, because the industry typically plans its operation on this basis. Hearing testimony supported the fiscal period being established for a 12-month period beginning June 1 and ending May 31 of the next year. However, based on future experience, it may be desirable to establish a fiscal period other than one ending on May 31. Thus, authority should be included in the order to provide for the establishment of a different fiscal period if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking procedures. In any event, the beginning date of any new fiscal period should be sufficiently in advance of the harvesting season to permit the committee to formulate its marketing policy and perform other administrative functions. Also, it should be recognized that if at some future date there is a change in the fiscal period, such change would result in a transition period. (b) Pursuant to the Act, it is desirable to establish an agency to administer the order locally as an aid to the Secretary in carrying out the declared policy of the Act and to provide for effective and efficient operation of the order. As proposed in ยง956.20, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee should therefore be established and consist of ten members, including one public member. The record indicates that a committee composed of ten members, with a like number of alternates, would provide adequate representation and would provide for reasonable judgment and deliberation with respect to recommendations made to the Secretary, and in the discharge of other committee duties. Since the order is intended to primarily benefit Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, it is appropriate that the committee be comprised primarily of growers. Six of the ten committee members should therefore be Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers. Since the program would be financed by handlers, and handlers would be responsible for complying with the terms of the marketing order, however, it would be reasonable to provide for handler representation on the committee as well. For this reason, proponents proposed that, of the ten members on the committee, three of those members should be handlers.
