However, it will be government in quotation marks. That is to say, last week, parliament, where the anti-Meciar opposition holds a majority, took a portion of power into its own hands. In other words, as of last week, Slovakia does not have a government that could fully carry out its functions. This somewhat bizarre situation came into being as the result of two "specifics" of Slovak politics--the absence of the term resignation in the political vocabulary of today's power elite, and the lack of readiness or, rather, the inability on the part of the opposition to take on the responsibility for directing the state. Its hesitation is more surprising because, in one breath and with unprecedented sharpness, it speaks of the "catastrophic consequences of Meciar's governing" and of the need to prevent "the further devastation of the country." The political crisis began at the beginning of February, when the government coalition of the HZDS-SNS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia--Slovak National Party] made use of a parliamentary filibuster to defeat discussion of an amendment of the law on large-scale privatization (the dispute involved the personnel connections between the executive and the National Property Fund). The coalition decided to take this step at the moment the Cernak faction within the SNS notified the coalition that it was canceling its allegiance and when this move resulted in balancing the ratio of forces within the National Council at 75:75. However, as early as the subsequent termination of the meeting of delegates, it was clear that, as long as the ratio of forces did not change, there was the threat of the total paralysis of the legislative power. This was obviously realized by Josef Moravcik, minister of foreign affairs, and Roman Kovac, deputy prime minister, under whose patronage the Political Realism Alternative (Alternativa politickeho realismu) parliamentary faction came into being within the HZDS. The parliamentary session that was resumed last week confirmed the new distribution of forces. The "Alternative" faction joined the opposition, and the delegates adopted the amendment in the form in which it was being asserted by the opposition. (In practice, this means sidelining the prime minister from the National Property Fund.) But the subsequent step--the fall of the Meciar cabinet--did not take place. The necessity to agree on a date for early elections (the coalition was proposing June, the opposition suggested November) turned out to be the prerequisite for the declaration of no confidence. And shortening election time through parliamentary maneuvering requires a three-fifths majority (90 votes), and even two attempts to put such a majority together failed (the first attempt fell short by 21 votes, the second by seven). The fact that both the opposition and the coalition agree on the necessity for calling early elections and, at the same time, cannot agree on such a secondary matter as the date for these elections is somewhat absurd. Logically, the question thus arises as to whether the common desire for early elections may not be just a mere pacifier of sorts. It is clear that the dispute over "June versus November" is a pseudoproblem, at least from the side of the opposition. The argument that June is not a suitable date for elections because "the political scene must become crystallized so that the parties can prepare their programs" and that the "transitional government requires time to stabilize the country" is, on the face of it, a proclamation regarding the harmfulness of the continued functioning of Meciar, which is not trustworthy. After all, anyone who takes the words regarding the continuing "devastation of the country" seriously is attempting to remove the government from power as quickly as possible. Vladimir Meciar is correct when he says that the crisis needs to be resolved immediately. The problem of present-day Slovakia actually lies elsewhere than in the deadline for early elections. It lies in the fact that the opposition continues unable to agree on the most substantive matter--on the decision to resolve the situation by making a radical cut. Today, the anti-Meciar opposition is divided approximately into three camps--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the Hungarian parties, and the remainder around Carnogursky's KDH [Christian Democratic Movement]. Of course, the keys to further development are only in the hands of the Weiss former communist SDL. This party was the first to insist that a vote of no confidence in the government be preceded by a call for early elections and is currently holding its opposition colleagues under tension through bilateral discussions with Meciar. Although Weiss is rejecting Meciar's coalition offers, this is amply sufficient for purposes of disintegrating the opposition. Even in the face of efforts to outwardly maintain the appearance of unity, Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the KDH, precisely characterized this situation on Friday: "The situation is obtuse, particularly thanks to the fact that the SDL is gambling on all parties. And that is what is decisive at this moment." As far as Meciar's tactics are concerned, his gamble on early elections is, at the present moment, relatively trustworthy. This week, he is beginning to collect signatures of citizens to a petition demanding the announcement of a referendum on early elections. In the tradition of his populism, however, he wants the referendum to include two additional items: Citizens are to decide to deprive those delegates who have changed their political uniforms since the election of their mandate and to compel adoption of a law proving the source of money involved in privatization. If Meciar collects the necessary 350,000 signatures--and this is a certainty--the president will have to announce a referendum involving all three of these topics within 30 days. The Hamlet-type questions besetting present-day Slovakia thus lie elsewhere than in the date for early elections. Even in the face of everything that is occurring in the country, has the time already arrived for recalling the Meciar cabinet? And can early elections in the foreseeable future bring an actual alternative to the government of the HZDS to the leadership of the state; can these elections mean a true turnaround? Understandably, an unequivocal response to the first question does not exist. It does exist with respect to the second question: The answer is no. Arguments for the end of the "broad-gauge" Meciar government are serious and generally well known, and would be sufficient for a separate article. Meciar is a permanent threat to democratic development in the country, a threat that need not come about, but its very existence is a sufficiently momentous reason. On the other hand, it is true that Meciar continues to enjoy the confidence of one-fifth of the population. And so, even if he were to be removed from the prime minister's position in the foreseeable future, the new elections cannot prevent the HZDS from returning to power. Moreover, it is certain that, should Meciar enter the election campaign from the opposition end, the preference for his movement would again increase. In a highly likely preelection coalition with the Klepac Christian Socialists and the "Andel-Prokes" portion of the SNS, he will most likely obtain 30 percent of the votes. However, even if he were to obtain fewer votes--the count will surely not be lower than 20 percent--the only realistic possibility would be a government coalition between the HZDS and the SDL anyway. Anything else is out of the question. Although the advent of the refined "Weiss boys" will serve to improve the overall impression of an old-new government team, that government team is aiming its policy still further toward the left. (While today Toth, minister of finance, is barely adhering to the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and is thus at least holding inflation under control, it is likely that, in an HZDS-SDL coalition, this practice would come to naught.) The notion that Weiss will wish to avoid a coalition with Meciar--which would be politically difficult or even impossible--and would form a common bloc with the other parties is also not overly encouraging. Additional early elections would be only a matter of time. Optimists will surely object to this somewhat catastrophic scenario by stating that there still remain some 50 percent of the people who do not want to go to the polls today and whose votes could change everything. But this is only a hope. A part of those who are undecided will certainly not vote, and the remainder, as is shown by experiences involving "nonvoters" in other countries, will divide their votes evenly between the strongest parties. The future of Slovakia lies fully in the hands of the Slovak voter. Unfortunately, all public opinion polls conducted thus far and the analyses derived from them signal the fact that whether early elections are held in June or in November is completely immaterial. Therefore, for the time being, it is premature to expect not only fundamental but even partial changes in the situation as it exists today. Early elections in Slovakia will truly be premature.
