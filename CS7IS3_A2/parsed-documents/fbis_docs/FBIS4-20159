Therefore, at the special meeting with the protective power Austria today, Thursday, SVP Chairman Siegfried Brugger wants to get an "assessment of the new situation in Italy" from Vienna. Said Brugger in an interview with KURIER: -- about the neofascists: "Italy is the first country in West Europe to make old and new fascists socially acceptable. A party that has never distanced itself from fascism will participate in the government," Burger states, seeing "reason for concern." And when Italian MSI Chairman Fini "is permitted to call Mussolini the greatest statesman of the 20th century, something dangerous is going on," Brugger told KURIER. "I am afraid that the slogans of the MSI are indeed developing in the direction that they are aiming for." -- on safeguarding the autonomy: The SVP chairman sees difficult times ahead for the minority Germans and Ladins. Therefore, together with Vienna it must be examined "to what extent the security mechanisms of our autonomy are internationally anchored and effective to defend our autonomy." -- on help from the outside: However, Brugger also expects diplomatic pressure on Italy -- because international treaties are involved. "If one carelessly undermines international treaties, one starts an avalanche. And this might also have a dangerous effect on South Tirol."
