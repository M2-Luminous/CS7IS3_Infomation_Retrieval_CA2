During the reception, Jiang Chunyun first extended a warm welcome to the guests on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government as well as Shandong people. Then, he said: Last year, while leading the Shandong delegation to visit New Zealand, I was warmly welcomed and cordially treated by your government and your people on various circles. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks. During our stay in New Zealand, we were deeply impressed by your country's beautiful scene and abundant natural resources as well as your hospitable people. Through that visit to your country, our understanding of New Zealand was deepened, the mutual friendship was strengthened, and the mutual economic and trade cooperation and exchanges were promoted. We believe that the current visit by your mayor will further deepen the friendship between the peoples of Shandong and New Zealand and press forward the further cooperation between the two sides. After briefing the guests on Shandong's natural resources and economic development situation, Jiang Chunyun said: China's economy has now embarked on the stage of rapid development, and the dynamics of reform and opening up has been increased. Therefore, we are urgently required to conduct economic and technological cooperation with developed countries and regions. New Zealand and Shandong are much complemented in the economy, and there are bright prospects for the mutual cooperation. We hope that the current visit by your mayor and ambassador will further expand the sphere of mutual cooperation and exchanges. While talking about the on-going second session of the eighth National People's Congress and the second session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Jiang Chunyun said: These two sessions have given prominence to the subjects of seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability in line with the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. China's economy has continued to maintain a relatively high growth rate. As a developed coastal province, Shandong effected a 24.2 percent increase in economic growth rate last year. This year, Shandong plans to effect a 12 percent increase in the gross domestic product. To effect such a high growth rate, we should, what is very important, bring in funds and technology from abroad, in addition to making good use of our own natural resources. Therefore, we are very happy to see that New Zealand is willing to continuously conduct economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with us. Our cooperation favors both sides. We hope that the friends of New Zealand will make investment in Shandong and also encourage Shandong's enterprises to run plants and do business in New Zealand. As the window of the mutual cooperation between the two sides, the Shandong Luxin Economic and Technological Consulting Corporation, that will soon be established, will certainly play a positive role in promoting the economic and technological cooperation between Shandong and New Zealand. In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun wished the mayor and ambassador of New Zealand success in their visit to Shandong. The mayor of Tauranga city and the New Zealand ambassador expressed their belief in the new progress in the mutual cooperation and exchanges in the future. During the reception, Wang Jiangong, vice governor of Shandong Province, and responsible comrades of departments concerned were also on hand.
