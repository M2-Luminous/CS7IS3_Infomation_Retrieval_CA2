FR940216-0-00251 FR940216-0-00010 (B) Post-1990 gasoline. Summer and winter Method 3-type gasoline data, per paragraph (c)(3) of this section, shall be evaluated separately according to the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.016 where: X bs =Summer or winter baseline value of fuel parameter X for the refinery s=season, summer or winter, per paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A)( 1 ) of this section g=separate grade of season s gasoline produced by the refinery in 1990 p s =total number of different grades of season s gasoline produced by the refinery in 1990 T gs =total volume of season s grade g gasoline produced in 1990 N s =total volume of season s gasoline produced by the refinery in 1990 i=separate batch or shipment of post-1990 season s gasoline sampled n gs =total number of samples of post-1990 season s grade g gasoline X gis =parameter value of post-1990 grade g season s gasoline sample i V gis =volume of post-1990 season s grade g gasoline sample i SG gis =specific gravity of post-1990 season s grade g gasoline sample i (used only for fuel parameters measured on a weight basis) (3) Percent evaporated determination. (i) Baseline E200 and E300 values shall be determined directly from actual measurement data. (ii) If the data per paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section are unavailable, upon petition and approval, baseline E200 and E300 values shall be determined from the following equations using the baseline T50 and T90 values, if the baseline T50 and T90 values are otherwise acceptable: E200=147.91^(0.49×T50) E300=155.47^(0.22×T90) (4) Oxygen in the baseline. Baseline fuel parameter values shall be determined on both an oxygenated and non-oxygenated basis. (i) If baseline values are determined first on an oxygenated basis, per paragraph (e) of this section, the calculations in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) (A) through (C) of this section shall be performed to determine the value of each baseline parameter on a non-oxygenated basis. (A) Benzene, aromatic, olefin and sulfur content shall be determined on a non-oxygenated basis according to the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.017 where UV=non-oxygenated parameter value AV=oxygenated parameter value OV=1990 oxygenate volume as a percent of total production (B) Reid vapor pressure (RVP) shall be determined on a non-oxygenated basis according to the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.018 where UR=non-oxygenated RVP (baseline value) BR=oxygenated RVP i=type of oxygenate used in 1990 n=total number of different types of oxygenates used in 1990 OV i =1990 volume, as a percent of total production, of oxygenate i OR i =blending RVP of oxygenate i (C) Test data and engineering judgement shall be used to estimate T90, T50, E300 and E200 baseline values on a non-oxygenated basis. Allowances shall be made for physical dilution and distillation effects only, and not for refinery operational changes, e.g., decreased reformer severity required due to the octane value of oxygenate which would reduce aromatics.
