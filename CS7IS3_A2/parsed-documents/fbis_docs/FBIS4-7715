We were surprised to hear the instructions of the Croatian Government's Office for Refugees, which discontinues refugee status in the Republic of Croatia for citizens from the area of the Mostar municipality. Our surprise is all the greater since we know that Arif Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and social policy in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, during his recent visit and talks with deputy prime minister of the Croatian Government Ivica Kostovic, and director of the Office for Refugees Adalbert Rebic agreed on joint activities of the two governments regarding the return of refugees from Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina. An identical agreement was reached with the representatives of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the recently held Constituent Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. Therefore, we propose to the Croatian Government to annul the aforementioned instructions and create conditions for joint preparations for all activities pertaining to the organized return of refugees and displaced persons to which we are obliged by the provisions of international treaties on the repatriation of refugees, reads the statement of the Information Ministry.
