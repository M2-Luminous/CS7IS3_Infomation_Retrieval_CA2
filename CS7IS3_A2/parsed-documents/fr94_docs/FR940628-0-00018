SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Designated ports are the cornerstone of the process by which the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) regulates the importation and exportation of wildlife in the United States. With limited exceptions, all fish or wildlife must be imported and exported through such ports as required by section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1538(f). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for designating these ports by regulation, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury after notice and the opportunity for public hearing. On January 4, 1974, the Service promulgated a final rule designating eight Customs ports of entry for the importation and exportation of wildlife (39 FR 1158). A ninth port was added on September 1, 1981, when a final rule was published naming Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas a designated port (46 FR 43834). On March 15, 1990, a final rule was published naming Portland, Oregon as the tenth designated port of entry (55 FR 9730). An eleventh port was added on May 20, 1992, when the final rule was published naming Baltimore, Maryland as a designated port (57 FR 21355).
