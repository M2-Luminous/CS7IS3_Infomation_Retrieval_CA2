[passage omitted] Is it true that there were nuclear warheads in Hungary at that time? [Fur] Yes, it is true. For a long time a special situation prevailed that even we, after the formation of the new government, did not know about it until the Russians moved them [the nuclear warheads] from Hungary. Even now we do not know at exactly how many places these nuclear warheads were stored. We certainly know one or two places, but, it is assumed that there were nuclear warheads in several other places. [passage omitted] There were no such things [nuclear warheads] in the ownership or operation of the Hungarian Army. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What can be done regarding the reorganization [of the army] in four years? [Fur] First and foremost, we have put an end to the Army's offensive structure and the entire operations planning system. The Army has to exclusively fulfill defensive functions. The total strength of the Hungarian Army has dropped from 152,000 to less than 100,000 within three years. The drop in the number of professional soldiers over the past three years is almost the same -- that is about 25 percent. [Correspondent] Does the present state of the Army provide a certain level of defense capability? [Fur] The Army, too, reflects very precisely the country's general social and economic state. That is to say, certain social problems, or even social tensions evolve within this army, as these pressing problems are present in society itself. We have tried, as much as it was possible, to raise wages every year. [passage omitted] On the other hand, there were purchases in the seventies. However, there have been no more serious purchases in this Army from the beginning of the eighties. [passage omitted] Let me say that we expect a lot from the setting up of a new humane service [human szolgalat], to consist of officers who are well-prepared and well-trained in social and psychological issues. [Correspondent] Let me note that there have been comments that this is a kind of revival of the system of political officers. [Fur] It is very wrong, the two have nothing to do with each other. That was a system of deputy commanders within the Hungarian Army, and this will be a fully subordinated, coordinated, special organization of the Hungarian Army, where the work will be carried out by trained experts. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Is the present state of the Army good enough to continue smooth operations in the event of a change of government, for we cannot know the election results in advance? Will it be able to operate without hitches, which may cause problems either in international relations or at home? [Fur] Although this army is under political direction, I am certain that it is not committed to any party political program. This army is in fact subordinated to the national cause, and it is also now laid down in law that no one within the army can engage in politics. [Correspondent] Is it not a kind of pressure that the minister of defense is one of the leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], and may perhaps become its number one leader? [Fur] By no means. I am the one who usually protests in the firmest manner against any move that perhaps the MDF would like to take in connection with the Army. [Correspondent] Has the basic transformation been implemented, or can it only be regarded as implemented after joining NATO? [Fur] It is not only when we have joined NATO, but also when internal tension has eased, which, in my view, requires at least 5-10 years. Then we can say that a full transformation has indeed taken place. It will be a modernized army of national character regarding its' every detail, its' way of thinking, preparedness, organization, and battle order.
