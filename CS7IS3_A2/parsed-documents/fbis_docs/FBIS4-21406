FBIS4-21406 "jpten009___94072" JPRS-TEN-94-009 JPRS Environmental Issues 25 February 1994 WEST EUROPE UNITED KINGDOM Law on Vehicle Pollution Not Enforced Law on Vehicle Pollution Not Enforced 94WN0218A London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH in English 25 Feb 94 p 11 94WN0218A London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH English CSO [Article by Jonathan Margolis: "Polluting Cars Escape in Cloud of Confusion"] [Text] With evidence growing that motor exhaust fumes are behind Britain's asthma epidemic, it has emerged that not a single car, bus or lorry owner has been prosecuted for having a dirty exhaust since it became an offence eight years ago. Under the Construction and Use Regulations a polluting car owner can be fined up to £1,000 and the owner of a bus or lorry up to £2,500. Yet only one car driver is believed to have been stopped by police for suspected pollution -- an Edinburgh man questioned last year because of his black exhaust. He was charged, however, only with having bald tyres and no insurance. Although most people breathing in exhaust fumes feel that polluters must be breaking the law, there is widespread ignorance among experts about even the existence of legislation. An Environment Department press spokeswoman emphatically denied that it is possible to be fined for polluting. Even Friends of the Earth believes drivers of the fume-belching cars are untouchable. Mr Doug Parr, the environment group's atmosphere and transport campaigner, said he was "pretty sure" a polluting motorist could not be prosecuted. The recession has led to an estimated one in 10 drivers skimping on car servicing, with buses increasingly spewing black smoke. The link with asthma was highlighted in last week's BBC1 Panorama programme and a report from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. Panorama said that the number of pre-school children with asthma had risen tenfold in 30 years, and that the Government was considering banning cars not fitted with a catalytic converter during smog alerts such as the climatic inversion over London in December 1991, when hospitals were swamped by children suffering from asthma. A prime reason for lack of prosecution of polluting drivers is bureaucratic gridlock between interested government departments. Only the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate can stop and check polluting cars. Police traffic patrols do not carry testing equipment, however, and the inspectorate has a policy of not prosecuting. Local authorities, led by Westminster City Council, are lobbying for powers to stop and fine polluting motorists. Sporadic roadside emission checks on buses, coaches and lorries -- but not cars -- by the inspectorate have led to around 600 lorry operators a year being warned and 500 bus companies. Owners are given 10 days to adjust their engines. Vehicle emission checks introduced to the MoT test in 1991 are not working, say some experts. A British chemist, Prof Don Stedman, of Denver University, Colorado, who has studied road pollution in Britain, says drivers with dirty exhausts have learned how to cheat on the test. Prof Stedman has tested exhausts in 12 countries and says British cities are worse than congested places such as Seoul and Hong Kong. "We know from testing 100,000 cars in London, Leicester and Edinburgh that half of the pollution comes from eight per cent of cars." He believes one badly adjusted petrol car can emit 40 times as many pollutants as one clean engine. Prof Stedman says only fines can persuade polluters to adjust their engines. In Los Angeles, a taxi firm with 75 polluting cabs was fined $250,000 last April. Many other U.S. cities now prosecute for polluting.
