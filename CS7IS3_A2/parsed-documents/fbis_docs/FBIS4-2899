It is beneficial to both sides and not a bestowal provided by one side to the other. Prior to his China tour in March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher visited Australia. During his visit, Australian Foreign Minister Evans explicitly said: "It is our opinion that MFN is not something preferential but is a normal basis for trade." But when Christopher visited China, he still regarded MFN as a carrot and linked it to the human rights issue. Sino-U.S. relations are not based on the same social system, the same concept value, or on the same ideology but are established on the basis of common interests. Despite their different concepts on value and human rights, Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations have rapidly developed since the signing of a bilateral trade agreement in Beijing which provided each other with MFN status in 1979. Sino- U.S. trade volume increased from $2.45 billion in 1979 to $27.65 billion last year. Deputy U.S. trade representative Barshefsky told the U.S. Congress that direct investments by U.S. businessmen in China totaled more than $7 billion; in 1993, U.S. business investments in China amounted to $3 billion, some 550 U.S. firms had established offices in China, and 500 major U.S. firms regarded their investments in China as one of their strategic development targets. China needs developed countries' capital, technology, and equipment for its modernization. When talking about investment prospects in China recently, U.S. trade representative Kantor predicted that in the coming 10 years, China's investment in basic facilities construction alone will amount to $500 billion; the United States has competitive strong points in the fields of telecommunications, highway, and heavy machinery. Some U.S. economic experts estimate that if the United States can obtain 1 percent of these contracts, this will create tens of thousands of employment opportunities in the United States. Following the sustained, rapid, and steady development of China's economy, China's imports will continuously increase. China's imports amounted to $103.95 billion last year and if they grow at 9 percent per annum, they will amount to $1,000 billion in the year 2000. This serves as a large market for the world. As long as the United States maintains normal economic and trade relations, China will become an increasingly important market for U.S. investment, commodities, and labor force. A host of facts prove or suggest that mutual MFN status between China and the United States is beneficial to the two countries and their peoples. If the United States abolishes China's MFN status, China's interests will be damaged but the U.S. Government is clearly aware of the following points: First, China has a large population and relies mainly on its domestic market. Last year, China's exports amounted to $91.77 billion. Deducting the one-fourth export volume of the "three-capital" enterprises and some of the export commodities manufactured in the business form of "three come's and one compensatory" [processing provided raw materials, processing according to provided samples, assembling with provided components, and compensatory trade], China's exports do not account for a large percentage of its GNP. China relies mainly on its domestic market and its ability to rely on its own efforts is strong. Second, China's opening up is omnidirectional and it is willing to develop economic and trade relations with other countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. So far, businessmen from more than 100 countries and regions in the world have come to China for investment. Last year, investment agreements between China and foreign businessmen amounted to $110.852 billion and the investments actually made totaled $25.759 billion, of which U.S. investments accounted for only a small percentage. Many Americans understand that, should the United States abolish China's MFN status, U.S. losses would not be smaller than China's because it could lose a large market for investment, commodities, and labor force. After Christopher's visit to China, the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee held a seminar on Sino-U.S. relations in Washington on 15 March. At the seminar, some famous entrepreneurs called on the Clinton administration to separate the human rights issue from China's MFN status and to unconditionally renew China's MFN status. Clarkson, vice president of the Boeing Company, said that the company "fully supports renewal of China's MFN status" and hoped that the U.S. Congress would abolish its annual debate on this issue. Denholm, general manager of Chrysler--the third largest automobile company in the United States--recently asked the Clinton administration to separate the human rights issue from renewal of China's MFN status. He pointed out that, at the same time as the United States was using the human rights issue to exert pressure on China, the German Government had expressed its readiness to provide preferential financial aid to create conditions for Mercedez-Benz and Chrysler to build a factory in China, adding that the United States would harm itself in using the human rights issue to impose trade sanctions against China. Worlick, in charge of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, expressed the same uneasiness by saying that, in retaliating against China, large U.S. companies could be the first to suffer. His company has joined the project to build a modernized telephone system in China. Worlick said: Only two of every 100 people in China have telephone sets. There is huge potential in this respect in a country with 1.1 billion people and "by the year 2000, China will have the biggest telecommunications network in the world." Worlick added: The American Telegraph and Telephone Company must remain in a favorable position, otherwise it will lose its leading position among its opponents, like France, Germany, Sweden, and Japan. In a speech on 23 March, President Clinton said that "the United States absolutely needs to renew China's MFN status." This indicates that President Clinton has a good idea of how things stand. The problem is that some so-called idealists in the United States are ignorant about China and the world and unwilling to lay down the obsolete weapons of carrots and sticks. However, we believe that reality is the best teacher to awaken these "idealists" to the facts.
