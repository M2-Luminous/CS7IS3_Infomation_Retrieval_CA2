There is ever more talk about the top personalities of the Crimean Government, President Yuriy Meshkov and Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov whom he brought in from Moscow, being at each other's throats, and the Crimea getting a new government soon. The economist Yevgeniy Saburov from Moscow, who has not been recognized or appreciated in his state, ended up in the Crimea on a recommendation by Sergey Stankevich, a friend and adviser of Yuriy Meshkov. To be sure, local observers believe that Stankevich is a friend of the Republican Movement of the Crimea chief, insofar as the latter needs a democratic image. Saburov also was Meshkov's choice because he was born in Yalta. Having just embarked on his career as a deputy prime minister of the Crimean Government, Saburov felt major resistance from Meshkov's most immediate entourage, and especially from Valeriy Grishenkov, the chief of the president's staff, who jealously and diligently protected the Crimean president against the "pernicious" influence of the deputy prime minister. Besides, Yevgeniy Saburov publicly proclaimed his loyalty to Kiev a few times and stated that, despite his Russianness, he was against the redrawing of borders. On every occasion, the specialist from Moscow indicated that he intends to carry out economic reforms. Within the framework of these reformist efforts, Yevgeniy Saburov canceled bread subsidies on the eve of an election and prepared an edict to the effect that the Ukrainian karbovanets is the sole legal tender in the territory of the Crimea, which was later signed by the president of the autonomous republic. Of course, this is not by any means in line with the pre-election promises of Yuriy Meshkov about the prompt introduction of a ruble zone on the peninsula. Differences and behind-the-scenes skirmishes between Saburov's team and the president's staff headed by Viktor [as published] Grishenkov, a former colonel of the USSR KGB, ended in the disbandment of the entire staff and the dismissal of almost all of his associates. Saburov's victory was complete: Yet another Muscovite, Viktor Minin, was appointed to the position of minister for the issues of state service (in fact, the administration of the government and the president). At a meeting with journalists, Minin stated that his main task is to be a buffer between Meshkov and Saburov and to smooth over differences between them. If nothing else, the fact of the cancellation by Meshkov of the already mentioned directive of the deputy prime minister to raise prices for bread and bread products indicates that such differences do exist and are quite serious. Saburov responded sharply to this action of the president: "Populism never does any good, no matter by what political motives it is guided." For now, Yuriy Meshkov will tolerate Saburov for as long as he and his team are needed. However, the Crimean president meets and consults more readily and with greater pleasure with Oleg Rumyantsev, the former head of the Constitutional Commission of the Russian Federation and a deputy of the former Supreme Soviet of Russia, who has promised to develop a concept for the state and legal buildup of the Republic of Crimea. Commenting on these contacts of the leader of the autonomous republic, Yevgeniy Saburov jealously stated to journalists that as a politician, Oleg Rumyantsev does not amount to anything and nobody reckons with him in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that the Russian advisers of the Crimean president have resolved to transplant the infighting between liberals (Saburov) and national-patriots (Rumyantsev) in Moscow to the Crimea. Nonetheless, despite the dissimilarity of the views of Meshkov and Saburov and the avowed loyalty of the Crimean deputy prime minister to Kiev, we should not make him into some kind of a Ukrainophile. It is just that he is much more sensible than Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov combined. The Crimea now finds itself at ground zero in a fight among Russian clans for influence on the peninsula, and Saburov's main task is to ensure the economic expansion and establishment of specifically his clan (Luzhkov, Shokhin, Stankevich) in the Crimea. To this end, political stability is needed first of all in the autonomous republic. Meshkov's failure to understand this is what brings about misunderstandings between him and his deputy prime minister. Rumors to the effect that these differences will soon be brought to an end are circulating in Simferopol. It appears that the days of the semi-Crimean and semi-Muscovite government of Yevgeniy Saburov are numbered, primarily because anti-Saburov sentiment prevails among the members of the Russia ruling faction of the Supreme Council of the Crimea. Who will come to take his place--Rumyantsev or Baburin? Or is it Zhirinovskiy? To be sure, they have enough such characters of their own here.
