An important statement. Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenants with Allah; of them some have died and some still wait, but they have never changed their determination in the least. [Koranic verse] O masses of our lofty Yemeni people: As history recorded in its black chapters the hideous crimes and rancorous practices perpetrated against the honest people of Abyan by warmongers and vampires, it also recorded in its shining chapters the honest stands, sacrifices, and heroic acts carried out by the sons of Abyan throughout ages. Abyan represented the torch of the revolution. We only mention this as a reminder to say that we are proud that Abyan is the birthplace of [name indistinct], 'Abbas, [names indistinct], Muhmmad 'Ali Haytham, and former Yemeni president 'Ali Nasir Muhmmad. O masses of our lofty people: The Abyan Governorate, which turned over the black chapters of history, [passage indistinct]. What took place during the past stages will not prevent us from continuing to struggle and defend unity and democracy. Abyan will always remain a symbol of loftiness and pride. As it was the cradle of revolution and revolutionaries, it will continue to be so during the unity. Let the banners of unity and democracy remain high. Splendid victory is the lot of our masses. Pride to Abyan and glory to its sons. [Signed] The sons of the Abyan Governorate, Sanaa [Dated] 22 [as heard] February 1994
