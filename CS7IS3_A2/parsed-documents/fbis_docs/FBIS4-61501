During negotiations with Estonia, the Russian delegation repeatedly called on the Estonian side to begin joint work to demarcate the state border but heard refusals each time. The Russian leadership decided to begin marking and reinforcing the border unilaterally, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced during his visit to Pskov in April. He stressed then that "the border must reinforced with technical means but not with the bodies of Russian soldiers". The minister was referring to the shooting of a Russian border patrol by contrabandists specialising in arms trade. The expedition will mark the border on the terrain in May and then the border guards will install special signs and protection devices.
