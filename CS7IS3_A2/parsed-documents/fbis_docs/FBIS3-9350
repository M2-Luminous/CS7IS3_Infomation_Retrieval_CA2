Showing that he was not the supporter of the idea "to copy automatically all that is there (in other democratic countries)," he considers that "we should apply only what is best of their experience, but adjusting it to our own needs." A diplomat of career, Gheorghe Tinca explains why the appointment of a ministry of civil defence was necessary and goes on to say: "My experience as a diplomat is, in my opinion, appropriate for the current stage of reform in the Army. It is, in fact, a stress laid on contacts, on interactions between our Army and the armies of other countries. This, first of all, as regards `the Partnership for Peace' plan, but not exclusively. We aim to foster ties not only with armies of the countries in the partnership, but also with that in the European countries that are not members of that partnership. I would like the Romanian Army to build a network of relations that will include other countries of the world, starting with major countries such as China, Japan, and then with armies in the Latin American states and in other countries of the world. This does not affect our main target, that is our integration within Euro-Atlantic political, economic, and military structures." Referring to the modernisation of the Romanian Army, the Romanian defence minister is of the opinion that "due to the current situation in our country, that is, a period of transition, I think that a priority is that of keeping the Army structured to perform a discouraging function, taking into consideration the fact that we are in an area of instability that threatens to become more unstable. Under these circumstances, I think that it would be extremely good for the Romanian Army to perform a deterrence function, which means that it will be always operational, but maintained as a well-determined mechanism to be used whenever needed," the Romanian defence minister said. The state of proper training would mean for us and also for the area we are living in a function favourable for stability," Gheorghe Tinca said.
