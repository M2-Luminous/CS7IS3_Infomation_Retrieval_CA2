Although he himself described this as a scheduled trip, the visit to the Russian enclave in the West was in many respects unexpected. Grachev was expected in St. Petersburg. Informed sources believe that the military minister's plans were changed by the urgent need to decide the Baltic Fleet's future -- whether it is to exist or not. The Defense Ministry is disastrously short of money. Whereas at the end of 1992 the state's debts to the military totaled 5 percent of the defense budget, at the end of 1993 the army and navy were owed 25 percent of their finances. In January 1994 the Defense Ministry was given just 63 percent of the money it requires. There is only enough money to pay wages. The Defense Ministry cannot pay the military-industrial complex for hardware and weapons. Some 64 percent of all Russia's enterprises work for the defense industry and are paid by the Defense Ministry -- over half the country's plants, millions of workers. In 1993 only half of the Defense Ministry's 2.2 trillion-ruble arrears to the military-industrial complex were paid off. The military-industrial complex is "falling apart." The results of the "battle" over the military budget in 1994 are unpredictable. But it is obvious even now that the Defense Ministry will not receive all the money it requires. Therefore the question of cutting back a number of military structures is an acute one. The Baltic Fleet has come under attack. Two views have clashed in the Defense Ministry. First: That the fleet not be destroyed. Second: That, on the basis of the Baltic Fleet and the Leningrad Naval Base, a "diviziya" of warships be created which would come under general military command [obshchevoyskovoye komandovaniye]. Both ideas are backed by high-ranking people, and there are reports that a real battle has flared up. Pavel Grachev took a group of military and naval top brass with him to investigate the situation on the spot. Will We Be Posing a Threat From Here? No -- Defending Ourselves In Kaliningrad the defense minister listened to the command of the Baltic Fleet and visited a number of military installations, troop units, and ships, many of which were put on alert during his work in the oblast and put to sea or took to the field. Summing up the results of the trip, Pavel Grachev gave a cautious response to the direct question of whether the Baltic Fleet is to exist or not: "The Baltic Fleet will evidently remain as it was." Clearly, a definitive decision will be made once the results of the work of the numerous representatives of the Defense Ministry central apparatus and the commanders in chief of the branches of the Armed Forces who visited Kaliningrad Oblast with the defense minister have been summarized. However, Grachev assured the men of the Baltic Fleet that he personally is in favor of keeping a fleet in the Baltic. The minister said that the main purpose of the visit was to study the decision to create a Kaliningrad Oblast Special Defense Area [KOOR]. This territorial operational formation is to comprise large groupings of ground forces, military aviation, air defense forces, and part of the forces of the Baltic Fleet. The Kaliningrad Special Defense Area will interact with the border troops and, possibly, with units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] internal troops, which Pavel Grachev intends to discuss with [MVD Minister] Viktor Yerin in Moscow in the near future. The plan is to place the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area under the jurisdiction of the defense minster and the General Staff. The grouping will be under the command of a single commanding officer. If he is a naval commander, his deputies will be general military personnel. And vice versa. The special defense area's main tasks are to defend the littoral and the airspace. All categories of support for the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area will be organized at central level. That is difficult right now owing to the isolated position of Russia's most westerly oblast. Following his talks with the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration Pavel Grachev intends to confront the Russian authorities with the question of creating a St. Petersburg-Baltiysk "sea run". It is envisaged that a transshipment base will be set up in Leningrad Oblast from which military freight and combat hardware will be shipped to the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area by amphibious warfare ships or seagoing ferries. That is a costly business, but transit through Lithuania is now several times more costly. Like cable communications lines too. The laying of underwater lines is now being completed, and it is also planned to provide the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area with additional space communications systems. Minister Gunning for Every Penny During his final news conference in the Baltiysk Garrison Officers' Club the defense minister devoted half an hour instead of the promised 10 minutes to journalists and film crews. Warming to his theme, Pavel Grachev spoke about... ...his daily routine: "I spend half my working time thinking about where to get money for the army and navy -- I search it out, or I `extort' it." ...Armed Forces manning: "The fall draft went OK. I hope the spring draft will also provide us with enlisted men and seamen. I think that by the end of 1994 we will be able to man the main Armed Forces categories some 85-90 percent. And secondary categories 60-65 percent. That is quite acceptable given the realities we face. Throughout the world, 20-30 percent of citizens are exempt from the draft. Legislators in our country have 'gone over the toip': 70 percent of citizens are exempt from service, while 30-40 percent of those who are drafted are sick." ...contract service: "There are already 120,000 contract personnel. The president has authorized another 150,000 to be recruited in 1994." ...the "breakup" of the Air Defense Forces: "There have been reports in the press that the Air Defense Forces are being halved. Not at all. We are to some extent 'contracting' the troops, removing obsolete systems. All the same, we cannot cover all the targets in the country, we will select the most important. Special attention now is to be focused on electronic reconnaissance systems and reinforcing the Air Defense Forces' fighter aviation. There will be good intelligence, making it possible to enlist the Air Force and antimissile defense forces and systems to defend the airspace."
