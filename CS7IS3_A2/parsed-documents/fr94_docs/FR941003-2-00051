This is a result of a small number of indicators that are specific to individual grant programs. In general, this category relates to the overall institutional environment in which the program is located and the manner of support for establishing or enhancing the training of generalist physicians at the institution. The ``Administrative and Management Ability'' review criterion has the highest number of points and is consistent across all grant programs because this area of the application will describe the proposed project for which the grant funds are being requested. The proposal needs to clearly detail the proposed project as well as relate the proposed project to the institution's overall goal of establishing or enhancing its training infrastructure in order to produce more generalist physicians to meet the needs of the Nation. The ``Economic Viability'' points are consistent across all grant programs. The ``Project Requirements'' points vary considerably for some programs. This is related to the differing number of project requirements specific to each grant program as well as the significance of some of the indicators. For example, for Family Medicine Residencies, the points are lower to reflect the fact that residency programs that are accredited or approved by the appropriate accrediting body, have already met the project requirements.
