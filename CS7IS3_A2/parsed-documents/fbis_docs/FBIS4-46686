The document--although this is not reflected in the title in any way--discusses regulation of the taxation of election campaigns. The deputies preferred the submission of changes to existing laws to that of a draft new law especially devoted to features of taxation of election campaigns, which was developed and submitted to parliament by the federal government. It is necessary to give due credit to the Russian parliamentarians: They were up to the mark, demonstrating that they had a better knowledge of legal norms than the government. As early as 1992 the Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution that is in effect now in accordance with which any tax benefits go into effect only in the event they are stipulated by law on the pertinent tax. According to this logic, the parliamentarians were absolutely right in declining the government's proposed draft law "On Certain Aspects of Taxation in the Conduct of Election Campaigns in the Russian Federation." The very same questions--taxes on resources paid into the election funds of candidates for representatives at various levels of legislative and executive authority--are resolved in the parliamentary version owing to the submission of changes to taxation legislation in effect. The corresponding draft law, which received the support of the State Duma, was introduced by Sergey Shulgin, a deputy from the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction and a member of the Committee on the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances (before his election to the Duma he was president of Arkhangelsk's Gandvikbank). Differing with the government on what kind of laws should regulate the imposition of taxes on election campaigns, the State Duma was in complete agreement with it on the volume and addressees of those receiving tax privileges. The action of these privileges is being applied to "relations that arose since 1 January 1994," and any subsequent elections will be conducted according to the new rules. Official justification for the tax privileges is reduced to the following. The exemption from taxes of the property of election commissions and associations, as well as the establishment of privileged taxation of donations of juridical and physical persons, is occasioned by the fact that these resources are used for noncommercial purposes. On the other hand, the privileges free the budget from a significant part of election costs, including payment for the work of bookkeepers and finance inspectors. Formally, this is how it is. But the "noncommercial" character of investments in one or another deputy of the State Duma, or the mayor of a large city is highly conditional, as indicated, for example, by experience in the United States. There certainly will be no difficulty in getting around the established "donation" limits. In any case, a legislative base is being established for the emergence in Russia of funds to support one or another candidate or political movement and the more active participation of big business in the "affairs of politicians," at both the local and federal level. The question is whether big business itself will realize this.
