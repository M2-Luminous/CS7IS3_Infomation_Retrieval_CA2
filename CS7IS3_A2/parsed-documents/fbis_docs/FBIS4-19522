The discount rate was decreased from 5 to 4.75 percent and the Lombard rate from 6 to 5.75 percent. The Gomex rate, which is important for the money-procurement costs of the banks, was decreased from 5.5 to 5.4 percent. The new rates are valid as of today, Friday. The first round of interest cuts in 1994 was implemented in mid-February. [passage omitted] In an interview with DIE PRESSE, OeNB President Maria Schaumayer justified the move using the "harmonization of the European interest rate structure" argument. It was also taken in anticipation of a decreasing inflation tendency. Austria's key rates continue to be lower than the German rates, which, according to Schaumayer, is a "sign of strength" and a confirmation of Austria's line. She hopes that, as a result of the decreased rate of price increases in Germany, Austria will again import stability from there in the near future. [passage omitted]
