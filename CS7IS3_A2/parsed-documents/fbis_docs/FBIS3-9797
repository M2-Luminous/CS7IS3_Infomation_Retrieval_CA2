Slovakia needs a speedy reform of the half-communist economic system, while having little capital and also little time, Janicina told CTK. He did not dismiss other privatization methods, including direct sales, but said that in no case would they be used to the same extent as by the Meciar government. "A government coalition deputy cannot be allowed to carry out a survey and then pass the property into his party colleague's hands," said Janicina. He sees direct sales linked mainly with foreign investments. Janicina also believes that lucrative enterprises, such as Transgas or arms manufacturers, will be included in the second wave of voucher privatization. Although nearly 60 percent of Slovak enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy and the real value of their property is deep below its nominal appraisal, Janicina sees no problem in selecting enterprises for coupon privatization. Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns will be set aside for coupon privatization. The government will seek to open the preliminary round before the autumn parliamentary elections.
