At their meeting in Mostar, they also discussed the political and security situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Zdenko Vranjes has filed this report: [Vranjes] Addressing the members of the executive committee and the chairmen of the municipal committees of the HDZ in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council of the Croat republic, said that a majority of the Croatian and Bosniak people want to implement the Washington agreement and the constitution of the federation. The minority of the Croatian nation which would like to obstruct the Washington agreement must be aware that it fulfills the interests of the entire Croatian nation both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. We must continue to stress that Bosnia-Herzegovina is our homeland in order to prevent anybody from making exclusive claims on it. Zubak said that talks on the presidency of the federation in the interim period will be resumed with Bosniak representatives on Saturday. Under the constitution, the Croatian side wants to have their man as president in the interim stage. However, Zubak added, the Croatian side is prepared to accept a compromise if the Muslim side insists on a Muslim president of the federation and if Haris Silajdzic is nominated for this position.
