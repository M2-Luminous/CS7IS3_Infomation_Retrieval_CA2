SUMMARY: This document provides notice of public hearings in which the public is invited to comment on regulations proposed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service, relating to the administration of grazing on the public lands administered by the BLM and on National Forest System lands. These hearings will also provide the public an opportunity to comment on a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Rangeland Reform '94. Immediately preceding the hearings, BLM and the Forest Service will sponsor informational meetings on the proposed regulations. DATES: All hearings will be held on June 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Hearings will be held at the facilities listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The United States Department of the Interior is proposing to amend the regulations which govern how the BLM administers livestock grazing on the public lands. A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on Friday, March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14314). The proposed rule provides for a public comment period that runs until July 28, 1994. On April 28, 1994, the United States Department of Agriculture published similar proposed rules in the Federal Register (59 FR 22074, 22094) which govern how the Forest Service administers livestock grazing on National Forest System lands. These proposed rules also provide for public comments to be received by July 28, 1994. In addition to the proposed rules, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as cooperating agencies, have prepared a draft EIS. The draft EIS is currently being printed and prepared for distribution. Notice of availability of the draft EIS will be made through a separate publication in the Federal Register . During the preparation of the BLM proposed rule, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt met on a number of occasions throughout the West with governors, State and local officials, ranchers, environmentalists and other public land users. These meetings resulted in many useful suggestions that are reflected in the proposed rule. In order to continue this important communication with user groups and members of the public, and to further elicit valuable comments on the proposed rules of both Departments and the draft EIS, the BLM and Forest Service have jointly scheduled 49 public hearings to be held throughout the United States on June 8, 1994. Hearing Procedures The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an alternate method by which to comment on the proposed rules and the EIS. The hearings do not replace the public comment period described in the proposed rules. All members of the public may submit comments in accordance with the procedures set forth in the proposed rules and are encouraged to do so. The hearings will be preceded by informal general information sessions which will begin at 8 a.m. in each location. The purpose of these sessions is to allow the public an opportunity to learn more about the proposed rules and EIS. BLM and Forest Service personnel will be present to describe the key elements of the proposals, and to answer questions so that those who wish to testify at the hearings will fully understand the proposals. These sessions are not part of the hearing and will not appear as part of the hearing record.
