However, Kalvoda is ruling out the possibility that the coalition could disintegrate because of those reforms. [Krasnicky] According to Deputy V. Dobal, the ODA has reached the conclusion that the government is unreliable in that respect. This is why they are going to draft a law on nonprofit organizations. How do you feel as a member of the government and, at the same time, a member of the party that is criticizing the government? [Kalvoda] This reflects tensions between the government and parliament. This anomaly ensues from the coalition mechanisms. Yes, I am a member of a party that is stressing the need for a general adjustment to the nonprofit sector and has a strong idea about the fact that a law should be drafted that would create room for civic activity. All government members play this double role inasmuch as they are dependent on their party and their sector. The situation, however, has not exceeded tenable limits. [Krasnicky] The prime minister yesterday signed a schedule for reforming the public administration. Did you not feel quite lonely when fighting for this reform? Did other ODA ministers support you? It might seem that this is a Kalvoda-Klaus personal dispute.... [Kalvoda] I do not want to divulge any details from government meetings, but I can say that two ODA ministers, apart from myself, were of the same opinion. This dispute is not a dispute between two individuals. If you just look at the ODA election program, you can see that the self-administration issue plays a key role. We know that we have to implement this reform now. Time is important in this case. The thing is that citizens have to be given, apart from assurances that they have powers, a new role in that self-administration. If this does not happen right now, I am afraid that the apathy we observe today will increase even more. [Krasnicky] Vaclav Klaus is pointing to the risks ensuing from territorial and administrative reform. He is afraid, for example, that the principle of civic solidarity could be endangered if the new system of local budgets is implemented. Are you also aware of certain risks? [Kalvoda] No. This seems to be a misunderstanding to me. It has been evident since the very beginning--when we signed the coalition agreement--that a self-administration unit without its own income is no self-administration unit at all. This is not a new risk factor. This is a needed feature that any self-administrative unit must have, as a rack wagon must have wheels. Documents that I presented to the government over the summer contain two basic models for financing regions and lands. We could also redistribute the financial sources through the state budget, like they are doing in the northern, mostly social democratic, countries--that is, we could try to set up dozens of objective criteria, according to which money from the state budget would flow into self-administrative units. According to another alternative that I am supporting, the new units could receive their income from taxes. [Krasnicky] You have mentioned cooperation within the coalition several times. What are the reasons for the misunderstanding? Is prestige sometimes involved? [Kalvoda] All the issues, whether we want self-administration or not, whether we want nonprofit organizations or not, are conceptual issues. As someone who is present at the negotiations, I cannot objectively say whether personal views prevail in this dispute. Emotions should not play any role in politics.
