The spokesman, Grigoriy Karasin, told reporters that the declaration could not only help stabilize Serb-Croat relations, but also have a positive effect on resolving the problem of Krajina (the state created by Serbs within the boundaries of the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia). The foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and Croatia, Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, signed in Geneva on Wednesday a statement on the normalization of mutual relations and opening of representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb on February 15. Belgrade said on Thursday the statement did not imply mutual recognition and establishment of diplomatic ties between the two states and did not prejudge a solution to the problem existing between Croatia and the U.N.-protected Republic of Serb Krajina.
