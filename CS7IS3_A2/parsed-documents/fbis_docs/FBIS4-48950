In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, urged that the people from higher levels downward across the province should concentrate greater energy on grasping the 1994 agricultural and rural work; focus on increasing the supply of farm products and the income of the peasants; stabilize grain production; ensure cotton production; increase economic results; and ensure a stable increase in grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, an overall increase in the rural economy, and a big increase in the income of the peasants. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the conference. Present at the conference were some provincial Leaders, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, and Li Zhen; and responsible comrades of the prefectural, city, and county party committees and provincial-, city- and prefectural-level departments concerned. According to the opinions made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government, Jiang Chunyun talked about eight issues as follows. First, stabilize the production of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and vegetables and effectively ensure the supply for society. Jiang Chunyun said: The province's main agricultural production tasks in 1994 are to stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops; to restore cotton production; and to enrich vegetable baskets. Cotton production is the province's most important agricultural task for this year. The provincial party committee and the provincial government urged that the party and government departments at various levels should regard the planting of good and sufficient cotton as an arduous economic task as well as a serious political task. We should continue to carry out the system of leaders assuming responsibility for cotton production and regard that whether or not the localities can plant sufficient amounts of good cotton and capture bumper cotton harvests as an important content of assessing [words indistinct] cadres. Second, comprehensively develop the rural economy and increase, by a big margin, the income of the peasants. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Striving to increase the peasants of the peasants by a big margin at the time of ensuring a stable increase in the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is an urgent, prominent agricultural and rural work task for this year. To this end, we should positively readjust and optimize the rural industrial structure and the rural product mix and increase the economic results of agriculture. Third, ceaselessly deepen the rural reform and inject new vitality to the development of agriculture and the rural economy. Jiang Chunyun said: To further mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production, we must make a new breakthrough in reforming the property right system. We should strengthen the setup of the (?land turnover) system and positively carry out the shareholding system. Barren mountain areas, barren beaches, wasteland, and undeveloped coastal areas can either be developed on a contracted or leasing basis or be auctioned for development. It is necessary to guide the broad masses of the peasants to enter markets. Fourth, realistically strengthen the buildup of agricultural scientific and technological front and vigorously popularize agricultural sciences and technologies. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should regard the improvement of the peasants' scientific and educational quality as a fundamentally great matter for rejuvenating agriculture with science and education and comprehensively upgrade the peasants' scientific and educational quality. Fifth, continue to support the poor, to make development, and to ensure the realization of the fourth five-year plan for supporting the poor. Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, the province worked out the fourth five-year plan for supporting the poor. That is, the province should concentrate five years of time to solve the problems relating to four million people's food and clothes. This indicates that our province has entered the last stage of the project for supporting the poor and making development with the purpose of providing sufficient food and clothes for the people. Sixth, strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy and do our best to serve agriculture. Jiang Chunyun said: In line with their actual conditions, all trades and professions and all departments should generally examine their aid-agriculture work, affirm their achievements, find out where they lag behind, study and formulate measures for improvement, and conscientiously attend to the implementation of the measures. Seventh, implement overall measures and ensure the stability of the rural areas. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Nineteen ninety-four is the key year of reform. So, it is of peculiar importance to safeguarding the stability of society. According to the existing [words indistinct] as well as [words indistinct] that will possibly crop up, the leading comrades at various levels should persist in the policy of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough and positively and actively do their work jobs. Eighth, strengthen the setup of the rural basic organizations to provide a reliable guarantee for agriculture and the rural work. Jiang Chunyun stressed: The prefectural and county party committees should concentrate their main energy on the rural work. Secretaries, majors, commissioners, and county heads of the localities that fail to promote the production of major farm products, such as grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and vegetables; and have problems in supply of these products, should be called to account. It is necessary to persist in the principle of seeking truth from facts, to resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucracy, and to strictly ban exaggerations and false reports. The grass roots should report to higher levels both good and bad news, and [words indistinct]. Responsible persons of five prefectures and cities and two provincial-level departments made speeches at the conference. Before the conclusion of the conference, Zhao Zhihao, governor of the provincial government, made a speech. In his speech, he urged that all localities and all departments should conscientiously implement the guidelines of this conference and ensure there are ideology, tasks, measures, and leadership. In regard to the current production, Zhao Zhihao said: The most important agricultural production task is to grasp cotton sowing work. We should try every possible means to fulfill the cotton sowing plan. He also reminded all localities to grasp the management of wheat field in the later stage, to make earlier preparations for planting, harvesting, and field management, and to ensure a bumper summer grain harvest.
