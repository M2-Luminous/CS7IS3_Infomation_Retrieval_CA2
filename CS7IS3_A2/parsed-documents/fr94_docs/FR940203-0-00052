FR940203-0-00052 FR940203-0-00016 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Parts 1207 and 1249 [Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;206] Revision to Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Motor Carriers of Property AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission is eliminating the Uniform System of Accounts for common and contract motor carriers of property. In addition, the Commission is revising the report form designations for class I and class II motor carriers of property and is changing the classification threshold levels for classes I, II, and III motor carriers. The intent of these changes is to reduce regulatory and accounting burdens for these carriers and to create a simplified report form for those carriers earning between $3 and $10 million in annual operating revenues. Use of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in lieu of the Uniform System of Accounts, and simplified annual reports for class II carriers permit the Commission to carry out fully its regulatory oversight functions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective January 1, 1994. It will take effect for the reporting year beginning January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ward L. Ginn, Jr., (202) 927&hyph;6187. (TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notice of proposed rulemaking instituting this proceeding was published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1992 at 57 FR 33314. Based on comments received in response to that notice, the Commission is revising the Code of Federal Regulations by eliminating 49 CFR part 1207 and modifying 49 CFR part 1249. Also, annual reports for motor carriers of property are being modified, with two annual report forms being designated; Form M&hyph;1 (essentially identical to the old Form M) for class I carriers, and a simplified Form M&hyph;2 for class II carriers. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.

Environmental and Energy Considerations This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on such entities. The purpose of our regulation is to reduce regulatory burden for the motor carriers. The economic impact on small entities, if any, will be to reduce the cost of maintaining and preparing reports to the Commission, and is not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
