The oil will be sold at the normal international price and there will be no compensation or barter mechanism, the report adds. Another report from Bogota adds that the Barranquilla Municipal Council has condemned the U.S. blockade against Cuba, and that Barranquilla and Matanzas will soon be declared sister cities for possible cooperation. Cuban Ambassador to Colombia Jesus Martinez also paid a visit to Barranquilla. He learned details about the project to declare Barranquilla and Matanzas sister cities and that this will probably take place when Barranquilla Mayor (Bernardo Hoyos) visits Cuba by mid-March. The ambassador held a lengthy conversation with the Barranquilla mayor. Ambassador Martinez also held meetings with the governor of Atlantico Department, (Gustavo Bell), businessmen, health officials, university students, and professors. During the meetings they discussed prospects for cooperation in different fields, many of which will be included in the declaration of sister cities. These cooperation prospects will be developed mainly in sports and cultural, touristic, and scientific activities.
