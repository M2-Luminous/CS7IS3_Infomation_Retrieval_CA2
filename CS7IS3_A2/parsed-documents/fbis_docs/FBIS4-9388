Spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said the Danish convoy of 10 trucks, carrying 90 tonnes of supplies, arrived in Gorazde Tuesday morning. The convoy, which left Belgrade Monday morning, crossed into Bosnia Monday afternoon, but was stopped at a Serb checkpoint at Dobrun, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Gorazde, and sent back into Serbia, where it remained overnight. On Tuesday Bosnian Serb authorities in Pale authorised the convoy to continue into Bosnia, Sachs said. Two other aid convoys, both Russian, were on their way to Moslem enclaves in Bosnia, Sachs said. One was carrying 110 tonnes of aid to Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia and the other, of 14 trucks carrying 61 tonnes of supplies, was heading for Gorazde. A UN convoy carrying some 250 peacekeeping troops arrived in Gorazde at 2:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) Monday, having taken 11 hours to make the 70-kilometre (40- mile) journey from Sarajevo. It was blocked for two hours in the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica by Serbs who objected to what they said were discrepancies in the convoy's papers.
