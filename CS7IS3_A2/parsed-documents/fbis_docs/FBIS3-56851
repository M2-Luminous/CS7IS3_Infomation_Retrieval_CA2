Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX that the Executive Secretariat and other CIS bodies were having serious problems at present. He said that because "the embassies of Turkey and Ukraine, the U.N. mission and the premises of some commercial structures are located in the Commonwealth building, the government and high-frequency communications systems in the building have been disconnected, which defies all logic." "The government of Belarus has still not solved the accommodation problem for officials from Commonwealth countries. The Economic Court of the CIS is situated in an unsuitable place, too," Korotchenya said. He expressed the hope that the future agreement between the Executive Secretariat and the Belarusian government would, among other things, make provisions for the construction of a CIS complex in Minsk.
