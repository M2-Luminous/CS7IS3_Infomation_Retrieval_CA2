Koren and N. Nadav of I.D.E. Technologies Ltd., P.O. Box 591, Ra'anana, Israel] [Text] Abstract Over the last 15 years steam injection has been the only method capable of significantly enhancing oil recovery in the German and Dutch oil fields producing a highly viscous crude. However, the steam injection has a negative impact on the oil reservoir pressure, since the steam to oil ratio is about 4. This means that for each produced barrel of oil, there is an accumulation of 4 barrels of condensed water coming from the injected steam. The outcoming oil and water mixture is separated in decantation tanks. The oil is further processed and the remaining brine is a disposal stream. The conventional method to dispose of the produced water is to pump it to separate reservoirs, such as a depleted underground gas reservoir, but this is limited to the available disposal capacity. Any other means to dispose the produced water to lakes or to rivers is prohibited by environmental regulations. The re-injection of the water back to the depleted reservoir is prohibited too based on the following: -- Contamination of the potable quality ground water with oil through cracks in the formation because of the increased pressure of the reinjected water. -- Raising the water table in adjacent residential areas due to the pressure of reinjected water, leading to the closing of ground water wells due to contamination. -- Irreversible changes in underground locked crude pockets which may damage future oil exploration. Based on careful investigations prepared by the oil companies operating in the German/Dutch oil fields it was decided to install a mechanical vapour compression unit to desalinate the produced water and use the distillate for boiler feed water, thus recycling the produced water and eliminating the previously mentioned drawbacks. This paper outlines the process which allows the production of high quality boiler feed water for steam generation from produced water, eliminating the ecological dangers mentioned above. This is achieved by ensuring a permanent water balance in the oil reservoir in the form of a closed water cycle, thus preventing the excessive volume of injected steam and creating the continuous addition of water to the system either from the fresh water wells or other available water resources. 1. Introduction Steam enhanced oil production is a well established technology. In the thermal methods heavy crude oil is extracted by injecting large quantities of steam into the oil formation. Continuous steam injection during a long period of time continuously disturbs the volumetric balance of the oil reservoir. At a steam oil ratio of 4:1, the injection of 4 volumetric units of steam brings to the surface one volumetric unit of oil and four unit volumes of water in addition to the naturally present water in the oil reservoir. The produced water may be reinjected. However to avoid pressure increase in the reservoir an excess of three volumes has to be disposed to an empty gas reservoir or to environmentally allowable special disposal areas. Three new additional volumes of fresh well or river water have to be used after treatment to generate the steam for injection. A solution for the permanent water imbalance in the oil reservoir is to use treated produced water for boiler feed water, to control a closed water cycle in the oil production facility. The ``closed water loop'' does not add any extra water from water wells, rivers or any other fresh water sources. 2. General Process Description The process is shown in the attached process block diagram. Figure 1. Steam Enhanced Oil Production Process Block Diagram The enhanced steam recovery method brings to the surface not only the oil but also significant quantities of formation water which are discharged back to the reservoir. The mixture of hot oil and saline water is fed to oil/water separation plant. After cooling the oil fraction is separated. The saline water fraction leaving the separation tank is treated in cascade for separation of residual oil and suspended solids. Before the produced water enters the MVC units to produce high quality boiler feed, it goes through a treatment stage to remove gases and dose an oxygen scavenger in order to keep the iron in soluble form. The distillate of the MVC unit is used as feed water to the steam boilers, whilst the brine is disposed to an injection well. Thus a permanent water balance is kept in the oil reservoir by forming a closed water cycle. 3. Process Description 3.1 General The vapour compression unit, which separates the feed into two streams -- distillate and brine is the heart of a system which transforms the produced water, originating from the oil/water separation tanks to boiler feed quality water. The central position of the vapour compression distiller results from the fact that it represents the major investment in the system, and that its operation is far more sensitive than the rest of the system blocks. Therefore, the design philosophy was to install a series of pre-treatment steps, each aimed at the removal of a certain potential risk to the smooth and trouble-free operation of the vapour compression distiller. 3.2 The Evaporator The evaporator is classified as an open loop heat pump. It is composed of two main components, the heat transfer tubes and the compressor. The compressor sucks vapour from an evaporating falling film on the exterior of the heat transfer tubes and discharging them to the interior of the same tubes. The lift of the compressor supplies the needed thermal gradient for the evaporation of the falling film and the condensation of the vapour inside the tubes. The heat transfer is the latent heat of condensation supplied via the tubes' wall as the latent heat of evaporation. In the temperature enthalpy diagram the process is described as two parallel lines (parallel to the enthalpy axis) at constant temperature. The top line represents the condensation and the bottom the evaporation. The conventional name of the evaporator is mechanical vapour compression (MVC). The mechanical structure of the MVC is explained as follows: The main element of the unit is a horizontal, 10 m-long cylindrical vessel with a diameter of 4.5 m mounted on a 4 m-high support structure. Within the vessel there is a nest of almost 7,500 horizontal heat transfer tubes (Figure 2). Figure 2. MVC -- Process Schematic The water is sprayed on the heat transfer tubes by a number of spray nozzles thus covering the whole surface of the upper tubes with a thin water film. The tubes are arranged in such a way that the water drops by gravity from the upper tubes evenly distributing over the tubes below continuously forming thin films. The brine recirculation pump guarantees a continuous efficient circulation. After passing through the feed heat exchanger and the auxiliary condenser/vacuum degasser the feed water is added to the circulation flow. A turbo-compressor sucks the vapour which has evaporated from the falling film. The vapour enters the vapour duct through mesh type mist eliminators and flows to the compressor suction port. From the compressor the vapour is discharged at higher pressure and temperature to the interior of the heat transfer tubes. There it condenses supplying the latent heat required for the evaporation process. The condensate and the concentrated brine are pumped out after exchanging heat with the feed. Non-condensible gases (NCG) are first concentrated in the auxiliary condenser and then exhausted by means of a rotary vacuum pump, which also serves to create the initial vacuum. The directly coupled compressor is tank-head flange-mounted to the vessel in a support frame. The most important components are integrated into the support structure of the unit. These components are the brine and condensate pumps, brine recirculation pump and liquid ring vacuum pumps, the feed heat exchanger, which is divided into two sections, the control cabinet as well as all necessary control units, switchboards and display units. 4. Field Experience The first MVC of 600 m[.sup]3[/]/day distillate capacity unit went on stream in December, 1990 and the second during September, 1991. Both units were successfully commissioned and since then have been in continuous operation in the oil extraction facility. The first unit was opened and thoroughly inspected after 3,500 hours of continuous operation. The findings were as follows: -- No performance decrease of the units due to deterioration of the heat transfer. -- No scaling was found during the inspection of unit I. Heat transfer tubes, demister and compressor blades have not shown any fouling. -- There were no corrosion attacks in the MVC unit itself. -- Checks of the compressor bearings have not shown any wear or balance errors. -- There are no particular changes in the vacuum tightness of the MVC plant. As we can see from the table, the design parameters of the MVC units are conservative compared to the real test performance. The distillate production capacity of the units is up to 10 percent higher, and specific energy consumption is 6 percent lower. Temperature is by 2.5�C to 4�C lower than the comparable designed parameters. 4.1 Operating Results ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The results were: -- The distillate is of constantly good quality. -- TUV has not recommended any further treatment to the distillate other than the regular chemical conditioning where the residual hardness is sequestered. The inherent simplicity of the MVC unit, as well as the automatic controls and instrumentation, enable quick start up and shut down, and allow unattended round-the-clock operation. Maintenance required is on a routine and normal basis for rotating equipment such as pumps and motors and for instruments and electrical equipment. Lubrication is carried out on a preventive maintenance schedule as given in the operational and maintenance manuals. The scale cleaning which is recommended by IDE after every 6-12 months of continuous operation was found to be unnecessary to date. The units consume, according to the design, moderate quantities of consumable materials such as hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, scale inhibitor, oxygen scavenger and lube oil. The units have been in continuous operation since their commissioning and allow the oil production company to continue to be an on-going facility for exploration of oil by steam injection, leaving the operation site ecologically safe. 5. Conclusions -- The mechanical vapour compression units have solved a major environmental and production problem by eliminating the volume of disposal of excess waste water (usually four times that of water per one volume unit of oil). -- The closed water cycle operation no longer required a continuous consumption of fresh water (from wells or rivers) due to the recycle of produced water by desalination to obtain distillate in high quality to be used as boiler feed to generate steam for the oil production facility. -- The installation of the MVC has been economically justified for enhancing oil production by steam injection. -- The performance data of the units in operation are above those which were taken in consideration in the design phase.
