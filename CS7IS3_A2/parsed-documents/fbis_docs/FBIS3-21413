The text of the report follows: There is currently no substantiated data on the condition of major oil reservoirs, such as al-Burqan, which is of primary importance. Studies are still in their preparatory stages. The al-Burqan study may be completed before August 1994. Preliminary studies of the reservoirs and Kuwait Oil Company estimates of other reservoirs indicate that they suffered no major damage and that the production losses they sustained from burning were limited to three-times the regular production. Other minor losses may have occurred in addition to capital equipment damage as a result of sabotaging the fields and other support facilities for transportation, gathering, warehousing, and exporting--all of which, in the final analysis, represent the cost of opportunities foregone in the utilization of oil money. A Ministry of Petroleum response to a weekly magazine certainly agrees with the above summary, even though it lacked in detail, perhaps for political considerations. There does not seem to be total rejection in Kuwait for the premise of foreign participation, which is the second point of concern. The Ministry of Petroleum's response seems to indicate that the premise has been accepted on a technical level and may have been the subject of precursory discussion by the Supreme Petroleum Council. The debate revolves around three caveats as we previously mentioned: 1.The role of people of influence in pushing through agreements that may not serve our national interests; either by endorsing incompetent foreign companies or by pursuing inequitable agreements. The media of information has a constructive role [to play] by alerting the legislative and executive branches in order to limit the incidence of aberrations that [tend to] proliferate in closed societies. 2. The potential for foreign government and private pressure utilizing the carrot-and-stick approach as a result of the invasion aftermath [as published]. This may be handled by raising the awareness of public opinion as well as the decision-making authorities. 3. The potential of failure in putting the country's internal affairs in order, especially where the public treasury is concerned. This is a pressing matter that calls for urgent and unpopular measures if we are to maintain a reasonable negotiating position. It seems that the Ministry of Petroleum leans so far towards foreign participation in all other oil activities such as petrochemicals, refining, and transportation, as well as in virgin territories or politically sensitive areas of production. But the Ministry of Petroleum's intentions remain just that; since the matter must go through normal channels to such decision-making authorities as the government, the National Assembly, and the Supreme Petroleum Council. The center of controversy is the current and future consequences of lower prices as we previously discussed. The Ministry of Finance reported on this issue to the Council of Ministers and recommended freezing certain expenditures such as those for defense, reducing withdrawals from financial reserves by 20 percent, and reducing public expenditures by the same ratio. But short- and long-term implications exist and may be summarized as the potential for widening the cumulative fiscal deficit in the face of a large increase in the flow to the labor market. Moreover, because of the need for considerable capital to develop the reservoirs in order to boost productive capacity, we will be in a poor negotiating position unless we contain the deficit shortly. The Ministry of Finance submitted to the Council of Ministers a report primarily based on an earlier World Bank report on privatization, one of whose objectives was to ameliorate the imbalances in the components of the Kuwaiti GDP, estimated at 6.3 billion dinars [KD] in 1992. The oil sector and the government services sector account for 76 percent of GDP, leaving 24 percent to others. But this is imprecise because of the strong and direct links they may have with others. The report deals, in its basic thrust, with the attempt to face the potential for a widening public treasury deficit, with over-employment where the surplus ranges between 20 and 40 percent, and with cost differentials. Once again, the Ministry of Finance is to be given credit for getting that report finished, for commenting on it, and for adopting its general principles and presenting them to the Council of Ministers, much as it did with its earlier report on the deficit. The report identifies some 74 projects as candidates for privatization within five years. Of those projects, 62 are companies owned in full or in part by the General Investments Authority. Half of the [remaining] 12 projects are in the oil, electricity, and telecommunications sectors, or are part of the General Ports Authority. The World Bank estimates government ownership in all those projects, with the exception of the oil sector, at about KD3.6 billion ($12 billion), of which the electricity sector alone accounts for some KD2.2 billion and all other [sectors] account for KD1.2 billion. The report goes into some detail about the candidates for privatization. It mentions, for instance, that of 62 companies owned by the General Investments Authority, some 23 may be privatized directly, six must be liquidated, and 23 need some detailed study. Differences do exist on whether the telecommunications sector should be fully or partially privatized, but they do not seem to be insurmountable, and we believe that the [outcome] will be dictated by such variables as demand, capital, and the stipulations for privatization. The report recommended that the electricity sector, because of its structural defects and low prices, be overhauled before it is privatized. We believe that there are social and political justifications that mandate its gradual transformation, and we concur with the recommendation to divide it up. The World Bank recommends establishing an alternative system for health insurance, leasing the facilities of the Ports Authority, and selling 75 percent of all transportation companies, including Kuwaiti Airlines.
