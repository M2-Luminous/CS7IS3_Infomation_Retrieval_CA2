The meeting will take place during a break in the OAS deliberations in Belem, Brazil. Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN that Di Tella wants to discuss the scope of Argentina's participation in a multilateral military intervention force aimed at reestablishing democracy in Haiti, in case last week's UN resolution ordering a total naval blockade of the country fails. [passage omitted] Apparently Di Tella would be consulted about a U.S. idea to create a police or military force with personnel from the entire continent for that eventuality. Di Tella will possibly tell Talbott whether Argentina is willing to send troops to participate in that force. Di Tella has already told CLARIN that the idea has the government's political support.
