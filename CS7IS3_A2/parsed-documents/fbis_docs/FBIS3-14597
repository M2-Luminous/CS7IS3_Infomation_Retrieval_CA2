A press release issued by the High Commission has referred to the joint communique issued in 1981 after the visit to Pakistan of the then Indian external affairs minister and the present prime minister, Narasimha Rao. In the communique, both sides endorsed each other's right to acquire weapons for their defense. As India has already acquired a large quantity of arms, it should not sense any threat from Pakistan. The press release further states that the F-16 issue, payment for which has already been made, concerns Pakistan and the United States. The press release also gives a reminder of the fact that Pakistan has never tried to have any influence on the acquisition of arms by India, although the acquisition of such arms has altered the balance of power in the region. Pakistan has always tried to maintain a balance in conventional arms and has supported a ban on the acquisition and installation of weapons of mass destruction and has also submitted several proposals in this regard. The press release asks India to hold constructive talks with Pakistan so as to ensure peace and stability in the region instead of indulging in arguments and debates.
