Lien made the remarks on Saturday [12 March] at a briefing by Vice Economic Minister Sheu Ke-sheng on issues regarding Taiwan's GATT membership, such as how membership would affect the local economy. Sheu said that if Taiwan fails in its bid to join GATT, it will not be able to establish fair and normal trade relations with other countries, which would badly hurt the competitiveness of local industries in the world market because Taiwan products would not be granted lower tariffs by GATT members. Failing to become a GATT member would not only reduce the chances of Taiwan's becoming a member of other international organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund, but would also negatively affect Taiwan's bid to become an Asia- Pacific operations hub and to become a member in full standing of the international community. Sheu cited a report by the Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research as saying that Taiwan's gross domestic product and export volume would increased by 2.13 percent and 34.7 percent, respectively, by 2002 after Taiwan joins GATT. Import volume should grow by 58#8 [figure indistinct] percent, and the trade surplus should decline about ntgdrtp billion [figure indistinct] (US$17 billion), the report said. Stressing that GATT membership is of great importance to improving Taiwan's economy, Lien said that all relevant government agencies should join forces to facilitate Taiwan's entry into GATT. Saying that the government is already taking measures to ease the impact GATT will have on local industries, Lien asked relevant government authorities to work harder to communicate with both the private and public sectors with the academic community and the legislature in order to prepare Taiwan for GATT entry. Meanwhile, Hsiao Wan-chang, the chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, called on all government agencies to increase the pace of reforms necessary to fall in line with GATT rules. Dismissing rumors that Taiwan's bid to join GATT is politically motivated: Hsiao said the government has no choice but to become a member of GATT because GATT policies would have an influence on government policies whether Taiwan joins GATT or not.
