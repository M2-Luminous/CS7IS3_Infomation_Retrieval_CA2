(Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 10 Feb 94) National Coffee Commission President David Robleto Lang has told BARRICADA that the nation's coffee growers will fall short of their goal of producing 1.1 million quintals of coffee in 1994. Lack of funding and the situation in the northern region of the country will be contributing factors. Agricultural and Livestock Minister Roberto Rondon primarily blames the drop in coffee production on heavy rains; however, he does admit that a lack of funding is also a contributing factor. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 19 Feb 94 pp 1, 10) The Nicaraguan Government's payroll will be reduced considerably in 1994. This was announced by Deputy Finance Minister Mirna Somarriba. The government plans to cut back jobs in areas such as public services. The cutbacks will affect approximately 9,000 workers. Several trade unions are opposing the reductions. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1540 GMT 13 Feb 94) The Nicaraguan Government has defended the indefinite closure of its commercial borders to Costa Rican milk products because of Costa Rica's delay in granting sale permits for Nicaraguan rice. The decision was announced by Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais. The closure of the commercial borders occurred on 27 January. Nicaragua buys approximately $400,000 a month in Costa Rican milk products. Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas said that the granting of permits for the import of Nicaraguan rice is the responsibility of the Costa Rican private sector.
