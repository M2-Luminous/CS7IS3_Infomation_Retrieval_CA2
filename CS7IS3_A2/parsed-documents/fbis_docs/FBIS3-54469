Of course these accusations will be studied and pursued in due course by the appropriate authorities. The rights of the Majles deputies must be defended, and they have the same right as any citizen of the Islamic Republic to express their views on current national affairs, so that, God forbid, conditions will not develop where anyone will dare to say that any kind of opposition to him is equivalent to opposition to the Imam (peace be upon him) and that his opponents are aligned with America and Israel. Of course in the recent past certain people also tried, under cover of Imam Khomeyni's (peace be upon him) oppression, to divert his path and to oppose the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult, and they were unable to do so! Apart from the insults, so far the Voice and Vision organization has not answered concerning the measures it plans to take to prevent the repeat of at least four instances which led to memos from the exalted leader. So far the management of the Voice and Vision organization has given no answer concerning what it has done, more than four years later, to implement the exalted leader's clear order to prepare a Voice and Vision organization administration bill. His Holiness gave this order in writing when he appointed Mr. Mohammad Hashemi chief of the Voice and Vision organization on 6/2/1368 [24 August 1989]. "It is required that a bill on the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran Administration Law be prepared and submitted to the government and the Majles quickly for passage through the approval process." According to the research and investigation report, so far that has not been done. In the research and investigation report numerous instances are cited of the Voice and Vision organization management's inattention to the organization's charter, and at least eleven instances of violations of the law are given. A quick review of the contents of the research and investigation report reinforces the belief in the reader that the management of the Voice and Vision organization seems to think that the organization's independence means their personal control of the organization, that they think themselves above all the competent bodies in the government, and that they see no reason to honor the rights of the other bodies in the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is perhaps this kind of thinking that justifies his manner of dealing with the Majles. Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that made the National Investigation organization wonder about the Voice and Vision organization management's failure to follow up with judicial authorities on the case of the collapse of the satellite building. Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that prompted the Policy Council appointed by the exalted leader to protest because the measures approved by the council were not announced to the pertinent units, and consequently were not enforced. Why doesn't the executive director give reports to the council every two months, as required by law? Perhaps it is the result of this kind of thinking that caused the organization's security chief to be appointed without the cooperation and approval of the Ministry of Intelligence. Perhaps it is because of this kind of thinking that personnel violations are not collected and a report on them is not given to the Ministry of Intelligence. The natural result of such dealings is the suffering, expulsion, and isolation of Hezbollah forces, the clearest manifestation of which is the basijis in the Victory Tradition Group. Under such circumstances naturally the remnants of the former regime in the organization are present and powerful enough that they are able to keep files on the Hezbollah forces for the crime of protesting their performance. An individual who resigned and was arrested because of relations with deviators was even appointed manager of the Voice and Vision organization in one of the provinces! With things like this going on in the Voice and Vision organization, it is natural that there is little room there for the growth and authority of 100-percent committed forces in the critical Voice and Vision organization. It is certain that a careful follow-up on the report from the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group by the competent authorities, without any kind of public controversy, will prevent some people from being deluded by the idea that dealing with individuals is to be done according to their official connections and not according to what they have done!
