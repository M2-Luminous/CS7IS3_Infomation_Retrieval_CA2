Velliste suggested that the deadlock on the border issue could be broken by moving that aspect of the Estonian-Russian negotiations into the framework of the European Stability Pact (Balladur Plan). Velliste and Eino Tamm, both members of the Estonian Riigikogu's [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, are in Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Parliament's foreign relations committees to discuss the historic, legal, economic, social and other aspects of the Estonian-Russian border and border areas. Also participating in the debate were many Russian officials and representatives from oblasts and districts on the Estonian and Latvian borders. Among those speaking were Russian hard-liners from Narva, Vladimir Malkovski and Juri Mishin, former Interfront leader in Estonia, Yevgeni Kogan, and others. The Russian officials and other representatives urged the Russian parliament to support unilateral demarcation by Russia of the current control line (essentially the same as the Estonian SSR-Russian border). Sections of Estonia in the southeastern corner of the country as well as territories east of Narva were illegally incorporated into the Russian SFSR by Stalin in 1944. Estonia is bound by its constitution to maintain the borders as set in 1920 by the Tartu Peace Treaty. The Estonian and Russian parliamentarians agreed to continue contacts between the foreign relations committees.
