Gen. brother 'Abd-al-Malik al-Sayyani, chief of the General Staff; his deputies; the defense minister's advisers; and ministry department heads. The chief of the General Staff began by congratulating brother Mansur Hadi on his appointment as defense minister and the trust placed in him by brother Lieutenant Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the Armed Forces. The chief of staff told the brother minister that he can count on the cooperation of everyone to advance national unity and constitutional legitimacy and to stand up to all forces of apostasy and secession who are out to plunge the Armed Forces into a bloody war to promote their despicable plans and sick dreams. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani went on to emphasize that what the apostate separatists are after is to tear the united Yemen asunder and set it back to the pre-22 May, 1990 era. The chief of staff declared that under the kind of decisive circumstances the homeland is going through now, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff Command have ahead of them a formidable task. Granted, he said, ours is a demanding mission, but by our cooperation and boundless confidence in the capabilities of the brother minister, which we have come to know first-hand throughout his service, should make its achievement possible. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani praised the defense minister's performance as commander of the al-Bayda' axis, where he and the military distinguished themselves in battle against the forces of apostasy and secession, and accomplished their mission with minimal losses. The chief of staff stressed that the forces of unity and legality are following up on their successes in al-Bayda' and elsewhere with further gains against the treasonous and apostate gangs led by secessionists in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party. They are fulfilling their assignments with admirable proficiency in Abyan, al-Dali', Lahij, and Aden, and elsewhere on the battlefront. For his part, Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi said he took pride in the confidence placed in him by Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He said he will extend every cooperation to his brothers at the General Staff Command and army commanders to translate this confidence into physical reality. The brother minister applauded the distinguished performance of the Armed Forces who, he said, are now engaged in fierce combat with the Socialist Party's gangs of apostasy and secession. He noted their remarkable steadfastness and successes in the field as they upheld the will of the people for unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. We are fighting a battle forced upon us by this tyrannical coterie against the wishes of the political and military echelons, who are anxious to spare the lives of the valiant military's personnel and the blood of the citizens of the united Yemen. We have no choice but to stand fast and fight on, the brother defense minister added. The forces of unity and legitimacy will soldier on and pound all the fortifications of the agent secessionists until, God willing, sure victory is attained.
