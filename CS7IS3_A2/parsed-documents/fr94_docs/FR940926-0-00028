FR940926-0-00028 FR940926-0-00009 Rule Changes Part 73 of Title 47 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations is amended to read as follows: PART 73_RADIO BROADCAST SERVICES 1. The Authority Citation for Part 73 continues to read as follows: Authority: 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 334. 2. The stay of the effective date of §73.3555 was lifted by publication of a Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140 in the Federal Register at 57 FR 42701 (September 16, 1992), and §73.3555 is revised to read as follows: §73.3555 Multiple ownership. (a)(1) Radio contour overlap rule. No license for an AM or FM broadcasting station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if the grant of such license will result in overlap of the principal community contour of that station and the principal community contour of any other broadcasting station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the same party, except that such license may be granted in connection with a transfer or assignment from an existing party with such interests, or in the following circumstances: (i) In radio markets with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own up to 3 commercial radio stations, no more than 2 of which are in the same service (AM or FM), provided that the owned stations, if other than a single AM and FM station combination, represent less than 50 percent of the stations in the market. (ii) In radio markets with 15 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own up to 2 AM and 2 FM commercial stations, provided, however, that evidence that grant of any application will result in a combined audience share exceeding 25 percent will be considered prima facie inconsistent with the public interest. Note to paragraph (a)(1)(ii): When evaluating audience share evidence submitted under §73.3555(a)(1)(ii), the Commission will consider data that eliminates statistical anomalies, provides a better focused survey area or includes revenue data or other relevant information. Where applicants certify that they do not have readily available audience share data, they may substitute other information that can serve as a proxy for such data. See Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (Sept. 16, 1992). (iii) Overlap between two stations in different services is permissible if neither of those two stations overlaps a third station in the same service. (2)(i) Where the principal community contours of two radio stations overlap and a party (including all parties under common control) with an attributable ownership interest in one such station brokers more than 15 percent of the broadcast time per week of the other such station, that party shall be treated as if it has an interest in the brokered station subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section. This limitation shall apply regardless of the source of the brokered programming supplied by the party to the brokered station. (ii) Every time brokerage agreement of the type described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be undertaken only pursuant to a signed written agreement that shall contain a certification by the licensee or permittee of the brokered station verifying that it maintains ultimate control over the station's facilities, including specifically control over station finances, personnel and programming, and by the brokering station that the agreement complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (e)(1) of this section. (iii) Any party operating in conflict with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section on September 16, 1992 shall come into compliance within one year thereafter. (3) For purposes of this paragraph: (i) The ``principal community contour'' for AM stations is the predicted or measured 5 mV/m groundwave contour computed in accordance with §73.183 or § 73.186 and for FM stations is the predicted 3.16 mV/m contour computed in accordance with §73.313. (ii) The number of stations in a radio market is the number of commercial stations whose principal community contours overlap, in whole or in part, with the principal community contours of the stations in question ( i.e., the station for which an authorization is sought and any station in the same service that would be commonly owned whose principal community contour overlaps the principal community contour of that station). In addition, if the area of overlap between the stations in question is overlapped by the principal community contour of a commonly owned station or stations in a different service (AM or FM), the number of stations in the market includes stations whose principal community contours overlap the principal community contours of such commonly owned station or stations in a different service. (iii) A station's ``audience share'' is the average number of persons age 12 or older on an average quarter hour basis, Monday-Sunday, 6 a.m.-midnight, who listen to the station, expressed as a percentage of the average number of persons listening to AM and FM stations in that radio metro market or a recognized equivalent, in which a majority of the overlap between the stations in question takes place. The ``combined audience share'' is the total audience share of all AM or FM stations that would be under common ownership or control following a proposed acquisition. In situations where no metro market or recognized equivalent exists, the relevant audience share data are the data for all counties that are within the principal community contours of the stations in question, in whole or in part. (iv) ``Time brokerage'' is the sale by a licensee of discrete blocks of time to a ``broker'' that supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements in it. (b) Television contour overlap (duopoly) rule . No license for a TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if the grant of such license will result in overlap of the Grade B contour of that station (computed in accordance with §73.684) and the Grade B contour of any other TV broadcast station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the same party. (c) One-to-a-market ownership rule . No license for an AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if such party directly or indirectly owns, operates or controls one or more such broadcast stations and the grant of such license will result in: (1) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an existing or proposed AM station, computed in accordance with §73.183 or §73.186, encompassing the entire community of license of an existing or proposed TV broadcast station(s), or the Grade A contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s), computed in accordance with §73.684, encompassing the entire community of license of the AM station; or (2) The predicted 1 mV/m contour of an existing or proposed FM station, computed in accordance with §73.313, encompassing the entire community of license of an existing or proposed TV broadcast station(s), or the Grade A contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s), computed in accordance with §73.684, encompassing the entire community of license of the FM station.
