The letter reads: Your Excellency, I would like to express profound concern over the situation in the three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde, created by hostile conduct by UN personnel toward the Serb civilian population. This problem was also present before, but it has exacerbated with the arrival of the Canadian troops in this area. On several occasions our civilians were ill-treated, even surrounded by armored vehicles and UN personnel, held at gun-point, had their personal belongings searched without authorization, and generally exposed to crude treatment. The most serious of all these problems is that the Canadian soldiers demand that the Serbs leave this zone, thus evicting them from their houses using brutal methods. We fear that such behavior is leading toward armed incidents with unforeseeable consequences. The agreement on Gorazde does not authorize such treatment of Serb civilians. The prevailing impression among the civilians is that they will be gradually evicted from the area, which the UN will then hand over to the Muslims. Such unhealthy conditions can easily lead to incidents, and we believe that it is only a question of time when incidents will start occurring. We are therefore suggesting that you forward this protest to the UNPROFOR military command and instruct the command to issue orders for the fair treatment of civilians in the three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde. The situation is so serious that if no radical change takes place, we will either provide police escorts for our civilians or allow events to dictate the situation on the ground. Please treat this problem as one of exceptional importance. Thank you for your understanding. Yours sincerely,Vladimir Lukic
