The secretary generals of the three largest trade union confederations in Europe and the world visited Sarajevo today for the occasion. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnian presidency, also addressed the meeting on behalf of President Izetbegovic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency. [Begin Ganic recording] It is not by accident that the world's largest trade union confederations have chosen Sarajevo as the venue for this year's main May Day celebration. This reveals a bad conscience because the world has failed to do all that it can for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Workers, those who are least to blame for the failure to act, are doing this to catch the attention of UN politicians, politicians of all countries, people who hold the power. In the name of human solidarity, in the name of the moral and political principles they uphold, they should not have left a country of hard-working people, a country of culture, science, and work, to the tender mercies of the armed chetnik gangs. What is all the more humiliating is that this country and its people have been denied the right to defend themselves by the imposition of an unjust embargo on the import of arms. The so-called protected area of Gorazde was defended by the courage of almost unarmed defenders who sustained the assaults by the aggressors equipped with (state-of-the-art) weapons of mass destruction. Those who prevented a more effective defense and protection of Gorazde and its residents are the accomplices of the crime in that town. [end recording] [passage omitted]
