Presidential hopefuls Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action Party (PAN); Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD); Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green Ecologist Party (PVEM); Marcela Lombardo Otero of the Popular Socialist Party (PPS); Pablo Emilio Madero of the Mexican Democratic Party (PDM); Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, of the Cardenist Front for National Reconftruction Party (PFCRN); Cecilia Soto Gonzalez of the Labor Party, and Alvaro Perez Trevino of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM) said the following: Diego Fernandez de Cevallos: Ernesto Zedillo "is a respectable and honest person who will certainly play a good role as presidential hopeful for his party. I now have an adversary again and will strive for the presidency." Cuauhtemoc Cardenas: "Perhaps now more than ever, he is the presidential candidate of continuity." Hopefully, despite how he was chosen, "it will be a clean and straighforward election." Jorge Gonzalez Torres: "Zedillo represents the continuity of a sinking ship and of something that failed." The new candidate "bases his political campaign in the image of Colosio, because he lacks his own personality." Marcela Lombardo: "The choice of Zedillo falls within the same democratic trend presented by Colosio, because it follows the same objectives and the same proposals of Colosio." Pablo Emilio Madero: "I hope that Zedillo's participation in the elections will be pure and clear, conforming to reality. It is hoped he will assume the responsibility inherited from Colosio of talking to all sectors." Rafael Aguilar Talamantes: "Zedillo's participation will raise the stature of the electoral race and will certainly guarantee that it will be civilized, tolerant, and respectful of all the candidates." Cecilia Soto: "All the contendors deserve respect. Zedillo will be an important contender. It is hoped he will embrace Colosio's positions." Alvaro Perez Trevino: "The proposals made to the people and the political line of Ernesto Zedillo will differ substantially from the proposals made by Luis Donaldo Colosio."
