KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service-- 15 Dey [5 January] The deputy minister of guidance for parliamentary affairs gave an interview to KEYHAN's correspondent in which he discussed the provision of the death penalty for producers of immoral films. He said: Only those who are the main agents in the production, reproduction or distribution of films showing nude women and men or sexual relations and who have been arrested three times for this crime will be called corrupt on the earth and condemned to death. 'Ezzatollah Zarghami, deputy minister of guidance for parliamentary affairs, discussed the conditions for issuing a death sentence for these kinds of criminals. He added: The Law Increasing Penalties for Producers, Distributors, and Reproducers of Unauthorized Videotapes and Images, recently passed by the Majles, states clearly that the death penalty applies those who knowingly do this, using the resources of international networks and with the goal of society's moral deviation. In this regard he explained: In our view people like this are no different than narcotics smugglers and those take armed action to destroy the government of the Islamic Republic. In answer to the negative propaganda by some media from Western nations concerning the law increasing penalties for those involved in the production, reproduction, and distribution of vulgar films, he said: As long as the Western nations trample the primary principles of freedom and democracy and will not even tolerate the presence of four veiled girls in their schools, they are in no position to dictate the observance of human rights to other societies. According to the deputy minister of guidance for parliamentary affairs, based on the law approved by the Majles, individuals who use children for the storage, sale and reproduction of tapes of immoral films will also be subject to the prescribed penalties. Likewise, secondary agents involved in the distribution of tapes of this kind will be sentenced under the law to cash fines and prison terms. Zarghami was asked: "In the end, are video tapes authorized or not?" In answer he emphasized the need for planning for proper use of videos and added: At the same time, because of the sensitivity of the matter, there must be controls in place to prevent abuses in this area. He discussed the decision by the Ministry of Guidance to authorize the establishment of "Video Societies" in the cities. Concerning the requirements for obtaining this authorization, he said: Great care is being exercised in the selection of qualified individuals among the applicants to establish video centers. In this regard priority goes to reputable revolutionary individuals who are basijis, veterans and members of families of martyrs. According to Zarghami, video tapes have already been produced and made ready for distribution of 100 films of various kinds.
