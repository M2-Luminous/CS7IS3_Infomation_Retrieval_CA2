President of the Study Committee on National Defense and managing editor of the monthly review DEFENSE NATIONALE, he took the opportunity of this visit to consult a broad range of players in the current Algerian crisis. In this interview, he explains France's position on the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism and describes France's policy toward the Maghreb and the Arab world in general. [Belhouchet] The week you spent in Algiers gave you the chance to meet many people. What is your appreciation of the situation in Algeria? [De la Gorce] My appreciation could be summed up in two observations. The first bears on the indisputable capacity for resistance of Algerian society in general, in its diverse aspects, against what we will call for simplicity's sake "the armed Islamist opposition." I would say very frankly that overseas, at least when I left Paris for Algiers, the climate was very pessimistic regarding Algerians' capacity to resist the armed Islamist movement. So I must say that the resistance is considerable. It is expressed in diverse ways, of course--by the attitude of the government, the conduct of the army, the actions of the security forces, and also by the specific security policy pursued by the regime in place. Let us not forget the manifest existence of ideological political camps that are determined, as I see it, to stoutly resist the armed Islamist opposition. The second point I would make is that this camp comprises a complex mix of elements, as diverse as Algerian society itself. The political and social hierarchy in all its totality also includes those who pour out in the streets to demonstrate against the prospect of a religious state in Algeria. The divisions within this camp were striking. It seems that this camp has a great deal of difficulty uniting and focusing its efforts. [Belhouchet] Observers think France's policy toward Algeria has changed In the last six years, especially since the right came to power. What is your view? [De la Gorce] I think the initial tone taken by French leaders vis-a-vis Algeria was set in 1992. There were all sorts of arguments that official policy should distance itself from what was happening in Algeria and from the regime in place. Following the interruption of the electoral process, it was thought the growing power of Algeria's Islamist currents was irreversible, so there was a great deal of concern about the situation and a feeling that France should stay very far away from that process. But in October 1992, a decisive turning point was reached. Dumas's visit to Algeria, followed by the visit of Belaid Abdesselam and Redha Malek to Paris, resulted in large financial commitments. This new direction was maintained by the new government, after the 1993 legislative elections in France. I should note that French policy is determined jointly by the president and the prime minister, and the two men feel the same way about Algeria, i.e., that it is necessary now to support Algeria in its struggle against the armed Islamist opposition. Although that judgment is the starting point, there may be fluctuations from time to time regarding tactics or the language to be used. Sometimes it is stern and categorical in support of the government in place against an opposition described as "terrorist." At other times, one might think the most important thing was to do something for those fighting against the armed Islamist opposition rather than saying something that would have no real-world impact. The general tenor of French policy is more the former. [passage omitted] [Belhouchet] One has the impression France is giving Algeria a sort of wink and a nod, as if to say, "We can help you, but make up your mind where you're going." [De la Gorce] I do not mind at all when people say France and Algeria have a special relationship. But the root of the problem lies with the Algerians: Nothing can substitute for their own collective will. The choice of a certain type of society is one for Algerians to make. I think that for many reasons this choice has been delayed and fretted over, because you are looking for the reaffirmation of a national identity in Arabization and Islam. At the same time, some Algerians were committed to modernity. There was a reliance on ideological foundations that did not prove as sound as one might have hoped and that may have diverted Algeria from the path of modernization, from developing the kinds of social attitudes needed to participate effectively in the modern world. One must never lose sight of the fact that in history, as in life, there is no such thing as a complete break. One never starts over from the zero point, even when leaders are replaced. We are saddled inescapably with the consequences of cultural, economic, and social choices made in the preceding period. It seems to me it is not very profitable to denigrate a regime, such as the one in power today, which is taking important steps forward. The accord with the IMF is the largest since 1988. It marks Algeria's decision to take a path on which other states have already embarked. [Belhouchet] Do you have the impression that the Islamist movement in Algeria is completely sui generis? Why do you think there is so much atrocity, so much hatred, when initially it was an opposition movement that was allowed to express itself and even enjoyed a great deal of sympathy all around the world? [De la Gorce] Without going so far as to dispute the uniqueness of the Algerian situation, one should not forget that manifestations of political and religious fanaticism are extraordinarily violent elsewhere too. The unfortunate way the Iranian regime behaved and evolved was also extremely violent. We see terrible violence in Egypt. I think one must consider the logic of conflict. At first, all sides, even those trying to seize power, are sensitive to public opinion, the need to form alliances, to pay attention to the international context. But the logic of conflict leads to the unleashing of violence. We must realize that such violence feeds on itself. Thus it does not surprise me very much that things have reached the present juncture. This kind of thing is characteristic of violent and armed struggles in general. So I would cautiously suggest that we should not forget that in the history of Algerian political movements there have been what one of your compatriots, historian Mohamed Harbi, termed very powerful plebeian tendencies, which continued into the period after 1945, into what we have called the Algerian War. [Belhouchet] Despite all the crimes it has committed, not even sparing foreigners, the fundamentalist movement has continued to enjoy support abroad, notably in France. [De la Gorce] Yes, in France, we have this very strong, very negative, irrational and absurd reaction, but it's pretty widespread. I would like to draw your attention to the fact the same reactions can be seen in other countries--and the example of the United States is particularly revealing in that regard. You published in EL WATAN an extremely revealing report of remarks made by a U.S. State Department assistant secretary-designate before a congressional committee, which reflected very accurately the attitude I myself observed several weeks ago in Washington among members of the majority party--namely, the feeling that Algeria has been on the wrong path since the interruption of the electoral process, that in the last analysis the Islamist current is the one most representative of Algerian society, that the country is sinking into internal turmoil that will end in civil war. I recall that two American officials were criticizing the Algerian Government because in the face of an armed Islamist opposition it would be incapable of moving ahead with the monetary, financial, and economic reforms indispensable not only for its own future but simply to restore order. [Belhouchet] What is the main tenor of the U.S. Administration's current thinking on Algeria? [De la Gorce] The predominant view more or less favors a compromise with the Islamist camp. There is a different school of thought holding that the struggle against Islamist fundamentalism must be pursued because it is a dangerous phenomenon, with Iran the seat of infection and Sudan a secondary locus of contagion. [Belhouchet] As you leave Algeria, what feelings do you take with you? [De la Gorce] My feeling is that the determination of men and women opposed to a takeover by the armed Islamist opposition is such that the latter will not succeed. But naturally I cannot predict the duration of that struggle--or the forms it may assume. I also think it is too soon to predict whether those resolved to destroy the armed Islamist opposition will have a quick victory, because there is more to the struggle than just the security dimension.
