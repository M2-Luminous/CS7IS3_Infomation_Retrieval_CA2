All the politicians' machinery proved ineffective when it came to getting voters motivated. [Begin recording] [unidentified person] I do not care if I did not vote. [Unidentified reporter] Don't you care? [Unidentified person] No. [end recording] This woman was part of the 68 percent of the population who did not vote. If yesterday's elections are compared to those in the last 15 years, they represent a setback in voter turnout. From 4 million voters in 1978, we went to 5.5 million in 1982, nearly 7 million in 1986, over 7.5 million in 1990, and back to 5.5 million yesterday. Political expert Hernando Gomez Buendia commented on this phenomenon. [Begin Buendia recording] A high voter turnout is very dangerous because it signifies there is a big conflict and people feel threatened by a very serious decision to be made. It is normal to have a high abstention rate. In parliamentary elections in Colombia, Sunday's figure is not disastrous. [end recording] In addition, few people voted yesterday because the Congress' image does not excite people. There is no faith in parties either; the ballots were confusing to many people, and it rained. Given these reasons, yesterday's election was not seen as a classical game of politics -- a games that fill the public stadiums -- but as a game played in the Olaya Stadium.
