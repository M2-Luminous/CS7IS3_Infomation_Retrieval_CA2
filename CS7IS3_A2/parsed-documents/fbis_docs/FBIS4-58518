The spokesman announced that the decision became active immediately following requests by Jordan to replace naval inspections in with an onshore process. France, said the spokesman, was the only country which participated continuously in the naval inspection operation alongside the U.S. since they were launched. The spokesman was quoted by AFP as saying that the decision to quit the force was taken in close coordination with the U.S. and His Majesty King Husayn and U.N. Secretaary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali were informed of it. Informed sources told the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper that Canada turned down a U.S. request to replace French naval forces in monitoring the embargo in the Red Sea. AL-HAYAT quoted the sources, who were not identified, as saying that the Canadian government totally rejected replacing the French forces. The sources commended the French decision saying it "reflects France's understanding of the Jordanian stand and manifests its desire to narrow the gaps and reconcile international legitimacy as a slogan and international justice in reality." Jordan, which has announced the suspension of its participation in the Middle East peace process until the siege on the port of al- 'Aqabah was lifted, has reached an agreement with the U.S. providing for land-based sanctions verifications by a neutral side. The French embassy in Amman late Wednesday issued a statement announcing its decision to quit the multinational inspection forces, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, said. Through taking this decision, it said, "France aims to demonstrate its support for Jordan in finding a formula that would help reduce the heavy burdens inflicted upon the Jordanian economy by the naval inspection operations."
