A majority of La Paz newspapers said in their front pages on 20 March that Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle his cabinet, dismissing some of his ministers and changing the assignment of others, possibly on 22 March. The sources consulted by EFE said the ministers who will almost surely leave the government are Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Interior Minister German Quiroga. The same sources said the "super ministers" of economic development, Fernando Illanes, and human development, Fernando Romero, will have their assignments changed. The sources also said that current Minister of the Presidency Carlos Sanchez Berzain and an outstanding entrepreneur and political leader from Santa Cruz are the leading candidates to replace Interior Minister Quiroga if he leaves the cabinet. Sanchez de Lozada's government is formed by a coalition of his party, the liberal Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS), and the social democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL). The UCS, the party granting the MNR control of the absolute majority in Congress, presently has one of its members as head of the Defense Ministry. The post was assigned to Antonio Cespedes, but he is expected to leave the government because his own party has requested that he be removed. The MBL, whose votes in Congress are not essential, was able to get the Foreign Ministry for its leader Antonio Aranibar. His continuation is assured because he seems to be Sanchez de Lozada's government's most popular minister. Sanchez de Lozada formed his government on 6 August 1993 after his victory by a relative majority in the 6 June 1993 election. In these seven months of government, Sanchez de Lozada's cabinet has established the legislative basis for a future absolute transformation of the Bolivian economy and administration. The key instruments in this transformation are the Capitalization Law to privatize public companies, and the People's Participation Law to give more power to citizens in the political and administrative decisionmaking process and the allotment of state resources through the country's municipalization. Sanchez de Lozada also has reorganized the executive branch by significantly reducing, among other things, the number of ministries.
