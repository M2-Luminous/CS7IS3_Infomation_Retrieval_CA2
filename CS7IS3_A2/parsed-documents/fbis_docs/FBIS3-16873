"Why did Iranian pilots who knew that medium altitudes over a combat zone (of Nagorno-Karabakh) are mortally dangerous still flew towards Stepanakert and further headed towards the strategically important Lachin corridor (connecting the enclave with Armenia)", the experts told TASS on Monday. They added that neither the special commission investigating the crash, nor the simultaneous statements of Armenians and Azeris denying their involvement in the crash will give an answer to the main question -- why the C-130 appeared in the airspace of Nagorno-Karabakh and why did the crew choose the course right over the combat area?. The experts stressed that the crew of the plane had an unusually big number of members and that the craft did not need any emergency landing even if the cockpit was depressurised. The plane could have landed in Gyandzha or Shamkhor in Azerbaijan where runways of former Soviet military airfields are big enough for all types of heavy planes. The experts do not rule out that one of the warring sides shot down the plane mistaking it for an enemy one. It is quite possible the transport craft was attacked from a mobile anti-aircraft missile which are in big numbers in the combat zone, they added.
