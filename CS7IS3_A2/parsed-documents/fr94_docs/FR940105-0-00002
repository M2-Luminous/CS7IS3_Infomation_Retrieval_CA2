FR940105-0-00002 FR940105-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Part 204 [INS No. 1647&hyph;93] RIN 1115&hyph;AD61 Priority Dates for Employment-Based Petitions AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by providing that an application for labor certification filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, must be filed with the Service in connection with a petition filed under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) before October 1, 1993, in order to maintain a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. This rule implements section 302(e)(2) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline. DATES: This interim rule is effective January 5, 1994. Written comments must be submitted on or before February 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Records Systems Division, Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 5307, Washington, DC 20536. To ensure proper handling please reference INS No. 1647&hyph;93 on your correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael W. Straus, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 7122, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 29, 1991, the Service published a final rule in the Federal Register at 56 FR 60897&hyph;60913, revising 8 CFR 204.5(d), which provides that the priority date for an employment-based petition that is accompanied by a labor certification shall be the date the request for labor certification was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor. A priority date cannot be established unless the Service approves a petition under section 203(b) of the Act based on a labor certification approved by the Department of Labor. Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into law the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102&hyph;232, dated December 12, 1991. Section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 102&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, was enacted in order to address the transition of labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created by IMMACT. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification filed in connection with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October 1, 1991, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA further provides that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application subsequent to October 1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the date of certification. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service has interpreted that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which have been certified by the Department of Labor between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) must be filed within 60 days after the date of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. This reading of section 302(e)(2) of MTINA furthers congressional intent by allowing at least 60 days from the date of certification to file the petition under section 203(b) of the Act. In light of the above, 8 CFR 204.5(d) will be amended to reflect these MTINA amendments. The regulation will be further amended to provide that if the petitioner fails to maintain the priority date by filing a timely petition, the new priority date shall be the date a new petition is properly filed with the Service.
