[D'Alema] The bringing of charges as a political weapon is something unprecedented in modern democracies. If someone tries, he can find three or four unscrupulous lawyers and set them to work in connection with the investigation of a number of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's aides for having given money to postal service officials, and with the business involving his brother, Paolo -- well, he can try. He can formulate a fine charge and make the rounds of the attorneys' offices. Let us be frank: The very idea that someone should consider settling the political contest in this way seems to me frankly monstrous. [Messina] But it has happened [D'Alema] So, I tell you that this initiative on Craxi's part, this anti-PDS super-prosecuting attorney, is revealing. It sheds light on other judicial matters, other "spontaneous" statements from members of the business demimonde that evidently felt -- what shall we say -- inspired to act. Then, when he realized that he was not succeeding, he acted himself. He used a trick learned from judo -- causing your adversary to fall under his own impetus. I believe that this is all he has been doing for the past several months. It must be an obsession for him, his job. To contact people, to send them to attorneys' offices, to acquire documentation. In human terms, it is all rather pathetic: Someone who used to be a very prominent political leader, a statesman. [Messina] You spent a long time at Attorney Mele's office. Is it true that you were questioned by the magistrates? [D'Alema] What questioning! I went to the attorney's office to lodge a formal charge for libel against Bettino Craxi. And to institute a legal action in this connection. [Messina] On the basis of what was reported in the newspapers? [D'Alema] Certainly. He accused me of being the organizer, the promoter, the accomplice in a series of actions of illegal party funding. And this is not true. What is more, none of the attorney's offices in Italy knows anything about it either. It seems that this charge is nothing but a collection of judicial proceedings, statements, and articles cobbled together by some clever lawyer that Craxi can permit himself to pay. But it is all old hat. And since during the past two years of inquiries not only have I never been investigated by any attorney's office, but no judge has even felt the need to summon me as a witness. [Messina] But do you or do you not know whether the magistrates have included you on the list of investigatees? [D'Alema] I do not know; that is secret information, or should be. For that matter, we do not even know how many people have been included on the register of investigatees over the past two years, or who they are. We do not know. Because that is a preliminary and necessary action that the magistrate carries out in absolute secrecy. Above all, it is a secret to whoever is on the register, because he must not know that he is the subject of preliminary inquiries. But we have now monstrously distorted everything. [Messina] But why does Craxi want to hit you and [PDS Secretary] Occhetto? Is it revenge, an attempt to spread the guilt? [D'Alema] He wants to hit us because were are in the midst of an election campaign. [Messina] What direct interest could he have in doing so, since he is no longer your political adversary? [D'Alema] First, Craxi is motivated by an implacable hatred for those who have always combated him. He considers us his fundamental enemies. From this viewpoint, I feel honored by so much esteem. It is the best reply to those who used to say that we and Craxi were closely associated: This action bears the stamp of hatred. Moreover, it is not true that Craxi is not in the arena. He is. I do not know who may have deluded themselves that the decline of a political system would put an end to that system of government, that complex of vested interests and businesses. Those forces still exist. The difference now is that Berlusconi is in the front rank and Craxi in the second rank. Craxi is involved in the political struggle, as well as seeking a personal vendetta. [Messina] Is there not some personal factor in this business? What did you say last time you met? [D'Alema] I have not spoken with Craxi for a very long time. I believe that I have definitely maintained a civil attitude toward him since his fall from grace. I have never attacked him. I fought him when he was powerful. He will not find a single statement by me against him since he became implicated in the corruption inquiry. I love political struggle, not the persecution of individuals. [Messina] What were your thoughts the other night? [D'Alema] Personally, I am confident, I actually slept fairly well except for the fact that my three and one-half year old son wakes up from time to time. Of course, I have some concern for my friends and family. [Messina] Of what nature? [D'Alema] Well, I will have to visit the people who know me as a result of the battles that I have waged, and I will have to explain to them that I am an honest man. That is the last thing in the world that I thought that I would have to do. [Messina] And will you do so? [D'Alema] Who knows? You have the suspicion that the person in front of you may have seen a television news program, read the newspapers. And frankly I find that rather difficult to accept. [Messina] Have you thought what you would do if you were to receive an investigation notice? [D'Alema] I do not need to think about it. I am a fighter. And we progressives have decided on the following rule: If anyone receives an investigation notice for offenses connected with matters relating to Bribe City, including illegal party funding, he will not stand as a candidate. This is the rule, and I will adhere to it, like everyone else. Having said that, I am a responsible person, and certain things are not solely up to me. [Messina] What if they were up to you? [D'Alema] I will tell you that I am not very keen. [Messina] To conduct an election campaign? [D'Alema] No, I would willingly conduct it more energetically. I am not very keen to go around telling people: You must vote for me. I feel a great weight on my mind at the moment.
