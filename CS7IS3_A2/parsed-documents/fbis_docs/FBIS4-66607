Singh Nominated 94AS0229F Madras THE HINDU in English 15 Feb 94 p 1 94AS0229F Madras THE HINDU English CSO [All quotation marks as published] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Janata Dal [JD] affairs took a curious turn today with the party president, Mr. S.R. Bommai announcing his decision to quit the post. The former Prime Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, now convalescing in London, was nominated by the national executive of the Dal to head the party. A resolution to this effect was passed by the executive. However, Mr. Singh's consent is still awaited, despite claims from sections that the former Prime Minister had agreed to take over the reins of the party. Until such time Mr. Singh expresses his opinion, Mr. Bommai will continue to lead the party. A new president will have to be elected by the general body of the party within six months from now, according to the Dal constitution. Sources within the party described today's development as `part of a concerted move to oust Mr. Bommai and install Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan as party president'. According to them, Mr. Singh is expected to decline the post and hoist his confidant in place of Mr. Bommai. Taken by surprise: Though today's development was more or less on expected lines, with powerful sections within the Dal gunning for Mr. Bommai, his decision to quit today appears to have taken his supporters in the national executive by surprise. Speculations are rife of a further split in the party, which is already witnessing exodus at local levels. Today's national executive was preceded by a meeting of the Political Affairs Committee, where the demand for Mr. Bommai's ouster was raised by members, led by the Bihar Chief Minister, Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav. Mr. Bommai's announcement to step down was essentially a fallout of this, said partymen. Those who opposed Mr. Bommai's ouster include the Dal vice-president, Mr. George Fernandes, and the entire `socialist camp' within the party. This camp was closeted in a meeting immediately after the executive meeting. The executive is slated to continue its deliberations tomorrow, when the Dal's rout in the recent elections is expected to come up. Apart from Dal leaders leaving the party to join Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, a similar movement of Dal men, including some MPs, joining the Congress(I) seem to be on the cards. Confirming such an eventuality, a Dal MP from Bihar today said "we cannot remain party to this decision and do not intend to continue with them." Mr. Bommai told the press that he had offered to quit as party president on consideration that Mr. Singh alone was capable of retrieving the Dal from the dumps that it is in today. "I am a satisfied and contented man today," said Mr. Bommai. Though the meeting was slated to discuss a score of issues, including the `merger of Dal factions which was initiated at Ghazaibad in September 1993', the only business transacted today was Mr. Bommai's stepping down. In fact, demands by Orissa Chief Minister, Mr. Biju Patnaik, and others that Mr. V.P. Singh's consent be obtained before resolving the issue of party presidentship, was turned down by vocal sections. Apart from Mr. Patnaik, the move was resented by Mr. Ramakrishna Hegde and many others from the southern States. This demand, sources said, was `violently' turned down by sections led by Mr. Laloo Prasad. `Consent': According to Mr. Bommai, Mr. Laloo Prasad claimed that he had spoken to Mr. V.P. Singh on the proposal to which he had agreed to. As if to endorse this, Mr. Bommai added that he too had expressed such a view to Mr. Singh, before his departure to London and "Mr. Singh did not say no."
