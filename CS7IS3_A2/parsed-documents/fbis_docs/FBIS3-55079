The problem lies in what they are after. Traditions are only just taking shape in the relations between Poland and Ukraine, because, until quite recently, the two countries were under control of the almighty KGB, and their special services danced to the same tune. The history of these relations has only started to take shape, although not in the best spirit. Its first page is the fate of Anatoliy Lysenko, major of the Mostyskyy Rayon (in Lvov Oblast) Department of Ukraine's Security Service. On 23 August 1993, the major of Ukrainian special services was arrested on the territory of Poland and accused of espionage. It is already the fourth month that Anatoliy has been under investigation. The trial will be held soon. It is a strange case -- the major was arrested not far from the border. On his trip to Poland, Anatoliy was accompanied by his whole family -- wife, student daughter, and a little son. He did not receive permission to leave from his authorities -- for lack of time. Doctors insisted on the fourth operation on his son, and the parents decided to seek the advice of an experienced Polish specialist. In addition, there was nobody he could ask permission from -- the chief was away on leave, and his deputies were afraid to take the responsibility upon themselves. The Lysenko family decided to go to Rzeszow on their own, though they did have corresponding documents for crossing the border. Nowhere in the history of special services worldwide will one find a precedent in which a whole family would be engaged in spying. The version maintaining that Major Lysenko collected intelligence information seems, to put it mildly, doubtful not only to professionals. It is a different matter that the Poles, taking advantage of the distress of the Lysenko family, did everything in order to lure the major to their territory. The first officer, who was in charge of the Mostyskyy Customs House and who, apparently, ensured free border crossings for more than one cargo, could not but interest his Polish colleagues. The Mostyskyy Customs House is the gate to Western Europe, and officers of the local department of Ukraine's Security Service are a Klondike of intelligence information. The "proofs" of espionage about which Lysenko's wife writes in her appeal to the Ukrainian president, are ridiculous. Lysenko allegedly asked one Pole to bring a few newspapers from Poland; another time, he asked about who was going to head the religious community in Przemysl and when the clergyman there would be replaced. Finally, the most serious accusation -- he helped a Polish citizen to bypass Customs. Based upon a testimony of their citizen, Polish special services charged the major with espionage and applied to him an article of the Criminal Code envisaging between five and 15 years imprisonment or capital punishment. Although, Major Lysenko has yet another choice -- to betray his fatherland. The Poles are offering him a job in their special services, to bring his family, and adopt Polish citizenship. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Security Service, having abandoned their colleague to the mercy of fate, maintains calm and pretends that nothing has happened. The Poles show greater interest in Lysenko's case, because they already repeatedly hinted that Ukrainian leaders should come to his rescue. Judging by numerous hints, it is not just a matter of Anatoliy Lysenko's fate. It appears that we are dealing here with the worst variant of relations between special services, where the rule "tit for tat" is in effect. Consequently, Ukrainian special services pushed their Polish colleagues to a decisive step, or else the Poles decided that attack was the best type of defense. As a result, Ukraine's Security Service Major Anatoliy Lysenko celebrates the coming of the New Year in a Polish prison, his wife Olena haunts the thresholds of high-ranking officials, who can only help by appointing a lawyer. Perhaps, they do not want to help? It only remains for us to wonder what kind of logic the Polish special services adhered to by picturing a modest rayon official as the greatest Ukrainian spy. It is possible that Anatoliy does not even have an idea about this. Now, his colleagues will welcome him as a hero....
