The recent meeting entitled "Our Home -- the Republic of Moldova" fulfilled all the functions of former traditional congresses of the Communist Party by formulating "directives" and "theses" for the coming period. The anti-Romanian atmosphere of the proceedings and the anti-unification promoted by all speakers triggered lively applause in Moscow. Here is how Radio Moscow and Ostankino Television acclaimed the said congress: "The participants in the forum condemned the political forces and media opposing the state's independence and spread national feuding (...) Moldova's President Mircea Snegur delivered a profoundly substantiated speech in front of those present. The ultra-patriotic slogans supported by a number of parties and movements led to a split not only of the people of different ethnic origin, but also among the ranks of Moldovans." And at the end of the report, which apparently is not linked to what was reported before, but which actually testifies to the fact that Moscow endorses Chisinau's official stance, it is emphasized: "The same day (6 February), Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an intergovernmental draft accord that establishes the rules and conditions for the stationing of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova." Once again this proves that Snegur's previous statements in connection with the need for the 14th Army to withdraw were false. Even the organization of the congress (by the so-called Civic Alliance in Chisinau, a formation that was set up recently, and the Government of the Republic of Moldova) does not differ in any way from the former measures of defense and security adopted by the communists. The proceedings were attended by delegations from several countries, including from former Soviet republics; Romania was not invited. Access to the congress was very restricted. The invitations had been issued by state structures. The same procedure was also in force for most of the journalists, who, not having the authorities' approval, had to withdraw when faced by the cordons of policemen. Chisinau radio and television carried live relays of the congress, so that the citizens' indoctrination would be more effective. In practical terms, the speakers respected the electoral platform of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] by trying, first and foremost, to slander the pro-union political forces and promoting Romania-phobia and an exaggerated, abnormal Moldovanism. Adrian Usatai, general director of the national radio television in Moldova and leader of the Civic Alliance in Chisinau, went as far as to contest the national ideal of the country's reintegration, thus questioning -- with sinister sarcasm -- the supreme sacrifice accepted by Ilie Ilascu: "Mr. Ilascu, it is one thing to defend the integrity of the Republic of Moldova in Tiraspol, and another, if you state, in your cage, that Romania is your homeland. In what capacity were you there and what was the purpose of being in Tiraspol?" Not wanting the Republic of Moldova to become "a province or domain of other countries," Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader, supports the presidential point of view militating for an independent Republic of Moldova, eventually united with Moldavia on this side of the Prut River. During a recent meeting with the electorate of the Cantemir Rayon, Motpan said that, after the genuine consolidation of Moldova's statehood, the PDAM "will proceed to the unification, but not with the whole of Romania, but merely with Romanian Moldavia." Unfortunately, the agrarians are the ones who can most easily manipulate public opinion in villages, both at the 27 February 1994 elections and during the so-called sociological referendum on 6 March 1994, considering that the majority of peasants rely on the kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders, who constantly put pressure on them due to the directives received from the "center."
