Burbulis, a member of the Russian State Duma, and head of the humanitarian and political center "Strategia," made the remark in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. He also said reformists must pursue a "more realistic" course of reforms and acknowledge mistakes that have been made over the past two years resulting in bankruptcies and unemployment. More emphasis must be placed on securing the livelihood of pensioners and other disadvantaged citizens, he said. In an apparent barb at the new cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Burbulis warned that the country's problems cannot be solved by such measures as excessive issuance of currency, which would fuel inflation, and reckless issuance of subsidies for state farms and industry. He was speaking amid widespread speculation that market reforms are threatened by last month's cabinet shakeup and the departure of leading free marketeers Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, and Liberal Social Welfare Minister Ella Pamfilova. Chernomyrdin has argued that the reshuffle was necessitated by the strong showing of ultranationalists and Communists in December's parliamentary elections. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has vowed that reforms will continue but has largely distanced himself from the new cabinet. Burbulis, who is a leader of Russia's Choice, the largest party in the lower house of the legislature, is visiting Tokyo as a member of the Russian delegation to a two-day trilateral forum between Russia, Japan and the United States on problems of security in the north Pacific, which ended Wednesday.
