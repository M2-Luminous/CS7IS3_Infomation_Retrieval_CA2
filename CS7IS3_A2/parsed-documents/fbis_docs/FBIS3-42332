Mark Robinson, 47, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome and a former minister, and Tony Worthington, 52, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken on Wednesday night with Action Aid external relations manager Jeff Chinnock. The MPs were abducted near Erigavo, northwest Somalia, during a week-long fact-finding mission in the Horn of Africa country wracked by famine and bloody feuds between local warlords. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm that they are at the Action Aid office in Erigavo and we understand they will fly out tomorrow." The spokesman said it was too dark to consider flying the released men out tonight.
