On 31 January, the government decided to send back to Tehran two people suspected of terrorism, no doubt to avoid possible reprisals. For a government which wants to terrorize the terrorists this is not very brave. [Juppe] Everything has already been said about this matter -- the interior minister explained on television under what circumstances he proposed to the prime minister that this decision be made, and the prime minister thus made this decision for the reasons he gave himself. [Giesbert] Yes, but we do not understand the reasons. [Juppe] They were quite clearly explained, it was for reasons of state. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] When the Swiss minister, Arnold Koller [head of Department of Justice], says that France has lost some of its credibility in the fight against terrorism, should one not admit that he is right ? [Juppe] I do not think that Switzerland's credibility in this field is much greater than that of France, and in any case, combatting terrorism is not a matter of keeping on one's national territory those who organize terrorism. [passage omitted] The government's determination not to give in to anyone, the determination of [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, in particular, to ensure that France is not a rear base for international terrorism can not be doubted, and furthermore we have shown this on several occasions with action against the PKK -- the extremist Kurdish party -- and the FIS [Algerian Islamic Salvation Front]. This takes great courage and great organization on the part of the government. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] The other matter, which is much more important, is, of course, the appalling Bosnian tragedy. Yesterday, a further five peacekeepers were injured in Sarajevo. Does this not show that General Cot is right when he says that our peacekeeping soldiers are tethered goats waiting to be killed? [Juppe] I will leave the responsibility for this expression with him, because I believe that our soldiers on the ground are doing an admirable job. Having said this, General Cot is right that the situation on the ground is untenable today, and the tragic thing in this matter is that, despite all the efforts we have made, no peace process has begun. What is in the process of beginning today is a process of war, as all the protagonists on the ground, and I mean all the protagonists, today want, and are seeking, war. [passage omitted] If we do not break this process of war then we are heading for an unprecedented catastrophe. [passage omitted] People have to know that we can not make peace among people who systematically seek war. [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, you have just said to us that the situation is untenable, so what can be done? [Juppe] What are we trying to do? I repeat, to break out of this spiral of war and violence. [passage omitted] If this spiral continues, what will happen? First, all the UN Protection Forces, our soldiers, our blue helmets, will be increasingly exposed, as we saw again yesterday, and the logical consequence of all that is that at some point or other -- and this is an argument which has already arisen in certain countries that have sent peacekeepers to the spot -- we will be led to withdraw them, and if we withdraw them, Sarajevo will fall, and a disaster, an unprecedented explosion of warfare will take place in the heart of Europe, in the Balkans. So, this must be stopped, and this is why we want the NATO summit on Monday and Tuesday to take a strong position. I have heard people saying here and there that we were making an appeal to the Americans.... [Giesbert interrupts] Yes, we are throwing ourselves at the Americans, are we not? [Juppe] Let me laugh when I hear that, let me laugh. Can you imagine for 30 seconds that on Monday and Tuesday the 16 member countries of the Atlantic Alliance -- the Americans, but also the Germans, the British and the French -- will meet in Brussels to discuss the stability of the European continent without saying a word about the situation in former Yugoslavia? [passage omitted] [Giesbert] This matter concerns Europe, above all, and Europe is not doing anything. [Juppe] This matter concerns all those who are involved with the security of Europe. [passage omitted] I am trying to bring about progress, and I can not allow it to be said that Europe is not doing anything -- Europe has thousands of soldiers on the ground, and several have died or have been injured; Europe is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to fund humanitarian aid; Europe has not ceased taking political initiatives over the last few months. [passage omitted] [Juppe] I want to talk about what we will try to do on Monday and Tuesday, but first please recall that there is a political plan to attempt to find a way out of the current situation, and it is the European Union which has put this political plan on the table. [passage omitted] The second thing that has to be done is for the 16 countries of the Atlantic Alliance to declare themselves ready, if this peace plan is signed, to guarantee its implementation on the ground, by developing an adequate ground force; and third, the countries of the Atlantic Alliance must say that they are ready to help the United Nations in applying the resolutions of the Security Council, which means reinforcing the ground forces, the troops on the ground, and also real protection of the security zones. In particular France also... [Giesbert interrupts] [words indistinct] [Juppe continues] Excuse me, but this is very important, because there are people dying there -- no one will be dying in Brussels, at least I hope not -- and France's additional proposal is to reopen Tuzla airport, which is at the heart of central Bosnia, so that humanitarian aid can be brought in there. In Brussels, as you mentioned just now, we are going to talk first of all about the European defense identity, the adaptation of NATO to its new missions, notably to what is happening in Yugoslavia, and finally its extension to include countries of the East. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Good Day.
