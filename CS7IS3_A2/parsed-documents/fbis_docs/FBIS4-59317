[Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome. To begin with, I would like to thank you for your interest in this issue. In fact, what happened last night was a very horrible event. As usual, we sent cars, along with doctors and nurses, for an inspection. At the same time, approximately 35 killed or wounded people were evacuated. This figure includes nine dead children, women, old men, and youths. Naturally, the injuries varied from serious to slight injuries. All are now at the General Military Hospital. [Correspondent] Dr. Ibrahim: Will there be any future effects from these missiles, or effects on those in the vicinity? [Al-Ruba'i] Psychological cases do affect people in the surrounding area. These cases differ from one person to another, depending, of course, on individual will. Such cases will be referred to psychiatrists who can diagnose them. [Correspondent] What about the hospital's capability to treat the wounded people? [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God, there is good capability. There is coordination with the brothers in the Ministry of Health. As soon as we need specialists in some types of surgery, we refer the cases to the [word indistinct] hospital, for example, or to the Republican Hospital, or to Kuwait. However, the opposite can occur. There is a complete [word indistinct]. [Correspondent] Praise be to God. [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God. May God grant us success.

Thank you very much, Dr. Ibrahim al- Ruba'i, deputy director of medical services for medical affairs at the military hospital. [Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome.
