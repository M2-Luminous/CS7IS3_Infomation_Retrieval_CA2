Kingdom's Relations With Islamic World Are Excellent"] [Text] Jeddah, AL-HAYAH -- The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has stressed that his government is not prepared to tolerate mistakes related to the Islamic faith and that it has no intention of harming any Saudi individual through his wealth. He spoke of the "strength of Saudi relations with the Islamic states." He said: "We are the friends of all within our capabilities and within mutual interests." In a comprehensive statement to the media on 22 April during his inspection tour of the central station of the prophet's holy mosque services in holy Medina, King Fahd said: "In the midst of the bliss we are enjoying we should expect that someone would come and try to spoil it, but nobody would be able to do that because the people and all their institutions are unanimous in preventing and deterring these things." He emphasized that divine will, not human capability, was behind the completion of his project for the expansion of the prophet's holy mosque. He said: "Some people said that the project would require 20 or 30 years to complete." He added that he had made the decision and assumed the responsibility, and the project was completed. He noted that "since the beginning of work on the project, God's boons and favors have increased for us." He said that oil production and prices have increased. In his statement King Fahd said that "God has blessed this country. It has had no colonialism and no interference in its affairs. It is fortunate that the people of this country always, in private and in public, raise their hands to the creator of the universe adhering to their true Islamic faith that is free from blemishes, everyone doing his duty as dictated by God. This a divine bliss and we should thank God for it day and night, in good and in bad times, at all times." He added: "We have had innumerable boons. There is no better testimony than the facts. The facts speak for themselves. Thank God, our relations with the Islamic world are excellent. Our relations with the states with which we have relations are also excellent. We have no bad relations with anyone at all and we owe nobody any favors, except the almighty God. That is why we should be grateful to the gracious almighty God." The custodian of the two holy mosques added: "Yes, we are Muslims, thank God, and we adhere to our Islamic faith in letter and spirit, but some things are not related to that." He added: "We have human resources in our country today. If we look at the students and experts of theology in this country, and those entrusted with the affairs of Muslims for the purpose of pronouncing Islamic edicts [ifta']...we would find very excellent resources and raw material." King Fahd added: "There can be no doubt that the theological resources which educate the citizens, the judges, and the Shari'ah courts -- the state has nothing to do with and does not interfere in any of these things.... We do not want anything from anyone. We only want to be friends with everyone. We do not want to interfere in problems in any way, not international problems, not Arab problems, not African problems, and not Asian problems. We want to be friends within the limits of our Islamic faith. We cannot, under any circumstance, swallow or accept anything that runs contrary to the Islamic faith. Nobody except God can impose his will on anyone. I say this because it is a fact. It is a fact about this country dating back to the fathers and forefathers." He added: "The imams of Islam have long recorded, analyzed, and explained this fact. The Koran and the prophet's teachings are the constitution of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I do not believe that anyone can claim otherwise. We are everyone's friends within the boundaries of our capabilities and mutual interests. We want nothing but friendship and respect from any country in the world. As regards what has taken place in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the form of construction and doing one's duty, be it the citizen or the state, the projects speak for themselves. We are perhaps the least pretentious and do not try to project matters in the media or in a propagandist way, but (projects) speak for themselves in a country which 20 or 30 years ago had no resources. I say that because I was there and I know this very well." He added: "Where else do resources come from, if not from God. We have the oil. When oil was discovered the war broke out and stopped everything. I can say that since 1953, or perhaps 1955, the oil began yielding an output, not the required output but as the years went by that output began to enable the state to launch projects." He contined: "I was very happy that God enabled me to make these extensions in the Mecca mosque, and in the squares and buildings, and to make the roof improvements, and the same applies to what we now see in Medina. That will not stop at any limit. We will continue the good work in the interest of Islam and the Muslims." He said: "The best social system, as they say, is the Islamic system. It is unmatched. It has gentleness and kindness and it has God's words." He added: "We have a wealth of theologians who have performed their duties in the best required way, be it in the Shari'ah courts, as imams in the holy mosque, in the holy Medina, or anywhere else in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." He continued: "Naturally, amid all these boons and graces we are enjoying, we should expect that some would try to undermine them but, by God, they would not be able to do so because all the people and their institutions are unanimous in their resolve to prevent or deter these things by legitimate means. We want nothing from anyone. All we want is for the almighty God to bless us and forgive the mistakes we unintentionally commit. I beseech God to show us the way and to guide us to what would be to his satisfaction. These projects we see now, whether in Medina, Mecca, or anywhere else in the country, have penetrated mountains as roads and reached the mountain peaks in 'Asir, and have reached the sea. Some are open roads, others pass through mountains. Roads have been built from north to south and east to west. And I do not say that that is all we want to do." In conclusion, King Fahd said: All this is a result of adherence to the letter and spirit of the Islamic faith. As regards mistakes, they have been mentioned in the Koran and in the teachings of the prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be upon him, and the Orthodox Caliphs. The correct path would not have been known if there were no mistakes, but mistakes do not last and the state will absolutely not tolerate mistakes related to the faith. That will not be tolerated. There is no desire to upset anyone or harm him through what he owns. The state has never harmed anyone through his wealth. On the contrary, we bless everyone and wish them well. We have now seen projects which began some years ago and have now reached their peak.... They provide the evidence that God has enabled us and ordered us to do that work. If I am to be credited for that work, I am not alone in that." [closing quotation mark as published]. He added: "I am only completing a mission. I hope God will help me in any work I undertake in this country in the interest of the public provided it does not violate the Islamic faith in any way. We want nothing but good for everyone, but we will absolutely not let anyone come and change our faith or our organization of our Islamic faith because it is all good and it is all bliss. We see now that our relations with the world are at their best possible because we do not interfere in anyone's affairs and do not want anyone to interfere in our affairs."
