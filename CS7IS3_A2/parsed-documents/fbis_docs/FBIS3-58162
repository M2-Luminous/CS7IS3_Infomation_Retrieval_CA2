"It is good to make commitments but we must keep them tomorrow," Mitterrand said at the opening session of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's two-day summit here, according to spokesman Jean Musitelli. France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities. But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act, warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on the ground. Musitelli said U.S. President Bill Clinton told the summit that Washington was ready to go along if "each country assumes its responsibilities to implement what will have been decided." Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the 10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia. British officials said the summit would do little more than reaffirm the August decision to put its air power at the United Nations' disposal if requested. "Reaffirming them means being ready to implement them. The situation could evolve in such a way that would call for their implementation," one said. France has also called in recent days for the boosting of UN forces in Bosnia and application of UN Security Council Resolution 836 aimed at using Western air power to protect UN troops and Moslem "safe areas." British Prime Minister John Major said the summit had to consider "what realistic help we can continue to give to keep Bosnians alive and encourage the peace process." Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana told reporters here that the 21-month-old conflict embroiling Bosnian Serbs, Moslem and Croats "is a conflict that does not have a military solution." He said the UN presence in Bosnia "will not be eternal" and a decision on its future would have to be taken after the winter if a peace accord is not struck. Clinton also reiterated the United States' readiness to send troops to Bosnia to help police and enforce an eventual peace agreement, if the U.S. Congress agrees, according to Musitelli. But U.S. officials have said congressional approval to provide up to half of a planned 50,000-strong force was in doubt following peacekeeping debacles in Somalia and Haiti. The leaders were expected to discuss Bosnia as well as the situation in Russia over dinner Monday night, officials said. The foreign ministers of France, Britain, Spain and Canada, which are contributing the bulk of the UN troops protecting relief operations in Bosnia, were to confer at the same time.
