"Through the CSNPD's fault and because of its intransigence, we were only able to examine a certain number of problems," the minister, who led the government delegation to the Bangui talks at the end of February, stated on national radio. The objective of these talks, which were held under the auspices of the Central African Republic [CAR] authorities, was to sign a peace agreement between the government and the CNSPD. They only resulted in the signing of a simple joint communique between the two sides. "Right from the start, the CSNPD laid down conditions. When one goes to a negotiation and starts with conditions, it often does not bode well," Mr. Izzo added. Despite this, he added, "we examined these conditions, but the meeting was only able to agree on matters of principle, particularly on the cease-fire, the withdrawal of the republican guards from the south of the country, and the free movement of goods and persons." According to reliable sources, Moise Kette had demanded at the opening of the talks the withdrawal of the republican guards -- an elite unit under the exclusive orders of President Idriss Deby -- as well as the holding of a referendum within a short time in order to institute federalism in Chad. The republican guards have been accused of molesting civilians in the south of the country, thus provoking a massive exodus towards the CAR. In June 1993, a cease-fire agreement was signed between the Chadian Government and the CSNPD.
