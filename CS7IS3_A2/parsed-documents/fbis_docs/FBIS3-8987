Boris Yeltsin did refrain from shaking hands with the man who has been accused of committing war crimes unheard of in this century, but the fact remains that official Moscow honored Karadzic in many ways that are by no means fitting to his real significance and status. Karadzic was a Moscow prima donna for three days. He was received by top politicians, he met with cultural and political figures, and reporters were always tugging at his sleeve. The Chetnik leader had reason enough to glow with pleasure. Namely, his dream about winning Russia's approval for his ideas and war aims had come true. Although Russian officials have verbally tried to relativize and represent this sudden closeness with the Pale gang as objective mediation in the Bosnian negotiation process, even laymen understand that Russia is in effect taking up high patronage not only of the rebel Bosnian Serbs, but of the Orthodox part of the former Yugoslavia. The Kremlin has two objectives: To use the Bosnian crisis to bring their diplomacy back into international focus, and to reestablish the southern Slav part of Balkans as their interest sphere. For the time being, at least as far as the first objective is concerned, Russia is doing more improvising than actually playing the role that it would like to play in the Bosnian crisis. Using a cheap trick in cooperation with its friends in Pale, Russia tried to win the points in the game with the NATO ultimatum that eventually led to the resolution of most of Sarajevo's war problems. The trick was repeated upon Karadzic's arrival in Moscow, when the Russian- Serb agreement on the reopening of Tuzla airport was flamboyantly declared. The Kremlin diplomats triumphantly ascribed the main role in the humanitarian unblocking of the Tuzla region to themselves, although they understand that the UN would have conducted the operation with or without the Russian-Serb approval. However, Russia has succeeded in something here, as in the Sarajevo case: It has reinforced its military presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Using the logic of following the path of the least resistance, the UN has accepted Russian control role of the airport, as they accepted a similar role for Russian soldiers in Sarajevo. However, the question arises as to how far it is possible to go. The ultimate Russian intention is to, in agreement with Belgrade and Pale, deploy its soldiers in all the Bosnian buffer zones as peace arrives in them. This is the line Karadzic followed in talking to the presidents of both parliamentary councils of Russia, whose have the final word when it comes to sending Russian troops out of the country. There are many reasons to consider the possibility that, following the trends of Russian policies employed so far, Bosnia will soon be divided and militarily neutralized like post-war Germany, with internal borders seemingly there inevitably to divide the country, marked by Russian troops on one side and Western troops on the other. Russia wants to work on this arrangement hand in hand with Washington. The United States has so far refused the Moscow initiatives for returning to the principle of division of interest spheres. However, no one can guarantee that this will not eventually happen. Chiefs of diplomacy, Kozyrev and Christopher, are meeting later this week in Vladivistok, and Bosnia will be the center of attention. The Kremlin has planned to close the circle started with Karadzic by then directly contacting Croatian and Muslim leaders. Haris Silajdzic accepted Moscow's invitation, but did not want to rush off to Moscow, which wished to see him the same evening that Karadzic was leaving. It seems that the head of the Bosnian Government also refused the honors that he was offered, certainly aware of the false hospitality that the Russians were suddenly offering. By going to Moscow, he acknowledges Russia's importance in the resolving of the Bosnian crisis. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is doing the same. He will be visiting Russia's capital at the same time as Silajdzic. For the time being, there are no indications that Russian diplomacy will mediate between the three people who have been negotiating on Bosnia for a long time and without much success, but it is quite possible that some of Karadzic's important messages will be conveyed to Silajdzic and Granic by Kozyrev and Churkin. The matter primarily concerns territorial demarcations within Bosnia- Herzegovina. To conclude, let us say that Moscow is very interested in what lies behind the Muslim-Croat agreement signed in Washington, which it both wants and fears. It wants the agreement because it effectively legalizes its aim, which is to break independent Bosnia- Herzegovina definitely into pieces, and fears it because the unification of the Bosnian Muslims and Croats with the Republic of Croatia can easily lead to another escalation of the war, that is, to the creation of a Muslim-Croat anti-Serb block! Russia is prepared for either case. Everyone involved in deciding on Bosnia's future should be aware that in either case Mother Russia will undoubtedly be a Serb sponsor, and is, for the sake of its protege, prepared to risk as much as its own international prestige.
