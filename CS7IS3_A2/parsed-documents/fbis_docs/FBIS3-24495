These photodetectors are suitable for operation in a structure of three-dimensional integrated microcircuits with optical linkages. Of the familiar types of GaAs photodetectors, the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors are the most attractive from the point of view of being able to obtain ultimately high speed and sensitivity, and because of their technological compatibility with the fundamental element of GaAs integrated circuits - the field effect transistor. The structure of the examined MSM-photodetector is described and its spectral characteristic is shown in a graph. As shown in the curves, the maximum spectral sensitivity is located at the absorption edge of the gallium arsenide (_l_[.sup]1[/]=0.87, where a sharp peak is observed. The second maximum appears at _l_[.sup]2[/]=1.2-1.3 ï¿½m. Presence of two spectral photo-sensitivity regions with different characteristic times, offers an additional capacity for controlling the information flow using two wave-lengths. Results of studying the indium phosphide photodiodes are discussed and graphs showing their cross section and topology, as well as their volt-ampere characteristic are provided. The spectral characteristic of an InP photodiode is also shown in a graph. Figures 7, references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western
