He said there would be no change to the EU-Japan agreement on market access, signalling that the commitment to open the EU market by the end of 1999 must stand. But he held out the prospect of a substantial aid package to help restructuring and hinted that he expected to see further mergers along the lines of the Rover-BMW deal. Unveiling a Commission strategy paper on the future of the European car industry, Mr Bangemann said: "We are not advocating mergers, (but) we do believe that not all the European car industry have the necessary size to compete in the world market." He urged European car makers to target emerging markets in the Far East and Latin America for both sales and production. The commission is pushing for better market access for EU car exports in Japan, U.S., South Korea, East Europe and Turkey. The agreement struck between Japan and the EU in July 1991 envisages the progressive opening of European markets to Japanese imports by 2000, allowing Japanese exporters to increase market share when the European market is growing. The Commission report calls for measures to tackle the structural weakness in the European car industry including: 1. Allocating EU funds for retraining workers, with up to ECU4bn of EU funds potentially available. 2. Developing joint programmes of research and development, with ECUl.3bn of funds likely to be earmarked between 1994 and 1998. 3. New measures to smooth the operation of the internal market, such as streamlining the distribution system and harmonising vehicle taxes. 4. Introducing a range of environmental standards, aimed at promoting cleaner and more efficient cars.
