He said that the BoT agrees in principle with the need to promulgate such a law. The BoT has discussed the principles and framework of this law with Mr. Tharin Nimmanmoen, the minister of finance. It is felt that such a law will eventually be promulgated. As for reports that the BoT has not taken a clear position in supporting the promulgation of this law because of the fear that this will affect foreign investment in accord with the policy of providing financial freedom, Mr. Wichit said that if this law is implemented, it definitely won't affect foreign investment. Mr. Wichit said that the BoT is now studying this in detail, including the limitations, responsibilities, means of implementation, and effects of this law. It has compiled data and participated in seminars with other countries that are in the process of implementing such laws. The results achieved by countries, such as Singapore, that have already implemented such a law are being considered, too.
