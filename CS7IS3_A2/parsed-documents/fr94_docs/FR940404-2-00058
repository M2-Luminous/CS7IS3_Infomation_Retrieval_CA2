FR940404-2-00058 FR940404-2-00038 Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of February 21 Through February 25, 1994 During the week of February 21 through February 25, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Appeal Ed Bricker, 2/22/94, LFA&hyph;0349 Ed Bricker filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Office of Inspector General (IG) of a request for information submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Eight of the documents responsive to Bricker's requests were withheld in their entirety pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), and certain material in 18 other responsive documents was withheld pursuant to the same two exemptions. Subsequent to the filing of Bricker's Appeal, the IG informed the Office of Hearings and Appeals that it had adopted new policies regarding its withholding of information under the two exemptions. The IG stated that because these policies were not in place at the time of its initial determination, an additional review of the documents at issue would result in more information being released to the appellant. In light of these changes, the matter was remanded to the IG to conduct a further review of the documents so that additional information could be released. In all other respects, the Appeal was denied.
