The police confirmed that the incident occurred at 0230 in the morning (0830 GMT) when a 1993 Ford Grand Marquis car that had been loaded with explosives blew up. The vehicle was parked in front of the "Camichine" room of the aforementioned hotel. Relief and security offices have reported that the explosion destroyed 10 vehicles, including the bus of the "Los Huracanes" musical group, and broke the windows of the room where a birthday ball was being held to celebrate the 15th birthday of Karine Ramirez. Judicial Police Director Roberto Machuca Aguilar commented that the party started last night and that the room for the ball had been rented by a lady whose last name is Fernandez Castro, apparently from Sinaloa State. Of the six people injured, who were sent to different health centers, five were identified as Jorge Castro Angulo, Alberto Menchado Montes, Arturo Rangel Martinez, Ramon Perez Velarde, and Jose Andres Gonzalez Padilla, 38, 30, 46, 34, and 20 years of age, respectively. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1450 GMT on 11 Jun 94 reports from Mexico City that "according to local reporters, the car bomb could have been placed as an act of vengeance between drug trafficking bands that operate in Guadalajara or as retaliation for the arrest of Manuel Quintero Payan, related to a powerful drug trafficking band." The AFP report adds that reporters have linked the arrest of Quintero Payan to the car bomb "because the people who attended the girl's birthday party talked like `northeners' and thus are associated to the drug trafficking bands."]
