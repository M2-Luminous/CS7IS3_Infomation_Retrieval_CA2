According to the Treaty on Payments, the debtor must pay this amount by the middle of the following month at the latest--in this instance, 15 February. The equivalent of 46.1 million ECU's, which Slovakia owes for January, was remitted at the end of last week through a foreign mediator, and it is possible that it will be credited to the CNB account today. In the past, both the Czech and the Slovak parties have stated their intention to close the old clearing lot [debts arising prior to the currency split on 8 February 1993], which serves to cover claims from the time before the currency split. Even recently it was the main cause of the imbalance. CNB Vice Governor Pavel Kysilka yesterday confirmed to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that, at present, the impact of the new lot [debts arising after the currency split] is clearly increasing. It is responsible for almost half the January deficit, and, according to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY sources, another approximately 20 million ECU's have been added to the Slovak deficit since the beginning of February. As a feasible solution to this problem, the CNB has proposed to expand the margin for fluctuation of the mutual exchange rate within the framework of the clearing to twice 10 percent, Kysilka said. This step should be accompanied, however, by other measures--above all, Slovak measures. "It has transpired that the deficit is becoming a more permanent affair, and the Slovak side will have to resort to some unilateral measure that, in the long run, would eliminate this phenomenon. I have in mind such a measure--for instance, as a move in the exchange rate or an import surcharge," the vice governor added. Finance Minister Kocarnik recently definitely refused an unofficial proposal by the Slovak side to extend the margin credit by several dozen million ECU's. At present, the Czech Republic provides Slovakia from its state budget a credit in excess of 6 billion korunas by means of clearing. The closing of the old lot and a modification of the Treaty on Payments is currently being discussed by expert groups, a high-ranking official at the Finance Ministry, Milan Galler, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. According to him, however, it has not yet been decided when this work will be concluded in an agreement. Because of the ongoing talks, Kysilka has not specified the date when the representatives of the two countries are to meet concerning the clearing.
