Despite the possibility that Croatia will soon "sail" into international sanctions, the "ship" of state does not show any visible signs that something serious is happening. The course remains the same. One hears an angry but inconsequential foreign policy debate carried on by the opposition. According to FERAL TRIBUNE, for a short while the opposition even succeeded in convincing a part of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] that Croatian foreign policy was misdirected. However, both soon grew silent as if they were afraid of their combined strength. A possible introduction of sanctions against Croatia certainly would not be enough to shake the image of the president who takes credit for everything in the country. However, the sanctions could probably cause suspicion and mistrust and lead to uncertainty as to what to expect next. Enumerating these factors, Marinko Culic concludes that the next moves by President Tudjman will be interesting, especially with regard to his relations with that wing of HDZ which wants the international sanctions -- as the best environment for creating the Croatia it wishes for.
