Meanwhile, Enrique Iglesias, IDB president, noted that the first guarantee to control a nation's foreign debt is to maintain "clean public finances and good administration by the government." Both officials closed the 35th annual meeting of the IDB Governors Assembly and the Inter-American Investment Corporation (CII), where they stated that the IDB's new commitments and new agenda are to support the overall economic and social development of the region through dialogue and attention to the programs that combat poverty and encourage the private sector. In a news conference at the end of the meeting, Enrique Iglesias said that the economic liberalization policy undertaken by the Latin American governments "is totally coincidental with the policies of social improvement. Other models that were applied did not solve this issue, they made it worse, as is clearly demonstrated by the hiperinflationary crisis, which is the greatest burden on the most destitute in Latin America." When reporting on the new organization of IDB capital shares, Aspe explained: There is a new attitude on the part of the United States toward the region as well as toward extra-regional European and Japanese participation. "What we have said is that the United States truly regards the region increasingly as a current and potential associate; this is resulting in a much more balanced and solid relationship. By reducing its shares in the IDB, the United States will participate in capital replacement without resorting to additional budget resources. The official explained that the IDB Governors Assembly will meet on 10 June in Washington DC to establish the strategy to be followed in restructuring the CII so that its activities are not duplicated by those carried out by the IDB in the programs earmarked to finance the private sector, particularly infrastructure works. Enrique Iglesias suggested that the IDB members who insist on pushing the economic reform process specifically improve internal savings with procedures similar to those used in the southeastern nations. Iglesias said that the IDB has indicated its willingness to support the governments in implementing voluntary family planning policies and in reducing military expenses so that investments are directed toward productive activities. Meanwhile, Iglesias disclosed that the IDB will seek to reduce its internal costs "because we feel we cannot preach austerity to the governments without practicing it in our own home. It is said that charity begins at home." The IDB president also explained that as a result of restructuring the bank's capital, two additional seats were created on the board of directors which still have not been assigned to any nation. In the next 60 days, a decision on this will be discussed with the multilateral organization's. One seat will be for a Latin American nation and the other for an extra-regional nation. Nevertheless, it has transpired that one of these seats is practically assured to Japan, while the other is being disputed by Chile with other Latin American nations. In this context and during his participation in the fifth full assembly, Mario Read, a Dominican Republic minister, acknowledged the eighth replacement of IDB capital took place amid fierce debate. At times, the possibility of transforming the IDB from a promoter of economic and social development into an institution with a predominantly financial tone, was considered. Meanwhile, Barry Hudson, UK alternate governor, indicated that the mission at this time is to make the best use of the large increase available in the bank's financing.
