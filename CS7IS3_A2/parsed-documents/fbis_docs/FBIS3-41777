For fairness' sake, it must be said that cases in which this disease has been discovered in Russian territory have been been noted before. They were all, however, attributed to the disease being carried in from abroad. The biggest cholera outbreak occurred in 1990 at one of the tourist hotels in the Stavropolsk kray, where 49 persons took ill and were immediately hospitalized as a result of contact with infected arrivals from Siberia. In the past 2 years, the infection was brought in to our country from Indochina: In 1991, two such cases occurred, and in 1992 there were already five. The situation has continued to worsen this year. In July-August alone, 17 patients and carriers of the vibrio linked to cholera being carried in from India, Pakistan, and Turkey have been recorded in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. Although physicians have somehow become accustomed to cholera imported from abroad, the occurrence of ``local'' foci of cholera on Russian territory has not been seen since the end of the 1970s and has become an unpleasant novelty for them. Nevertheless, the absence of patients did not, in the specialists' opinion, mean that cholera was completely over within the country. Vibrios have been isolated from open water reservoirs in many regions, including in Moscow, even in the best years. The storm finally hit this summer. A fishermen who drank untreated water from the local canal became ill and died in Kaspiysk (Dagestan). The disease was also discovered in his wife. At the republic hospital in Makhachkala, a 4-month-old child has been found who contracted the disease elsewhere. A second case of cholera caused by local sources has already occurred in Moscow. Here on 8 August, a vagrant suffering from cholera was brought to the No. 2 Clinical Infection Hospital. Yet another person from those with whom he socialized turned out to be a carrier of the disease's causative agent. If one considers that there are generally 10 carriers of the cholera vibrio for one patient, it is entirely possible that he may not be the last. Physicians continue to actively seek all those who had been in contact with the patient.
