FR941102-1-00011 FR941102-1-00002 (ii) If more than one crack is found on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius, prior to further flight, install the applicable P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (3) For cracks exceeding 4.0 inches, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (c) If cracks are found in the web face in the area of the huckbolt fasteners but not in the bend radius during the inspections specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, accomplish the following at the time specified in accordance with the instructions in Beech SB No. 2360, but do not stop drill the cracks because it is possible to damage the structure behind the web face: (1) For cracks less than 1.0 inch in length, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) If not more than one crack on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure web face is found, within the next 200 hours TIS and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS, reinspect each crack for progression and repair accordingly. Upon the installation of the applicable P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, the repetitive inspection time may be extended to 500 hours TIS. (ii) If more than one crack is found on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure web face, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (2) For cracks more than 1.0 inch in length, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) If not more than one crack on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure web area is found, within the next 25 hours TIS, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (ii) If more than one crack is found on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (3) If a crack passes through two fasteners but is less than 0.5 inches beyond either fastener, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) If not more than one crack on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure web area is found, within the next 25 hours TIS, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (ii) If more than one crack is found on either side of the wing forward spar carry-through frame structure bend radius, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, and reinspect at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (4) If a crack passes through two fasteners but is more than 0.5 inches beyond either fastener, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (d) If cracks are found in both the web face in the area of the huckbolt fasteners and the bend radius during the inspections required in paragraph (a) of this AD, accomplish the following in accordance with the instructions in Beech SB No. 2360: (1) If only one crack is found on either side of the airplane, prior to further flight, repair each crack in accordance with the criteria and instructions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) or (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this AD, as applicable. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (2) If more than one crack is found on either side of the airplane, accomplish one of the following as applicable: (i) For any crack that is 1.0 inch or more in length, prior to further flight, install the applicable Beech P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (ii) For any crack under 1.0 inch in length, within the next 200 hours TIS and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS, reinspect each crack for progression and repair accordingly. Upon the installation of the applicable P/N 36&hyph;4004 Kit, the repetitive inspection time may be extended to 500 hours TIS. (e) If a fuselage skin crack is found around the opening of the lower forward carry-through fitting, prior to further flight, obtain repair instructions from the manufacturer through the Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) at the address specified in paragraph (g) of this AD, and incorporate these instructions. Reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the initial or repetitive compliance times that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Wichita ACO, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Wichita ACO.
