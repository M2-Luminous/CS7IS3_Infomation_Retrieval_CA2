FBIS4-23976 "drafr119_a_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-119 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire New Prime Minister on Government, Priorities New Prime Minister on Government, Priorities AB1906201194 Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network in French 1900 GMT 18 Jun 94 AB1906201194 Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network French BFN [Text] Returning to the country where there have been developments in the formation of a new government following the HCR-PT [High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament] election of new transitional Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo, the president of the Republic not only fulfilled his duty by signing the ordinance to confirm the election of the new prime minister within the deadline prescribed by the law, but he also held private discussions with the reelected prime minister. Lumba Nakapasa asked Kengo Wa Dondo a few questions: [Begin recording] [Nakapasa] President Mobutu Sese Seko received Prime Minister-elect Kengo Wa Dondo only 24 hours after the head of state's return from Tunis. Accompanied by his only bodyguard, the next tenant of the Hotel du Conseil spent two good hours with Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko before sitting down to table. These are sure signs that the heads of the two important institutions of the transition are prepared to work well together. Already, there is every sign that the Mobutu-Kengo relations will be cautious and noncombattive. Kengo Wa Dondo answers my questions: [Kengo Wa Dondo] As you know, I was elected prime minister on 14 June. Yesterday, the president's ordinance confirming my election was made public. It was normal for me to meet him to review the general situation in the country and examine the prospects for the formation of the government of national union that everyone is expecting. [Nakapasa] So there will be a kind of cautious cooperation between the two of you, cautious cohabitation, I mean. [Kengo Wa Dondo] No, we constitute...[pauses] by recognizing the strengths of everyone and asking for the three institutions of the Republic -- president of the Republic, High Council of the Republic- Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], and the government -- to be able to cooperate. This cooperation must be made through consultation and I think we have to respect the provisions of the Constitution. [Nakapasa] So when will the government be ready? After how long? Can you give any date now? [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the peculiar arrangement entitles the political class to begin consultations at its level, then make proposals to the prime minister. Politicians are busy holding consultative meetings presently. We hope that over the weekend the political parties will submit their first proposals. This will enable us to hold discussions with everyone so that we can successfully reach the necessary consensus on the formation of this new government in which everyone will be involved. [Nakapasa] This includes the ministers from what is known as the radical wing? [Kengo Wa Dondo] I have stretched out my hand since my election. I will insist that everyone feel concerned about the government. It is the only way to form a government that will satisfy the public opinion. Where they is a will there is a way. If there is the will, I think we will succeed. [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, you know that the country has suffered complete disaster. There is deterioration at all levels. At which level will you start restructuring? In short, what will be your priorities? [Kengo Wa Dondo] First and foremost, I will try to restore state authority. The state is not present everywhere. The recovery of the economic and monetary situation depends, above all, on state authority. The social aspect depends on the economic one. We are first going to begin by reestablishing state authority. We will then reorganize the economic, financial, and monetary environments, and lastly, rehabilitate the basic infrastructure. [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, I can read a very great assurance on your face. What can you do concretely in 12 months of transition? [Kengo Wa Dondo] I can do what the time limit permits. The deterioration which you now deplore can be traced to the beginning of the transition. If everything has been destroyed in four years, then you must give minimum time to those who are going to redress the situation. We will do everything we can to ensure minimum recovery before the presidential, legislative, regional, and local elections and install the institutions of the Third Republic. [Nakapasa] Mr. Prime Minister, to be successful, you need, I think, the contribution of everyone at home and abroad. Is external aid guaranteed? We know that at home for example, the Union of Employers was very harsh about you. How is that going to take place? Apparently, you cannot count on its support. We can recall what everyone knows -- fiscal terrorism. [Kengo Wa Dondo] Yes, yes, but well, actions are far from words. We are going to invite everyone. The crisis has not affected only a small part of the population. It has affected everyone, and those who want to work in a sound environment must hold dialogue with the government. The government is not against anyone, much less the prime minister. If he wants to be a man of consensus, he must cast his net wide. I would like to be a man of consensus and so with everyone. We can hold dialogue on issues on which we differ in order to reach a compromise. [Nakapasa] You are said to have external support. Is this support simply imaginary or something concrete? What can be the contribution of foreign countries by your current presence at the head of the government of the country? What can we expect? [Kengo Wa Dondo] First, the foreign countries can only give us their assistance if we ourselves make an effort to ensure minimum development and show seriousness in the management of public affairs. Its assistance can only come as a support afterwards. We have to make the greatest effort first. It is our country. We must not look directly up to foreign countries. This country is capable of being self-sufficient. Let us show that we are capable of doing something to draw foreign countries to our country, like it is done in other countries today. [Nakapasa] What is the difference between the first commissioner of state that you were and the prime minister that you are going to be, or rather that you have become since the presidential ordinance has been signed? [Kengo Wa Dondo] Well, there is a lot of difference. The prime minister is a coordinator of the executive, pardon me, the first commissioner of state is a coordinator of the executive, but the prime minister is head of the government and he has special assignments that the HCR-PT member has conferred on him. We expect to exercise all the prerogatives that the HCR-PT has conferred on us. [end recording]
