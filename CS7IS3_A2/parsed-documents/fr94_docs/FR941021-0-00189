FR941021-0-00189 FR941021-0-00022 IV. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 225. Need for Rules and Objective. We have codified proposed rules that will permit Big LEO systems to be licensed. Our objectives have been to promote efficiency and innovation in the licensing and use of the electromagnetic spectrum, to develop competitive and innovative communications systems, and to promote effective and adaptive regulations. 226. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis. No comments were received specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. We have, however, taken into account all issues raised by the public in response to the proposed rules. In certain instances, we have eliminated or modified our proposed rules in response to those comments. 227. Alternatives that would Lessen Impact. The minimal regulatory burden that we have imposed is necessary in order to carry out our duties under the Communications Act and other Federal statutes. We will continue to examine these requirements in an effort to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to minimize significant economic impact on small businesses. V. Conclusion and Ordering Clause 228. By our action today, we are adopting regulations that will allow the licensing of competitive voice and data Big LEO systems. This service has the potential to provide the United States public with a wide range of needed mobile voice services and to help stimulate the domestic economy as these multi-billion dollar systems are implemented in the United States and throughout the world. 229.
