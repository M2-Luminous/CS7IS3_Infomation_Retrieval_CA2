[Prefecture], Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan's first fully domestically developed rocket, the H-2, blasted off successfully on its maiden flight Friday [4 February], putting an unmanned prototype space shuttle into circular orbit, the state space agency said. After one pass around the earth at an altitude of about 450 kilometers, the experimental space shuttle code-named Orex splashed down as planned two hours 10 minutes later about 460 kilometers south of Christmas Island in the mid-Pacific, said officials of the National Space Development Agency (NASDA). The mission has put Japan among the leading nations in rocket technology, opening up prospects for potential commercial satellite launches, NASDA officials said. Engineers at Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan cheered when the rocket ignited and took off from the center's launch pad at 7:20 A.M. [2220 GMT], leaving a thick orange condensation trail in the morning sky. The lift-off was delayed by 20 minutes because a ship unexpectedly entered the area where the H-2's solid rocket boosters were to plunge down after the launch. Originally the lift-off had been set for Tuesday but was postponed until Friday because of bad weather and a faulty air duct that came loose. The rocket released the 860-kilogram cone-shaped Orex from inside the payload fairing at the top part of the rocket some six minutes after the launch. Fourteen minutes later, the H-2 delivered a 2.4-ton satellite, called vehicle evaluation payload (VEP), into a high-altitude orbit, where it will circle the earth for four days to confirm launch performance. On reentering the atmosphere, Orex conducted various tests that will help in research and development of a future unmanned space shuttle called Hope, expected to be launched around 2005. Compared with its predecessors, which contained a number of foreign-made components, the two-stage H-2 rocket has a bigger engine and can carry a bigger payload. Due to an improved fuel tank and fairing, the H-2 is only half as heavy as the European-developed Ariane-4 rocket, but reportedly equals its capability. The 50-meter-long H-2 can deliver a single two-ton satellite into geostationary orbit. For the first stage the H-2 uses a newly developed liquid- hydrogen rocket engine called LE-7, which is said to be more powerful than previous versions, and is claimed to rival the engine of the U.S. space shuttle. The H-2 has so far cost some 270 billion yen to develop. Preliminary testing began in 1985, and NASDA started actual development testing in 1986. The initial goal of launching the first H-2 rocket in early 1991 was revised when scientists said it required more advanced technology. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has said it will use an H-2 to launch a satellite to measure rainfall in the tropics in 1997. At present the high cost of the H-2, which at 19 billion yen -- including launching fees -- is five times higher than for a satellite launch by Ariane, are the obstacle to widespread use of the rocket in commercial projects, officials said. To increase Japan's competitiveness in the international rocket market production costs must be substantially reduced, they said.
