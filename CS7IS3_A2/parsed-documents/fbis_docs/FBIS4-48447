FBIS4-48447 "drafr097_a_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Kigali Hospital Shelled, 30 Reported Killed Kigali Hospital Shelled, 30 Reported Killed AB1905084394 Paris AFP in English 0815 GMT 19 May 94 AB1905084394 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Nairobi, 19 May (AFP) -- About 30 wounded people were killed in their beds when a mortar shell slammed into Kigali's main hospital early Thursday [19 May], a United Nations spokesman said, quoting reports by witnesses. UN officials were on their way to the hospital to check the report, spokesman Abdul Kabia said. It was unknown who had fired the mortar shell. Fierce fighting between rebels and Army soldiers erupted overnight around Kigali Airport and prevented a UN relief plane from landing, Kabia said. Artillery and small arms fire resumed overnight in various parts of Rwanda's capital, which had been relatively quiet for several days. UN officials shuttled between rebel and Army commanders Wednesday in their latest attempt to win an agreement to make the airport a UN-controlled neutral zone. But a spokesman for the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front said the airport remained a military target because it was surrounded by government artillery positions and there was a big Army camp nearby.
