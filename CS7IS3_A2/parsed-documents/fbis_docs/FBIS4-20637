Construction of Japan's first engine wind tunnel capable of testing the ramjets required for spaceplanes has been completed at the Kakuda Research Center. The opening ceremony was held on 7 October 1993. The ceremony was attended by 137 guests including former Science and Technology Agency Director General Soichiro Ito and the Space Activities Commission's Acting Chairman Tamiya Nomura. The test facility was shown to the visitors at 2:30 p.m. and the ceremony was held at the Kakuda City Center at 4 p.m. The construction plan was authorized in FY88 and construction began in 1989. The facility can simulate on the ground engine inlet conditions equivalent to Mach 4, 6, and 8 during flights at altitudes of between 20 and 35 km. In order to heat high pressure gas to a maximum of 2300�C at up to 100 atmospheres of pressure, heat reservoir and combustion heaters are used together. The heat reservoir heater, 2 meters in diameter and about 10 meters in height, contains aluminum oxide bricks which operate as a heat exchanger. The combustion heater burns a hydrogen and oxygen mixture. The ramjet is placed in an air current which is accelerated through a supersonic nozzle with a 51 cm square outlet to measure the engine performance and the pressure and the temperature of every part of the engine. In order to approximate altitude conditions, the ramjet engine test facility is connected to the exhaust system of the existing rocket engine high-altitude sky performance testing facility and the pressure in the low chamber where the engine and propulsion measuring equipment is located is lowered to 1/10 - 1/100 atmospheres. This testing facility is the first of its kind in Japan. Other features of the ramjet and scramjet performance test facility, one of the best facilities in the world, include: 1) Ability to simulate a wide range of flight conditions from Mach 4 to 8. 2) The world's largest facility able to test up to Mach 6 using pure gas heated by a heat reservoir heater. 3) Comparison of engine performance within heated pure gas and combustion simulated gas. 4) Simulation of engine regenerative cooling through control of the temperature of hydrogen and engine fuel, from -253�C to 500�C. 5) Ability to measure the main thrust, and vertical moment generated by the engine. The engine wind tunnel will be used not only for testing high-speed flight range in Japan, but also as a significant resource for joint use by the rest of the world. At present the National Aerospace Laboratory [NAL] is making a water cooling type subscale engine prototype as Japan's first scramjet for testing. Comprehensive engine performance tests are scheduled in this new test facility. Through the tests, the results of the research conducted so far on elements such as air inlet, combustor, and nozzle, parts of the engine and cooling structures will be reconfirmed. NAL will clarify the mutual interference effect when different elements are combined. NAL intends to further promote ram-/scram-jet engine research by completing a test engine that best combines those elemental features. The program has had its ups and downs since initiation in 1986. The most crucial task was to expand the cross-section of the wind tunnel to twice the size of that originally planned space specifications for the engine tunnel called for a precise combustion simulation and cooling structure. Also the pressure required by the facility had to be increased because the simulated flight altitude at Mach 8 was decreased from 40 km to 35 km. The above two tasks strained both budget and technology. However, with much support from concerned parties, including Kobe Steel and the Science and Technology Agency, the facility has finally been completed. The exterior building was constructed in cooperation with Tohoku Region Construction Bureau and Ishihara Construction Co., Ltd. and the facilities were prepared in cooperation with Yuatech and Nissin Setsubi.
