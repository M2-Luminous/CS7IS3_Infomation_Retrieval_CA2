FR940216-1-00015 FR940216-1-00008 Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Rule The proposed rule would amend two parts of Chapter II of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations: Part 261_Prohibitions, and Part 262_Law Enforcement Support Activities. A section-by-section discussion of the changes proposed to each part follows. Part 261_Prohibitions Subpart A of this part sets forth acts and omissions that are prohibited throughout the National Forest System. Subpart B grants authority to Regional Foresters and Forest Supervisors to issue orders and regulations prohibiting certain acts in specific areas. Subpart A_General Prohibitions Section 261.1␣Scope This section establishes when the prohibitions of the subpart apply. The punctuation in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) would be revised to make clear that the conditions set forth in §261.1(a) are in the alternative (i.e. that all conditions need not apply, just any one of them). Paragraph (a)(3) currently provides that the rules of the subpart apply to an act or omission that affects, threatens, or endangers persons using the National Forest System or Forest development roads or trails or persons engaged in the protection, maintenance, or administration of such. As written, the rule protects Forest Service employees only when they are engaged in their duties and does not apply to situations where Forest Service employees are threatened or intimidated during ``off-duty'' hours as a result of an action taken while they were on duty. This situation can be remedied by revising paragraph (a)(3) to refer in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to threats to or endangerment of persons engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties including the administration of the National Forest System. Existing paragraph (a)(4) would be revised to clarify that these regulations apply within the boundaries of those components of the National Trails System or the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System that are administered by the Forest Service. A new paragraph (a)(5) would be added to provide the agency a means of protecting personal property of forest users in the absence of a response by local law enforcement agencies. At present, if a forest user has personal property stolen or damaged (for example, an ice chest or sports equipment) the Forest Service must rely on State or local law enforcement personnel to investigate and charge the person responsible. However, in many cases, local law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to investigate these cases in a timely manner, and while the Forest Service has authority to investigate the case, it presently has no basis in its regulations for charging a person with misdemeanor theft. This is understandably a source of frustration to forest visitors victimized by theft, especially when trained and equipped Forest officers may be in the area where the theft or incident occurred and are able to identify the person(s) responsible. This addition to the rule would bridge this gap in law enforcement in those cases where local law enforcement agencies cannot respond in a timely manner. Paragraph (b) of existing §261.1 exempts certain activities allowed for by statute that otherwise may be a violation of this part. The paragraph currently cites The Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Mining Law of 1872. The provisions of other laws which would also apply are not included. The paragraph would be revised to make clear the agency's intent to exempt from the prohibitions of this part any activity that is conducted in compliance with other regulations set forth in chapter II. A new paragraph (c) would be added to make clear that the existence of these rules does not prevent the Federal Government from proceeding with necessary criminal action codified in Federal statutes rather than under these regulations. This revision is necessary to comport with the fact that the United States Department of Justice determines when the Federal Government should pursue criminal sanctions under Federal statute. A new paragraph (d) would be added to clarify that unless intent is stated in specific provisions, strict liability applies to these regulations. The prohibited acts set forth in 36 CFR part 261 are offenses in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or are offenses in the nature of inaction where the law imposes a duty ( Morisette v. United States, 341 U.S. 262 (1952)). Such offenses ``render[s] criminal a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the community's health or safety,'' ( Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 426 (1985)). Thus, for example, a prohibition of unauthorized livestock on national forest land without regard to whether a person intended to place such livestock there would tend to ensure that a person exercises diligence to prevent resource damage. A person should know that the use of Federal lands is subject to stringent regulation, and that action or inaction in violation of such regulations can cause irreparable harm to the public or the land and its resources.
