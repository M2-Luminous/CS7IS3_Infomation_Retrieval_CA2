The acetophenone-destructor strains were isolated by a conventional procedure of direct soil suspension inoculation on an agar-treated mineral M9 medium containing acetophenone as a sole carbon source. The experimental procedure is outlined. The acetophenone-destructor strains were tested in waste water assays in 250 ml bulbs with 100 ml of waste water at a 10[.sup]7[/] c/ml inoculation density. The component concentration was measured by gas chromatography and spectrophotometry methods. Six strains capable of growing in agarized mineral media with a 500 mg/l acetophenone concentration as a sole carbon source were isolated from the 38 samples taken from phenol-producing enterprises. One was identified as Azomonas macrocytogenes No. 139 and one--as Pseudomonas putida No. 8. The remaining strains were nonpathogenic gram-negative bacilli. The isolated strains were capable of utilizing acetophenone in an up to 500 mg/l concentration; as a result of selection, they improved their ability to degrade this substrate in a 625 to 1,250 mg/l concentration in 96-120 h. The substrate utilization and biomass accumulation dynamics during acetophenone biodestruction by strain No. 8 of Pseudomonas putida as a function of its concentration is plotted. After total utilization of the toxic substrate by the strain, the culturing liquid was less toxic than the initial acetophenone solution for a number of test microorganisms. In the authors' opinion, the isolated cultures are quite promising for microbiological waste water treatment. Figures 1; tables 1; references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.
