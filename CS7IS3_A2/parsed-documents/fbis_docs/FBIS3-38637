[Wasch] Foreign Minister, do you not think that it is easy for Austria, which is not a NATO member, to call for air strikes? [Mock] It is not at all easy. What we do is abide by the principles of the UN Charter and international law; we have always said coercive military action should be the last resort. However, if such action is necessary to halt aggression and to create, at least, a chance to find a way out of chaos, then one can only pursue this course. [Wasch] Do you think NATO will be influenced by Austria's demand? [Mock] Certainly not. Nevertheless, we have been asked, and I have been invited, to participate in a conference of neighboring countries in Geneva. I will stick to our course there. If others think that order can be restored by dividing up recognized countries, or by rewarding aggression -- then this is their opinion with which I will not identify. However, one will have to regard that as a most serious warning for medium-sized and small countries. One will have to be aware of the fact that the law hardly counts in current international politics, all that matters is strength.
