Witnesses who saw the corpse say that Naim Bajrami was killed by a single shot in the back, that his jaw was broken, and that he had facial injuries. The victim and his family had been recently wanted by the Serbian police on the pretext of a search for weapons. A statement issued by the Party for Democratic Action in Presovo states that a delegation of this party went to the site of the murder and discovered that Naim Bajrami had been killed 2 km from the border with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], while, at about 1000 on the same day, a Serbian soldier had fired on the minor C.M. from the village of Miratoc. It is now known that the young man wanted to leave Kosova because he and his family had been harassed for a long time by the Serbian police on the pretext of collecting weapons. It is striking that this murder is a sequel to the torture and persecution being carried out against the Albanians in Kosova, especially in recent weeks. However, this murder has another significance. Of the five murders commited by Serbian forces in the last two months, four of them, including the most recent, have been in border areas. Two Albanian citizens were killed in the border zone of Kosova and Albania. An inhabitant of Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic] was killed in the Kosova-Macedonian border zone. The most recent case, the murder of Naim Bajrami, took place in the Serbian-Macedonian border zone. These murders are a clear sign of the increased military presence of Serbian forces in Kosova's border areas with Albania and Macedonia. The murders and the increased fortifications of the Serbian forces occurred at the time when NATO sent the Serbs an ultimatum to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and when Greece began to increase the frequency of incidents on the Greek-Albanian border. The aggressiveness of Serbian forces also increased in these areas at the time of the NATO ultimatum to lift the blockade on Gorazde and other UN-protected areas in Bosnia. The inhabitants of Zhur [Zur], Vermice [Vrmica], and Han i Elezit have been continually mistreated by Serbian military forces in recent weeks. Belgrade has so far not made the slightest mention of the murder of Naim Bajrami, while directly blaming Albania for the murder of two Albanian citizens a few days ago at Morine near Gjakove [Djakovica], accusing Albania of being a factor of "regional instability." It is evident that the murders of the two last months have been concentrated on border areas with the intention of sending a clear warning to the Albanians that, while they live under torture and continual punishment in Kosova, entrances and exits to this area are under strict control. It is not difficult to see that Belgrade now intends to confront the Albanians with extreme solutions, and with the dilemma of acquiescence or rebellion.
