Kohl assured the Polish delegation of his committment to improving Polish-German relations. He recalled Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's declaration of 1949 in which Adenauer considered German reconcilation with former enemies -- namely, the French, Jews, and Poles -- as one of his goals. After the meeting, Oleksy told a news conference that the talks focused on the significance of the present stage of Polish-German relations for Europe and for overcoming the fears of the past. He also said he expected German support in negotiating the Partnership for Peace, for which Poland wanted a good agreement. While addressing the Bundestag, Kohl stressed that the Partnership for Peace was one of the most significant results of the NATO summit in Brussels. He added that it opened up prospects for membership and there was no reason for disappointment. The German chancellor also stressed the values of the Partnership for Peace, although he said he understood the anxieties and needs of nations in East Europe, especially Poland. He added, however, that it was particularly Germany which should take into consideration Russia's fears of isolation. Earlier in the day, the Polish delegation met with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. The two sides stressed the significance of parliamentary contacts. Suessmuth said they were marked by considerable progress, and added that the German-Polish parliamentary group had 108 members. Oleksy said Polish-German relations were very good, but he stressed they still could improve. He also assured his German interlocutors that democracy in Poland was safe and did not depend on the results of each election. The Polish delegation met also with Hans Stercken, head of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee. Stercken and Oleksy emphasized the importance of parliamentary contacts in Polish-German relations. Oleksy declared that Poland's Euroatlantic security was unchanging. "We see Poland's strategic security in European structures," he said, adding that Russia must not be isolated. The Sejm speaker also said during the news conference that Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak was expected to visit Germany soon. According to unofficial sources, the visit could even take place in the first half of February. "The opposition won the elections in Poland, but there was not an earthquake and nothing like this will happen. We are a country of high political stability, a country where extreme attitudes are put in their proper place and are marginal," Jozef Oleksy said while delivering a speech at the German-Polish Society on Thursday evening. Present at the meeting were German industrialists with head of the commission for East German economy Otto Wolff von Amerongen. Oleksy also pointed out that Polish political elites no longer feel hostility toward Poland's western neighbor, and stressed that he hoped prejudice against Poles no longer existed in Bonn. Oleksy appealed to German industrialists to invest in Poland. He pointed to the fact that the Federal Republic, Poland's largest trade partner, placed sixth as far as the invested capital was concerned.
