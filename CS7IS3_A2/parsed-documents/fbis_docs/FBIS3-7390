Pyongyang's threats against Seoul started with remarks made by the chief North Korean delegate to the failed eighth round of inter- Korean talks. Chief delegate Pak Yong-su called the South's strong reaction to the North's refusal to allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its declared nuclear facilities "a renunciation of the special envoy exchange, a declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war." "We're fully prepared to counter words with words and swords with swords," he said. When his South Korean counterpart expressed concern about the mounting tension in inter-Korean relations, Pak snapped, "Don't worry. Do you think Seoul is far away from here? Do you think the South will be safe when the North is inflicted with damage? Seoul is not far from here and when war breaks out Seoul will be a sea of fire." The Workers' (Communist) Party newspaper, the NODONG SINMUN, blamed the South for the failed inter-Korean dialogue, saying in a commentary carried in the March 20 issue that Seoul had "virtually declared confrontation and war" when its delegate used wild language that provoked his counterpart at the meeting. Radio Pyongyang warned in an interview program aired on Sunday that the situation would lead to another war on the Korean peninsula. The chief North Korean delegate to the failed working-level talks on exchanging special envoys issued a statement Monday denouncing the South's strong steps including resumption of the "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United States. Calling the measures "a renunciation of the special envoy exchange," he charged that the South is leading inter-Korean relations to the brink of war. In a statement issued by the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland on Tuesday and in a commentary Radio Pyongyang aired the same day, North Korea harped on the danger of war while intensifying its propaganda offensive against the South -- even asking South Korean soldiers to disobey their superiors. North Korea's leaders, while creating a sense of crisis among their people to put them on alert for war, are instigating South Koreans to overthrow their government and fight against America. Radio Pyongyang urged, in a commentary also aired on Tuesday, that South Korean workers build a democratic government "on the grave of the reactionary government," recalling labor strikes in September 1946 and March 1947, according to the official North Korea watcher NAEWOE press. It also called on South Korean students to rise up against the United States, reminding them of the student raid on a U.S. Embassy facility 12 years ago. It said, "America is the root source of the South Korean people's sufferings, pain and unhappiness, and it is America that has heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula to increase the danger of war." North Korea's threat of war aims at breaking the Seoul-Washington system of cooperation in dealing with the nuclear issue, analysts say. The North had no intention of exchanging special envoys with the South even when it proposed the exchange last year. It was made simply to counter Seoul's proposal to form a joint North-South Nuclear Control Committee, according to the analysts. This became clear when North Korea opposed including a clear provision on an inter-Korean special envoy exchange in the four- point agreement it reached with the United States in New York in February. The North Koreans simply agreed to resume working-level talks with the South Koreans on the exchange. When North Korea denounced the inclusion of an exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the next round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks, it showed its intention to break off the dialogue with an eye to excluding Seoul from its talks with the United States on the nuclear issue. In this light, U.S. President Bill Clinton's letter to President Kim Yong-sam on Monday reaffirming America's defense commitment to South Korea dealt a blow to the North Koreans' wish to break up the Seoul-Washington cooperation system. As before, North Korea's propaganda offensive against the South is designed to create social confusion in the South and spur South Koreans into anti-government and anti-American struggles. North Korea also wants to maintain its political and social stability and solidify the position of Kim Chong-il as heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song by heightening tensions. North Korea's propaganda tirade against the South is expected to intensify further when Team Spirit resumes and the IAEA steps up the pressure for additional inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea.
