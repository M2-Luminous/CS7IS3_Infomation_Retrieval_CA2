We have the noncommital remarks of Malian Defense Minister Diocounda Traore, speaking to Muriel Pomponne: [Begin recording] [Traore] The national pact provides a unique framework for resolving this crisis in the northern part of the country, and we believe there is no alternative. [Pomponne] So there is to be no military management of the crisis, but instead political management of it? [Traore] Not exclusively military handling of the crisis, but basically political handling of it. There is no special redeployment of the armed forces in the north. We are still occupying the same locations, the same positions. We have not occupied any new positions. [Pomponne] Has there been any increase in the number of men deployed in the north during the last few weeks? [Traore] Yes, certainly, in line with the strengthening of security in the north, it is quite normal that we should reinforce the units we have on the spot there to some extent so that they can handle their obligations better.
