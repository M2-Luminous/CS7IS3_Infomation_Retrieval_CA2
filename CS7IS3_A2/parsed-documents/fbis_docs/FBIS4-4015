Dai Bingguo said: "The visit, with rich contents, was of great significance and remarkable success" It will certainly move relations between China and the Central Asian nations toward a greater depth and breadth. The visit has achieved the desired objective of enhancing mutual understanding and trust, promoting the relations of good-neighborliness and friendship, and expanding mutually-beneficial cooperation. He particularly mentioned the important speech delivered by Premier Li Peng in Tashkent. He said: It was the first time that a Chinese leader had quite completely and openly expounded China's basic policies toward the Central Asia countries. What he expounded are China's permanent, basic principles, not expedient policies. His speech fully showed China's respect for the sovereignty of those countries, and its good intentions for promoting regional stability and development. The speech has aroused a positive response among the Central Asian nations. It will certainly yield a far-reaching impact on the relations between China and the Central Asian countries. As time goes by, the principles proposed in the speech will show their increasing vitalities. The visit has enabled us to see many common stands shared by China and the Central Asian nations: Both sides want to maintain long-term relations of good-neighborliness and friendship, be good friends and good neighbors, and develop friendship and cooperation in all fields. Both sides maintain that every country should choose its own political system, ideology, and road of development according to its own situation; all countries are equal regardless of size; and a new, just and rational international political and economic order should be established. Both sides are anxious to maintain a lasting peace and stability in the Central Asian region and oppose national splittism and other activities detrimental to regional stability. Both China and these countries expressed their desire to strengthen mutual consultations and cooperation in international affairs. Dai Bingguo said: In Almaty, Premier Li Peng made an important six-point proposition on developing economic cooperation with the Central Asian countries. Both China and the Central Asian countries want to continue to expand and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation on an equal footing, enrich the contents of cooperation, increase the forms of cooperation, improve the environment of cooperation, and enhance the benefits of cooperation. Chinese entrepreneurs who accompanied the premier on the trip had wide contacts with their counterparts in the four Central Asian countries, and reached a series of agreements and signed a number of letters of intent on cooperation with the latter, indicating a good start for cooperation between the enterprises of the two sides. Dai Bingguo emphasized: During the premier's visit, the Chinese Government signed a series of bilateral cooperation documents with the governments of those countries. The most important of them is the Sino-Kazakh border agreement. The conclusion of the agreement was an event of great historic significance, and it will yield a far-reaching impact on the development of bilateral relations. Dai Bingguo said: During the talks between Premier Li Peng and Kyrgyz leaders, both sides shared the willingness to settle their border issue at an early date. The settlement of border issues between China and these countries will help us create a good border environment.
