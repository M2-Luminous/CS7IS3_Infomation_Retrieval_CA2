It has been a serious phenomenon for a long time that state-owned enterprises owe one another loan repayments and this seriously hinders their operations. For this reason, it is very necessary for the state to concentrate some capital to clear the debts of key industries in addition to settling bank bills to strengthen credit measures by the banks. It has been learned that the state-owned loss-making industrial enterprises for which the State has decided to give support in terms of circulating funds comprise the following six types: Enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose production and marketing rate is greater than 93 percent; foreign-trade export-oriented enterprises which make profits from exports and have export orders but lack circulating funds for the execution of contracts; enterprises whose production continues all the year round and whose products are marketed in a particular season or whose production lasts for a particular season and whose products are marketed all the year round; enterprises with clear loss-curbing goals; enterprises which ensure that [loss-curbing] measures are implemented; and those enterprises which have begun to produce profit-making products and hope to curb losses in one or two years. For these six types of state-owned loss-making enterprises, the relevant banks will grant support loans using the average amount of the actual loans of circulating funds obtained between 1991 and 1993 as the base. These enterprises should pay back the loans as scheduled in accordance with the loan contracts. If they fail to do so, their banks can stop offering loans to them. This preferential circulating-fund policy also means that the State's loans to profit-making industrial enterprises this year and next generally will not be lower than the amounts in 1993. It will increase loans to enterprises whose returns are good appropriately, in keeping with deposit status of the banks in the current year. When deciding to offer loans of circulating funds to state-owned enterprises, the relevant quarters specifically stressed the need to pay attention to integrating production and marketing and to continue to strictly limit the production of unmarketable and overstocked products in keeping with the principle of "increasing the production of marketable products, limiting the production of less marketable products, and stopping the production of unmarketable products."
