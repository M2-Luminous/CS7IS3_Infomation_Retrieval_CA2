In a public lecture several days ago, Huang Ting said that the burdens on Guangdong's enterprises have not been lightened very much. Financial reform is not keeping pace with the needs of development, funds are lacking, and it is difficult to proceed with the development of the capital market. At present, Guangdong has to strictly implement the central authorities' macroeconomic policy by controlling currency issuance. On the other hand, however, enterprises are suffering an acute shortage of circulating funds which is estimated to total 10 billion yuan or more. This problem becomes much more serious when we consider that many enterprises in Guangdong have to pool their own funds, are running deficits, or cannot obtain loans. Moreover, since the new tax system was put into practice, some rights concerning tax revenue have been centralized, and some enterprises no longer enjoy such previous preferential policies as the delegation of rights to local authorities and tax reductions. Their losses have therefore increased from 20 percent to 43 percent, and their profits have decreased by 37.8 percent. According to a recent survey conducted by the provincial government, there are still more than four million people throughout the province who do not have enough food and clothing. Guangdong is facing a difficult challenge this year. Huang Ting briefed his audience on the new measures Guangdong plans to adopt this year. In the area of monetary reform, the main focus will be on developing local financial institutions and vigorously preparing the establishment of overseas Chinese banks. The relevant report has already been submitted to the central authorities. Moreover, foreign financial institutions will be encouraged to enter Guangdong, and the entry of foreign insurance firms is even being considered. Enterprises with the necessary conditions are encouraged to issue B shares abroad. Moreover, every effort will be made to guarantee circulating funds for enterprises that have a ready market, produce good returns, and have good prospects. Huang Ting revealed that the central authorities have already fully considered Guangdong's special conditions and are prepared to pump an additional 4 billion yuan or more into Guangdong. Therefore, beginning with the second quarter of this year, the circulating funds shortage facing Guangdong's enterprises will probably be alleviated. On the subject of the fiscal system, Huang Ting maintained that, although Guangdong will have to come up with an additional 20 billion yuan or more according to the new fiscal system, this will be conducive to the healthy development of enterprises in the long term. Moreover, the province continues to allow cities and counties to be responsible for their own finances, and enterprises' responsibility contracts can be extended for two years to help them get through this transitional period. Huang Ting said that this year Guangdong will not introduce new pricing measures to curb inflation. As for reform of the property rights system, attention will be paid to avoiding the indiscriminate transfer of share rights to foreign businesses.
