Why was there no better outcome? [Tudjman] One could agree with your assessment that the result is unsatisfactory and one could also assume that the Croatian delegation is not satisfied with the results. But I think that the meeting was in a certain sense a success because it helped clarify many important questions, and in any case it is important for people to know that Croatian policy is consistent, not only with regard to an end to hostilities but also with regard to all efforts at cooperation and friendship between Muslims and Croats. [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, with all due respect, the whole world is hoping for peace because we all assume there will soon be no more money and no more arms left. Where are you getting the weapons? [Tudjman] The Muslim side has of course some weapons and munitions factories, and one has to say that they have gained a certain advantage by having used humanitarian convoys in order to import high-tech war material. In all wars in the world, there are always some opportunities to gain access to weapons. Over and above this, the Serb side is selling arms at very high prices to every party involved in the war. And they have quite certainly considerable quantities. [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, you could probably call me very naive if I ask why the Bosnians and the Croats don't join forces and fight together against the main aggressor, the Serbs. [Tudjman] At the beginning, the Croats and the Muslims not only made common cause, but the Croats in Bosnia and in Herzegovina defended Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serb aggressor with the aid of the Republic of Croatia, at a time when the Muslims were not able to do this. If that had not been the case, then the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have fallen into the hands of the Serb aggressor. Later, however, the understanding between the Croats and Muslims broke down because at that time, the Serbs had conquered two-thirds of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims, knowing that they could not retake the country, turned against the Croats. That is the set of problems. Even the talks yesterday and the day before were concerned with this particular set of problems. And that is probably why no agreement was reached -- to be precise, particularly because there is the Muslim demand that they should take over the regions inhabited by Croats. [Mueller-Blattau] There is a rumor, Mr. President, that you met Milosevic even before the war, in 1991, to talk even then about the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is that correct, Mr. President? [Tudjman] Yes, that's right. I did actually meet Mr. Milosevic. Following the meeting, I also suggested that Milosevic and I should meet Izetbegovic as well, for these are the three most important people in relation to the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We met in Split. The main topic was at that time the prevention of a possible war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Split we held the same views and positions which we put forward right at the start on the Petersberg.
