He said the only Russian channel in Estonia will be broadcast every day from 18:00 to 22:00. Saarna explained the measure by saying that Russia owed about DM [German marks] 200,000 to Estonian Esttelecommunications for relaying the broadcasts. The Estonian government asked Esttelecommunications to inform Ostankino of its decision and to conclude a new contract envisioning the reimbursement of its debt and regulating other procedural issues before March 28. Otherwise, Ostankino programs will no longer be broadcast on Estonian territory, Saarna said.
