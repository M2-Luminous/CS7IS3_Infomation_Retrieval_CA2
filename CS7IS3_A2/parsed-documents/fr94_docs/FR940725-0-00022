FR940725-0-00022 FR940725-0-00005 The FAA has determined that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the terms of the RFA. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion The FAA has determined that this final rule to establish the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will impose a negligible cost of $550 on the agency. When this cost estimate of $550 is added to the total cost of the Class C airspace program, the Class B airspace program, the Mode C Rule, and the TCAS Rule, the combined cost will still be less than their total potential safety benefits. This final rule will also generate benefits in the form of enhanced operational efficiency. The establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will only impose negligible costs on the aviation community. Thus, this final rule will be cost beneficial.
