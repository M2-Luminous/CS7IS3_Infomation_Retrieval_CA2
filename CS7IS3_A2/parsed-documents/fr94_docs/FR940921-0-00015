FR940921-0-00015 FR940921-0-00009 The emissions summaries for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) are provided below: Table 4._VOC Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 1.13 6.50 8.51 16.14 1996 1.20 6.40 4.93 12.53 2005 1.33 6.30 4.11 11.74 Table 5._NO X Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 378 2.7 4.7 385.4 1996 376 2.7 4.1 382.8 2005 340 2.6 3.4 346.0 The total emissions are projected to decrease in the county and, as a result, the county is expected to maintain the ozone air quality standard. The mobile source NO X and VOC emissions projections for the year 2005 will be the budget for transportation conformity purposes. The air quality monitoring data submitted by the State shows that the area is still in attainment of the NAAQS for ozone. The maintenance plan also includes a contingency measure that the State will use to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone. This is the same plan that is outlined above for Preble County. This county is similar to Preble in that it is a transitional area. The main difference between them is that Jefferson County was never included in the post 1987 SIP call letters issued by USEPA to OEPA (dated May 26, 1988, and November 8, 1989), and was never cited as having RACT deficiencies, as Jefferson County was not in violation of the NAAQS. Thus Jefferson County is not subject to a requirement to correct RACT deficiencies. C. Columbiana County The maintenance plan provided for this county consisted of an emissions summary; and mobile, area, and point source emissions inventories. The emissions summaries for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) are provided below: Table 6._ VOC Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 1.89 10.40 11.69 23.98 1996 1.98 10.60 6.79 19.37 2005 2.25 10.80 5.65 18.70 Table 7._ NO X Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 0.06 4.60 7.00 11.66 1996 0.06 4.80 6.03 10.89 2005 0.07 4.90 5.05 10.02 The total emissions are projected to decrease in the county and, as a result, the county is expected to maintain the ozone air quality standard.
