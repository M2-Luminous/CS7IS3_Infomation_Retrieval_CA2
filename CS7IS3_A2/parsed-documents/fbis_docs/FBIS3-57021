As I have learned, deputies should have completed their discussion on the briefings by General Attorney Shaladonaw, Interior Minister Yegorov, KGB Chairman Shyrkovskiy, Foreign Minister Kravchanka, and Border Troops Commander Bacharaw regarding the Lithuanian incident -- the detention of Lithuanian communists Burokevicius and Jarmalavicius, who were accused of participating in the bloody events of 1991. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to listen to the debate. Therefore, I have to wait for a recess and hope that someone will show courage and relate to me the course of the discussion on this issue and its results. The recess has been called, and deputies are currently exchanging their opinions on this issue. [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] My interlocutor is People's Deputy Aleksandr (Parun). What is your assessment on this incident? [(Parun)] As a matter of fact, there has been no incident. What has really occurred was fulfillment of bilateral agreements signed between the Republic of Belarus and Lithuania. Another issue is that, de facto, we lack strong state authority, and due to that, the law has been violated at different levels. The Attorney General's Office should have issued a warrant to arrest the previously mentioned individuals, and it failed to do so, giving a verbal order by telephone instead. Second, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which conducted this operation along with representatives of the Lithuanian special services, carried out this job without written permission from the Attorney General's Office. The reports by the KGB chairman and the foreign minister, which were requested by numerous deputies, showed that the very lack of strong authority and the lack of a system of subordinating these services to state authority is leading to various violations of the law. The essential resolution which should be adopted by the Supreme Council should concern not only this incident, but also other episodes in which the rights of our citizens on territories of other republics and citizens of other republics on our territory were violated. Everything should be done in a manner enabling us to finally establish a strong state authority. [Rutkowski] Is it possible that we will wake up one day and there will be different authorities -- power will be assumed by a foreigner? [(Parun)] We should know what is going on in our country, and we should prevent attempts to violate our Constitution. [Rutkowski] However, the question of what is hidden behind this political action still remains unanswered. I have addressed this question to People's Deputy Yawhen Huskevich. [Huskevich] In my opinion this is politicizing. The campaign against the power structures -- the KGB, the Attorney General's Office, and the Interior Ministry -- establishes the framework for a coup. I believe so because what has happened does not deserve two days of discussion behind closed doors. Today, we have fulfilled this duty and heard those reports. [end recording] What will be the final result of this story? I believe we will find out soon.
