At 18.98 billion French francs [Fr] (2.15 billion pounds), the new budget is just 1.2 percent above the 1993 figure of Fr18.76 billion -- less than inflation. In keeping with worldwide trends, the proportion of CEA funding coming from military sources is falling, although both military and civilian funding from government agencies show slight increases, at Fr8.85 billion (+0.9 percent) and Fr6.54 billion (+1.6 percent) respectively. Funding from external sources, such as contract work for the nuclear industry, is up 2.5 percent to Fr3.56 billion. Of Fr10 billion for civilian projects, Fr8.57 billion is devoted to research and Fr317 million to teaching, education and international collaboration. The remainder will meet financial needs such as interest charges and anticipated retirements. Nuclear-related research now accounts for 59.6 percent of the 1994 budget (58 percent in 1993), with pressurized water reactor (PWR) safety (Fr509 million), laser enrichment (Fr447 million) and the renewal of civilian power plant installations (Fr566 million) as major items. Other allocations reflect the CEA's current strategic aims in fuel storage and disposal: Research on the separation and incineration of actinides and long-lived fusion products (the SPIN programme), gets a 20 percent increase to Fr257 million; and the CAPRA programme, which is studying the use of fast neutron reactors to reduce plutonium stocks, goes up 12 percent to Fr217 million. Research into the temporary and long-term storage of radioactive waste sees a record rise of 31 percent to Fr134 million and, in line with the aims of the nuclear industry, R&D programmes on the next generation of PWRs and on MOX [mixed oxide] nuclear fuels also get funding boosts -- up 24 percent (to Fr172 million) and 18 percent (to Fr115 million) respectively. But all service activities relating to engineering and production are to be transferred to the industrial sector once they are sufficiently near-market. This particularly affects nuclear fuel cycle pilot installations, where the budget falls 27 percent to Fr204 million. There is also a dramatic decrease in funding for fast neutron reactors (FNRs), coinciding with the closure of the European Fast Reactor (EFR) programme. The CEA notes with satisfaction the technical progress made through the EFR studies and has cut the FNR budget by 44 percent to Fr74 million. Nuclear topics allied to the environment, biology and health, will receive about 10 percent of the total research budget. There are substantial increases in several key sectors: About 10 percent for radiation protection and radiobiology (to Fr188 million), and Fr133 million for the Protein 2000 programme, which aims to study, design and made proteins for medical and industrial applications. Materials science gets 14.7 percent of the total budget, down 1 percent from 1993. There are rises of 8 percent for atomic physics (to Fr53 million) and 5 percent for fundamental and particle physics (to Fr218 million), but a 13 percent cut (to Fr468 million) for large-scale facilities. This drop corresponds to the slowing down of research at the Saturne accelerator in Saclay, the completion of repairs and refurbishing at the Institute Latre-Langevin in Grenoble, and completion of work at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, also in Grenoble. Technological development -- a major activity at the CEA -- suffers a small drop in budget share, from 16.3 percent in 1993 to 15.7 percent. By concentrating its efforts on strategic sectors, CEA has found increased money for work on integrated circuits and micro-systems (+3.6 percent to Fr375 million), photonics and electro-optics (+4.5 percent to Fr157 million) and for ionizing radiation measurements (+10 percent to Fr61 million). In a final gesture of efficiency, the number of administrative staff will be reduced by 250 by the end of 1994 -- how much money this will save is not revealed in the budget.
