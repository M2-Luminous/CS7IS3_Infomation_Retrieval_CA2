Fujimori added that his government will not reconsider the sanctions imposed on Chilean MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] members. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] I reject the report saying that the helicopter crash was caused by a fuel shortage or poor maintenance. Accidents of this sort happen by chance and are regrettable. They must be investigated in a strictly technical manner. The Air Force has appointed an investigative commission to investigate the accident. The reasons for the crash helicopter must be clearly outlined, because according to the control tower, the helicopter was landing as usual with no problems. [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to investigate the reasons for a possible sabotage of this helicopter? [Fujimori] No possibilities can or should be ruled out. I had even planned to fly to Cuzco before going to Arequipa. I flew with the crew of that helicopter a week ago and everything was normal. I think this was a rather unexpected event. The investigations must be thorough to eliminate all possibilities other than technical or circumstantial reasons. Regarding the Chilean MRTA members, they did not perpetrate these hideous crimes in Chile but in Peru, and they have been sentenced to life imprisonment. I reiterate: I will not reverse my position. They have been tried according to antiterrorist laws. The Peruvian position on this is clear: Peru has a right to peace. [Reporter] Will the sentences be reconsidered? [Fujimori] Not at all.
