People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar rang the changes on the word at least 49 times in his one-hour speech [at the 19 April Congress of Deputies state of the nation debate], and constantly applied it to head of government Felipe Gonzalez, in order to conclude: "Go!" According to the People's Party leader, Gonzalez, with his credibility ruined, has no honorable solution left except to "tender his resignation to the king," and advise King Juan Carlos on the Socialist who should succeed him in the government. Aznar, however, avoided referring to a censure motion or calling for a vote of confidence, and made it quite clear that he does not want an early election now. Gonzalez found grounds in Aznar's reply for making his message clearer. He is not prepared to resign, and his intention is to complete the legislative term. Aznar chose a tactic of wearing down his opponent, but striving to emphasize that he is in no hurry to attain power through an early election. His role was rather that of somebody seeking to take up the general dissatisfaction and strengthen himself as an alternative. In his speech, he left no room for pity: "What will be the next scandal, Mr. Gonzalez? What extremes have we had to go to for this question alone to sum up the state of the nation?" That was the beginning, and the end was the resignation call. In between, there was a lengthy reflection full of direct questions to the prime minister and recollections of the rejections of and votes against committees of enquiry which Gonzalez and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party have reeled off over the past few years. He argued that the head of government, through his passivity, has encouraged the impression of impunity and contributed to the current atmosphere. As a result, according to Aznar, Gonzalez is not only politically responsible for the appointment of alleged corrupt people as chiefs of the Civil Guard or the Bank of Spain, but also "is too late, even to wash his own face." In the People's Party leader's opinion, the promises to investigate the Roldan or Rubio affairs now are just an attempt to ensure that the responsibility falls on "a scapegoat, whom (the Socialists) attack with the fury of the convert." Aznar emphasized that parliament should speak not of the culprits -- a task for the courts -- but of the individuals responsibile for making the appointments and who now should answer for the appointees' misconduct. "It is you," he concluded, looking at Gonzalez's seat, "who are responsible for helping to create the most unbreathable moral atmosphere of our recent history." Aware that Gonzalez's weak spot is credibility, the People's Party leader rubbed salt into the same wound in the second section of his speech, devoted to deriding the announcements of economic recovery. Aznar concluded by denying Gonzalez even the ability to maintain political stability, which is threatened by the atmosphere of public distrust about corruption, and said that he can no longer correct matters. As long as he he stays in power, "we can expect no sincerity, no solution." Hence, according to the People's Party chairman, his responsibility is to resign and hand over his post to another Socialist. Gonzalez opted for taking up the gauntlet and replying to Aznar immediately, without waiting for speeches by the other spokesmen. Much livelier than in the morning, the head of government accused the People's Party chairman of delivering tirades without saying "anything at all" about what can be done with the country. Determined to strike back, the head of government cited the prosecution of Miguel Perez Villar, Aznar's former councillor in Castille and Leon, for the alleged irregular granting of public aid, and asked who takes political responsibility for his appointment. In a parliamentary "look who's talking" gesture, Aznar rejoined that his party voted for the establishment of a committee of enquiry in the parliament of Castille and Leon, and called for one in the Congress over the Naseiro affair, but the Socialists voted against. Gonzalez recalled that the People's Party voted against the application [for lifting parliamentary immunity] of deputy Sanchis, involved in that affair. Aznar announced that his group will call for a committee to investigate the Filesa affair (the application will be submitted at the registry this very morning), and Gonzalez warned him that perhaps he will be surprised if the Socialists accept it and propose extending it.
