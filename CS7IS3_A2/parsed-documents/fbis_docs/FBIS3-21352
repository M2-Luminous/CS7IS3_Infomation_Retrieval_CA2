This was done in an emergency session of the Saudi Cabinet, chaired by the king and held on 1 January 1994. The 1994 budget was allocated 160 billion Saudi riyals [R] (approximately $42.66 billion). The substantial reduction in the Saudi budget is due to the sharp decline in oil prices during the past three months. The price per barrel is less than $13, and this has affected the amount of Saudi revenues. King Fahd referred to this in his speech on the occasion of issuing the budget. He said that the oil economic situation and the drop in world oil prices, resulting from increased supply, has affected Saudi income, which has been reduced from what it used to be. However, the Saudi king expressed his expectations that the present oil situation would not continue as it is now and that "this situation will change at a not far distant time, God willing, if all oil producing countries sincerely cooperate. We hope that this will be achieved." King Fahd stressed the importance of maintaining the strength of the Saudi economy "within the bounds of available resources." He gave support to the value of the Saudi riyal, when he stressed the commitment to preserving its value, which has not changed since 1986. It was noted in the Saudi budget decrees that no reference was made to the true volume of estimated state financial revenues during 1994. On the contrary, the Ministry of Finance's statement was content to say that "estimated revenue for governmental expenditure is R160 billion." This means that the Saudi Government will achieve a balance between estimated income and spending in the new budget by borrowing, and that the value of the deficit that the Saudi budget will experience has not been determined because of the fluctuating oil prices. This has prevented many countries that are dependent on oil for their revenue from determining the size of their financial income. It is said that Saudi Arabia depends on oil profits for 75 percent of its income. Last year's budget, totalling R197 billion or $52.5 billion, had a deficit of R28 billion ($7.4 billion). The Saudi Government was forced to borrow from local banks by using development bonds to cover last year's deficit. It was noted in the decrees for the new Saudi budget that they did not refer to details of expenditures scheduled for each sector, such as the education, health, military, or security sectors. They only referred to expenditures allocated for certain governmental organizations, such as Saudi Airlines, and to expenditures for organizations of higher education and research centers, which totalled R6.3 billion. Despite the reduced spending in this year's general budget, Saudi financial and economic circles have expressed satisfaction with its numbers, pointing out that it continues spending for operating contracts and construction projects authorized in the past. The sum of R43 billion was allocated for them. This shows governmental satisfaction vis-a-vis developing and increasing the role played by the private sector in local economic activity, since this sector has achieved a 5.1-percent growth. This means that the reduction of governmental spending in this year's budget will be compensated for by the growing economic activity of the private sector which, during the past two years, has proved its ability to play an important role in economic development in the Kingdom. This is especially true since the Saudi private sector has high liquidity capable of domestic investment, particularly in industry, agriculture, and real estate. Unofficial statistics estimate the private sector's liquidity at between $14 billion and $20 billion. Immediately after the Gulf war ended in 1991, Saudi markets experienced a significant influx into the private sector of Saudi capital. This capital had been abroad. This contributed considerably to the attainment of reasonable economic growth rates in Saudi Arabia which, last year, amounted to 1 percent, despite world economic circumstances and the decline in oil revenues. In the report of the Saudi Ministry of Finance concerning the fiscal situation with regard to the 1994 budget, it stated: "The 1993 fiscal year saw a significant drop in world oil prices. Oil represents the state's main financial resource, constituting 75 percent of total government income. This decline in the rate of growth of the gross national product has affected all local economic sectors. The growth rate during the past year was 1 percent, as it was the year before that. This is the first report that will be audited and amended in light of final figures, after last year's accounts are closed out. However, if we look closely at one of the gross domestic product sectors, the domestic sector, we find that during 1993, and according to initial estimates, its growth was satisfactory, and was estimated at 5.1 percent compared with last year's rate. "This rate assures continuation of domestic sector expansion and its increased effectiveness. It also proves the continuing growth of the national economy's absorbing capacity, as a result of domestic investments during the past few years. "It is said that one of the main reasons for this improvement is price stability, because statistics measuring the costs of living show that they continued to be low. The annual increase in the last month of 1993 did not exceed 1.8 percent, compared with the same month last year. This is a very low percentage compared with prevailing rates in most world countries. Statistics measuring living costs are obtained by compiling and recording the prices of all kinds of necessities of life, including housing, food, clothing, and any other requirements for life. This measuring statistic represents the rate of increase in all these sectors." Saudi financial circles are hopeful that during the second half of this year there will be an improvement in world oil prices, if all producing states comply with the Gulf initiative announced during the Riyadh summit last month. In this initiative the Gulf states declared their willingness to reduce their oil production levels, if producer nations will also comply with that.
