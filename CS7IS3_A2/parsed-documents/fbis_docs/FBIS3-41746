But the fact is not routine, even in relation to the present times: the Oncological Center is closing for one and a half months, from July 15 through September 1. Is there is no money to support the work of this enormous, unique complex, to treat patients? Such information has already appeared briefly in the press. The Center is actually a bit low on resources. But about this - a bit further on. The Academician explained this uncommon fact by the long-developing necessity for the repair of some of the buildings of the complex, which opened as long ago as 1980. Patients whose treatment cannot be interrupted will continue to receive it; the fate of the others has also been looked after. In a word, the Academician expressed confidence that there will not be patients who have suffered as the result of this action. It is difficult to check this assertion; therefore, let us take the eminent Academician at his word. And although there has been no sensation, you will understand that it made sense to continue the conversation... It is said that AIDS is the plague of the twentieth century. In Russia 500 people have acquired this plague. But in 1990, 700 thousand people in the USSR fell ill with cancer. We now have 500 thousand new cancer patients annually in Russia alone. Five hundred and 500 thousand. But the majority, to please various currents of opinion, are more concerned with the problem of AIDS. Today 42-43 per cent of our patients recover. This is the per cent of recovery of the colored population of the US. It is higher among the white population - half of the oncological patients. It is clear why: the conditions exist for early diagnosis, there is a higher level of medical assistance rendered. So that deliverance from the terrible disease is not only a scientific, medical problem, but a social problem as well. How does it occur, and what are the causes... According to forecasts, at the beginning of the next century every third person will become ill with cancer in the course of his life. Our current social characteristics will have their effect in 10-15 years. It is known that incorrect nutrition is the cause in 35 per cent of cases of the occurrence of malignant tumors, and smoking in 30 per cent. Fifteen after the second world war, the number of cases of cancer of the stomach increased sharply - the deprivations of the war years were taking their toll. Now these tumors, as in other countries, are encountered infrequently. Among tumors, lung cancer leads among men, breast cancer among women. But in 15 years a sharp increase in stomach cancer cases awaits us: todayUs deprivations of the population will take their toll. When I lecture in the labor collectives, it is awkward for me to speak of rational nutrition - people in general are going half-starved. I especially want to talk about smoking. The widespread publicity about the nation's ill health elicits, to put it mildly, surprise. A number of bans and restrictions of local, including Moscow, authorities is not changing the situation fundamentally. It is necessary, as has occurred in the US and Canada, and for which the French public is campaigning, to ban legally the advertising of tobacco products. Note: our politicians give interviews, as a rule, with a cigarette in their teeth (in his time a chain smoker, as are, incidentally, many surgeons, Nikolay Nikolaevich gave this habit up twenty years ago. - T. S.). Or, for example, athletic competitions are going on, and the entire stadium is plastered with cigarette ads. How can this be reconciled? Moreover, smoking fosters the occurrence not only of cancer of the lung, but of the throat, the urinary bladder, the kidney... Americans are a nation more interested in and knowledgeable about questions of health; therefore, in the US in the last 2 years 3 million people have quit smoking... Yes, 30 per cent is an impressive fact. Could you comment on another percentage that has been mentioned: 42-43 per cent of people with a diagnosis, which until now has sounded like a simple death sentence, do recover... This percentage evidently includes cases caught at an early stage. The WHO has proclaimed: early diagnosis saves the patient's life. This is correct. But now, thanks to advances in chemotherapy we cure even some neglected forms of cancer. We cure cancer of the testis in 85-90 per cent of cases, including those with lung metastases. We even eliminate some tumors of the uterus without operative intervention. At our center 100 sick young children are observed, born of women who have experienced uterine cancer. Osteogenic sarcoma is conquerable in 70-75 per cent. Medicine will very shortly be in a position to cure some malignant tumors completely. Even now 80-85 per cent of children with cancer can be rid of the disease. All we need is a full arsenal of preparations, radiation therapy, and highly qualified specialists.S I believe that you have only the latter at your disposal. We have the equipment for radiation therapy: 60 per cent of patients receive it - in pure form and in combination. Linear accelerators are already in use throughout the world. Here they can be counted on oneUs fingers: the Center, oncological clinics in Volgograd and Arkhangelsk. There are another ten RelephantsS, domestic counterparts of American accelerators, with much poorer capacities. Therefore, gamma therapy is mainly used in the outlying regions. But that is a past era. But the greatest problem is antitumor preparations. We are always short of them. One foreign firm has opened a currency pharmacy at the center. Some kind of safety valve, at least. I passed by it. The prices are scary: there are ampoules for 40 dollars each. How much does the treatment of one patient cost? I hope, anyway, it's not up to him personally: shouldn't oncological patients be helped gratis? We charge patients from the CIS. We do not take money from Russians. How much does it cost? One simple example: the modern treatment of a patient with osteogenic sarcoma with preservation of the extremity (previously an amputation was carried out). The cost of an endoprosthesis is 5 thousand dollars. Plus chemotherapy - this is another 25 million rubles. If an enterprise can pay for the treatment, we accept it. We pay for others out of the budget, our commercial activity. But here is a paradox which cannot be explained. We treat from budgetary funds. And there is, for example, the state firm, TFarmatsiyaU. It is ready to send us currency preparations, but it requires 20 per cent of the ruble cover of the cost of these pharmaceuticals from the Center. This is very much like shuffling the same money around different pockets of the same pair of pants. Given such a patient cost, how much money does the state allocate to the Oncological Center? It's easier for me to answer what the budget of our partner, the American National Cancer Institute, is. One billion 200 million dollars. While so far this year we are living without a budget at all. The Russian Academy of Medical Sciences promises: we will give so much for treatment, so much for food, for salaries. And not a word about scientific research, although we are a scientific institution first and foremost. True, I have received pleasant news from the Ministry of Health: the Center is being allocated 2 billion 125 million for the development of expensive treatment methods such as bone marrow transplantation, plastic surgery in oncology... Our last conversation compelled the optimistic percentages of recoveries to fade. Therefore, let us return to the stage of neoplastic diseases when the shortage of funds will not be so tragic for the outcome of the illness, that is, the problem of early diagnosis. The Center has now concluded an agreement with enterprises and organizations to carry out surveys in collectives. We are creating teams of various specialists and equipping them with the most up-to-date equipment. Literally the other day twenty of our colleagues returned from Novorossiysk. A terrible picture is sketched on the basis of the results of these trips. I have in mind not only our patients, but the state of health overall. And a large number of cases of cancer, about which people were completely in the dark, have been identified as a result of each trip. Landings of specialists are not comparable, of course, with a stagnant must-do situation, with a professional examination which cannot be called anything other than a bluff. Certainly, those who are completely in the dark are on the conscience of its initiators... But one center like yours is not enough for all of Russia. And not every enterprise in todayUs conditions can allow itself, obviously, a not inexpensive contract with the Center. In our time we have been leaders in oncological science. But, now... There are national anti-cancer programs in many developed countries. They are reviewed by parliaments, and obtain the necessary financing. The President of the US has a council on oncology; it was headed up until his death by Hammer, who is well known in our country. Congress hears the Director of the National Cancer Institute annually, and only then approves the budget. Russia also needs such a government approach to the problem, which is longer called an exclusively medical problem (remember: every third person contracts cancer in his lifetime), and our own national program, directed toward a reduction of mortality from tumors. Our Center is engaged in its development. Perhaps the fate of draft law on oncology we developed, which has been lost in the long drawers of our parliament, will not befall this document. Primary prevention, early diagnosis (screening programs, for example, to identify cancer of the uterine cervix and breast here have already been worked out here to the level of demonstration projects), fundamental research, the development of treatment methods - these are the main necessary constituents of such a national program. I am naming them in order of priority. Well, in the practice of domestic oncology today the priorities have been precisely arrayed more or less the wrong way around.
