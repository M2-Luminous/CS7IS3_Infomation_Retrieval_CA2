FR940106-0-00131 FR940106-0-00022 It is essential to retain the definition of eligibility period for the application of prior law with respect to first qualifying separations which occurred before August 23, 1988, while adding a definition of the new eligibility period for qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) is applicable. If, however, the adversely affected worker is totally separated on or after August 23, 1988, following a first qualifying separation which occurred prior to August 23, 1988, amended section 233(a)(2) must be applied even though it results in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period established under pre-OTCA law. Therefore, no substantive change is made in paragraph (m)(1)(i) of §617.3, but as noted below substantive changes are made in paragraphs (m) and (t) as a result of the new interpretations of sections 1430 (a) and (g) of the OTCA, and to correct technical errors. 2. Application of new eligibility period. The UAW commented that in §617.3(m)(1) the Department set up two standards for the 104-week eligibility period during which TRA is payable. The UAW argues that the proposed two standards differ according to whether the date of separation occurred before or after August 23, 1988. The UAW commented that Congress explicitly provided in section 1430(g) of the OTCA that the revised definition of the 104-week eligibility period in section 1425(a) (amending section 233(a)(2)) was effective upon enactment unless the application of the amended eligibility period would reduce the period for which a worker would have been eligible for TRA. Therefore, the two standards should not turn on the date of the worker's separation, but on whether or not the worker's period of eligibility is reduced through the application of the amended eligibility period. The UAW commented further that Congress intended the amendment to be fully effective upon enactment, permitting the amendment to increase the eligibility period for basic TRA or establish a TRA eligibility period for some workers, and noted that the Conference agreement statements in House Conference Report 100&hyph;576 on sections 1425 and 1430 of the OTCA strongly support this application of the amendments. The UAW also commented that under OTCA sections 1425(a) and 1430(g) the most recent total separation which is qualifying must be used to determine the eligibility period, unless the eligibility period would be shortened through the application of the amendment to workers separated prior to enactment. The PDLI, commenting on the transition guidelines in §617.67(e)(3), noted that section 1430(g), in specifically referring to total separations prior to the enactment of the OTCA, raised the unavoidable implication that amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations prior to August 23, 1988, if such application would provide the worker with a longer or later eligibility period than the worker would have had under the pre-OTCA law. The Unemployment Council of Southwestern Pennsylvania made the same point in its comments. Department's response. The Department agrees with the commenters' understanding that the amendment to the basic TRA eligibility period is not to operate to the disadvantage of workers whose eligibility period would expire at a later date with respect to a qualifying separation which occurred before the date of enactment of the amendment to section 233(a)(2). These comments were also a factor in the Department's reconsideration of GAL 7&hyph;88 and the resulting new interpretations of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g) announced in GAL 15&hyph;90 (see discussion in item A. above). If workers are to retain the advantage of a later expiration date for the eligibility period based on the prior law, then the prior law must continue to be applied to first qualifying separations which occur before the date of enactment of the OTCA (August 23, 1988). Accordingly, in general the comments have merit, and substantial changes are made in the final regulations regarding the definition of ``eligibility period'' in §617.3(m)(1) and the definitions of ``separations'' in §617.3(t). Furthermore, the transition provisions at §617.67(e) also have been revised to reflect the Department's new interpretations of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g). For further clarification, a proviso directly implementing section 1430(g) of the OTCA is added to §617.3(m)(1). 3. Retroactive approval. The PDLI stated that §617.3(m)(2)(iii) does not clearly point out why weeks of training prior to approval cannot be paid. The PDLI asked ``What if the trainee, for example, was in JTPA funded training that would be, after approval, either paid for by TAA or continued under JTPA?''
