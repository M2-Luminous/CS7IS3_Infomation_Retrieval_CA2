So far this year, the plant has generated 1.62 billion kWh of electric power, already beating the annual plan by 200 percent, and operating as it is, at a load factor of 64 percent, it is two years ahead of its planned annual performance capability. The first load of concrete for the Qinshan nuclear power plant was poured on 20 March 1985, and 81 months later, on 15 December 1991, it was successfully tested on the grid. Last July, after reaching full-power operations, its facilities were completely realigned, and the plant was brought up to its maximum operating capability. On 12 March this year, the plant was again successfully operated on the grid, and on 25 June its 100-hour "examination and acceptance test" was completed without a hitch. The plant is now well into its high-operational stage, generating up to 7.2 million kWh per day. An official of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation told reporters that since the plant joined the grid two years ago it has generated 2.145 billion KWh of electric power, exceeding the original plan. There have been no harmful effects to the facilities, personnel, or the environment. The Environmental Surveillance Department reports that the amount of radiation from waste water discharged into the environment is less than the limit of one part per thousand set by the State, and the volume of discharged inert gases is about at allowable limit of one part per 100,000, which proves that the operation of the Qinshan nuclear power plant is clean, safe, and economical.
