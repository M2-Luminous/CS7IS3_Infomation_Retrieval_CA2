In Rio de Janeiro on 5 May, he promised that if elected, he will create a "strong government" to intervene in the economy, not to nationalize it, but to control the market and the strategic sectors and to fight tax evasion. Lula plans to review the privatizations conducted during the administrations of former President Fernando Collor and President Itamar Franco, to change the concession system for radio and television stations, and to create a state-owned educational television network of very high quality. Lula said the constitutional reform failed because "no one was able to make lazy congressmen vote." Addressing Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. workers at the Brazilian Press Association, Lula said he wants "a strong government, not a weak and fragile one. He wants a government capable of intervening in the social and economic areas." He criticized the current administration for "not having the courage to fight the financial system, the oligopolies, and the cement cartel." Lula said a strong government would fight tax evasion, expand and reorient the domestic market, and seek social justice. [passage omitted] Lula tried to calm entrepreneurs' fears about the socialist profile of his party. He pointed out that the government program approved by his party members does not force him to declare a moratorium on the foreign debt, but to maintain suspension of payments as a weapon to be used depending on the creditors reaction to the negotiations he plans to conduct. He gave examples of how the government can intervene in the economy: by stimulating the establishment of leather industries, clothes manufacture, toys, and school materials in small urban nuclei, "thus creating a bond between the citizen and his native region and preventing the poor in the northeastern region from moving to the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo shantytowns where they become totally destitute and miserable."
