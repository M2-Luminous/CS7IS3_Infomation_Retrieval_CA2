The military sources were asked about the "replacement of the commander in chief." They told LOS TIEMPOS today that "nothing significant will happen during the next few days with the high military command now that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the president of the Republic and general commander of the Armed Forces, has ratified his confidence in the military commander." The source stated: "The military garrisons were surprised by the military prosecutor's recommendation to try General Fernando Sanjines for allegedly being involved in the sale of material and spare parts belonging to the Bolivian Air Forces in 1992." Just hours after Military Prosecutor Ezequiel Block's recommendation was disclosed, the high military command was shaken by an unusual movement of troops, and it was rumored that "the commander in chief would be replaced immediately." The situation was clarified at a high level after the president of the Republic "ratified his confidence in Sanjines as commander in chief of the Armed Forces."
