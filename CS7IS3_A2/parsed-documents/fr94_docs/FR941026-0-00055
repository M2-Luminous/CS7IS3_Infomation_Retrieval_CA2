FR941026-0-00055 FR941026-0-00020 In its proposed definition, HUD intended to define the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays the escrow item. HUD intended to apply a standard that conformed with prudent lending practices to pay escrow account items promptly and to take advantage of discounts, when available, and avoid penalties. The proposed definition required a servicer to pay an escrow item in time to take advantage of available discounts, or at least in time to avoid a penalty. In the final rule, HUD defines the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays an escrow item. In ยง3500.17(k), HUD provides that in calculating the disbursement date, the servicer must pay the disbursement on or before the earlier of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The disbursement date may be in a month other than the due date established by the payee. In cases of payments to obtain a discount, the disbursement date may be in a month before the payee's due date. In cases of payments to avoid a penalty, the disbursement date may be in a month after the payee's due date, but before the penalty would be assessed. Escrow Account Eight commenters requested clarification of the proposed ``escrow account'' definition. Commenters stated that the final rule definition should exclude voluntarily escrowed funds. They believed that such payments should be excluded from the trial running balance calculations of an escrow account. The Department rejects this argument. The term escrow account encompasses all escrow accounts, including those that are ``voluntarily'' agreed to by borrowers and under the control of servicers. Because most borrowers are anxious to obtain a loan, they are likely to agree to a lender's request for a voluntary escrow account that is under the lender's control. Arguably all escrow accounts are voluntarily entered into when the parties agree to the mortgage loan. Thus, an exemption for servicer controlled accounts involving ``voluntarily'' escrowed funds would nullify the statute's purpose of protecting consumers. Therefore, the final rule provides a uniform standard for all servicers who control escrow accounts. In the final rule, the term ``escrow account'' excludes any account that is totally under the borrower's control. Escrow Account Analysis Twenty-one commenters requested clarification of the ``escrow account analysis'' definition (14 mortgage companies, 4 banks, 2 attorneys, and the MBA). These comments complained that the proposed definition of ``escrow analysis'' required that an analysis be done to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. The commenters viewed these functions as completely separate. They argued against the linkage of the analysis with the preparation of the escrow account statements. The Department considered these comments but concludes that an escrow analysis is ordinarily needed to provide an initial and annual escrow account statement. Otherwise, the statements may be meaningless. In the final rule, however, the Department no longer requires the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement. Section 3500.17(g) now permits servicers to submit the initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 calendar days after settlement. In this way the servicer, rather than the closing agent, is likely to perform the escrow account analysis, and the initial escrow account statement will more accurately reflect the first year's projections. Escrow Account Computation Year Twenty-eight commenters sought clarification of the term ``escrow account computation year'' (17 mortgage companies, 6 banks, 3 attorneys, and 2 associations). Twenty comments asked for clarification of the term ``escrow account computation year'' as HUD used it in the definition of ``trial running balance.'' Several commenters requested that HUD revise the final definition to be consistent with HUD's definition in an earlier proposed rule of December 9, 1991. There, HUD defined ``escrow account computation year'' to mean ``any escrow account year whose date of establishment begins on or after January 1, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445, ยง3500.17(a)(1).) January 1, 1991, was the statutory initiation date. In HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule, the definition of ``escrow account computation year'' is a 12-month period starting on the initial payment date (58 FR at 64071). Several commenters argued for greater flexibility to set the escrow account computation year, rather than have it established by the initial payment date. HUD is aware that servicers may need to spread out their workload throughout the year. The final rule permits the servicer to have some flexibility in setting the computation year by allowing for ``short year'' statements. In the final rule, an escrow account computation year begins at the initial payment date. However, the servicer may use a ``short year'' statement to level its production load and reestablish an escrow account computation year that best meets its business cycle. Installment Payment Four commenters requested clarification of the ``installment payment'' definition. They stated that HUD's proposed definition lacked clarity regarding tax or insurance statements that are payable on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, but are actually paid by the servicers annually. The Department believed the proposed definition adequately described installment payments, but has given an example to clarify its usage in the final rule. Unless there is a discount to the borrower for early payments, the regulation does not allow servicers to pay installment payments on an annual or other prepayment basis. Payment Date and Payments Other Than Monthly Six commenters suggested the definition of ``payment date'' be changed to ``payment due date'' to distinguish the term from the disbursement date. In response to these comments, the Department uses the phrase ``payment due date'' in the final rule. These commenters also suggested that the reference to monthly payments be revised to ``periodic payments.'' HUD makes this change when appropriate. Four commenters requested detailed guidance on escrow accounts when payments are made biweekly or for periods other than monthly. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this issue. It used monthly and yearly phrases because those terms follow the statute's language. The final rule, however, provides illustrations of biweekly accounting in Appendix H.
