Samples are already being shipped. MELCO is marketing them for use in portable terminals, electronic memo books and notebook size personal computers. The new product uses the same processes as the low power consumption second generation 1 megabit SRAM's, and it is completely compatible with the current 256 kilobit SRAM's (B version). The bit configuration is 32 k x 8 bit; and products with access times of 55 ns, 70/85/100 ns are being provided. The power consumption is 150 miliwatts when conducting read out operations, and 0.15 microwatts during standby. The operational voltage in the standard item is 4.5-5.5 V, but low voltage operation is also possible with an access time of 120 ns at 2.7-5.5 V, and an access time of 85 ns at 3.0-3.6 V. The packages are supplied in 258 pin DIP, SOP and TSOP.
