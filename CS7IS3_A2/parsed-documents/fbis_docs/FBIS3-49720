From this viewpoint, how do you evaluate the situation of the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]? [Ader] The preparation for the election campaign should be evaluated from various viewpoints. One of the essential factors is whether the party has the necessary infrastructure and personnel conditions for a successful campaign. In my opinion, the infrastructure and apparatus development that began in 1992 has now come to its last phase, and this process will be finished by the beginning of the election campaign. [Farkas] The other important factor is obviously the selection of candidates. To what extent is this work ready? [Ader] There are two branches of political preparations, and in one of them, namely in nominating candidates, the preparation is slowly coming to an end. We will hold a national committee meeting on the first weekend of February, when we will approve the list of candidates running in individual districts and the territorial lists, and the meeting will also decide on the national list. In addition, it is also important to formulate the political program and the messages to the voters. Actually, we are talking here about the expansion of the program elements adopted at the FIDESZ congress in Debrecen, and formulating this program in a language understandable for broader strata of voters. [Farkas] Regarding the nomination of candidates, to what extent did the events that took place since the meeting in November affect this activity? [Ader] Fortunately, these events did not affect the nomination of candidates at all; I do not know of any candidate who withdrew from representing the FIDESZ at the elections because of those events. [Farkas] However, this process must have probably caused problems politically.... [Ader] No party, including the FIDESZ, benefits from personnel conflicts emerging on the eve of elections. Naturally, this did us no good either, but I think the FIDESZ has already overcome this period. The relevant debates in the FIDESZ ended in November 1993, and now everyone is focusing on a successful campaign. [Farkas] The fact that the FIDESZ deputies in Gyongyos left the party at the end of last week seems to slightly contradict this.... [Ader] This is a fact, but I would not attribute particular importance to this, because Gabor Fodor originates from Gyongyos and the group of people there were connected to him. I am sure that Gyongyos remains an isolated event, and I would be surprised to see similar events in other areas. [Farkas] Did the possible future coalition ideas affect the nomination of candidates? [Ader] This was not a factor in selecting candidates; the decisive principle is to seek persons who are trained in a certain professional area, are known and appreciated by the locals, and accept the political values and goals of the FIDESZ. However, a possible coalition formation did not emerge at all because there are a lot of uncertainty factors here.... [Farkas] Did Viktor Orban's recent statement and its various interpretation cause any disturbance in the preparation for the elections? [Ader] This did not affect the preparations for the elections. Besides, I find the coalition speculations rather useless and a waste of time, even if I know that this becomes a national pastime with the approach of the elections. We must accept the fact that the future coalition will be determined by the election results and the previous programs and political orientations. Consequently, it is possible that a political constellation emerges, which no one expects. In this respect, our previous position continues to be valid, namely that the FIDESZ is ready to cooperate with every party that accepts the basic political values and the rules of democracy. The compatibility of various party programs will basically affect cooperation after the elections. We do not have any reason to change our current position. [Farkas] Is Viktor Orban's temporary silence connected with the aforementioned statement? Are there any consequences of this statement in the FIDESZ? [Ader] I do not think that the aforementioned statement should be dramatized, and it is also useless to add any political combinations.
