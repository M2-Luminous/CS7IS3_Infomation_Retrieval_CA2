FR941110-1-00047 FR941110-1-00010 A three-year term would be appropriate because it would give members sufficient time to become familiar with committee operations and enable them to make meaningful contributions at committee meetings. Furthermore, a three-year term would enable establishment of a rotation so that approximately one-third of the committee membership would terminate each year. Staggered terms would lend continuity to the committee by insuring that some experienced members would be on the committee at all times. Therefore, the order should provide that the terms shall be determined so that approximately one-third of the total committee membership terminates each year. The Notice of Hearing proposed that the term of office for initial members and alternates should be established so that one-third of the initial producer and handler members and alternates would serve for a one-year term, one-third would serve for a two-year term, and one-third would serve for a three-year term. Since there would be only one public member, there is no need to provide for staggering that membership; the initial public member should serve a three-year term of office. The effective date of the order, if issued, may not coincide with the specified beginning date of the terms of office of committee members and alternates. Therefore, a provision is necessary to adjust the initial terms of office. To accomplish this, the order should provide that the terms of office of the initial members and alternates shall begin as soon as possible after the effective date of the order. In the event that the initial members are selected prior to June 1, 1995, an example of how the initial terms of office could be adjusted is as follows: the initial one-year term would not end on May 31, 1995, but would continue until May 31, 1996. Similarly, the two-year and three-year terms would end on May 31, 1997, and 1998, respectively. For the purposes of applying the tenure requirements of the proposed order, each of these initial terms would be considered as a one-year, a two-year, or a three-year term even though the actual period of the appointment may be several months longer. To prevent unnecessary vacancies from occurring on the committee, the order should provide that members and alternates shall serve in such capacity for the term of office, or portion thereof, for which they are selected and have qualified, and until their respective successors are selected. However, so that there is a continual turnover in membership and infusion of new ideas, the order should provide that no member, including the public member, may serve more than two consecutive terms on the committee unless specifically exempted by the Secretary. After serving two consecutive terms, a committee member should be eligible to serve as an alternate, but should be ineligible to serve as a member for a period of one year. These tenure requirements should not apply to alternate members. Testimony indicates that there should be no tenure restriction on alternate members. The proponents believe that establishing a maximum of two three-year terms for alternate members would serve no useful purpose, but potentially could limit the pool of candidates for full committee membership. Testimony also indicates that producers with less than three years experience growing Walla Walla Sweet Onions should be eligible for appointment to the committee as alternate members. To guard against the possibility of a position remaining vacant because of a lack of eligible nominees or persons eligible to serve, the Secretary should have the authority to except an individual from tenure limitation. Such an exception would be made in special and unusual circumstances. Limiting the tenure of committee membership as proposed would be in accordance with the Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders.'' The order should provide that the Secretary shall have the authority to select members and alternates of the committee, but the Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers and handlers should have the responsibility for recommending nominees to the Secretary for selection under proposed ยง956.22. The nomination procedure outlined in the order would provide a means of making available to the Secretary the names of prospective members and alternates desired by the industry to serve on the committee. The record does not indicate how the initial committee should be nominated, but an often used method in such instances is for the Secretary to conduct a meeting to nominate initial industry committee members. All producers of record in the production area should receive notice of the meeting in sufficient time to enable them to attend. Nominations should be received and voted upon at these meetings. Those persons receiving the highest number of votes for each of the positions to be filled should be considered the nominee for that position. Handler nominations should be accomplished in the same way. The committee should be responsible for conducting subsequent nomination meetings, and providing notice to Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers and handlers of those meetings. The proposal in the Notice also provided that at least one nominee be submitted for each position for the Secretary's consideration. Proposed ยง956.22 provides that one nominee be designated for each member and alternate member position that is vacant or is about to become vacant. However, the Secretary would reserve the right to select any qualified candidate willing to serve.
