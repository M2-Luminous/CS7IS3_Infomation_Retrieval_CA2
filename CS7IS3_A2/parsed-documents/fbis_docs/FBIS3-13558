Savir said that "Israel and the PLO understand that there is a need to create an appropriate atmosphere in the territories to alleviate the situation and instill a greater sense of security and trust in the political process." The Israeli representatives said that Israel is prepared to make additional concessions toward the Palestinians and to agree to expand the Palestinian police force to 9,000 men and increase the number of weapons at its disposal. Israel had earlier agreed to a 6,000-strong force. 'Arafat is not satisfied with these steps and is demanding a series of additional moves, most of which are unacceptable to Israel. [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 16 March, in a related report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8, adds that "in the delegation's meetings with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis, it was made clear to him that Israel has agreed to the deployment of international forces throughout the territories, except for Jerusalem, on condition that they are unarmed."] Referring to the specific steps to be taken, Savir said that Israel, for its part, took very tough measures against the extremists, but added that "there are steps that must be coordinated with the Palestinians to prepare the ground for the resumption of the process." Savir noted that the Tunis talks advanced the possibility of a direct dialogue on those issues. "It is obvious that Israel is serious about its intention to contribute to security on the ground for Arabs and Israelis alike, and the Palestinian side made it clear that despite the difficult obstacles along the way, it intends to implement the Declaration of Principles, which will bring a drastic change on the ground." Savir also said that "those who speak about stopping the process in the wake of the terrible massacre are, in fact, caving in to extremists and murderers, and that is not in the interest of either side." Savir believes, therefore, that the process will continue to make progress and that the Tunis talks were a step in that direction. [passage omitted]
