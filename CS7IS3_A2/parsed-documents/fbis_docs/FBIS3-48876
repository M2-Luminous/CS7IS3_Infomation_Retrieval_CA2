The Ministry of Defence has warned Downing Street that the crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes is threatening to force Japan to abandon its non-nuclear stance. The risks are detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence Committee, Whitehall's main security body, which advises the cabinet and the prime minister. The report, sent last month, reveals that Japan has key bomb-making components, including plutonium and electronic triggers, and has the expertise to "go nuclear" very quickly. One expert who has seen the report said: "They (the Japanese) could have acquired all the expertise for imploding a weapon without breaking safeguards. All they would need to do is select adequate amounts of plutonium for the core." American intelligence officials said President Bill Clinton has given up hope of stopping North Korea getting nuclear weapons, a setback which is likely to spark a regional arms race. The Pyongyang government still refuses to allow full inspections of two disputed nuclear sites. Tension increased last week when America announced it would deploy the Patriot antimissile system in South Korea. North Korea described the move as an "unpardonable grave military challenge." The Patriots are supposed to help reassure South Korea and Japan by providing a first-line defence. But they will not prevent Japan developing a nuclear deterrent if it fears a surprise attack, intelligence sources said. The turning point would come if North Korea improves the accuracy and range of its Nodong missile. The weapon, a version of the Iraqi Scud, can carry a nuclear or chemical payload; last May it landed a test flight in the Sea of Japan. The Whitehall report emphasises there is no evidence yet that Japan has taken the decision to proceed with a nuclear bomb programme, or that it has strayed from its commitments to the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Japan has its own reprocessing plant for producing plutonium and has also contracted Britain and France to supply several tonnes of plutonium from Japanese spent reactor fuel. It also has sophisticated rockets for launching space satellites that could be converted to intermediate or long-range missiles. Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently confirmed that he was "very strongly concerned" by North Korea's growing military strength. "The missile North Korea is developing has a range of 1,000 km and could hit much of Japan eight minutes after it is launched," he said. "How to develop a defence against that is a matter of great concern to Japan." North Korea is growing increasingly unstable as food shortages and electricity blackouts blight the bankrupt nation. Kim Il-song, the 81-year-old dictator, warned in a new year address that any effort to pressure his country into reforms "may invite catastrophe." The Central Intelligence Agency last week repeated its warning that North Korea probably had enough plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs. It also warned of its "heightened state of military readiness" and the deployment of rocket launchers and artillery close to the demilitarized zone. America has threatened economic sanctions if North Korea fails to agree by February 22 to allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea replied it would suspend the armistice on the Korean Peninsula if Clinton pushed for sanctions.
