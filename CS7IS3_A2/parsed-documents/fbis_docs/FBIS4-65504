SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse stated today at the end of a two-day visit to Saxony-Anhalt that it is unacceptable that the impression is being created that the perpetrators have been released again. This is an invitation for more acts of violence. The Magdeburg policy apparently did react resolutely enough. It is the state's duty to react to violence with all instruments that are available.
