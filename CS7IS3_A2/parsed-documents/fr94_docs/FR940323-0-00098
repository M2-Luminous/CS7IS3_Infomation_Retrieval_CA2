FR940323-0-00098 FR940323-0-00024 Increases in COLA Rates 1Allowance area/category 1Current rate 1Final rate City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii Commissary/Exchange 15.0 17.5 Territory of Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: Local Retail 15.0 22.5 Commissary/Exchange 7.5 17.5 St. Thomas and St. John, Virgin Islands all employees 15.0 17.5 On August 30, 1993, OPM published proposed regulations (58 FR 45556) that would effect the above increases in COLA rates. On the same day, OPM published a notice (58 FR 45558) that included Runzheimer's ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Selected Nonforeign Areas and in the Washington, DC Area, May 1993.'' In response to the proposed regulations and notice, OPM received comments from nearly 250 persons. An analysis of the comments follows. General Comments One commenter stated that OPM did not comply with provisions of the Treasury, Postal, and General Government Appropriations Act 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141) as these provisions apply to COLA. This law requires that OPM study living cost issues and submit to Congress a report on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1995. The commenter believes that the law directs OPM to make changes in the COLA model before 1995. OPM's General Counsel carefully reviewed Pub. L. 102&hyph;141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee report. The General Counsel determined that the law has two requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress on possible changes to the COLA methodology. The law does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this time. The Senate Committee, however, requested that OPM research specific methodological issues. This OPM is doing, and OPM plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to implement changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA methodology as appropriate. Another commenter said that OPM regulations should describe in greater detail the COLA model and survey. The commenter also stated that all of the data collected should be made public. OPM believes that its COLA regulations are adequately detailed and that any attempt to subject the COLA survey process to a set of overly detailed and inflexible rules would impair rather than improve the COLA program. The flexibility results in a more accurate COLA model because improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made public because, before COLA rates are adjusted, OPM publishes in the Federal Register a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Therefore, employees have the opportunity to comment on any changes.
