FR940826-0-00032 FR940826-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of the Secretary 43 CFR Part 12 RIN 1090&hyph;AA42 Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations AGENCY: Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary. ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule will adopt for the Department of the Interior, standards which will be imposed on grantees covered by the revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations.'' DATES: This rule is effective on August 26, 1994. Comments must be in writing and must be received by September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Acquisition and Assistance Division, Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior, 1849 C St., NW., Mail Stop 5512, Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Dean A. Titcomb, (Chief, Acquisition and Assistance Division), (202) 208&hyph;6431. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OMB Circular A&hyph;110 covers both grants made by Federal agencies and subgrants made by States to nongovernmental organizations. Agencies were required to adopt those standards which would be imposed on grantees in codified regulations within six months after publication in the Federal Register . Over 200 comments were received by OMB from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations, and others in response to the notice published on August 27, 1992 (57 FR 39018) requesting comments on proposed revisions. The comments were considered in developing the final version. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule because of the previous request for comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number of comments already received and considered by OMB and the Federal agencies, and due to the limited flexibility to revise the rule provided by OMB. This interim final rule essentially adopts all the language in the Circular with two exceptions. At Section 12.904, language has been added to describe the procedure for handling requests for class deviations and case-by-case exceptions. At Section 12.915, the Department is including a term and condition concerning use of the metric system of measurement. The Department is revising 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart F to implement these requirements. Public Participation The policy of the Department of the Interior, is whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the interim final rule to the location identified in this preamble. Executive Order 12866, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim final rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but rather modifies and updates administrative and procedural requirements. This interim final rule does not contain a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Environmental Effects The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action having a significant impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Executive Order No. 12778 The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
