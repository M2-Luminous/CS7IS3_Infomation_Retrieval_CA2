The ceremony was opened by Academician Aleksandr Javakhishvili. Participants in the meeting were addressed by the head of state, who spoke about the great importance of the document. This was followed by the signing of the declaration by representatives of various public and political organizations. Among the many signatories were the Association of Georgian Professional Unions, the Liberal Democratic Party, the People's Front, the Green movement, the Russo-Georgian Cultural Society, the National Democratic Party, and the Citizens' Union. At the end of the ceremony our correspondent spoke with Eduard Shevardnadze and Giorgi Chanturia. [Begin recording] [Shevardnadze] I think that this is the beginning of a very important movement. I cannot say that the declaration will solve all problems. However, the fact that it was signed by such reputable political associations, forces and public organizations and that we were all united by several principles stemming from national interests, means that we have embarked upon the path of unity in our struggle for the salvation, independence, and democratic development of the country. As for the parties that are not represented here today, some of them have stated that they need some time to make up their mind. I think that if we do well and observe these principles, they will also join us, and a single front that is to lead us to a single Georgia will finally be formed. [Chanturia] Unfortunately, we have not recently had the luxury of holding political events like this. This is undoubtedly a political event. I know that there will be many demagogues and populists saying that the mere signing of something does not mean much [words indistinct]. If we agree on these important principles, it will mean that we have a future. Opponents may say that some forces will not observe these principles. Those who will not are not going to benefit from doing so. This declaration gives us an opportunity to use it against any organization which has signed it and is not observing it. In any case, this document should have been signed. The signing of this document has started off a major process. It may be not so conspicuous, since there is no waving of flags and destruction. Nevertheless, a very important political process has started. I hope that if this process gains sufficient momentum, we will be saved and will emerge as a state and a free society. Not only will we defend and retain our independence, but we will regain some of the lost ground as well. [end recording]
