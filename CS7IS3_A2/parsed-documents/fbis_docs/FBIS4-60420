FBIS4-60420 "drnes101dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Comments on `Crisis of Confidence' Comments on `Crisis of Confidence' JN2405115294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0954 GMT 24 May 94 JN2405115294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, place not given, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 24 May; from the "With the Midday Events" feature -- live or recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, good afternoon. [Al-Tibi] Good afternoon to you. [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, yesterday you sounded optimistic about a date for convening the Palestine National Council [PNC]. Perhaps there are some difficulties in getting all the PNC members together soon in the Gaza Strip. [Al-Tibi] Did you say optimistic? I did not hear your question. [Mu'addi] Yes. [Al-Tibi] Did you see my television interview yesterday? I was very clear. It was in Hebrew. I said that the PNC will convene in Gaza in the future. However, I said there were some logistical, administrative, and technical problems in getting all the PNC members together from all over the world. I said if these logistical problems were solved in the future after the arrival of the Palestinian uuthority and the establishment of security, then Yasir 'Arafat would demonstrate commitment to the agreement he signed that the clauses that relate to the State of Israel and contravene the Oslo agreement would be amended. Therefore, I reiterate what my brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th has just said about the PNC convening in Gaza in the future. Some people quoted me as saying the PNC would convene a session shortly. I said in the future, and there is a difference between the two. Things should be clear. [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad, do you expect Yasir 'Arafat to adopt another step to remove this crisis of confidence that erupted between the two sides in light of the recent statements? [Al-Tibi] Yasir 'Arafat is not the one who created this new crisis of confidence. It is is true that there is a growing crisis of confidence. The crisis has escalated over the past two days after the Israeli accusation that 'Arafat plans to violate the agreement. Some Israeli orientalists claimed that 'Arafat intends to violate the agreement just like Prophet Muhammad violated the agreement [with the Jews]. Any primary school student knows that Quraysh was the tribe that violated the agreement and that Prophet Muhammad adhered strictly to the al-Hudaybiyah Agreement, despite the difficult conditions set for the Muslims then. Therefore, there is no need for President 'Arafat to provide another written agreement to the head of the government, Yitzhaq Rabin, or to the Israeli Government. The only commitment that Yasir 'Arafat signed and adheres to so far is the Declaration of Principles signed between 'Arafat and Rabin. Therefore, asking 'Arafat to sign another letter is unnecessary and will not be done. [Mu'addi] One last question. Even Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, deemed by the opposition to represent the left side of the political map in Israel, has criticized Yasir 'Arafat in light of these statements. [Al-Tibi] What is new about that? This is not the first time that Yosi Sarid criticizes Yasir 'Arafat. He is always the first to do so. There is a choir that always criticizes Yasir 'Arafat. This is not new. I respect some of Yosi Sarid's attitudes regarding human rights and the need to talk to the PLO. However, I strongly object to his style in criticizing Yasir 'Arafat. Yasir 'Arafat will not be a mayor of the town of Jericho because he is a leader of the Palestinian people. And his leadership of the Palestinian people is not confined and is not linked to statements of this sort, which are harmful and do not help promote confidence-building. [Mu'addi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special adviser, thank you. [Al-Tibi] You are welcome.
