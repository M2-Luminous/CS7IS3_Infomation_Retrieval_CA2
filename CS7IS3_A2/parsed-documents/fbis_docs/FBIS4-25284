Speaking at the annual meeting of the U.S.-China Business Council, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy, said, "we will oppose any attempts in Congress to reverse this decision." "In very plain words, this is an issue we should get behind us...it's time now to move toward the definition and the development of our next steps," he added. He said that the U.S. relationship with China must include "full engagement" and "constant dialogue." "A growing economic relationship is anticipated," he stressed. However, he cautioned, "we should be realistic about the economic relationship... There will be disagreements but we think that a mature and growing relationship can work through them." He described this relationship as one that "must be characterized by a mutual recognition of strategic importance." Cutter also indicated that the U.S. will "insist upon a continued focus on democracy and human rights" in its relations with China.
