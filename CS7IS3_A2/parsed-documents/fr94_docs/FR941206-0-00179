Subpart AA_Air Emission Standards for Process Vents 19. Section 264.1033 is amended by revising paragraph (k)(2) and adding paragraph (m) to read as follows: §264.1033 Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices. * * * * * (k) * * * (2) Closed-vent systems shall be monitored to determine compliance with this section during the initial leak detection monitoring, which shall be conducted by the date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this section, annually, and at other times as requested by the Regional Administrator. For the annual leak detection monitoring after the initial leak detection monitoring, the owner or operator is not required to monitor those closed-vent system components which operate in vacuum service or those closed-vent system joints, seams, or other connections that are permanently or semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed pipe flange). * * * * * (m) The owner or operator using a carbon adsorption system shall document that all carbon removed from a carbon adsorption system to comply with §264.1033(g) and §264.1033(h) is managed in one of the following manners: (1) Regenerated or reactivated in a thermal treatment unit that is permitted under subpart X of this part; (2) Incinerated by a process that is permitted under subpart O of this part; or (3) Burned in a boiler or industrial furnace that is permitted under subpart H of part 266 of this chapter. 20. In part 264, subpart CC is added to read as follows: Subpart CC_Air Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers Sec. 264.1080␣Applicability. 264.1081␣Definitions. 264.1082␣Standards: General. 264.1083␣Waste determination procedures. 264.1084␣Standards: Tanks. 264.1085␣Standards: Surface impoundments. 264.1086␣Standards: Containers. 264.1087␣Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices. 264.1088␣Inspection and monitoring requirements. 264.1089␣Recordkeeping requirements. 264.1090␣Reporting requirements. 264.1091␣Alternative control requirements for tanks. Subpart CC_Air Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers §264.1080 Applicability. (a) The requirements of this subpart apply to owners and operators of all facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste in tanks, surface impoundments, or containers subject to either subparts I, J, or K of this part except as § 264.1 and paragraph (b) of this section provide otherwise. (b) The requirements of this subpart do not apply to the following waste management units at the facility: (1) A waste management unit that holds hazardous waste placed in the unit before June 5, 1995, and in which no hazardous waste is added to the unit on or after June 5, 1995. (2) A container that has a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 m 3 . (3) A tank in which an owner or operator has stopped adding hazardous waste and the owner or operator has begun implementing or completed closure pursuant to an approved closure plan. (4) A surface impoundment in which an owner or operator has stopped adding hazardous waste (except to implement an approved closure plan) and the owner or operator has begun implementing or completed closure pursuant to an approved closure plan. (5) A waste management unit that is used solely for on-site treatment or storage of hazardous waste that is generated as the result of implementing remedial activities required under the corrective action authorities of RCRA sections 3004(u), 3004(v) or 3008(h), CERCLA authorities, or similar Federal or State authorities. (6) A waste management unit that is used solely for the management of radioactive mixed waste in accordance with all applicable regulations under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. (c) For the owner and operator of a facility subject to this subpart and who received a final permit under RCRA section 3005 prior to June 5, 1995, the requirements of this subpart shall be incorporated into the permit when the permit is reissued in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 124.15 or reviewed in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 270.50(d). Until such date when the owner and operator receives a final permit incorporating the requirements of this subpart, the owner and operator is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart CC. §264.1081 Definitions. As used in this subpart, all terms shall have the meaning given to them in 40 CFR 265.1081, the Act, and parts 260 through 266 of this chapter. §264.1082 Standards: General. (a) This section applies to the management of hazardous waste in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers subject to this subpart. (b) The owner or operator shall control air emissions from each waste management unit in accordance with standards specified in §§264.1084 through 264.1087 of this subpart, as applicable to the waste management unit, except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section. (c) A waste management unit is exempted from standards specified in §§264.1084 through 264.1087 of this subpart provided that all hazardous waste placed in the waste management unit is determined by the owner or operator to meet either of the following conditions: (1) The average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination is less than 100 parts per million by weight (ppmw). The average VO concentration shall be determined by the procedures specified in §264.1083(a) of this subpart. (2) The organic content of the hazardous waste has been reduced by an organic destruction or removal process that achieves any one of the following conditions: (i) A process that removes or destroys the organics contained in the hazardous waste to a level such that the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment is less than the exit concentration limit (C t ) established for the process. The average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment and the exit concentration limit for the process shall be determined using the procedures specified in §264.1083(b) of this subpart. (ii) A process that removes or destroys the organics contained in the hazardous waste to a level such that the organic reduction efficiency (R) for the process is equal to or greater than 95 percent, and the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment is less than 50 ppmw. The organic reduction efficiency for the process and the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment shall be determined using the procedures specified in §264.1083(b) of this subpart.
