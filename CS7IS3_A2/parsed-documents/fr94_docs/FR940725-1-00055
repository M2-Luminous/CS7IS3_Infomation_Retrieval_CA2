FR940725-1-00055 FR940725-1-00010 For multiengine normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the determination of V R is transferred from §23.53(a) to proposed §23.51(a) with minor changes in the specified rotation speed. For multiengine airplanes, in proposed paragraph (a)(1), the margin between rotation speed and V MC increases to 1.05 V MC , or a margin of 1.10 V S1 is established between V R and stall. Proposed paragraph (a) would define V R as the speed at which the pilot makes a control input, with the intention of lifting the airplane out of contact with the runway or water surface. This definition would apply to tail wheel and tricycle gear airplanes, seaplanes, and single-engine airplanes. In addition to the multiengine rotation speed discussed above, proposed paragraph (a) would include rotation speeds for single-engine airplanes and seaplanes and amphibians. This proposed rule would extend V R applicability to all part 23 airplanes to establish a safe and standardized procedure that can be used by operational pilots to achieve AFM takeoff performance. This proposed use of rotation speed is consistent with part 25. In proposed paragraph (b) the speed at 50 feet is based on current §23.53(b) with no change in requirements. For commuter category airplanes, the takeoff speed requirements move from §23.53(c) to proposed §23.51(c) with editorial changes. The option in proposed (c)(1)(i) for an applicant to determine a V MCG and establish a V 1 based on V MCG rather than a margin above V MCA is added. Section 23.53␣Takeoff Performance The heading of §23.53 would be new and the content would come primarily from existing §23.51. This section would now provide general takeoff performance requirements. The proposal would move the takeoff speed requirements of the current §23.53 to §23.51. (See proposal for §23.51.) Proposed §23.53 provides general takeoff performance requirements for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes. Proposed paragraph (a) is based on current §23.51(a). Proposed paragraph (b) is a modification of current §23.1587(a)(5). Proposed paragraph (c) is based on §23.51(d). Section 23.55␣Accelerate-stop Distance This proposal would revise §23.55 to clarify the accelerate-stop segments and to make editorial changes. This proposal would divide the accelerate-stop maneuver into three segments, rest to V EF (proposed (a)(1)), V EF to V 1 (proposed (a)(2)), and V 1 to rest (proposed (a)(3)). This is not a new requirement, but it divides the total distance into three segments to be considered. The phrase, ``in the case of engine failure,'' in current §23.55(a)(2) would be deleted because it would be included in proposed (a)(2). Also, the phrase, ``assuming that *␣*␣* the pilot has decided to stop as indicated by application of the first retarding means at the speed V 1 ,'' is deleted because it is stated in proposed §23.51(c)(1)(ii). The ``exceptional skill'' phrase of §23.55(b)(3) would be deleted because it will remain in proposed §23.45(h)(5)(i). The §23.55(b) phrase ``if that means is available with the critical engine inoperative'' would be deleted because it is covered by the safe and reliable requirements. Section 23.57␣Takeoff Path Section 23.57 would be revised to clarify and specify which takeoff path segments must be determined in flight. Proposed paragraph (a) would clarify that the transition to the enroute configuration should be completed on or before reaching 1500 feet above the takeoff surface. In current §23.57(c)(1), the slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path must be ``positive at each point''; this is changed in proposed (c)(1) to ``not negative at any point,'' to allow acceleration in level flight, which is implied by current §23.61(c). A proposed editorial change to §23.57(c)(3) would specify that the climb gradient ``must not be less than *␣*␣*,'' as opposed to ``may not be less than. *␣*␣*'' The option in current §23.57(d) of determining the takeoff path, either by continuous demonstration or by synthesis from segments, no longer reflects current practice, nor is it entirely desirable. The only viable option in determining the takeoff path from rest to 35 feet above the takeoff surface is by a continuous demonstration. The most practical method of determining the takeoff path from 35 feet to 1500 feet above the takeoff surface is by synthesis from segments. Accordingly, proposed §23.57(d) and (e) would incorporate these changes.
