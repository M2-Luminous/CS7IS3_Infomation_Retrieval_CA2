FBIS4-28429 "dreas112_c_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 North Korea Panmunjom Spokesman Statement on MAC Meeting Panmunjom Spokesman Statement on MAC Meeting SK1006153294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1521 GMT 10 Jun 94 SK1006153294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["U.S. Side Is Not Qualified To Talk About `Violation of Armistice Agreement', Spokesman of KPA Panmunjom Mission" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Panmunjom, June 10 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army [KPA] in a statement today denounced the U.S. side for bringing forward on June 6 the question of holding a meeting of secretaries of the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) which had already ceased to exist and raising outcries over DPRK's "violation of the Armistice Agreement". The step of setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom was a realistic and timely one taken to tide over the present situation in which the Korean Armistice Agreement had been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC remained only in name due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side, the spokesman said, adding the U.S. side knows this and has manifested its stand to make a contact with our members. He went on: The U.S. side, however, on June 6 abruptly came up with a proposal to hold a meeting of secretaries of the MAC which had ceased to exist. In this regard our side called attention of the U.S. side to the fact that all the members of our side had been recalled and notified that an official of the KPA mission at Panmunjom might meet with the U.S. side. Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference hall and read a prearranged text and made a show of publishing a statement saying the act of our side was "a violation of the Armistice Agreement". Such act of the U.S. side was nothing but a ridiculous drama aimed at evading its responsibility for having destroyed and obliterated systematically the Armistice Agreement and the armistice mechanism. In fact, the U.S. side, at this late hour, is neither qualified nor has the face to talk about "violation of the Armistice Agreement". It is the United States that expelled in June 1956 the neutral nations inspection teams which had been overseeing and controlling the introduction and carrying out of military equipment, staying at appropriate entry ports of South Korea according to Article 2 C of the Armistice Agreement. It is also the United States that unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that it would renounce the implementation of Subparagraph 13 D of the Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of introduction into Korea of combat equipment. It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the armistice mechanism by appointing a "general" of the South Korean Army who has neither legal justification nor qualification, as the "senior member" of its side but also is beefing up the Armed Forces in South Korea, taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue". It is preposterous for the U.S. side that had unilaterally wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the armistice mechanism to talk about an "agreement between the two sides". What the military armistice commission and the neutral nations supervisory commission are needed for which have no role to play in preventing either arms buildup or the recurrence of war owing to the U.S. side query Whether it accepts our new proposal or not is a touchstone for the fundamental question of war or peace. The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to revive the armistice mechanism the function of which has been completely paralyzed by it. We will watch the future act of the U.S. side.
