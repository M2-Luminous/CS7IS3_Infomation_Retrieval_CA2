FR941102-1-00013 FR941102-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;148&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to determine proper adjustment of the gap tolerances of the seat track joints at frame 64, and correction of discrepancies. This proposal would also require eventual repositioning or replacing the seat tracks on all affected airplanes, which would terminate the requirement of repetitively removing or repositioning the seat tracks. This proposal is prompted by in-service inspection reports, which have revealed that a gap between the forward and aft seat track at frame 64 could exceed the tolerance limit due to a method used on the assembly line to control the position of the seat track. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the gap tolerances of the seat track joints do not exceed the tolerance limit and subsequently lead to separation of the passenger seats from the seat track under emergency landing conditions. DATES: Comments must be received by December 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;148&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
