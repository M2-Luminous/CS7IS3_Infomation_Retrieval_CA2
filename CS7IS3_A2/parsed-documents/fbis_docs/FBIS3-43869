He said that he had accepted and signed the devaluation measure for the sake of maintaining a consensus with the other CFA heads of state. In a televised address yesterday evening, the President of the Central African Republic announced follow-up measures to the devaluation and, as you will hear, also issued a stern warning to would-be speculators: [Begin Patasse recording] This adjustment cannot be regarded as a catastrophe if we can manage our economy properly. However, it is obvious that I will not tolerate destabilizing actions by speculators. Likewise, I hereby give warning to anyone who may be tempted to raise the prices of their merchandise, for their trading permits will be immediately withdrawn. I also give warning to the troublemakers, to those who take advantage of the slightest occurrence to sow disorder without concern for the future of our country. [end recording]
