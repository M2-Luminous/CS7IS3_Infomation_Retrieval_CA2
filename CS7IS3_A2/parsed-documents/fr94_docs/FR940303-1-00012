FR940303-1-00012 FR940303-1-00003 Paragraph (e): Investigation of Additional, Different or Ongoing Crimes or Civil Violations This paragraph is similar to, but not identical with, ยง77.7(d) of the previously published proposal. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is ``offense-specific.'' McNeil v. Wisconsin , 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2207 (1991). Thus, a defendant whose Sixth Amendment rights have attached as to one offense remains subject to questioning, whether direct or covert, regarding uncharged crimes. Id.; Maine v. Moulton , 474 U.S. 159, 180 n.16 (1985); United States v. Mitcheltree , 940 F.2d 1329, 1342 (10th Cir. 1991); United States v. Terzado-Madruga , 897 F.2d 1099, 1111&hyph;12 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v. Chu , 779 F.2d 356, 368 (7th Cir. 1985); United States v. Grego , 724 F.2d 701, 703 (8th Cir. 1984). The proposed rule employs an analogous approach, permitting ex parte contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented party has neither been arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting them. Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional, different or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is typically one of three varieties: (1) Conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes that are intended to impede the trial of the charged crime or unlawful conduct, such as subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct that is a continuation of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or scheme to defraud that continues past the time of indictment. The new or additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at the time of the investigation. By definition, communications pursuant to this exception will take place when the represented party is the subject of pending criminal or civil enforcement charges for which he or she is represented by counsel. Government attorneys must take extreme care to avoid violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel whenever they invoke this exception in the criminal context. In particular, care must be taken to avoid the deliberate elicitation of incriminating information regarding any pending criminal charges. Paragraph (f): Imminent Threat to Safety or Life The Supreme Court has recognized that, in certain limited situations, otherwise applicable constitutional requirements may be suspended by the need to guard against threats to public safety. See Warden v. Hayden , 387 U.S. 294, 298&hyph;99 (1967) (warrantless search permissible when delay would endanger lives of officers and citizens); New York v. Quarles , 467 U.S. 649, 657 (1984) (``the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the [ Miranda ] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). Paragraph (f) recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. The exception has three requirements: (1) The attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example, the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However, information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with Constitutional limitations.
