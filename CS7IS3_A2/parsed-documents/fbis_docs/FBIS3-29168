At the center of the expected reshuffle is Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger). Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest force in the seven-party coalition, oppose the removal of Takemura from the post. The SDPJ fears that if Takemura is removed, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the key party in the coalition, and Komeito would take a decisive leadership in the coalition, political sources said. Hosokawa said at a cabinet meeting this morning, "I would like to approach that decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a comprehensive point of view," according to government officials. In the same meeting, Sadao Yamahana, an SDPJ minister in charge of political reform, expressed his opposition to the reshuffle, the officials said. At a press conference SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama expressed his opposition to the reshuffling plan, saying "a reshuffle which smells of a power struggle should not be carried out." Murayama said Takemura has satisfactorily carried out his duties as "head clerk of the cabinet." The SDPJ leader said a cabinet reshuffle should take place after the closure of the current regular Diet session in June. Hosokawa telephoned Sakigake co-leader Hiroyuki Sonoda on Tuesday morning and urged him to take a cabinet post if Takemura could not remain in the cabinet. Sonoda rejected the proposal, political sources said. Hosokawa and Takemura met for 50 minutes in the afternoon at the prime minister's official residence and discussed the possible reshuffling. Takemura quoted Hosokawa as saying the timing and the scope of a cabinet reshuffle remains only on "blank paper." Hosokawa reportedly told Takemura that after concluding political reform and the Washington meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, a cabinet reshuffle is now on the horizon. Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key strategist in the coalition, supported Hosokawa's idea, saying, "it is the premier's exclusive right (to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will follow his judgment entirely." Sakigake held an emergency meeting of its Diet members Tuesday morning. Some members insisted the party withdraw from the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the change. Takemura and six SDPJ cabinet ministers earlier in the month disagreed with Hosokawa's controversial new tax plan to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut. The government faced collapse after the SDPJ threatened to withdraw from the coalition over the tax plan and Hosokawa was forced to scrap a proposed 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the 3 percent consumption tax. Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said his party is willing to take over the task of governing if the reshuffle leads to the collapse of the coalition government. The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power to the coalition government last August. Late last year when Takemura was at odds with Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, over the handling of political reform bills, Ozawa reportedly asked Hosokawa to sack Takemura. At the time, Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice, political sources said. Takemura and Ozawa reportedly buried the hatchet when Takemura visited Ozawa's residence to extend greetings on New Year's day. Takemura and Ozawa differ over Japan's future political structure. Takemura, who hopes to form a "liberal" force, including proreformers from the LDP, has said it is not easy to establish a two-party system, while Ozawa and Ichikawa want to set up a two-party system, political analysts said. Hosokawa has said he favors a moderate multiparty system. Ozawa advocates making Japan an "ordinary nation," calling for a greater contribution by Japan to international peacekeeping missions, while Takemura calls for a more modest role in the international community.
