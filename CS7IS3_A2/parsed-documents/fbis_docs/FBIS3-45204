He said that after 1 July 1997, people holding BNO [British National Overseas] passports and CI's [Certificate of Identity] for Hong Kong permanent residents, or those holding a DI [Document of Identity], Seamen's identity certificates, or Hong Kong return permits may continue to use those travel documents to travel outside Hong Kong as long as the documents do not expire, so people do not need to worry about their current travel documents becoming invalid, which may affect their travel out of Hong Kong and their return to Hong Kong. Wang Fengchao stressed: This will be effected with the endorsement and full support of China, and China and Britain reached agreement on this through the Joint Liaison Group last year. As for the issuance of special administrative region [SAR] passports that Hong Kong people are now concerned about, a multidepartmental committee of the Chinese Government has begun to handle this work. It is expected that an initial plan will be formulated and the Social and Security Affairs Work Group will be briefed on the plan and will be consulted. Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the Social and Security Work Group from the Hong Kong side, pointed out after the end of today's meeting that BNO passports are only a type of travel document; if BNO holders do not possess other countries' citizenship, they will still be treated as Chinese citizens and will still be eligible to apply for SAR passports; and Chinese citizens holding CI's may also apply for SAR passports. As BNO passports are regarded as only a type of travel document, BNO holders may simultaneously hold SAR passports.
