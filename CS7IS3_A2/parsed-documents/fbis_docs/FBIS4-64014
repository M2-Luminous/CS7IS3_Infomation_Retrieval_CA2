While in Argentina on an official visit, Shumeyko met with President Carlos Menem and Guido di Tella, minister of foreign affairs and religion, and had meetings with Argentine Parliament leaders and representatives of the business community. Russia and President Yeltsin can fully count on Argentina in the realisation of political and economic reforms, Argentine President Carlos Menem said here on Thursday during a meeting with Shumeyko. Mr. Menem expressed gratitude for the invitation, which President Yeltsin extended to him earlier, to visit Russia and confirmed that he would pay a visit to Moscow in October this year. At Shumeyko's request, President Menem described Argentina's experience in carrying out a radical economic reform and, specifically, in achieving financial and economic stabilisation, curbing inflation and privatising state property on a large scale. As a result of the meeting with Carlos Menem, it turned out that the Argentine people had thought it would take a decade to carry out privatisation. However, five years elapsed, and privatisation is already being completed. Argentine experience in privatising railways and merchant marine is of special interest to Russia which does not yet venture to privatise these branches of the economy, Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS. During Shumeyko's meeting with Guido di Tella, Argentine minister of foreign affairs and religion, it was emphasised that President Menem's forthcoming visit to Moscow would become an important landmark in the history of relations between Argentina and Russia. The minister said the visit would serve as a signal to Argentine businessmen that the president devotes much attention to Russia. Guido di Tella highly appreciated the results of his recent visit to the Russian Federation, stating that after the visit he became "the most active populariser of Russia" in Argentina. The Russian parliamentary delegation was received in the national congress of Argentina on Thursday. In response to a question about the first results of the patliamentary delegation's tour of Latin American countries, Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS that the delegation members feel that people both in Chile and Argentina take genuine interest in the developments in Russia. "Direct contacts with Latin Americans convinced us that they want to gain an understanding of the complex processes taking place in our country," Shumeyko pointed out. "contacts in Argentina, primarily those with the business community, give ground to believe that there are good prospects for fruitful mutually beneficial cooperation between Argentina and Russia," he said. "We are young politicians. The future belongs to us. Therefore, we shall never agree to the old notions about the division of the world into blocs and to the existence of the very term a "third world." We look for new partners, seeking benefit for Russia. In this sense, Latin America is of great interest to us," Shumeyko said.
