When he was about to meet with Cali Cartel lawyers, he received a surprise visit by the DEA director in Colombia. Attorney Bernardo Gonzalez, representative of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, and Attorney Juan Fernandez Carrasquilla, representative of Julio Fabio Ordinola Grajales, arrived this afternoon at the Prosecutor General's Office to confirm that their intentions to surrender remain firm. Although the slated meeting did not take place because de Grieff left hastily to meet with President Cesar Gaviria, the visit of the DEA director in Colombia caused surprise. Authorized Prosecutor General's Office spokesmen said it was regrettable that the U.S. Government, through the DEA, meddles in the surrender process. According to the attorneys, the Colombian Government has not allowed the surrender. [Begin recording] Fernandez: In our opinion, the delay is the government's fault. Unidentified reporter: Why? Fernandez: Because the government has not decided yet to guarantee the jail. Before any more steps are taken in the negotiations, the Justice Ministry must guarantee the Prosecutor General's Office that the inmates will not be moved from the place where they surrender. [end recording] To conclude, the attorneys said that their clients' surrender will be done individually and not in the name of the drug cartel.
