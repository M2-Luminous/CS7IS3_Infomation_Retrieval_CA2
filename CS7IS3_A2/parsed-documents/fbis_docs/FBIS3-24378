In order to show this clearly, I will cite data for 1993 from the oblast statistical administration. Thus, according to the data, on 1 January 1994 there were 8,792 economic subjects registered on the territory of Sakhalin Oblast. There were 565 commercial organizations, including state enterprises; 128 municipal organizations; 1,689 individual organizations (family and private); 269 open-type joint stock companies; 3,119 closed-type joint stock companies and limited partnerships; 1,033 peasant and private farms; and 299 production cooperatives. Among noncommercial organizations, there were 526 state institutions and 93 public associations. It is obvious from the figures cited that the oblast's economy has fundamentally changed; it has become a market economy. Whereas before the reforms, there used to be three forms of ownership--state, kolkhoz-cooperative, and personal, now different organizational forms and enterprises have appeared, and in choosing any one of them, they become free and independent. That is exactly what is required for a market. In 1993 Sakhalin's industrial enterprises in current prices produced 521 billion rubles [R] worth of output (and jobs and services); that includes R70.4 billion worth in December, which is 6.8 times the same indicators for 1992. The volume of production (in constant prices) declined by 13.8 percent as compared with last year and by 22.2 percent in December. In the processing industry, this indicator declined by 18.1 percent, while in the chemical, petrochemical, and light industries, the figure reached 13-43 percent. In electrical power engineering and the petroleum production and coal sectors, the decline in production volumes was 11-17 percent, while for extraction industry as a whole the figure was 6 percent. Thus, an increase in production can be shown only in monetary terms. The real volume of production declined and the decline has not stopped. The process of destatization of enterprises continued in industry throughout 1993. As of 1 October 1993, more than half of the industrial enterprises producing more than 60 percent of the output were found in the private and mixed forms of ownership. Nonstate forms of ownership were most common in sectors such as the building materials, light, and food industries. Losses of work time increased; that is above all related to the lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and production facilities. The greatest losses of work time were typical for enterprises of the timber, wood-processing and pulp and paper, light, and food industries--96.5 percent of the overall losses. More than half of the enterprise shutdowns in December were related to difficulties in the marketing of output as well as the unavailability of material resources. Of the 125 types of industrial output, the production volumes for 70 of them declined by 15 percent or more. A significant decline occurred in the food and fish (67 percent), light (10), and timber, wood-processing, and paper and pulp (8.6 percent) industries. A higher volume of production during 1993 was observed for 26 types of output. They included cement, wallpaper, certain types of furniture, frozen and salted fish, and frozen fillets. In the fuel and energy sectors, in December 1993 an increase in extraction (production) was noted for the basic types of energy resources; this is typical for the fall-winter period . Thus, in January-December, 2.607 billion kilowatt hours of electricity were produced (96.1 percent of last year's level); 3.667 million gigacalories of thermal power (98.2 percent); 1.6186 billion cubic meters of natural gas; 1.5609 million tonnes of oil, including gas concentrate; and 4.23 million tonnes of coal. In 1993 as a whole as compared to the previous year, the production of oil, including gas concentrate, declined by 6.9 percent (by 9.1 percent in 1992); of gas--by 6.4 percent (as opposed to 8.4 percent in 1992); and of coal--by 6.2 percent (as compared to a 3.5 percent increase in 1992). Converted to standard units, the extraction and production of all types of energy resources declined by 5.9 percent (by 3.7 percent in 1992). [19 Feb p 4] [Text] Logging sector enterprises reduced the production of commercial timber by 569.2 million cubic meters in 1993; that led to a 29-60 percent decline in production of railroad crossties and timbers and a 92 percent decline in production of factory-built wooden buildings. In the last months of last year, the production of commodity cellulose declined sharply--in all only 14,900 tonnes were produced, and that is 71.2 percent less than in 1992. A bad situation took shape in production of cardboard also; produced in December were 260 tonnes, or 11.4 percent of the level of that month in 1992. In 1993 light industry enterprises produced 12,300 knitted items (92.3 percent) and 216,000 pairs of leather shoes (85.7 percent). As compared with the previous year, production of shoes declined by 14.3 percent; of knitted items--by 7.7 percent; and of garments such as raincoats and rainjackets, jackets, suits, shirts, and other things--by 26-65 percent. One of the main reasons for the decline in the volume of production in this sector is the shortage of inhouse working capital resulting from difficulties in marketing output and the failure of customers to pay; their indebtedness as of 1 December 1993 totaled R810 million. Food industry enterprises produced the following: 6,825 tonnes of meat, including byproducts; 28,143 tonnes of whole milk products; 4,595 tonnes of sausage products; and 63,768 tonnes of bread and bakery goods. The decline in production of the products listed above was 16-43 percent. Moreover, changes occurred in the structure of the food industry in favor of higher priced types: thus, production of smoked items increased by 5 percent, while production of thoroughly smoked sausage items increased by a factor of 1.8. The fish catch declined by 12 percent as compared to last year's level, and that in turn entailed reduced production of fish products both overall and for certain variety groups. In particular specially dressed fish declined by 55.2 percent and culinary items declined by more than half. In only three rayons, Kholmskiy, Kurilskiy, and Smirnykhovskiy, was the volume of industrial production above the 1992 level. The oblast's other rayons reduced production of output, and in eight rayons the drop was as much as 30-60 percent. Labor Payment and the Number of Workers in Industry The number of people working in industry totaled 88,375 and declined by 8.1 percent as compared to the same period last year. The average wages in November 1993 rose by a factor of 11.9 as compared with the corresponding period last year. The wages of power engineering workers were 56 percent higher than the average in industry; of coal miners--44 percent higher; and of dairy industry workers--50 percent higher. The number of people working in enterprises with the state form of ownership as of 1 October 1993 was 36,150, or 40 percent of people working, and their average wages in September were R161,232. There were 200 people (0.2 percent) working at enterprises with the municipal form of ownership with average wages of R45,388. There are 46,943 people, or 54 percent of all people working in the oblast's industry, laboring in open-type joint stock companies with a mixed form of ownership where the average wages in September were R165,076. The number of people working during the first 9 months in closed-type joint stock companies with the private form of ownership was 2,632 (3 percent), while the average wages in September were R160,139. An extremely serious, one might say disastrous, situation took shape in the oblast's economy in January 1994. The decline in production totaled 34.2 percent, while wholesale prices rose by 30.5 percent as compared with December 1993 and 10-fold as compared with January 1993. There were 22 enterprises of the timber, wood-processing, pulp and paper, and food industries standing idle in Sakhalin in January; as a result 18,200 worker-days of work time were lost. Just what are the reasons for this situation? In my opinion, the main reason is that the proportions in the economy have been disrupted. While changing to the market, we have arrived at anarchy and completely discontinued planning and forecasting economic development. Even though it is well known that in countries where market relations have existed for decades, the state does not stop regulating them. A second, quite important reason for the situation which has taken shape is that there is no stable, scientifically substantiated legislation. Thousands of edicts and decrees which contradict one another and do not comply with the Constitution are issued. The next trouble is the present tax system. If it is not refined, the producer will have no incentive to produce output and, consequently, there will be no market. At this time, most of the goods coming to the oblast are imported. We export raw materials and create jobs for Japanese, South Koreans, and Americans and expect finished output from them. But just what are we ourselves supposed to do? And, finally, one of the extremely important reasons for the bad situation in the sphere of economics is the psychology of our people, who for 70 years were taught not to believe in private property, initiative, and entrepreneurship. And now we find ourselves in the position of people who have been cast into the sea without bothering to find out if we know how to swim or not. Of course, time is needed for people to learn how to live and work in market conditions. And during this transitional period all the problems which are arising must be regulated at the state level; otherwise the country will be completely dependent on foreign capital and lose any kind of independence.
