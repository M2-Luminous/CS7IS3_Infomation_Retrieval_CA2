The projected targets are mainly aggregate targets whose function is to provide information guidance; generally aggregate targets will not be subdivided and transmitted to lower levels. The scope and number of products under the mandatory plan are further scaled down and reduced with the promotion of the projected targets. In terms of gross industrial output value, the ratio of the output plan for industrial products controlled by the State Planning Commission plan in 1994 is down to 20 percent from 24 percent the previous year; the number of product targets under the mandatory plan is down to 33 from 36, down 8.3 percent from the previous year; in terms of gross industrial output value, the ratio of output value of the mandatory plan (including state orders) was down to 4.6 percent from 6.8 percent the previous year. There have also been great changes in the contents of the mandatory plan. Price controls on most of the products under the mandatory plan have been lifted, and the differences between the prices of a small number of products that have not been totally lifted and the market prices have gradually narrowed. Generally, the state only does necessary balancing work on the production conditions of certain products that fall under the mandatory plan and ceases to provide blanket guarantees for external production conditions of products that fall under the mandatory plan. The 1994 production plan for the industrial and transport sectors provides strengthened planning management for key enterprises' electricity consumption and for rail transport, because they have the effect of imposing the constraint of a "bottleneck" on the national economy. To optimize the electricity supply and to ensure normal production by key enterprises', the State Planning Commission, the State Economics and Trade Commission, and the Ministry of Power Industry transmitted the 1994 plan for electricity consumption by key enterprises. As for a small number of enterprises which undertake the heavy tasks of the state mandatory plan or undertake the production of important products that affect the national economy and the people's livelihood, the transport of their products has been incoporated into the 1994 plan; railroad departments will give priority to transporting their products.
