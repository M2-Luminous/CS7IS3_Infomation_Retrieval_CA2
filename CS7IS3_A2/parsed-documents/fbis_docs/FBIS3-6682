Chat Thai Secretary-General Banhan Sinlapa-acha said Gen Chawalit must take responsibility because he had ordered the change of the Police Department director-general claiming the past police boss could not ensure internal peace. The accidental discovery of the huge bomb in Bangkok only showed that the people were more vulnerable to danger than ever before, he said. Mr Banhan said he admitted that it was beyond the authorities to prevent untoward incidents from happening. However, he said Gen Chawalit must try to explain the situation to the people when such incidents occur and not just let them pass silently since that would only cause the public to panic. Mr Banhan did not dismiss the possibility that the Opposition would use the incident as ammunition to censure Gen Chawalit in Parliament. "We will discuss that in May," Mr Banhan said. Parliament will convene for an ordinary session in May after opening for an extra session from the end of this month to deliberate the Lower House members' constitutional amendment proposals. The Suphan Buri MP said he did not want to say if Gen Chawalit should "show his political spirit" over the incident. Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan said it was not time yet for the Opposition to initiate a censure motion against Gen Chawalit but noted "we are thinking about it and will discuss it later." Gen Chawalit, talking to reporters in Nakhon Phanom yesterday, said he would not be worried if the Opposition used the abortive terrorism plot in Bangkok as a ammunition to censure him. He dismissed the suggestion that a spate of bombing incidents in the country during his term at the Interior Ministry indicated that the ministry has failed in its job to maintain peace and order for the people. There are more than 60 million people in the country. The police should be commended for their ability to maintain peace, he said. When asked if he believed that violent incidents would cease if he decided to step down as the Interior Minister Gen Chawalit quipped: "You'd better find that out from a fortune teller." Meanwhile, Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit urged all Thais to help keep vigil against possible international terrorist attacks in the country. Returning from his visit to India, Gen Wimon said it was the duty of all Thais to serve as an eye and ear for the country. "We must not allow anybody to use Thailand as a stage for terrorism as that will damage the image and economy," he said. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said it was too early for the authorities to conclude the nationality of the terrorists who assembled the home-made bomb. However, he was confident that investigators would be able to obtain more information on the case soon. [passage omitted] Police Department chief Pratin Santipraphop who led a team of top Metropolitan policemen to meet with American diplomats at the United States Embassy yesterday urged the media to exercise restraint in presenting news reports about the bomb. He said the reports could hurt the good relations between Thailand and friendly countries. In Nakhon Si Thammarat, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said that terrorist bombings had taken place before in several other countries, including those where there are tighter precautionary security measures. What is important, he said, is when a bombing occurs, authorities concerned must cooperate with one another and also with foreign governments to adopt tighter measures to ensure that the incidents will not be repeated. Mr Surin suggested officials and politicians be cautious in making comments, warning that careless remarks may cause misunderstanding and tarnish the country's image. He said the foiled bomb plot against the Israeli Embassy was the work of international terrorists using Thai soil to stage terrorism. Fourth Army Region commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, meanwhile, said it was still too early to say for sure that there was a link between southern terrorist bandits and the terrorists who planned to attack the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok last week.
