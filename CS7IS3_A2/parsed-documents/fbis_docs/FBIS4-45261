FBIS4-45261 "jptdd025__l94013" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 1 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Government Upholds Policy on Downing Suspected Drug Planes Government Upholds Policy on Downing Suspected Drug Planes PA0106233894 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2013 GMT 1 Jun 94 PA0106233894 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Jun (DPA) -- The Colombian Government indicated today that it will not reconsider its order to the Armed Forces to shoot down planes that might be carrying drugs--an order which permits the use of force in intercepting hostile planes--in response to a U.S. move to stop supplying data from radar installations that monitor Colombian and Peruvian airspace. Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo said the Colombian Government's order was carefully reviewed within the context of existing international civil aviation regulations, and, therefore, "we do not have to change anything in this matter." The controversy in Colombia and Peru began when it was revealed that the U.S. Department of Defense, without consulting either the Colombian or Peruvian Governments, suspended the operation of radars located in the Amazonian jungle because it believed it was dangerous for the Armed Forces of the two countries to be authorized to shoot down planes. Spokesmen for President Cesar Gaviria's government reacted angrily to the move, calling it "unilateral, untimely, and rude." They also argued that it could represent a U.S. violation of agreements signed with Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru during the so-called Antinarcotics Summits held in Cartagena de Indias and San Antonio (Texas). Pardo said the Colombian Government believes it is acting properly, and he added that it is still awaiting an official answer from the United States on the reasons behind this U.S. move before deciding whether it will ask the United States to remove two radar installations located in Leticia and Araracuara in the Amazonian region. According to unofficial reports published in Colombia, the Pentagon's decision was unilateral and prompted concern in the White House and State Department because it might lead to an increase in drug flights into the United States. Colombian aviation officials who were consulted by the media indicated that the U.S. measure might have arisen from fear that one of the many U.S. military planes which "constantly violate" Colombian airspace might be shot down. Asked about the decision to suspend the release of radar data, Army Commander Major General Hernan Guzman said authorities will continue to comply with the order to down hostile planes, because "while fulfilling our duty, we cannot be concerned with what the Americans have to say." The controversy heightened criticisms from Colombian political sectors against what they have called "inconsistencies" in the Clinton administration's drug policy, because, several months ago, the U.S. State Department stopped forwarding evidence against drug traffickers after a disagreement erupted over statements made by Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff.
