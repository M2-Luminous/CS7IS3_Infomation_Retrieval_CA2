FR940317-1-00022 FR940317-1-00008 27 CFR Part 4 [Notice No. 792] RIN 1512&hyph;AB25 Use of the Term ``Reserve'' on Wine Labels (93F&hyph;033P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is considering amending the regulations to include a definition for the term ``reserve'' when used on wine labels. Based on a petition it has received, the Bureau wishes to gather information by inviting comments from the public and industry as to whether the regulations should be amended to provide for a definition of this term. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before June 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to: Chief, Wine and Beer Branch; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; P.O. Box 50221; Washington, DC 20091&hyph;0221; Attn: Notice No. 792. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James P. Ficaretta, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 U.S.C. 205(e), vests broad authority in the Director of ATF, as a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prescribe regulations intended to prevent deception of the consumer, and to provide the consumer with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the product. Regulations which implement the provisions of section 105(e), as they relate to wine, are set forth in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 4. Petition ATF has received a petition, dated June 4, 1993, filed on behalf of the Wine Institute, a trade association of California wineries which represents approximately 80 percent of the total U.S. wine production. According to the petitioner, a regulatory definition of ``reserve'' is necessary to permit U.S. ``reserve''_designated wines to be sold for export in European Communities (EC) countries. Specifically, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2392/89 of July 24, 1989, Article 26(2)(c) allows for supplemental information on imported wine labels, subject to certain restrictions. Details ``regarding superior quality'' are allowed on the label ``in so far as they are prescribed by the national provisions of the third country in which the wine originates for the domestic market of that country and are recognized by the Community.'' ATF has been informed that the EC considers that the term ``reserve'' is a term which refers to ``superior quality.'' In the absence of a regulatory definition of the term ``reserve'' in the U.S., which would apply to wines produced for domestic consumption, products bearing this term can be prohibited from being sold in EC member countries. The petitioner states that Germany, for example, prohibits the importation of U.S. wines that bear the term ``reserve'' on the label. The petition does not state whether other EC member nations have taken this position. The petitioner also believes that defining the term in the regulations would provide for uniform meaning and, consequently, be of benefit to consumers. They contend that the use of the term ``reserve'' is so prolific in the marketplace that its meaning has been lost, resulting in consumer confusion.
