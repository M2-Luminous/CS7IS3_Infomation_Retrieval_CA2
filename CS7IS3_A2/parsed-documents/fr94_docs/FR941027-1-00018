FR941027-1-00018 FR941027-1-00006 By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j)(1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The ownership and control provisions of the Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) at 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) §11.221 and of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA) at Article 5920&hyph;11 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated that Texas proposed to amend were: TCMR §778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance information; TCMR §786.215(e) and (f), review of permit applications; TCMR 786.216(i) through (n), criteria for permit approval or denial; TCMR §788.225(f), (g), and (h), commission review of outstanding permits; and section 21(c) of TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 30, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 33705) and invited public comment on its adequacy (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.07). The public comment period ended August 1, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the rules and statute at TCMR §778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance information; TCMR §786.215(e)(1), review of permit applications; TCMR §788.225(g), commission review of outstanding permits; and section 21(c) of TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications. OSM notified Texas of the concerns by letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.12). In response to OSM's concerns for these provisions, Texas, in a letter dated October 6, 1994, submitted a revised amendment (Administrative Record No. TX&hyph;576.13). Texas proposes to additionally (1) revise TCMR §778.116(m) and TCMR §786.215(e)(1) so that each requires an application to list violations incurred by the applicant under all SMCRA-approved State programs, including the Texas program; (2) recodify the previously proposed second sentence of TCMR §788.225(g) as (g)(1) and subparagraphs (g) (1) through (4) as (g)(1) (i) through (iv); (3) revise TCMR §788.225(g) to provide that if the Commission elects to rescind an improvidently issued permit it must serve the permittee with a notice of the proposed rescission and include the reasons under TCMR §788.225(e) for the Commission's findings; (4) revise TCMR §788.225(g)(g)(1)(iv) to require the Commission to find that, in addition to severing any ownership or control link with the responsible person, the permittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee; and (5) recodify previously proposed TCMR §788.225(h) and (i), respectively, as TCMR §788.225(g)(2) and (h). III.

In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15.
