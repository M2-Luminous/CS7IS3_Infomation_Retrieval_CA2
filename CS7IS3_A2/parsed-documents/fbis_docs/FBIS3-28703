By so doing, the government intends to prepare for the possibility that the North Korean nuclear issue will be presented to the UN Security Council when the nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency fail. The government has comprehensively analyzed North Korea's status of the accumulation of military materiel and other indications by using the intelligence capabilities of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command. A high-ranking government official said: "Even though major military facilities of North Korea have been reportedly built underground, the Combined Forces Command's intelligence capabilities can fully detect them." He also said: "Still, the government will further beef up this list and strengthen its intelligence capabilities against North Korea."
