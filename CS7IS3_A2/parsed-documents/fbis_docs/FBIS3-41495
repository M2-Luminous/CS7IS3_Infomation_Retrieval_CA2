In reality, however, the limits on pesticides or heavy metals are observed only infrequently. It is the desire of the EC Commission to ease the requirements by amending the 1994 guidelines. The nub of the debate is the stringent limit on pesticides. The EC guideline laid down over a decade ago allows a maximum of 0.1 �g (one microgram = one millionth of a gram) of a single pesticide per liter of drinking water. If a number of substances are present simultaneously, the total pollution should not exceed 0.5 �/l. In the final analysis, that value implies that should not be any pesticides at all in drinking water, since even using the most up-to-date methods, it is impossible to detect anything less. Even in West Germany this stringent limit has not been upheld for a long time by all waterworks. And that is even more so the case in other EC countries. Additionally, Bonn's Federal Association of German Gas and Water Works [BGW] classifies ``as serious'' the number of times the limit is overstepped in the new federal states. DM27 billion is the estimated cost of needed rehabilitation measures in this area. The EC is now deliberating amending the drinking water guideline and likewise the anti-pollution guidelines for lakes, rivers and canals. The controversial opinions of the different interest groups surfaced at an experts meeting at the end of September in Brussels. Environmentalist groups and broad segments of the water industry want not only to uphold the stringent limits but also to apply them to ground water and surface waters. Contrariwise, some member states, farmers and manufacturers of pesticides consider the standard unrealistic. In the future, the Commission is calling for accurate cost estimates for safeguard measures in order to assess whether the expense is still in a tenable ratio to the resulting benefits. Dr. Hans-Gerd Nolting of the Federal Biological Institute in Braunschweig summarized the results of the conference thus: ``The stringent parameters for pesticides can be altered without thereby scaling back health safeguards.'' It is the view of a number of observers that the total parameter of 0.5 �g/l for all pesticides will probably come down. The value for individual pesticides is disputed since it is valid only as a precautionary value. If it is overstepped, that still does not constitute any threat to the health of consumers. The EC drinking water guideline hews to the values proposed by the World Health Organization [WHO] for substances contained in water such as arsenic, chlorine or chlorinated hydrocarbons. This is the principle that the Frankfurt Farm Industry Association [IVA], representing pesticide manufacturers in the Federal Republic, is advocating also for pesticides. For the WHO's standard values are predicated on the quantities of each substance that pose no human health risk, based on current knowledge, to even infants or sick people, even if consumed daily for an entire lifetime. Practically speaking, that means different limits for individual pesticides. In the interim, the WHO has proposed such standard values for a number of pesticides that are currently in use. They are very distinct for the individual substances and are 10 to 20 thousand times the current EC rate limits. In the opinion of environmentalist groups, while such WHO values may avoid harm to health, they still do not make any allowance for ecology. Peter Kleemeyer, spokesman for the WWF Germany environmental foundation, tosses out for consideration: ``It is often only after many years that undesirable side effects show up.'' Too little is still known about the interactions of the by-products of the substances. Besides, higher limits for drinking water would inevitably facilitate an accumulation of pesticides in untreated waters. Environmentalists are calling for an agriculture that systematically scales back the use of pesticides. Kleemeyer points to the Swedish model: ``Since 1986 they have succeeded there in cutting the use of substances by 65 percent and, in fact, without loss of yields.'' In West Germany too, the use of pesticides is waning, according to the IVA, by one third per hectare since 1989. Water supply companies are calling for limits on pesticides in ground and surface waters. For them, it is a dilemma that, while there are stringent values for drinking water, there are only inadequate requirements for protecting rivers, lakes and canals. As BGW vice-president, Dr. Friedel Baurichter, remarks: ``Pollutants have a cumulative effect on water prices.'' The price of water has soared by nearly 20 percent in the past three years in the former federal states. In the new federal states, meanwhile, prices have already risen tenfold because of the rehabilitation measures that have been introduced. Also of concern to the BGW are the EC Commission's proposals for the authorization of pesticides. Products that have meantime been banned in the Federal Republic are on the list proposed for EC-wide marketing: Atrazin, Simazin, Lindan, etc. Supposedly also, approval will be given even to substances for which there is still no analytical method of detection. Since 1987, when the pesticide law took effect, that has been the pre-requirement for approval in the Federal Republic. Nolting observes: ``The Federal Biological Institute no longer gives approval for pesticides if values exceeding 0.1 �g/l can be expected from the substances themselves or from problematical by-products.'' The EC Commission is presently deliberating tougher limits for lead contents in drinking water from the current 50 �g/l to 10 �g/l. In this case it will follow the recently established recommendations of the WHO. At present, in the Federal Republic, critical lead values can still be anticipated only in old dwellings where no one has bothered to replace the lead pipes. In the meanwhile, the lead pipes up to the house connection have been replaced area-wide. The decisions of the EC Commission and the establishment of the new limits will come about at the start of the new year at the earliest.
