FR940513-0-00050 FR940513-0-00013 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 27583; Amendment No. 91&hyph;239] Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR); Denver, CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY: On January 19, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule to amend appendix D, part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to accurately reflect the name of the new Denver, Colorado airport. In view of the delay in the opening date of the Denver International Airport, this action delays the rule's effective date indefinitely. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the Final Rule at 59 FR 2918, as corrected at 59 FR 6547, as postponed at 59 FR 10958 (March 9, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen E. Crum, Air Traffic Rules Branch (ATP&hyph;230), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 19, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule intending to indicate in sections 1 and 3 of appendix D, 14 CFR part 91 that on March 9, 1994 the new Denver International Airport will open, replacing the Stapleton International Airport (Amendment No. 91&hyph;236; 59 FR 2918). In the amendment, however, the FAA inadvertently indicated that the word ``Stapleton'' should be replaced with the word ``International.'' The FAA issued a correcting amendment on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6547). Most recently, the FAA had delayed this rule until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the effective date of this name change is delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of this rule. Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days. In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rule amending the name of the new Denver, Colorado, airport in appendix D of 14 CFR part 91 (59 FR 2918; January 19, 1994) and the final rule correction (59 CFR 6547, February 11, 1994) as postponed at 59 FR 10958 (March 19, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 10, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
