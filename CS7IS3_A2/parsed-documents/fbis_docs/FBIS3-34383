Perhaps some observers interpret this as an Israeli attempt to dampen the success achieved in the the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton last month, and to indicate that improving Arab-U.S. relations should be done via Israel. For its part, Syria refuses to accept these ideas and insists that Israel should negotiate as a party, not as an ally of the United States. In statements to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Syrian political sources have accused Israel of trying to drive a wedge between Syria and the Arab states. It does not want to achieve any progress on the Syrian track. This is why it has pointed to the need to delay any achievement until details of the Gaza-Jericho agreement have been completed in isolation from the other tracks. Besides, the praise heaped recently on Syria and President al-Asad in particular at the expense of Egypt and the PLO chairman in the seminar held by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reflects -- according to the Syrian sources -- Israel's desire to split Arab ranks and deal with personal matters. Syria rejected and continues to reject this because its policy is opposed to such orientations. The sources are surprised by Israel's constant return to secrecy and discussing the concept of peace before announcing its agreement to withdraw completely, even though Syria has stressed its willingness to implement all requirements of a just peace. A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that in its current policy Israel is seeking to obstruct all efforts related to the peace process and to waste time. But Damascus will continue to display self-restraint, because it believes that time is not in Israel's interests and that these maneuvers will not help it to achieve what it wants, because the government's worrying position in Israel will inevitably push it toward the Syria gate, from which to move toward all solutions. The Syrian official added that current factors should help Israel to recognize the right of the Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese to have their territories liberated from the Israeli presence. And that Israel tried to play games by working for bilateral agreements, which Syria believes weaken the Arab position and has rejected conclusively. [passage omitted]
