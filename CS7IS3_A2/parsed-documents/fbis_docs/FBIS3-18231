The Pact for Italy cannot get its candidates presented? [Segni] I heard 10 minutes ago; yours is the first phone call that I have received. It all strikes me as absurd, and I feel very embittered. But anger will not blind me. We shall go ahead and fight. [Anselmo] It all strikes you as absurd? First, the Pact for Italy, your pact, was unable to collect enough signatures for the proportional list in eight constituencies. Then, yesterday evening, the final blow: The Court of Appeals in Rome has rejected your whole list of candidates for the Lazio region. Is this not a knockout? [Segni] I will not allow you to use that term. We are alive and well, and I assure you we have a great will to fight. Of course, things have been happening that I did not expect, baffling things that leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Mistakes have been made? We shall appeal. The Court of Appeal will think again; these mishaps will not stop us. [Anselmo] You talk about "mishaps." Do you think there is political maneuvering against you? [Segni] It is too early to tell, but I know one thing for sure: In this campaign we are David challenging Goliath. We are the ones with clean faces. You see, we do not have the old parties to back us, we do not have the billions, the support of the public and private television corporations, we cannot set the bureaucratic machinery of the system in motion. We are new. Do you know what that means? To put it in a nutshell, we have no godfathers, and we work on our own. [Anselmo] But a movement running for government cannot let itself be excluded from the Senate list in a region like Lazio.... [Segni] I would not overdramatize the situation. As far as Lazio is concerned, I believe there is a formal flaw that can be put right on appeal. The main thing is not to get into a flap. Our political proposals are good ones, and we cannot, now of all times, let ourselves be thrown by obstacles that, from certain points of view, were perhaps even foreseeable. [Anselmo] Why were they foreseeable? [Segni] I told you: Because the Pact for Italy is made up of volunteers and is not a party like the others, which have an organizational network covering the whole country. No need to worry there: They make no mistakes; their bureaucrats have 40 years' training. [Anselmo] But what happened in Lazio? Were mistakes made, were there irregularities in the collection of the signatures? [Segni] I am waiting to hear the reasons given by the Court of Appeals. But the situation in itself strikes me as strange, very strange. To be quite honest, I cannot think of an explanation. [Anselmo] How ever did you fail to collect enough signatures for the proportional list in eight out of the 26 constituencies? [Segni] The reason is very simple: Because in some regions our friends did not make it. [Anselmo] Not because you had taken too long to draw up the lists and to agree on the names? [Segni] In some cases 2,000 signatures had to be collected in two days. [Anselmo] But could you not have started earlier? [Segni] The delay in drawing up the lists undoubtedly had a detrimental effect, but there was another factor that placed a great handicap on us as well. [Anselmo] What was that? [Segni] The present electoral system, which has kept the proportional element alive, preserving the parties with their rules, their alchemistic practices, their wrangling over places and seats. [Anselmo] But Deputy Segni, were you not the champion of the referenda, the man who collected the signatures that launched institutional reform? How can you, of all people, fall down now on this very terrain? [Segni] Because David is not as big, powerful, and organized as Goliath. [Anselmo] You had launched the battle cry of a million signatures before the election. How many have you collected? [Segni] As of now, I am not in a position to tell you, but the figure is very high. [Anselmo] Deputy Segni, what will you do tomorrow? [Segni] I have worked hard to build up this political prospect for Italy and I am here, like David, waiting for the giant with my sling. [Anselmo] What giant? [Segni] The Right, which is trying to hold the League and the fascists together, and the left, which, with the Communist Renewal party, is presenting itself with its usual mask.
