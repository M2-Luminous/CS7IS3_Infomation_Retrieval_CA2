That is less than 10 percent of the 337,800 troops stationed here at the beginning of 1991. Major General Hartmut Foertsch, the Federal Government official in charge of the withdrawal and head of the German liaison command for the WGT, told DDP/ADN in an interview that the former First Strategic Echelon of the Soviet Army and the Warsaw Pact was withdrawing from Germany "according to plan."
