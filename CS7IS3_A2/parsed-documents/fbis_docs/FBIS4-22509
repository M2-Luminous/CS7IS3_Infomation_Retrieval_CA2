Golovin: "Khabarovsk Postal Workers on Attack Against Newspapers . . . with a Half Hitch"] [Text] Khabarovsk--We are already used to it. Every time he is about to start a subscription, the ordinary person, who cannot imagine life without newspapers and magazines, freezes in anxious expectation: what price surprise will the next subscription drive bring him? For example, in Khabarovsk, to get the central papers, which come out five times a week, they were asking 13,260 rubles [R]. So that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, based on the catalog price, would cost the subscriber more than R25,000--exactly five times more than he paid in the first half-year. The head of the press sales department at the Khabarovsk postal service administration, Tatyana Aristova, and the head of the planning department, Nina Vartseva, graciously presented all their calculations. This is how it works. To the "catalog" cost of the subscription, the postal workers add on 8 percent, plus the cost of one copy, multiplied by the number of times the newspaper comes out. But what norms are all these percentages based on? According to their assertion, these are the expenses for organizing the subscription itself, plus the cost of receiving, processing, and delivering the newspapers. Those living in Khabarovsk are actually lucky. What if they were in Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, or Okhotsk, or somewhere else in the northern rayon of Priamurye? There, the Khabarovsk price for the delivery of their own country's newspaper would seem completely laughable. In the north of Khabarovsk Kray, postal rates for daily delivery of the central paper stun any imagination--R46,000! Don't forget to add to this the "catalog" cost of the publication as well. May the Khabarovsk postal workers forgive me, but I personally am of the opinion that they are going to great lengths to rid themselves completely of the burden that the newspapers are. Speaking to this is the organization of subscriptions for the periodic press and its delivery, when all imaginable and unimaginable expenses are passed on to the Priamurye residents. There is a completely different attitude in neighboring Primorskiy Kray toward the lawful right of each person to receive information. If in Khabarovsk each rayon's postal service is doing its best to astonish the individual with its own price for newspaper delivery, then here a single price has been established--the same in Vladivostok as in the distant settlement of Luchegorsk. Moreover, to the more mass and popular publications, the cost of delivery is reduced by half over the normal cost. This system has been in effect here for over two years. And before starting the subscription drive for the second half of the year, postal workers came out with one more initiative, announcing for their partners a subscription, despite their relatively moderate price, on credit. "We do not want to lose subscribers," the head of the Primorye postal service, Antonina Astanayev, told me. "Believe me, postal workers have absolutely nothing to gain if the newspapers go under." Similar examples have absolutely no effect on the Khabarovsk postal workers. It is useless to cite the February resolution of the Russian president's judicial chamber on information disputes about how several territorial subdivisions of the postal service, occupying a monopoly position, have been willfully and uncontrollably establishing prices for newspaper delivery that significantly exceed the "catalog" cost of the publications. In reply to this, the head of the Khabarovsk postal service, Otto Grib, told a journalist from a local newspaper that the legal chamber's decision is lying on his desk, too, but it is nothing but a piece of paper which does not obligate him in any way.
