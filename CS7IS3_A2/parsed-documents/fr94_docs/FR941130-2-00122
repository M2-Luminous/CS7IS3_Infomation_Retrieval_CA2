Supplementary Information: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a closed-end diversified management investment company organized as an Iowa corporation. On August 28, 1989, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act. On January 2, 1990, applicant filed a registration statement under section 8(b) of the Act. Applicant did not file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 but rather undertook a private offering of its securities under Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. 2. Applicant has 174 shareholders, consisting exclusively of banks and bank holding companies, three insurance companies, and one utility company. 3. The purpose of the applicant is to advance economic development in the State of Iowa. Applicant is authorized by and regulated under the Iowa Business Development Finance Act of 1988 (the ``Iowa Act''). The Iowa Act provides for pervasive government regulation of applicant. As required by the Iowa Act, applicant's board of directors consists of twelve directors, seven of whom are Iowa public officials. Among applicant's public directors are the Iowa Superintendent of Banking and the Iowa Commissioner of Insurance. Applicant's president is appointed by the Director of the Iowa Department of Economic Development (the ``Department'') from the division within the Department that administers business financial assistance programs. Currently, two employees of the Department are the only officers of applicant. 4. The Iowa Act requires applicant to submit annual reports of its operations and condition to the Iowa Governor and the Iowa Legislature. The Iowa Act also gives the Department authority to request the Iowa Superintendent of Banking to examine applicant and submit a report to the Department, with copies to the Governor and Iowa Legislature. 5. Applicant received an order from the SEC under section 6(c) granting an exemption from all provisions of the Act. 1 Thus, applicant was exempted from the requirement that it register as an investment company under the Act. In the application for the exemptive order, applicant undertook to file an application under section 8(f) of the Act for an order declaring that it ceased to be an investment company. Upon deregistration, applicant will remain an ongoing corporation subject to regulation under the Iowa Act. 1 Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20542 (Sept. 8, 1994) (notice) and 20596 (Oct. 4, 1994) (order). 6. As of August 31, 1994, applicant had assets of approximately $6.7 million consisting primarily of cash, and debt and equity securities. After deregistration, applicant will continue as an ongoing entity, and thus there will be no winding-up of applicant's affairs and no distributions to shareholders relating to a winding up of affairs. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
