In its resolutions, the congress defined the New Sudan's territory and created military and civilian administrations, a parliament, and a judicial system in a step believed to pave the way for the declaration of a state in southern Sudan or for the imposition of a confederal formula for the country. [passage omitted] A press statement issued by the SPLM, a copy of which was received by AL-HAYAH yesterday, said that the movement's congress, the first of its kind since since the movement's birth in 1983, concluded its work on 11 April in an unnamed venue somewhere in "the liberated areas of southern Sudan." It added that the congress "announced the birth of a political and administrative entity which will from now on be called the New Sudan" and that it will consist of "areas south of Kurdufan (in the west of the country), south of the Blue Nile (in the east), and the three southern districts of the Upper Nile, Equatoria, and Bahr al-Ghazal," the regions identified by the movement as the "fighting regions," which were known as the "closed regions" under British colonialism and from which the northerners were banned except by special permit. The congress formed a parliament for the New Sudan and called it "the National Liberation Council" with a term of five years. It also formed an Executive Council similar to a cabinet. It elected Garang as speaker of the parliament and chairman of the Executive Council and appointed the movement's Chief of Staff Commander Silva Kir [as transliterated] as Garang's deputy. The congress decided that the Liberation Council shall consist of 182 members "of whom 132 are to be elected by popular ballot, 38 are to represent the movement's Army and regular forces, and 10, in addition to the speaker and his deputy, are to be appointed." The congress authorized the Executive Council to work for the following: 1. Seek to fulfill the right of the people of the New Sudan to self-determination by all means including armed struggle. 2. Use the New Sudan's resources in the management of the war if necessary. 3. Separate the civilian administration from the military administration. 4. Introduce the necessary civilian administration structures for the New Sudan. 5. Create a judiciary system to be independent from the legislative and executive institutions. 6. Uphold the rule of law and human rights. 7. Grant a general amnesty for individuals who rebelled against the movement or committed crimes. Steven Wandu, the movement's spokesman, said that Garang assured the congress members that the Executive Council would implement the congress resolutions and he announced a general amnesty for his opponents and emphasized that "those who return would be given their full rights and privileges." Garang affirmed that the Council "will do its best to achieve unity of the people of the New Sudan." Movement sources say that the announcement of the creation of a new entity coincides with the movement's call for a confederal state in Sudan for a transitional period to be followed by a referendum on self-determination. Observers of Sudanese affairs see that step as a practical move toward that phase which had been expected to materialize in the context of a peace agreement defining the jurisdictions of the northern and southern entities in the transitional period in accordance with the movement's peace plan. Commenting on the announcement of the New Sudan entity, a Sudanese Government source has stated that the "aim of such talk is to raise the collapsing morale of the rebel soldiers after the successive defeats they suffered and the divisions within their ranks." That declaration, he said, "might have been effective had it been made in 1987 or 1988 when the rebels were in control of all southern territories with the exception of the three main cities, but it is ridiculous now as the government is control of all Sudanese territory with the exception of some isolated pockets on the borders with Uganda."
