According to a written memorandum from "Q" [former South African Police officer who supplied information to the Goldstone Commission] generals Basie Smit and Krappies Engelbrecht, supported by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members Themba Khoza and Victor Ndlovu, initiated the gun-manufacturing project for the purpose of orchestrating violence. Until about 18 months ago, the unit was involved in the manufacture of homemade weapons on the East Rand and in Silverton. Warrant-Officer Snor Vermeulen, Warrant-Officer Lionel Snyman and Warrant-Officer Dawid Britz -- all members of C10 -- directed this operation. Other weapons from Koevoet [former South-West Africa counterinsurgency unit] supplies had been transported to Vlakplaas and later to Murrayhill (Mechem). The weapons were cleaned in acid and their serial numbers removed. The weapons were then placed in black bags and distributed to IFP members. Later, weapons were also received from Mozambique. When the unit's arms supply ran low, they bought weapons from Brooklyn Circle Arms. Five former operatives of Vlakplaas testified to the following. A large quantity of weapons from Koevoet was transported to Vlakplaas in the late 1980s, including AK-47s, mortars, RPG-7 rockets and hand grenades. Many of these weapons were supplied to Inkatha. Later the arms were transferred to a nearby farm and some were stored at the Speskop military installation. Former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock had arranged for the purchase of firearms from a weapons shop in Pretoria, including Glock pistols. The weapons were bought in the name of Badger Arms, one of several front companies run by De Kock. The men worked extensively with false documents, including passports. When Vlakplaas eventually disbanded, Brigadier Beukes and Colonel Cronje, both of SAP [South African Police] headquarters in Pretoria, arranged false identity documents and passports. This information was tested through the Department of Home Affairs and the SAP and found to be true. The Men Involved According to the main informant, known as "Q", Unit C1 at Vlakplaas, later known as C10, under the command of Colonel Eugene de Kock, had been involved since 1989 in violence aimed at the destabilisation of South Africa, including the organisation of hostel and train violence. The operations were under the command of Lieutenant-General Baise Smit and Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht. Lieutenant-General Johan de Roux, head of Crime Combating and Investigation Services, had full knowledge of, and was involved in, these activities. Dries (Brood) van Heerden, a former Vlakplaas man now a senior security official at ABSA [Almagamated Banks of South Africa] bank, was involved in distributing the weapons, employing only Zulus loyal to the IFP. He was assisted by another ABSA official, Douglas Crew. Others involved in the project were Eugene de Kock, Brood van Heerden, Willie Nortje, Charlie Chate, Chappies Klopper, Snor Vermeulen, Lionel Synman and Dawid Britz, all from unit C10, Vossie de Kock and Koekies Koekemoer of the East Rand Murder and Robbery Unit; Larry Hinton, Laurie Wasserman and Andy Taylor of the Durban security police; and the then KwaZulu Police Commissioner General Jac Buchner. Evidence was that Engelbrecht had at all times been involved in the projects and approved payments from the fund. The Inkatha Connection IFP Transvaal leader Themba Khoza was recruited by Brood van Heerden and Victor Ndlovu later joined them. They distributed weapons. Khoza was caught at a roadblock with some of these arms on September 4 1990. Unit C10 paid his bail and legal fees, Khoza concocted a story about the weapons and was acquitted. The project also involved crash courses in weapons and grenade training for IFP members. Khoza was issued with a car and he and Victor Ndlovu were paid as "informers" using false names. They were also supplied with firearms. Some of the arms distributed to the IFP were manufactured by Vlakplaas members at Mechem, a subsidiary of Denel. The commission further noted that an investigation into KwaZulu Police [KZP], hit squads, made public last December, had been blocked by a Brigadier E du Preez "in direct contradiction" of a decision made after a meeting with President de Klerk. The commission said there was "convincing evidence" that "elements in the KZP have been and are still involved in hit squad activities in Natal and also in the Transvaal". An officer investigating this said there was evidence "indicating the involvement of members of the SAP security police in hit squad activities". The commission criticized the deputy-commissioner of the KZP, Major-General Mathe, whose name "over years (has) been linked with improper conduct in the course of his official duties". The Cover-Ups The commission was told that on Engelbrecht's orders, all files and correspondence relating to Inkatha were to be destroyed. The commission also received information that Engelbrecht had instructed C10 members of dig up information compromise Goldstone so that he could be "persuaded" to drop the inquiry. Lieutenant-Colonel Botha told the commission that Engelbrecht had requested a Brigadier Schoeman to report that Englebrecht's department was not involved in the matters under investigation. The commission also has information that Smit helped to quash an investigation of motor theft against Lieutenant Piet Botha, one of the directors of Intercol. Two police officers, Colonel Roelf Venter and Major Henning Brand, approached Major du Plessis and attempted to find out how the Goldstone Commission investigation was proceeding. Venter later asked Du Plessis to keep Engelbrecht informed on who was giving information to the commission and what the National Intelligence Service was passing on. At the suggesting of the Commissioner of Police, General Johan van der Merwe, and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel, the allegations were put to generals Smit, Engelbrecht and Le Roux and colonels De Kock, Venter and Bellingham. Venter said Engelbrecht had put a stop to his investigation into alleged arms importation by De Kock. Guns for Money There was testimony that De Kock himself took some of the money he received in payment for the arms. De Kock was paid by the IFP for the weapons. Although he left the SAP almost a year ago with a R[rand]1.2-million "golden handshake" -- with the approval of the Cabinet -- he continued with the project. De Kock, Vermeulen, and other operatives Paul van Dyk, Jeff Bosigo, Joe Mamesela and Lucas Kalino, left the SAP with huge payouts to keep them quiet. The Askaris [former African National Congress guerrillas working for police] were paid between R200,000 and R600,000 each. The commission was supplied with information about two front companies, Eastech and Intercol, set up by De Kock was in excess of R1 million and was approved by the Cabinet.
