Fresh "difficulties" had emerged in resolving the crisis but "I don't think things have yet reached a point where the final resort has to be adopted," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng, giving the first indication that sanctions might be an option if the situation on the Korean peninsula deteriorates further. However, Shen stressed that "at this time" Beijing was opposed "to resorting to means that might sharpen the confrontation." The row over the nature of North Korea's nuclear programme intensified recently after Pyongyang rejected a request by the UN Security Council to suspend the removal of fuel rods from a five- megawatt reactor, suspected by the United States of being a nuclear bomb factory. Shen said China's stance that the dispute should be solved through negotiation "remains unchanged." "I believe that as long as the parties concerned remain calm ... the difficulty is likely to be overcome," he added. North Korea issued a new threat Thursday to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continued to pressure Pyongyang to accede to their nuclear inspection demands. The IAEA says the fuel rod operation at the Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, is crucial for determining whether any plutonium has been secretly diverted for military use.
