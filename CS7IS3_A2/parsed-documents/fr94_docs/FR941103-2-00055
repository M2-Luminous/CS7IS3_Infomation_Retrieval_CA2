FR941103-2-00055 FR941103-2-00031 Discussion Many factors influenced this rate adjustment. The items having an impact upon the proposed Integrated Projects firm power rates are summarized in the table below. Because rates must earn sufficient revenues to pay for estimated future costs, the table compares the change in the average annual projections used in the FY 1991 Rate Order PRS (which set the rate effective October 1, 1992) and the ratesetting PRS prepared for this rate adjustment. Major Factors Affecting the Integrated Projects' Firm Power Rate 1Event 1Change in average annual revenue requirement ($000,000) 1Estimated rate effect (mills/kWh) Increase in Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Transmission and Other Miscellaneous Revenues: primarily, compensation for new Phase-Shifter services (for Western System Coordinating Council loop-flow mitigation) $^2.6 ^0.33 Increase in CRSP Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Expense: $2.8 million per year due to inclusion of CME interest (inadvertently omitted from current rate); Remainder due to shifting of field crews from construction to maintenance work 8.2 1.05 Increase in Small Project O&M Expense: Rio Grande Project is one of Western's oldest projects, and O&M increases with age; Collbran has many small irrigation dams needing repair 1.1 0.14 Increase in Purchased Power and Transmission Expense: The environmentally-related flow restrictions already in place at CRSP powerplants require Western to purchase additional power to meet contractual delivery obligations 1.6 0.20 $51.2 million in historical environmental expenses made nonreimbursable by Grand Canyon Protection Act (plus $9.1 million associated with deferred interest expense); Applied to outstanding deficits ^0.5 ^0.06 Passage of Grand Canyon Protection Act made certain future environmental costs nonreimbursable ^1.0 ^0.13 Increase in Interest on Project Investment: The increase in power investment and unpaid deficits since the October 1992 rate adjustment resulted in an increase in annual interest due 2.1 0.27 Increase in Project Additions and Replacements: As noted on page 13 of Rate Brochure, $80.5 million was omitted from CWIP in the October 1992 rate adjustment 1.2 0.15 Increase in aid to CRSP irrigation and participating projects: Investment is very similar to October 1992 rate adjustment; however, there are 63 total years to pay for the investment, rather than the 65 years used previously since both studies have the pinch-point year of 2057. The change in the divisor results in the annual increase 1.4 0.18 n,s Totals $11.5 1.47 The existing and proposed revenue requirements for the Integrated Projects are as follows: Integrated Projects Average Annual Firm-Power Revenue Requirements 1␣ 1Estimated average annual FY 1995&hyph;99 firm power revenue ($000) 2SLIP&hyph;F4 2SLIP&hyph;F5 Firm power revenue 1$109,265 2$122,413 1From FY 1991 Rate Order PRS. 2From Ratesetting PRS. The rate increase is necessary to satisfy the cost-recovery criteria set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. This rate schedule, which will be effective on an interim basis beginning December 1, 1994, replaces Rate Schedule SLIP/F4 which FERC approved through September 30, 1996 at 62 FERC ¶61,159 (February 18, 1993). Statement of Revenue and Related Expenses The following table provides a summary of revenue and expense data through the 5-year proposed rate approval period.

Negative net purchase power expense figures imply surplus sales in excess of total purchase power expenses. Likewise, positive net purchase power expense figures imply total purchase power expenses in excess of total power sales. 3Interest on undepreciated CME, annual liability for the Civil Service Retirement System, and annual gross power-related requirements for the Collbran, Provo River, Rio Grande, and Seedskadee Projects. 4Includes repayment of capitalized deficits. 5Does not equal Total Revenues due to rounding. 6Ibid. Basis for Rate Development The provisional Integrated Projects rate was designed to continue to maintain an approximate 50/50 split between revenue earned from demand charges and that earned from energy charges. The cost to individual customers will vary because of differences in the amounts of capacity and energy they purchase from the Integrated Projects. The provisional rate contains a $3.83/kW/month firm-capacity charge and an 8.90 mills/kWh firm-energy charge in FY 1995. The necessary composite rate is 20.17 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 7.9 percent above the existing rate. The rate terminates on November 30, 1999. Comments During the 97-day comment period, Western received nine letters commenting on the rate adjustment. One letter was received after the close of the comment period. Additionally, four persons commented during the June 30, 1994, public comment forum. All comments received by the end of the comment period were reviewed and considered in the preparation of this rate order. Written comments were received before the comment deadline from the following sources: Bountiful City Light and Power (Utah) Bridger Valley Electric Association (Wyoming) Colorado River Energy Distributors Association (Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) Energy Strategies, Inc. (Utah) Garkane Power Association, Inc. (Arizona and Utah) Intermountain Consumer Power Association (Nevada and Utah) Irrigation and Electrical Districts Association of Arizona (Arizona) Upper Colorado River Commission (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) Utah Municipal Power Agency (Utah) Representatives of the following organizations made oral comments: Colorado River Energy Distributors Association (Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) Intermountain Consumer Power Association (Nevada and Utah) Irrigation and Electrical Districts Association of Arizona (Arizona) Platte River Power Authority (Colorado) Most of the comments received at the public meetings and in correspondence dealt with cost, purchased power, and water depletion projections. The comments and responses, paraphrased for brevity when it does not affect the meaning of the statement(s), are discussed below. Direct quotes from comment letters are used for clarification where necessary. The issues discussed are: (1) Depletion-related issues, (2) purchased power expense, (3) future flow restrictions at Glen Canyon Dam, (4) O&M-related issues, (5) construction-related projections, (6) environmentally-related expenses, (7) miscellaneous comments, and (8) issue paper resolution. 1. Depletion-Related Issues Extensive comments were made regarding the deferred recognition of water depletions for water projects in the Colorado River Basin after FY 2010. Western's responses are listed sequentially: a. Comment: Western is being guided solely by RA 6120.2 in the rate-setting process without paying sufficient attention to the CRSP Act of 1956 and other relevant legislation. The rate does not accurately reflect the intent of the CRSP Act, which is to produce rates that result in full repayment of the power system costs.
