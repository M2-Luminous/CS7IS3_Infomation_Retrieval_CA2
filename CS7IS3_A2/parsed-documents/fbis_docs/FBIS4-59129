At 1200 today, 10 May 1994, squadrons of the Zionist-U.S. enemy aircraft carried out several barbaric raids on PFLP-GC institutions that provide humanitarian, medical, and other services in the al-Na'imah area south of Beirut. The enemy aircraft carried out six raids over a period of two hours on these positions, hurling tonnes of their hatred and destruction. The Zionist aircraft continue to overfly the area. The military spokesman continued: We in the PFLP-GC view this Zionist aggression as an extension of the Hebron massacre and the policy of killing and terrorism that the U.S. peace brings with it and which pursues its open war against our people's aspirations and rights and seeks to undermine the morale of the mujahdin who struggle to regain their rights. As for our losses, they are limited and minor. We will issue a communique later as the situation and needs dictate. The military spokesman added: It is important for us in the PFLP-GC to emphasize to the masses of our nation and people that our political stand and struggle will continue in spite of what is being concocted against our rights, against our people, and against our nation. We are confident about achieving inevitable victory. The Zionist-U.S. policy of terrorism will not separate us from our cause. We pledge to pursue the revolution until the liberation of land and man.
