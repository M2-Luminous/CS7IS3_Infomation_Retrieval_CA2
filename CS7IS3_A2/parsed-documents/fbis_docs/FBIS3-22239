AKEL [the Restorative Party of the Working People] abstained from the vote, claiming that a simple change of ministry name would be a move without substance if there is no prior discussion and correct decisionmaking on the structure of departments that will deal with environmental issues. Democratic Party deputy Nikolaos Mousiouttas also abstained from the vote, claiming that the importance of environmental issues is diminished when they are simply made part of another ministry.
