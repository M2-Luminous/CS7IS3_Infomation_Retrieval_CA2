At the same time, he expressed the hope that Germany will have an inflation rate "with a two in front of the decimal point" by the end of the year. In addition, the finance minister called for a reduction of the German net contribution to the European Union, which is "slightly too high." In his statements about the economic development, Waigel mentioned a growth rate of 1.5 percent for 1994. Bonn's tight consolidation policy was the precondition for the historically low interest rates. As a result of the reduction of interest rates in the past few months, an investment volume of about 30 percent was created. Waigel criticized the "punitive tax" for persons without children, which was rejected by the CDU. The concept of family splitting, supported by the CDU, still has to be discussed, he pointed out. Cassandra will not be elected, Waigel shouted amid the applause of the 1,000 delegates. Never before since 1949 has so much been accomplished in one legislative period as between 1990 and 1994. The CDU/CSU must now ensure that no one will govern without or against the CDU and the CSU in Germany. Similar to Kohl, Waigel suggested that those who do not believe in he success of the CDU/CSU should give up their candidacy. The CSU leader vigorously rejected a grand coalition in Bonn. He expressed the hope that the CDU and the CSU will not see any need for another grand coalition in this century. Waigel praised Kohl demonstratively for his achievements concerning German unity. The CSU leader described the chancellor as "a man, a tree, and a rock." Waigel sharply attacked the SPD and its chairman Rudolf Scharping. He described the leading democrats as "swaying figures" whose names the leaders in other European capitals find difficult to spell. "No one tells as many lies as the SPD." The CSU leader warned the voters against the Instead Party and the Republikaner. In Hamburg, the Instead Party took votes from the CDU, but what was achieved was the SPD's absolute rule. As a result of the protest votes for the Republikaner in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the grand coalition there has become unable to act on the asylum issue. Germany cannot afford a Weimar situation. After Bismarck and Adenauer, another German chancellor -- Chancellor Kohl -- should not be removed too early.
