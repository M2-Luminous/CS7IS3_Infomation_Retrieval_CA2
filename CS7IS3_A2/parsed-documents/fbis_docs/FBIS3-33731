He said: The followers of the Ahl al-Bayt, may peace be upon them, have raised the flag of Islam and the Koran in this part of the world, and in continuation of the efforts and struggles by the family of purity and modesty, may peace be upon them, they have managed to rid Islam of oppression and alienation.

[passage omitted] His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i then said that one of the main objectives of America, the world's domineering powers and their dependent political regimes, is to create a rift between the Shiites and the Sunnis. He added: The gathering of the followers of Ahl al-Bayt in Islamic Iran is step toward unifying the adherent of the great Koran. This gathering will also pave the way for unity in the Islamic world and understanding among all Islamic sects. The great nation of Iran praises God that it has been able to put all its integrity, might, and capability a global scale at the disposal of Islam and the Koran. His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i stressed the sensitivity of the Islamic republic of Iran toward the issues of Muslim nations, and said: The Muslim nation of Iran does not consider itself aloof from the problems of the Muslim nations. While refraining from interference in the affairs of other countries, Iran is carefully following the issues of the Islamic world, to which it attaches great importance. The Islamic republic of Iran considers the problems of Kashmir, Afghanistan, and the oppressed but courageous nations of Palestine and Lebanon, as its own problems, and makes endeavors on a global level to resolve them. The leader of Islamic revolution expressed profound regret at the process of fratricide in Afghanistan, and set out to question the leaders of armed parties and groups in that country. He said: What excuses can the Afghan leaders give to the Afghan nation, and what justification can they provide for the Islamic community? They have managed to deliver the kind of blow to the Afghan nation that the communists had not been able to deliver. They must know that the Islamic Ummah will question those individuals who inflict so much destruction and bloodbath on a nation on the grounds of sectarian, partisan, and personal issues.
