The reason for this is bad weather. Sowing machines have stopped work in most rayons because of the rain which has affected practically the entire territory of the Belgorod region area. As of today 86 percent of areas here have already been sown to early grain crops. So as not to lose time and to complete sowing in the shortest time possible, machine operators have organized duty rosters in field camps. As soon as weather conditions permit they are ready to bring the full range of agricultural equipment into operation.
