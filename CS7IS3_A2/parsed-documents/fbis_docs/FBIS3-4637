We, representatives of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia [VGNUFC], are very happy that you have granted us this interview. As you know, the Anlung Veng Front's Command and the Democratic Kampuchean National Army [NADK]'s High Command have already informed our compatriots that on 24 February 1994, our NADK completely smashed the fourth large-scale military operation of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government on Anlung Veng battlefield. Our entire compatriots are very pleased with this news. We would like your excellency to tell us about the future developments of the situation. [Khieu Samphan] I would like to thank you, VGNUFC correspondents. Actually, this large-scale military operation to destroy Anlung Veng has been the military campaign of the Hanoi Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, and the evil alliance to destroy and compel Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to accept their three points and thereby to destroy the five-point uideline of His Majesty the King, to oppose the king himself, to destroy the hope for national reconciliation, and to eliminate our Cambodian nation and people. They have already launched four large-scale military operations. The crushing of those four large-scale military operations, particularly the fourth on 24 February, is a very big defeat suffered by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, and the alliance. It is a victory of our entire people and of the forces supporting the king's five-point national reconciliation plan, and of peace-loving countries in the world. What will the future situation be? Will the Hanoi Vietnamese communists, the elements that they have installed, the two-headed government, and their alliance stubbornly carry on the Vietnamese war of aggression, continue to oppose the king and his five-point guideline for national reconciliation, and do their utmost to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people? I am firmly convinced that if they continue to do so, they will certainly suffer even more serious defeats. This is because, it is very clear that the two-headed government's forces have suffered heavy casualties in the defeat at Anlung Veng. Presently, the two- headed government's troops routed at Anlung Veng, [words indistinct]. We do not know how many of them [words indistinct] in the jungle and died because of the lack of food and water, particularly at this time of the year when water sources become scarce. Most importantly, those who continue the Hanoi Vietnamese communists' war of aggression and who oppose national reconciliation will certainly be opposed and condemned even more strongly by the Cambodian nation and people. At a time when the Vietnamese communists have amassed tens of thousands of square kilometers of Cambodia's territory from the Dragon's tail [area in Mondolkiri Province] down to Kampot Province, as well as her seas and continental shelf, at a time when they continue to send more Vietnamese settlers into Cambodia with numbers already reaching four million [words indistinct] a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now in Vietnam], at a time when our people have to undergo hardship and suffering [passage indistinct], the two-headed government has done nothing to resolve these grave problems. It has instead tried hard to continue fueling the Vietnamese war of aggression to eliminate our nation and people (?and) DK resistance forces. Can the Cambodian nation and people accept such a situation? Make no mistake about it. Our nation and people are not ignorant. They are fully aware of who is responsible for their current misery and suffering. No one can deceive them as they have seen with their own eyes and are the victims of such a hardship and suffering. 1. They can see clearly that the continued misery and suffering of our nation and people come from the fact that the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese communists have continued their aggression and occupation of our country through the state power that they have installed since 1979. The aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese communists are behind this state power and have continued to control and guide this state power, carrying on their war of aggression through this state power, sending more Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia in line with their strategy to annex Cambodia through a demographic war, and so forth. 2. They also know that it is because some foreign powers together with the Vietnamese communists have attempted to eliminate the Cambodian people and oppose the national reconciliation and the king. 3. They know that it is because this two-headed government which is only the by-product of the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese communists and their evil alliance and (?stays in the iron cage) of the Vietnamese communist puppets. These are indeed the causes of the misery and suffering of our nation and people who can no longer tolerate them. Look at the countryside, what is the situation there? The most outstanding development is that our people have risen up and mutinied against the Vietnamese puppets' village and commune administration to liberate their villages and communes. They have mutinied not just to seize back their farmlands, cattle, rice, and food, but also to oppose the war to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people. In Phnom Penh and other provincial towns, students and teachers have staged demonstrations. The people whose land and houses were appropriated have also staged demonstrations. Those puppet troops and Para [Khmer People's National Liberation Frong] and FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] soldiers have also mutinied against the war to eliminate their own nation and people. They have turned their guns against the evil ringleaders and deserted their ranks, even hundreds at a time. Some who can no longer make a living have turned to rob traders and customers in markets. Some homeless soldiers have tried to settle anywhere they can. There have also been bloody repressions and so forth. What does all these mean? Is this not a signal that our nation and people are no longer able to endure? What are the causes of the defeat suffered at Anlung Veng by the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, the Vietnamese communists, and their evil alliance? Are they [words indistinct]? I think that it is necessary to give this matter very careful consideration. I do believe that after careful consideration, we can see that it is because the DK enjoys the participation of the entire nation and people in the struggle as it has always stayed with them. To fight against the DK is tantamount to fighting against the entire nation and people; therefore, the latter has to join in the struggle both in the countryside and in the cities. In such a situation, it is certainly not tanks or artillery that is decisive. [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency Mr. chairman for this clear explanation to our compatriots. With such a situation, what do you think about its solution? [Khieu Samphan] The DK party's stand is well-known to everyone, that is, national reconciliation in line with the king's five-point policy. On this matter, I would like to speak on the following two issues. First: As far as the foreign powers who have interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs and opposed national reconciliation and the king's five-point policy guideline are concerned, is it not about time for them to reconsider their position? Is it not better to reach a solution that will enable Cambodia to regain peace and national reconciliation in line with the king's five-point political guideline, thus enabling Cambodia as well as the whole of Southeast Asia to live in peace and their relations to prosper on the basis of peace and mutual benefit? Second: Concerning Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and the other FUNCINPEC leaders, I would like to sincerely propose that you reconsider your current stand. Have your highness and the other FUNCINPEC leaders been aware of what our nation and people have thought about your activities in the recent past? People from all walks of life have expressed their deep regret and have been wondering why FUNCINPEC leaders have fallen into the bad policy of the foreigners, have become friends with the henchmen of the Vietnamese, have embraced the Hanoi Vietnamese communists, and have waged war against their own Cambodian nation and people. How have the FUNCINPEC leaders been misled by those with Vietnamese minds and the Vietnamese communists themselves into massacring their own fellow ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] and FUNCINPEC forces? They regret this so deeply. If you are now aware of the fact, will you continue to listen to the foreigners or will you instead turn to listen to the king's advice and heed the call of our nation and people? I do believe that it is not too late yet. Our nation and people are waiting for you and will not fail to support you. Our nation and people want only peace and national reconciliation. His Majesty the King has issued the five-point policy guideline because he is aware of the grave and explosive situation in our country at present both in terms of national and social issues. His five points come from his very careful consideration. As he himself has been very close to our nation and people, he understands the wishes of our nation and people better than anyone. Our entire Cambodian nation and people support the five-point political guideline of His Majesty the King. They want to see all national forces reconciled and united both within the army and in the government. They want to see all national forces joined in one national army, that is within the framework of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces. They want to see a genuine national government so that there would be enough national forces to tackle national and social issues, small and big alike. The DK party fully supports His Majesty the King's five-point political guideline. I would like to stress here again that the DK party does not want to eliminate any force or any personality. But, the DK party will never allow anyone to eliminate it. The current situation clearly indicates that our nation and people will not allow anyone to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea or to continue to oppose national reconciliation. In brief, I would like to say that the only way out is national reconciliation in accordance with the king's five-point political guideline. [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency for your explanation to our compatriots. We wish you happiness and successes in your noble patriotic mission. Thank you.
