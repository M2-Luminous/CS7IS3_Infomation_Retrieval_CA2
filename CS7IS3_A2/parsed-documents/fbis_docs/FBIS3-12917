[Qaddumi] The economic life of the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples is a joint economic and social life. There is no way we can separate the aspects of these two peoples who have common interests in all spheres. We must strengthen these interests and create institutions capable of protecting them so that they will stand up against all the challenges that will face us in the future and that will try to devour the Palestinian economy. The agreement with Jordan and the one with Egypt seek to strengthen the Palestinian economic infrastructure and depend on the Arab parties and international aid to build a growing and independent Palestinian economy capable of freeing itself from Israel's grip. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Don't you think there is a contradiction in the course of Palestinian planning between the economic appendices of the Oslo agreement and the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement? [Qaddumi] This contradiction has not surfaced so far. We have agreed with Jordan on several economic aspects but have not reached any agreement with Israel, even though the economic appendices provide for cooperation in all spheres. We view this cooperation by our own concept, which is cooperation to free ourselves from the Israeli economy, in a basic way. This will ensure peace in the region. But if Israel wants to swallow up the Palestinian economy, peace will not be established. Israel's attempts at economic containment will fail, no matter what. Therefore, we are against customs cooperation with Israel. They have their own customs system, which is suitable to their advanced Israeli society. We also have our own customs system. However, there can be understanding on the import of goods from abroad. Undoubtedly, this course will protect the peace process and put it on a sound and correct path. If Israel tries to impose its will on economic matters, we will absolutely reject its measures. As I have stated, Palestine's economic life is tied to fraternal Jordan's economic life. There is no way we can ignore this fact but we must strengthen these economic ties. Our people live on the two banks and our Jordanian people are part of us. We have passed through a successful unity experiment. We cannot distinguish between a Palestinian and a Jordanian. The two people have common interests and ties that must be strengthened. As for economic relations with Israel, I clearly say: We will not allow the Israeli finance minister to decide which goods must pay customs fees. If there is a need to change the customs system or to alter the customs tariff on a certain commodity, we will do it. This is our stand, which is sound. No one can compel us to accept a unified customs system. In addition, the import policies are not uniform in the world. Each country has its own policy. If we take into account the low standard of living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the customs tariff imposed on imported goods cannot be similar to the customs tariff imposed in Israel. In short, Israel has its own system and we have our own system, which is considerably similar to the Jordanian customs system. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Occasionally, it looks as if Palestinian-Jordanian relations pass through difficult periods. We have seen Jordanian statements criticizing the PLO's weak coordination with Jordan. What is the truth about these relations and what is their present status? [Qaddumi] The slogan of coordination between Jordan and Palestine is raised by both sides but coordination has not reached the level that we or our brothers in Jordan want. The obstacles to the implementation of the agreement confirm and do not preclude the need to strengthen this coordination. This coordination must result in a broad plan of understanding between us and our brothers in Jordan. This led to the signing of the first economic agreement and then the second economic agreement, which includes many matters mentioned in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The second agreement covers all aspects of life--administrative, security, and economic aspects, as well as displaced people, refugees, borders, legislative affairs, and laws. Hence, we have actually begun following the correct course for coordination and cooperation that we should have followed a long time ago. I do not say which side is to blame. We were all busy with the peace process. When the proper time came to consolidate this coordination and cooperation, we began holding intensified meetings at the highest level (ministerial level) and drafted the terms of this coordination. The committees began to work. A few days ago, the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Political Committee held a meeting in Amman and reached agreement on most of the tasks of the committees that we have formed and appointed. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] There has been talk about establishing a Palestinian central bank as a symbol of Palestinian sovereignty and as preparatory groundwork for building a state. But looking into the articles of the agreement with Jordan we see that the task of this bank has been given to the Jordanian Central Bank. [Qaddumi] This is not absolutely correct. The Jordanian-Palestinian accord referred to an agreement of the PLO and Jordan to reopen the Jordanian banks that existed before Israel's occupation of the West Bank and this responsibility extended to cover the Gaza Strip. We accepted this and said that the Jordanian Central Bank will supervise these Jordanian banks that have branches in the West Bank. There is a joint technical and fiscal committee that supervises the tasks and responsibilities of the Jordanian Central Bank. On the one hand, the Jordanian Central Bank oversees these banks and, on the other hand, there is a joint Palestinian-Jordanian technical committee that receives a full report from the central bank after frequent inspections and supervision of the aforementioned Jordanian banks. This practice will continue until a Palestinian monetary authority has been established. When such an authority is established, it will assume all the responsibilities; in other words, the functions of the Jordanian Central Bank will cease after a Palestinian monetary authority is established. We know perfectly well that when talking about Jordan or Palestine, we do not talk about different states but of our concern as one team for the joint interests of these two nations who live on the two banks and in Gaza. Hence the Jordanian-Palestinian accord is the pinnacle of coordination and cooperation between the brothers in Palestine and Jordan. Then came subsequent agreement to enhance this cooperation with our brothers in Jordan. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] And what about the agreement with Egypt? [Qaddumi] We also signed an economic agreement with Egypt to help us develop our economy inside the occupied territories. The agreement stipulates Egypt's right to open branches of its banks in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. All this is aimed at investment, transferring capitals, developing the Palestinian economy, and building its infrastructure. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Do you believe that the U.S.-Syrian summit will have a positive impact on the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track, which could delay any progress on the Palestinian track? [Qaddumi] I disagree with those who hold this opinion because any progress on the Palestinian track helps advance the Syrian track and vice versa. Any progress on the Syrian track helps advance the Palestinian and other Arab tracks. We wish the best for Syria if it progresses in its negotiations with Israel, and we support sisterly Syria in its negotiating process to achieve its national rights. That is why I said at the beginning that the Syrians will not sign a deal before the Palestinians do. There was a mutual agreement at the ministerial coordination meetings that genuine progress in the negotiations has to be made on the Palestinian track because there are differences between this track and other Arab tracks. That is to say, we are first negotiating over a transition phase that we want to finish and then will move on to negotiating the final phase. This transition phase does not exist on the other Arab tracks, on which the delegations negotiate only the final phase. So any progress on the Syrian track will serve the Palestinian track because this means that Israel will withdraw from the Golan and south Lebanon. This helps us because everyone agrees that a final solution must be reached simultaneously, and all the Arab parties should sign a comprehensive peace deal on the same day. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Despite the coordination and agreements you mentioned, Syria continues to deliver sharp criticism against every Palestinian move toward a transitional solution that you mentioned. What is your comment? [Qaddumi] Not only Syria criticized these moves; I was one of those who criticized them. We admit there are flaws in the Palestinian-Israeli accord and the Palestinians criticized the Cairo agreement. Regrettably, the Israelis placed one option before us. This does not mean that it was an acceptable option, but rather an option imposed on us because we want to advance this process to return our land. What distinguishes the negotiations on the Palestinian track is that we are trying to enable our displaced people to receive their land. The point is that our people should live on their land not that we should just retake our land. The issue centers on the Palestinian refugees' return to their land; there is no such issue on the other Arab tracks. This is our basic concern and such issues and concerns do not exist on other tracks. Therefore, we often sacrifice other issues to guarantee our nation's return to its land; afterward, the nation can undo the shackles, with which the Israeli occupation tied it. Actually, this is the main difference between us and the Arab tracks. No matter how long the negotiations on the Arab tracks take, they do not have much effect on the Palestinian track. We want to halt the settlements and want the enemy to withdraw from every inch of our land so that the enemy will not build more settlements. The presence of our people there puts an end to settlement. It also makes it hard for waves of settlers to come to our Palestinian land. This is because the implementation of the agreement means Israel has no right after today to build any settlement on the Palestinian territory, despite its paramilitary presence on this territory. Also, the presence of our people on their land will put us in a stronger position to prevent the building of new settlements because the Israeli objective is to absorb the Palestinian land. The Israeli extremists and the fanatic Zionists in the world, particularly in the United States, claim that the Palestinian land is a disputed territory. As for the Golan, everybody admits that it is part of Syria, and the same goes for south Lebanon, which is recognized as part of Lebanon. So we are struggling to give the Palestinian identity to this land and force an Israeli acknowledgement that this land is Palestinian and, thereafter, it would be impermissible to establish any settlements on it. This is what the Arabs must understand when talking about the transitional period, in which things get mixed up, criticisms and queries increase, and the question is often asked: Why do the Palestinians accept this or that matter? As I have stated once, we are facing tough choices and the majority of the Palestinian leadership opted for the lesser evil, particularly following the Malta summit between U.S. President George Bush and then Soviet President Gorbachev. At this summit, they agreed to bring thousands of Russian immigrants into Palestinian land. The Baghdad Arab summit studied the new situation to protect the Palestinian land from being swallowed. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Did the Syrian leadership understand the Palestinian motives? [Qaddumi] The details of the Palestinian position demonstrate that we have a clear-cut strategy, and the Arabs realize it. However, they cannot back what we too are criticizing. What we have accepted is a choice imposed on us. We are struggling to gain more rights for our people so that they may have full sovereignty over their territory. The Arab brothers are trying to avoid discrepancies between the Palestinian track and the other Arab tracks. That is, they want the Syrian track to be similar to the Palestinian track. But the fact is it cannot be similar to the Palestinian track, because the facts regarding the Palestinian track are different from those of the Syrian or Lebanese tracks. We too back Syria and Lebanon when they say that the tracks are different and that a solution cannot be similar in all tracks. However, a solution must involve a comprehensive, explicit, and clear withdrawal and the removal of settlements. We are moving inch by inch on the Palestinian track to ultimately achieve these goals, but the methods we use may differ from those of the other tracks. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You mention the question of removing the settlements, but there is no text that explicitly refers to the removal of settlements or even to a halt to building activity. [Qaddumi] The political settlement is based on international legality; that is, "land for peace." The definition of land is that we must enjoy sovereignty over it. Thus, an Israeli settlement built on Palestinian land cannot remain. But how can it be removed? This is the question that we have to solve. When and how? In addition, the Security Council resolutions rule that these settlements are illegitimate and must be removed, and Israel must remove them because the final solution, as stipulated in the agreement, must comply with Security Council Resolution 242. This resolution calls for Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, a just solution to the question of Palestinian refugees, and the inadmissibility of seizing others' territory by force. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Doesn't Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi] believe that making progress on the Palestinian track, with tangible deadlocks on the other tracks, is a success for the Israeli strategy of creating a schism in the Arab front and separating the tracks? [Qaddumi] In fact, separate negotiations with each Arab party have been going on since the Madrid conference, but the Arabs are negotiating while coordinating among themselves. From the start, the PLO has sought to achieve this Arab coordination and cooperation in the negotiations. We tried to break the ice between us and Syria and started to coordinate with it; the same is true of Lebanon. We also straightened out our relations with Egypt, which in turn started to undertake its pan-Arab duties in the best possible way. This means that inter-Arab coordination proceeded well until the Oslo agreement; the fault here lies not with the Palestinians but with U.S. President Clinton. When I and brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] met President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus and handed him a copy of the agreement he said: We will study it, but we have some observations. We will not say that we are either for or against this agreement, but we will say that the Palestinian institutions, the PLO, and the Palestinian people are responsible for accepting or rejecting this agreement. In the meantime, we will give you some observations. Later, we were surprised to see that President Clinton insisted on the need to sign the agreement on 13 September. brother Abu-'Ammar tried to postpone the signing ceremony but it was a date imposed on us. This is what made brother Abu-'Ammar, in the end, go to Washington to sign the agreement. But the truth is that it was neither brother Abu-'Ammar's intention, nor the intention of the other brothers, to sign the agreement on that date because we were waiting for the observations promised by the brothers in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The mistake of the U.S. President and his administration was that they hurried the signing on 13 September to tell the world that the United States had made an important accomplishment in the Middle East. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Could this U.S. behavior be interpreted as a lack of interest in the facts about the region or a U.S. attempt to harm inter-Arab ties? [Qaddumi] This interpretation cannot be adopted. In my view, the United States at the time was going through a difficult economic crisis. It was said at the time President Clinton was reluctant to make crucial decisions. Thus, a political accomplishment was needed to improve the ratings of the U.S. Administration. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] We notice a U.S. tendency not to intervene in the Palestinian-Israeli talks. Do you expect the U.S. Administration to make a ceremonial act like it did in September? [Qaddumi] The United States is the primary sponsor of this process and cannot abandon its responsibilities to bring the views closer, promote the peace process, and put pressure on the parties concerned, particularly Israel, which shows intransigence. Without this, the peace process will not work. If the United States gives up acting as an unbiased sponsor this process will stumble. Unless real accomplishment is made on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, the peace process will stumble entirely. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But how can we talk about an unbiased U.S. role when U.S. officials do not let any opportunity pass without emphasizing their commitment to Israel's qualitative superiority over the Arab states? [Qaddumi] The United States always raises the claim that it is "an impartial sponsor". So it has to act in this way; that is, by making the peace process succeed in accordance with former President Bush's initiative in March 1991, which contained the principle of "land for peace," the recognition of the Palestinian people's political rights, and the implementation of Security Council Resolution 242 as a basis for a settlement. Judging by the promises it made to Israel, we knew from the start that the United States, particularly this administration, is biased. However, as time went by it started to realize that this bias would not serve peace in the region and that it had to be more sensitive to things that serve peace. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Can we talk about a normalization in Palestinian-Gulf relations following the visit of brother Abu-'Ammar to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with the Saudi monarch? [Qaddumi] Brother Abu-'Ammar's visit to Saudi Arabia and the visits of other Palestinian delegations to the Gulf states earlier were not only an attempt to normalize Palestinian-Gulf ties. On the contrary, they were attempts toward full inter-Arab reconciliation. We set up and participated in the committee formed by the Arab League to achieve Arab reconciliation. Without this reconciliation, the Arab position will remain weak. There must be reconciliation among all Arab members of the Arab League and an Arab charter must be drafted that clearly defines inter-Arab ties and their future. Thus, the Palestinian delegations' visits to the Arab states or the Gulf serve Arab purposes. They seek to create an appropriate atmosphere not only to serve the peace process, but also Arab reconciliation, which Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd- al-Majid is exerting strenuous efforts to achieve. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Oslo agreement did not contain a clear-cut and explicit clause about the return of the displaced persons. It looked as if the PLO had abandoned a legitimate right recognized by Security Council Resolution 437, which stipulated the right of the displaced persons to unconditionally return to their lands. Doesn't this sound logical? [Qaddumi] This is incorrect. A reference to the displaced persons of 1967 exists in the Oslo Agreement. A quadripartite Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli-Egyptian committee must be set up during the interim period. These displaced persons number more than 760,000. As for the refugees, the agreement mentioned that negotiations must be held to discuss their problem after the end of the second year of the transitional period. Also, the refugees committee of the multilateral talks is discussing this question although Israel remains intransigent and rejects Resolution 194, which stipulated the right of the Palestinian refugees from 1948 to return to their homes or, for those who do not want to return, to be compensated. Thus, negotiations between us and Israel over the refugees have been put off for two years, but this does not mean that we are not raising this issue in all international forums, in the UN General Assembly, in international conferences, and in bilateral relations. All efforts focus on the need to get Israel to recognize in principle the Palestinians' right to return to their homes in accordance with Resolution 194. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But, Brother Abu-al-Lutf, the recent "Cairo agreement" spoke about "residents" whose names are registered in the records of the Israeli authorities and about "visitors" of the Palestinian territory. It did not touch on the question of the displaced persons? [Qaddumi] The Cairo agreement is, one way or another, an annex to the Oslo agreement. It talks about who should and should not enter the Palestinian territory in the coming stage. As for the displaced persons, there are clear provisions about them in the agreement. As I said, a quadripartite committee (from Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt) will be formed to define the rules for their return; there is no room for argument about this. As for the refugees, they must not return to Gaza and Jericho but to their homes in Yafo, Haifa, the Galilee, etc. In other words, they must return to the places from which they were evicted. If they want to go as visitors to the West Bank and Gaza, they have the right to, but Israel must be informed if these persons will visit their relatives for one or two months and, in such case, they would have a visitor status. As for the question of their return, they must return to the places from which they were previously evicted. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You recently took part in a ministerial meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in Jakarta. What is your view of the movement's role and actions now that the Cold War is over, and how important is that role? [Qaddumi] The end of the international struggle that was called "the Cold War" has brought the nonaligned countries closer together. During the international struggle between the two superpowers, some of these countries were affected by the political stands of and received economic aid from one of the sides. As a result of these conditions in some nonaligned countries, differences arose within the movement. But following the end of the third world war (the Cold War), the developed countries started to have an almost identical view of these countries because interests that led to a rapprochement with them have disappeared. Hence, the big powers began to treat many nonaligned countries similarly. They started to feel that they were close to these countries and that their interests are identical and intertwined. The nonaligned countries began to feel the need to strengthen their solidarity in order to face the challenges presented by the developed countries. The struggle has in fact become more of an economic one than a political one. Therefore, we can say that the objective conditions are now present for the nonaligned countries to increase their cooperation on a regional basis, after which they will move toward comprehensive cooperation within the Nonaligned Movement's framework, because all these countries are in the south and in a struggle with the countries of the north to obtain technology and reduce their debts and the interest and services imposed on these debts. As we know, all the nonaligned countries have similar conditions and stands toward the major powers. Each one of these countries produces one or two commodities that are the basis of their economy. The developed countries in the north are trying to control the price of these commodities while the price of the developed countries' industrial goods are constantly rising. This creates an imbalance in the nonaligned countries' economic structure and makes them rally together to repel the dangers created by the developed countries' economic and trade policies. Hence, the struggle between north and south in all branches of the economic sphere will intensify. This will double the importance of solidarity among the nonaligned countries to confront the challenges imposed by the differences between the north and south. The Nonaligned Movement has become more important now than in the past because it affects the life of the citizen and his social and economic wellbeing, which in turn affect the political situation in these countries that are in dire need for political stability. We have seen a number of unstable political situations that resulted from the economic imbalance and troublesome debts of these countries. From this comes the importance of cooperation among the nonaligned countries, because the developed world is exploiting them regardless of their geographical positions or political stands. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But does not brother Abu-al-Lutf believe that the name "Nonaligned Movement" has become a relic of the past and that current conditions demand that it be changed? [Qaddumi] There is no need to change the name. We discussed this issue at length at the movement's conferences and it was decided to keep it, that is "the Nonaligned Movement", as an international movement. [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Palestinian-Israeli conflict entered a new phase on 13 September 1993. What is the scope of this conflict? [Qaddumi] The tools of the conflict will be political and social, in addition to foreign pressure. It will be a race of economic development and there will be serious attempts to organize Palestinian society so that it will be capable of facing the challenges of building and developing our institutions, training qualified cadres, finding all the honest means to enable every citizen to live a dignified life, and modernizing our institutions to absorb the developed societies' technological and scientific advances.
