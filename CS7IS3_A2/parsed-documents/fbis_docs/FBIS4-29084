His comment made clear that the Japanese Government plans to keep the agreement in effect without review until the end of July 1996. Japan and the United States are set to hold regular talks on the agreement for two days beginning 15 June in Tokyo. The agreement, which was concluded between Japan and the United States in August 1991, is effective for five years. The agreement carries a provision that requires the two countries to "review whether to repeal it or not" at the end of July 1994. The agreement sets a 20 percent share of foreign-made semiconductors in the Japanese chip market as the target of effort. Japan has deeply repented concluding the agreement with the United States, claiming that the target of effort has been exploited by the United States as a numerical target. For that reason, Japan has long thought of insisting on an early repeal of the agreement, but there is a strong view within MITI that, with the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks just resumed, "Japan cannot argue with the United States over another sticky trade issue." Though the Japanese Government has decided to keep the agreement in effect, the same senior MITI official made it clear that the Japanese Government will seek to repeal the agreement at the end of July 1996 when it expires, saying, "The agreement will not be extended after the end of July 1996."
