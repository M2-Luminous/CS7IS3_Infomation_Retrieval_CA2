[Al-Ghusayn] The peace agreement between Israel and the PLO only concerns the Palestinians in the occupied territories and the Palestinian exiles who were living there in June 1967, during the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Washington, the rest -- some 3 million people -- are not authorized to return, at least not for the time being. The fate of the Palestinians of the diaspora and those who left after 1967 will be the subject of the final phase of negotiations with Israel. I believe that many of the Palestinians living abroad will invest their money in the territories. But before they do this they are waiting for the Israelis to withdraw and for durable peace to be established in the region. In order to gain a general idea of the future of Palestine, the other problems must first be solved: the 1948 refugees, the issue of water, borders, and Jerusalem. Its future is also linked to the kind of relations established with neighboring countries. Economic cooperation and development will be a logical follow-up to peace. [Rozen] Must the diaspora make donations or investments? [Al-Ghusayn] The effect of donations is limited. We need investments. We want to set up a market economy in which the private sector -- rather than just the public sector -- will play a predominant role. We also want to limit bureaucracy in the new state, which could form part of a confederation along with Jordan. [Rozen] Will the PLO go ahead with nationalizations? [Al-Ghusayn] The days of socialism and nationalizations have definitely come to an end. Today, everyone is busy privatizing. We want to create a free zone in Gaza with peace, security, and no bureaucratic restrictions, so that investors will be inclined to set up shop in these territories. [Rozen] How will you finance the budget of the Gaza-Jericho unit? [Al-Ghusayn] During the two-year transitional period, our budget will have to be financed by the international community. Meanwhile, we shall have to establish an efficient system for collecting taxes and customs duties. We could also benefit from some of the taxes collected by the Israelis during the occupation. As you know, Palestinian resources are extremely limited. Our main assets are our well-trained laborers and the tourist potential. [Rozen] What does the future hold for the local administration? [Al-Ghusayn] The current administration of the territories could serve as a kind of nucleus. It will have to be revitalized and modernized by professionals and using technology. We want to build a government machine that is lightweight and efficient. The inhabitants of the territories will be responsible for the administration, not the expatriate executives in Tunisia. They must have priority regarding employment, because they are living there and are aware of the local problems. [Rozen] Do you intend to return to the country? [Al-Ghusayn] Every Palestinian is an uprooted individual who remains attached to his homeland. [Rozen] Why do you favor the political dimension? [Al-Ghusayn] The psychological environment is of key importance when it comes to establishing good cooperation. When you take on an associate in the business world, the understanding is based on trust, reciprocity, and equality between the two parties. How do you intend to build a future if you distrust each other? That is why we must first settle the political problems, the main one being the refugee issue. [Rozen] Is Yasir 'Arafat motivated by economic issues? [Al-Ghusayn] Being a trained engineer, Yasir 'Arafat was an entrepreneur in Kuwait before he became chairman of the PLO. He knows the significance of free enterprise and the free movement of capital.
