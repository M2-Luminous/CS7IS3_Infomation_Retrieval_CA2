FR940922-1-00003 FR940922-1-00001 Other quarantine costs, such as for feed and handling, could also be expected to decrease by more than one-half if the 7-day quarantine is no longer required. Whereas quarantine costs prior to the interim rule averaged about $3 per head per day, we estimate that during the period following the interim rule, these charges increased to between $5 and $10 per day, due to additional precautionary measures. Again assuming a 3-day pre-interim rule quarantine, the savings in charges by removing the 7-day quarantine requirement would be between $26 and $61 per head ($35 minus $9, and $70 minus $9). With the combined savings of reduced user fees and other quarantine charges, the removal of the VEE quarantine requirements would reduce importers' costs by an estimated $36 to $71 per head. Based on the average 1992 price of $310 per head for horses imported from Mexico, these reduced costs would represent a savings of between 11 and 23 percent of the value of each horse.
