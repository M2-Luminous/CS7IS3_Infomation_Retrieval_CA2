Of the lawmakers surveyed, 50.3 percent prefer a two-party system, 39.3 percent favor a moderate multiparty system with three or more parties, and 3.5 percent like a long and stable rule by a single party, according to a poll conducted by the Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform. The group of dozens of voluntary members from business, labor, academic and journalistic circles sent questionnaires to 761 lawmakers of both houses, 239 business executives and 78 labor unionists from April 1 to 22, committee members said. Of the legislators, 59.5 percent responded, they said. According to the survey, 20.3 percent of the lawmakers said most existing parties will disappear in political realignment. As to the timing of such realignment, 58.6 percent of the Diet members said it will take place in a year and 12.4 percent said in several years, they said. A two-party system was sought by 88.5 percent of respondents from Komeito [Clean Government Party], a Buddhist-backed party in the coalition, 87.3 percent from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and 60.9 percent from the Democratic Socialist Party, another ruling party, they said. A moderate multiparty system was backed by 70.8 percent of members of the Japan New Party led by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The figure was identical for the Social Democratic Party, which defected the coalition last week, and 50 percent for new party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Sakigake refused to take new cabinet positions, they said. The biggest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was split, with 45.6 percent favoring a two-party system and 41.8 percent support a moderate multiparty system, they said. The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August. Members of the opposition Japanese Communist Party did not answer the survey, they said.
