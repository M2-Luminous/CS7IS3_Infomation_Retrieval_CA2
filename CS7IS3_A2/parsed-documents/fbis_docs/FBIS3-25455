Akrou] [Text] Hamed Bakayoko, publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE newspaper and managing director of Radio-Nostalgie, has been arrested and placed under police custody for an offense against the head of state. It is especially in his capacity as publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE that he was arrested and placed under custody. LE PATRIOTE, which was initially created to defend the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI] and the republican institutions, and whose slogan is, "restoring the terror balance", was meant to serve as a combat newspaper, attacking the opposition and its leaders at will. Unfortunately, at some point this newspaper chose, inordinately, to take the side of former Prime Minister Alassane Dramane Ouattara against Henri Konan Bedie, who was then speaker of the National Assembly, and PDCI Secretary General Laurent Dona-Fologo. Singularly virulent remarks were published in the columns of LE PATRIOTE against them. When Mr. Bedie succeeded late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, LE PATRIOTE, in articles in each of its issues by its publishing editor and reporters or readers' letters, made offending, unkind, and even slanderous remarks against government members and the head of state. Ahmed Bakayoko clearly indicated in an editorial in December his intention to continue "the struggle," which was a way of saying that he would fight the new Ivorian leaders. Since then, he has not shown any restraint and has become particularly famous for the "letter to the brothers" of Kong, which appeared in Issue No. 93 of PATRIOTE EXPRESS in which President Bedie was insulted and called a "midget".... By so doing, he ignored the Press Law voted on 27 December 1991 which makes punishable by law "any flagrant insult and offense" committed against the head of state, and even the Ivorian Penal Code, which any citizen worthy of that name is obliged to respect.
