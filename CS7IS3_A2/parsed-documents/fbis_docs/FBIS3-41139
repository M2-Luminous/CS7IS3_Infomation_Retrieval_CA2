They were transporting 22 kg of cocaine base and ammunition for smuggled weapons. Police believe it had been brought to the city through the Galeao International Airport. Detective Luiz Eduardo Sato and police informer Luiz Etienne were caught red-handed by members of the PM secret service. They were coming down Andarai Hill, in the northern part of Rio de Janeiro, in a police patrol car. In the trunk, police found 22 kg of cocaine base--the raw material to produce cocaine--and a large amount of ammunition. There were bullets for AR-15 rifles--the favorite gun of traffickers and armored car robbers--and even shotgun shells which explode upon impact. These shells were unknown to the police. The detective said the drugs and ammunition had been seized during a police operation and would have been taken to a police station. The PM agents also found 10 million real cruzeiros in the detective's car. The police said the money was probably part of the payment by traffickers for transporting the drugs and ammunition. The police reported that the drugs and ammunition were to have been delivered to the main shantytowns to the north of Rio de Janeiro. It was to have been taken to the Andarai Hill slum; the Borel Hill slum, where the Red Command is headquartered; the Macacos Hill slum in Vila Isabel District; the Turano Hill slum in Rio Comprido District; and the Mineira Hill slum in Estacio de Sa District. Police believe the detective is trafficker Niltinho do Dende's trusty. Niltinho do Dende is one of Rio de Janeiro's main traffickers who has distribution posts at Governor Island where the detective works and where the Galeao International Airport is located. Police believe Galeao airport is the gate for trafficking into Brazil and the main connection for an international drug and weapons distributing route. [Begin Police Department Director Jorge Mario Gomes recording] Generally the route begins in Colombia and Bolivia and leads to Brazil, which is frequently used as a bridge to African countries and from there to Europe. This is the usual route. [end recording]
