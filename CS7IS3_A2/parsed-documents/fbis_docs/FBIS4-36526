Al-Husayni added that 'Arafat's arrival depends on the results of today's meeting between Palestinian officials and officials representing donor countries in Paris. The donor countries have pledged over $2 billion to the Palestinian self-ruled areas over a period of five years, but so far only $5 million have come from the United States. The latter had promised to give $500 million. In a statement to the press, al-Husayni said that he could not give a precise date for 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho, but added: I hope that this will be in the second half of this month. In reply to a question on whether the timing of 'Arafat's arrival is linked to the conference of donor countries in Paris, al-Husayni said: There is a link of this kind. [passage omitted]
