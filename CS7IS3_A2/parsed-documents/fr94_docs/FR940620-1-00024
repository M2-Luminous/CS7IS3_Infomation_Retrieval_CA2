FR940620-1-00024 FR940620-1-00006 Section 1902(f) States may use more restrictive eligibility criteria than are used by the SSI program in determining eligibility for CCBs. 5. Effective Date for Payment of Premiums as Medical Assistance An individual's effective date for Medicaid payment of COBRA premiums under sections 1902(a)(10)(F) and 1902(u) can be no earlier than January 1, 1991, the effective date of section 4713 of OBRA '90. The individual's effective date of eligibility date is based on the date of application and the date on which all eligibility criteria, including election of COBRA continuation coverage, are met. CCBs are subject to the existing policy of up to 3 months retroactive eligibility as specified in §435.914. 6. Federal Financial Participation FFP is available for medical assistance for COBRA premiums to individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage. 7. Changes in the Regulations We propose to amend part 435 (Eligibility in States, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa) and part 436 (Eligibility in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) as follows: Eligibility Requirements. Sections 435.10 and 436.10 would be revised and new §§435.240 and 436.274 would be added to specify criteria for determining COBRA continuation coverage. Federal Financial Participation Sections 435.1002 and 436.1002 would be revised to provide for FFP in expenditures for medical assistance on behalf of CCBs for COBRA premiums. Conforming Changes We would also make conforming changes to §§435.2, 435.3, 435.400, 435.600, 436.2, 436.400 and 436.600. III. Regulatory Impact Statement We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a Metropolitan Statistical area. Although these regulations do not themselves have a significant impact on the general economy, the statutory provisions on which they are based are expected to have an impact. In particular, we have determined that the part of the regulation dealing with section 4402 of OBRA '90 has the following savings impact for the Medicaid program: Federal and State Savings [Dollars in Millions] 1␣ 1FY 1994 1FY 1995 1FY 1996 1FY 1997 Federal $130 $140 $150 $160 State 100 105 110 115 n,s Total 230 245 260 275 We used the following methodology to estimate these savings. We used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) to estimate the fraction of Medicaid recipients having access to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) but not currently enrolled in it: about 3 percent for children and 1/2 percent for adults (including the disabled). We assumed that about 75 percent of these individuals would be subject to the group health enrollment requirements. In addition, we assumed that ESI premiums rates are based on utilization which is 80 to 90 percent of that of Medicaid enrollees for adults and children and 30 to 40 percent of these premiums on average. Employee cost-sharing was estimated at 20 percent, and the ratio of Medicaid to employer plan recognized charges was assumed to be about two-thirds. At present, we do not have the data to estimate the impact of section 4713 of OBRA '90 regarding optional Medicaid payment of group health plan premiums for COBRA continuation beneficiaries. Although this legislation creates a new eligibility group, we do not believe a significant number of individuals would become eligible. Further, this provision is optional for the States. To the extent these individuals become eligible for Medicaid, we believe this provision would reduce expected future Medicaid costs through continued coverage by employer group health plans in lieu of Medicaid coverage for a period of up to 29 months. The Secretary certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. We have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.
