FR940325-0-00041 FR940325-0-00009 (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set which is using NO X and/or particulate NCPs, none of that manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate credits for banking and trading. (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable. (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be used in customer service. 4. Section 86.092&hyph;23 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.092&hyph;23 Required data. (a) The manufacturer shall perform the tests required by the applicable test procedures, and submit to the Administrator the following information: Provided, however, That if requested by the manufacturer, the Administrator may waive any requirement of this section for testing of vehicle (or engine) for which emission data are available or will be made available under the provisions of §86.091&hyph;29. (b)(1)(i) Exhaust emission durability data on such light-duty vehicles tested in accordance with applicable test procedures and in such numbers as specified, which will show the performance of the systems installed on or incorporated in the vehicle for extended mileage, as well as a record of all pertinent maintenance performed on the test vehicles. (ii) Exhaust emission deterioration factors for light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines, and all test data that are derived from the testing described under §86.091&hyph; 21(b)(4)(iii)(A), as well as a record of all pertinent maintenance. Such testing shall be designed and conducted in accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the engines covered by a certificate issued under §86.091&hyph;30 will meet the emission standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) in §86.091&hyph;9, §86.091&hyph;10, or §86.091&hyph;11 as appropriate, in actual use for the useful life of the engine. (2) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, evaporative emission deterioration factors for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system combination and all test data that are derived from testing described under §86.091&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) designed and conducted in accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the vehicles covered by a certificate issued under §86.091&hyph;30 will meet the evaporative emission standards in §86.091&hyph;8 or §86.091&hyph;9, as appropriate, for the useful life of the vehicle. (3) For heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, evaporative emission deterioration factors for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system combination identified in accordance with §86.091&hyph;21(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, a statement that the test procedure(s) used to derive the deterioration factors includes, but need not be limited to, a consideration of the ambient effects of ozone and temperature fluctuations, and the service accumulation effects of vibration, time, and vapor saturation and purge cycling. The deterioration factor test procedure shall be designed and conducted in accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the vehicles covered by a certificate issued under §86.091&hyph;30 will meet the evaporative emission standards in §86.091&hyph;10 and §86.091&hyph;11 in actual use for the useful life of the engine. Furthermore, a statement that a description of the test procedure, as well as all data, analyses and evaluations, is available to the Administrator upon request. (4) (i) For heavy-duty vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 26,000 lbs and equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, a written statement to the Administrator certifying that the manufacturer's vehicles meet the standards of §86.091&hyph;10 or §86.091&hyph;11 (as applicable) as determined by the provisions of §86.091&hyph;28. Furthermore, a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations, and other documents, on which the above statement is based, are available to the Administrator upon request.
