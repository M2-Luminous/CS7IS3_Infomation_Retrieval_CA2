FBIS4-719 "drafr073_a_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Further on Rejection of Talks Further on Rejection of Talks EA1404214794 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 1815 GMT 14 Apr 94 EA1404214794 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Excerpt] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants are continuing with their armed fight against elements of the Presidential Guard, as well as government soldiers who decided to join the criminals. The fighting is centered in the capital, where the Presidential Guard continues to massacre innocent people, after being prompted by the pretext of President Habyarimana's death in an plane crash. The information broadcast this morning by several foreign radio stations and on Kigali radio concerning truce negotiations between the RPF and the transitional government put in place by those who organized the massacres is baseless. (Jean-Baptiste Kades) has this report: [(Kades)] Yes, [words indistinct] since this morning, several international news media have reported that the RPF agreed to meet the self-proclaimed authorities in Kigali, in order to discuss a possible cease-fire. The RPF insists on informing Rwandan and international opinion that this information is baseless. There is no question of the RPF holding any negotiations whatsoever with this pseudo-government while the killers working for certain government members now based in Gitarama continue to kill all over the country. We repeat: There will be no dealings whatsoever between the RPF and this government. The only consultations which have taken place in Kigali are, to the best of our knowledge, between the executive committees of political parties involved in the Arusha peace agreements. The members of these executive committees, or at least those of them who have escaped the massacres organized by the Presidential Guards, the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [words indistinct] of the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, met today in Kigali to discuss the situation now prevailing in the country. This has nothing to do with any form of cease-fire. [passage omitted]
