There have not been any clashes between the EPS and the 3-80 Northern Front led by recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, the military source added. A peace commission traveled on Thursday to the Quilali area in an attempt to make contact with rebel leaders to present a government proposal for the pacification of the nation's conflict-ridden and tormented northern areas. The peace commission is made up of members of the Nicaraguan Catholic Church and of the International Commission of Support and Verification, CIAV-OAS. On Wednesday, the Nicaraguan Government and the rebels each announced -- unilaterally -- a cease-fire aimed at finding a negotiated solution to the conflict.
