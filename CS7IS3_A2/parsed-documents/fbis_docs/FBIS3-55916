Russia, of course, is large and influential state, he said. But the West should not forget other states of the region as well. Processes taking place there are important not only for themselves but for the whole world as well. Development of democracy in all the countries of the region should be accepted with equal responsibility but not concentrating upon Russia. In the end of the report, the journalist made a conclusion that, despite reassuring words from Washington and Brussels, Lithuania fears a new separating line on the map of Europe is being drawn and the newly independent Baltic states are again remaining in the wrong side.
