Following the signing of the 'Arafat-Tel Aviv accord, these discussions faced a stalemate for four months. But after the meeting between the U.S. President and his Syrian counterpart in Geneva, a new round of talks has begun. The special characteristics of and the outlook for the new round of talks are discussed by Ne'matzadeh, an expert in the News Research and Commentaries Group. [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. Good morning, dear compatriots. This round of talks is largely on the level of the heads of the Arab delegations from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine and Israel. The most important development compared with the previous 11 rounds is that this one is being held away from the propaganda atmosphere and the mass media, such that they have been described as completely confidential talks. Even though the head of the Israeli delegation has said that the mass media and propaganda are being avoided because of the useless or harmful role played by propaganda in previous rounds, some political observers believe that this new tactic represents a middle line between Israel's insistence on completely confidential talks and Syria's insistence on open discussion. Perhaps the outcome of the discussions between the United States and Syria in Geneva on Sunday was to select this middle line: Open talks but far from the mass media and propaganda. The other characteristic of this round is that no one has stated when the talks will end. The current round of talks in Washington is significant and sensitive, because of its links to last week's meeting between al-Asad and Clinton. The talks resuming after a long interruption was the most important outcome of the discussions between the United States and Syria. Thus, the failure of the current talks or, to be more fair, their becoming routine will only mean the defeat and failure of the United States in this phase. The countries participating in the talks, particularly Israel and Syria, which are considered to be the major sides in this round -- while trying to preserve the optimistic propaganda atmosphere created by the Geneva meeting--cannot hide their concern over the behavior and motives of the other side and have started blaming the possible failure of the talks on the self-centered and expansionist policy of the other side. Irrespective of Syria's efforts during the Geneva meeting and afterward to display its goodwill and support for a peaceful Middle East solution, Israel has not held back from reacting negatively to the al-Asad-Clinton meeting. Thus, the success of the current round of talks depends on the outcome of a tug-of-war involving Syria's fundamentalism, Israel's behavior, and U.S. pressure. Of course, the futile pattern of 'Arafat's experience in his unending talks with Israel and his wasted dreams is no secret to the sides sitting at the negotiating table with Israel. The bombing of south Lebanon by Israel in tandem with the commencement of the 12th round of Washington talks shows that Israel insists on showing its aggressive nature to the negotiating sides that have entered the negotiations with the Zionist regime and that it is very hopeful of leaving the talks with its hands full, helped by Washington's support.
