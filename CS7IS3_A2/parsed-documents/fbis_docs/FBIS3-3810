Tong is a long-time activist in a movement which saw hundreds of elderly victims come to Beijing to petition Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He was taken from his Beijing home by police last Friday, one day before Hosokawa arrived for a three-day visit to China, one source said. Authorities detained at least 100 of the victims in front of the Japanese embassy in Beijing on Friday as they came to deliver letters to Hosokawa demanding compensation and a public apology for Japanese war crimes. The release of Tong and others detained by police for related activities was the focus of an open letter to China's National People's Congress on Monday. The letter was signed by 500 Chinese intellectuals. In a related development, Gao Hongmin, a government official detained Monday for allegedly planning to distribute political leaflets in Tiananmen Square, was also released after undergoing four hours of interrogation by police. Gao returned to work Tuesday.
