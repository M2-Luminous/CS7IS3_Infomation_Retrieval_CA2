Annie Lameus reports: [Lameus] Willy Claes deplored the fact that the warring parties were driven by a logic of war rather than peace, and he reserved particularly harsh criticism for the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic: [Begin Claes recording] The Serbian side continues to bear a crushing responsibility in this tragedy. I cannot find a single good thing to say about someone like Karadzic, whom I consider one of those most to blame for this tragedy. Even in general, however, when, like school teachers, we ask these various gentlemen whether they are prepared to commit themselves to a cease-fire over a given period -- with international public opinion as their witnesses -- and these gentlemen answer yes without the slightest hesitation and then we see that nothing, but nothing, is respected, then we have to ask ourselves some questions. [end recording] On 1 January, Greece will take over the European Presidency. Greece still refuses to recognize the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as long as it bears the name Macedonia. Other European countries have recognized this republic and, this morning, Willy Claes announced that Belgium would soon be doing the same.
