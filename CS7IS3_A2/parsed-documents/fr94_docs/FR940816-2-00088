FR940816-2-00088 FR940816-2-00068 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration Revocation of Registration; Franz A. Arakaky, M.D. On May 16, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., of Arlington, Virginia. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Arakaky's DEA Certificate of Registration, BA1999727, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). On May 17, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Arakaky by registered mail and was returned to DEA unclaimed, with no forwarding address. The Order to Show Cause was then mailed to Dr. Arakaky's last known home address on July 25, 1994, and was also returned unclaimed. Subsequent repeated attempts by DEA to contact Dr. Arakaky have been unsuccessful. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Arakaky has waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file. The Deputy Administrator finds that on April 19, 1993, Dr. Arakaky was indicted by the Grand Jury for the Arlington County Circuit Court on four counts of sexual battery. The indictment arose from allegations by three female patients who alleged that Dr. Arakaky performed inappropriate sexual acts under the guise of legitimate medical treatment. as a result of the indictment, on April 29, 1993, the Virginia Board of Medicine (Board) informed Dr. Arakaky of the Board's intention to hold a formal administrative hearing to determine whether Dr. Arakaky violated certain laws governing the practice of medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia. On that same date, the Board issued an Order of Summary Suspension of Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine. Following the administrative hearing, the Board issued its decision on June 10, 1993. The Board found that Dr. Arakaky behaved in an unprofessional and sexually inappropriate manner towards one female patient, and made similar findings with respect to three other female patients. The Board therefore ordered that Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia be revoked. The Deputy Administrator finds that as of June 10, 1993, Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia has been revoked, and as a result, he is not authorized to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Arakaky's DEA Certificate of Registration must be revoked. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BA1999727, previously issued to Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 16, 1994. Dated: August 10, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20031 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
