The Information and Press Department of the Army (Dide) has stated the URNG has caused the wave of terrorist attacks taking place throughout the country on the eve of the 30 January referendum to reform the country's Constitution. "With these criminal actions, the URNG is endangering the people's personal safety, destroying the country's infrastructure, and causing countless industrial damages," the Army has stated. According to the Dide, the guerrillas are seeking to intimidate the people to prevent them from participating in the referendum, because the URNG opposes Guatemalans expressing their desire to vote. The Armed Forces communique also states the URNG is seeking to imply that they are still active and give the international appearance that Guatemala is undergoing a reign of violence. According to National Institute of Electrification (Inde) sources, losses resulting from the dynamite attacks surpass 2 million quetzals (approximately $340,000). The Army has implemented operations and is maintaining security measures along bridges and electricity high-tension pylons to prevent further attacks, Dide Spokesperson Major Edith Vargas has said. The referendum scheduled to take place tomorrow aims to ensure the approval of reforms to 48 articles of the Constitution, such as rescheduling parliamentary elections for an earlier date, changing the Supreme Court of Justice, and shortening the presidential term from five to four years. Guatemala is the only Central American country where guerrilla activity, which began in 1960, still persists.
