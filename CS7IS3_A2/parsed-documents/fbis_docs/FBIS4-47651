Disarmament was agreed on 22 April by the political and military authorities. Its enforcement was supposed to start on 24 April at 1800. Because of some objections, however, the disarmament operation had to be postponed, especially in the area of Kamenge, north of Bujumbura, where there are apparently some problems. However, yesterday the security forces were given an order to carry out the disarmament operation. Here is Burundi Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo: [Begin Ngendahayo recording] Last night the army and the people of Kamenge exchanged fire. Only this morning the people living in Kamenge started to be evacuated. Thousands of people are today leaving Kamenge. As you know they are being gathered at a stadium in Bujumbura. We are trying -- with the help of ministers, of the army's high-ranking officials, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR, and other partners of Burundi -- to place them under the responsibility of well-known leaders so that once the search in Kamenge is over these people, these very same people, can immediately return to Kamenge. There will be people responsible for each and every street so that order will be kept by the very people living there. [end recording]
