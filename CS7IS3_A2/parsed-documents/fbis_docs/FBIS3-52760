At the initiative of U.S. Senator Kennedy and with the extensive cooperation of the propaganda machinery, the anniversary of the Pan American explosion over Lockerbie, England [as published], was marked by a pompous ceremony, the major objective of which was to justify the pressure by the United States and the West on Libya or, in a broader sense, to show the so-called fight against state terrorism. During this propaganda show, there were also some who tried to criticize Iran--probably because of the West's anger over the visit by the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tripoli. 2. A live television program with a large number of viewers aired questions and answers on the incident and the legality of the United States' demands that the Libyans accused of the incident be handed over. One listener asked: "If it is true that the United States has the right to demand that a person it thinks is responsible for the explosion be handed over to it, then the Iranian Government can also demand that those responsible for the downing of a civilian Airbus by a missile in the Persian Gulf, which resulted in the deaths of its passengers, be handed over to Iran to be tried and sentenced in Iran." The person to whom the question was asked, who was apparently caught off guard, hastily said: "No, no. These are two completely different issues." The correspondent, who found the entire scene disgraceful, said sarcastically: "Yes. There is a great difference. An Iranian mother apparently doesn't love her children as much as an American mother does!" Inevitably, a philosopher who was with the person being interviewed, commented: "Well, the U.S. Government's actions are all based on law and we have always behaved in a legal manner in the world. Therefore our situation is very different from the situation of others." 3. The above is not the only example of the emptiness of the West's political-humanitarian thoughts in justifying its behavior. Those who consider the perpetration of any crime to be permissible on the pretext of fighting fundamentalism or for the sake of human rights display the ugliest examples of behavior in history. Every day, the people of the world see dozens of examples of this kind of "logic" and "law." But why are they facing a problem? Why are modern technology, supreme economic power, and spectacular military might unable to offer a logical justification? Undoubtedly all their problems have to do with "being righteous." Bad can be disguised as good for some time, but the truth will ultimately surface. Even though we, the Islamic ummah, do not have supreme military might or advanced technological capabilities, we can safeguard our grandeur and our respect if we support justness and right.
