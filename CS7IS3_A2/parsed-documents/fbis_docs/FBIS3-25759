OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim met IFP leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi today. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] The OAU leader's visit to Ulundi for talks with the IFP and the kwaZulu government was the first by a leader of this organization. Both Dr. Ahmed Salim and Buthelezi made one thing clear: They had different views and perspectives of the transition process and especially the elections. [Salim] I believe in this because of these discussions that it will be vital in the interest of South Africa that everything be done to ensure an all inclusive election where the participation of all the political forces in the country, and certainly the participation of Inkatha Freedom Party also is possible. [Buthelezi] We definitely are doing everything worthwhile because we are very keen to participate in the elections, and therefore even now at this last moment -- even today -- our members of parliament I think, are talking to a select committee of Parliament about some of the amendments which were proposed by the IFP and the Freedom Alliance. [Alfonso] Both leaders also confirmed that international mediation, especially by the OAU, was of critical importance. Dr. Buthelezi said free political activity had become almost impossible in most parts of Natal. [end recording]
