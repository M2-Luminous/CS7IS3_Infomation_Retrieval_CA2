FR940711-0-00078 FR940711-0-00023 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG70 Exclusions From Income (Just Debts) AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning income exclusions in death cases. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that secured debts cannot be considered ``just debts'' for purposes of the income exclusion. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective August 5, 1993, the date of the General Counsel opinion upon which it is based. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Trowbridge, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, telephone (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Rates payable under VA's income-based benefit programs, pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation, are affected by the claimant's income. As countable income goes up, the rate payable goes down. The law does, however, provide certain exclusions from countable income. 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3) excludes amounts paid by a surviving spouse or child of a deceased veteran for the veteran's just debts from countable income; 38 U.S.C. 1315(f)(1)(H) provides a similar exclusion for a dependent parent of a deceased veteran who pays a deceased spouse's just debts. The term ``just debts,'' however, is not currently defined by statute or regulation. In a precedent opinion dated August 5, 1993 (OGC Prec 5&hyph;93), VA's General Counsel held that amounts paid by a surviving spouse on secured obligations incurred for the purchase of real or personal property could not be excluded as ``just debts'' under 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3)(A). Based on the principles in OGC Prec 5&hyph;93, we have amended 38 CFR 3.262(m), 3.262(o), and 3.272(h) to state that the term ``just debts'' does not include secured debts. The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of section 603 and 604. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104, 64.105, and 64.110.
