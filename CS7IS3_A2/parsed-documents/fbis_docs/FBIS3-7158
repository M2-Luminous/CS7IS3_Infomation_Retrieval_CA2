The Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee [HCMCPC] also issued Announcement No. 100/TB-UB on 15 September 1993 to clarify its views. Regarding Bishop Huynh Van Nghi, the Ho Chi Minh City government's attitude has been respectful: - On 25 August 1993, the Ho Chi Minh City Fatherland Front and the HCMCPC Religion Department directly informed Bishop Huynh Van Nghi that his appointment to the HCMCAO was at variance with the SRV law, therefore, it was not accepted. The Decree No. 69 issued by the Council of Ministers on 21 March 1991 stipulates in its Article 19 that: "[The appointment of] clergymen such as Buddhist bonze superiors; Catholic cardinals, bishops, and supervising priests; and equivalent clergymen in other religions must be approved by the Council of Ministers". This regulation is also practiced by many countries in the world. - On 5 September 1993, an HCMCPC authoritative official met and requested Bishop Huynh Van Nghi to stop all his activities as an HCMCAO supervisor. However, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has continued to select and appoint his general representative and representatives in charge of congregations and to set up the standing committee of the Ecclesiastical Regional Council,... at the same time, he has also presided many religious retreats, meetings,..., thus creating bad public opinion and affecting the public respectability to the law. - On 28 September 1993, the HCMCPC Religion Department sent a letter to Bishop Huynh Van Nghi reminding him not to conduct any religious activities in Ho Chi Minh City pending an agreement between the SRV Government and the Vatican. Regretfully, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has not reciprocated the Ho Chi Minh City government's goodwill. The HCMCPC had approved and created favorable conditions for the congregations to ordain 11 novices. But Bishop Huynh Van Nghi, on behalf of the HCMCAO, prevented the congregations' inviting other bishops to preside over the ordination in the city, causing difficulties for the congregations and relatives of the novices. Moreover, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi also sent letters to the supervising priests of related provinces, blaming the government. (the letter dated 5 October 1993 was copied and widely distributed among church followers). For many months, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi continued to write and disseminate religious affairs letters and other documents on behalf of the HCMCAO. The aforementioned activities by Bishop Huynh Van Nghi are violating the Decre No. 69 of the Council of Ministers, showing disrespect to the Ho Chi Minh City Government, and affecting the fine time-honoured relation between the government and the HCMCAO. The law cannot be held in contempt. On 22 February, the Ho Chi Minh City government held a working session with Bishop Huynh Van Nghi to point out his violations. In observance of the SRV Government's policy of freedom of religion, for more than 18 years, the HCMCPC has always created favorable conditions for the people to have an improved religious life-style and standard of living. The Catholic compatriots, due to the 1 May 1980 Open Letter of the Vietnam Bishop Council and the leadership of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, have actively contributed to the Ho Chi Minh City construction and protection and the building of the all-people unity and the unity between religious and nonreligious people. The government highly evaluates the patriotism of the Catholic compatriot who, together with other people in the city, has overcome difficulties and shared achievements and pride. The HCMCPC is very much in sympathy with the earnest aspiration of the Catholic priests and followers to have somebody to lead this diocese for the continuation of the fine direction executed by Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh for many years and for religious prosperity and happiness. On behalf of the HCMCPC, for the chairman, Signed: Vice Chairman Vo Viet Thanh
