Why is your progress so poor in that area? [Tanski] I must say I disagree with you completely. Our progress is by no means "poor," but actually quite good. You must take into account that it has not been "all of two years" but "only two years," which, in practice, has meant 18 months of our activity in a fully developed structure. During that time, we managed to take over the assets of all of the state farms and more than 40 percent of the assets at the disposal of the State Land Fund. And we began in extremely difficult circumstances, with only a small group of dedicated enthusiasts committed to the idea of the future transformations and resistant to all attacks and accusations.... [Zielinska] What attacks? What accusations? [Tanski] Well, all kinds of interests happen to come into conflict with one another as a result of the new privatization schemes. Previous employees of the state farms [PGR] currently under privatization often dream of getting the land for themselves. Now and again you still come across the slogan "Share out the land!," which was invoked, most irresponsibly, in my opinion, by people who at the time controlled the state's agricultural policy. Former PGR directors cherish different expectations than either local farmers or self-government structures, which in their turn view the privatization process in the light of their parishes' interests. However we look at it, these interests are often in conflict with one another as well as with the interests of the state treasury, to which the land belongs. [Zielinska] You can often hear the view that it is quite hard to find buyers ready to purchase reprivatized land. Especially in the northeast of Poland, where whole fields are often to be found lying fallow. [Tanski] It is true that situations do happen when land is left fallow during the period when, say, the privatization process is under way, when the old owner is gone and we have not yet managed to find his successor. But it also happens--quite often, too--that instances of land left to waste are the result of the agricultural policy inherited from the time when the PGR farm acreage statistics were artificially increased by the addition of grade V and grade VI land to the records, even if production on those sites was too expensive and unprofitable because of low soil quality. The market economy principles currently obtaining have naturally verified the land grading system, and I believe that this process is healthy and natural. [Zielinska] Another irritating development is that land sale auctions are inevitably won by local setups or interest groups.... [Tanski] The auction operations are merely the end element of the whole process because a long process has to take place before land is put up for sale by auction: It must be assessed, valued, and restructured according to a program drafted by our experts. This is in order to prepare healthy farms, free from excess poor quality land, capable of high production and able to function in the free market situation. And all of our auctions are organized in a way that precludes the possibility of corruption. Each is mandatorily attended by a notary official who collects the tenders, and by a director from our own agency; all decisions are made by an auction commission. You voiced an objection to "local setups." But these are fine as long as they are groups of local people who have sufficient financial credibility, with a leading shareholder, and a good chance of attracting external finance. Why should we object to them? On the other hand, it is true that sometimes interested local groups attempt to bend the rules to serve their own interests by proclaiming loudly that they are entitled to the land they want because they had been attached to it. [Zielinska] Are you talking about Andrzej Lepper? [Tanski] Not only him. In my opinion, in Lepper's case the aim was to take advantage of the fabricated conflict for political reasons. When we comment widely on such developments, we play into the hands of people who are only too keen to figure in front page news. Such incidents have taken place several times already, although they were not particularly highlighted by the press. For example, we came across such a campaign in Lysomice near Torun, when our office was forcibly occupied and we were forced to ask the police to intervene. This sort of action amounts to a breach of the law, and it should be unequivocally condemned, with all of the attendant consequences. And nothing more need be said about it. [Zielinska] What are your relations with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Pawlak government? [Tanski] During the past few months, we encountered no particular problems associated with the fact that a government coalition had assumed power. We do not need to convince anyone that privatization of the agricultural sector will bring immediate and tangible effects. We have only those problems to contend with, with which we had already grappled before. [Zielinska] Does the PSL or the coalition government not want to post their own men within your Agency? [Tanski] That would be a secondary concern. For the time being, as you see, I persist in my office, I function adequately, and I do not believe I look despondent at all. Of course, as any other high state official, I must be prepared for the possibility that I might be recalled one day, but I do not believe that this must not make any difference to the quality of my work in the present office: It should never bear the stamp of a "temporary job." [Zielinska] You mentioned certain problems. [Tanski] Yes. Our worst problem at the moment is the question of PGR debts. Let me remind you that we take over the PGR's, which are under liquidation, which means inheriting all of their assets as well as their debt liabilities. Unfortunately, the latter are quite massive: We estimate that they reach 20 trillion zlotys [Z]. Furthermore, you must remember that our creditors are institutions that must not be allowed to collapse because that would hurt the agricultural sector too much. Consequently, we seek a compromise that could be reached by instituting talks with the banks on the terms of a possible settlement, which would give a chance to both sides. Our second problem is the need to find credible customers willing to buy or rent the privatized properties. Here we are only partly successful because the lack of free capital in Poland presents a serious obstacle in this area. That is why we welcome engagement of foreign capital. The last problem is unemployment. Previously, this was hidden because PGR structures made it possible to conceal it, but the present transformations have uncovered and highlighted it very plainly. The phenomenon is particularly troublesome because it is concentrated in Poland's northern and western regions, where almost half of our farms are situated. People who live there have no alternative employment opportunities, while we, unfortunately, are unable to create so-called individual family farms, whose size would be limited to 20-30 hectares. Nevertheless, we are doing our best to activate for that purpose certain currently "underused" credit lines, which had been granted to us by the World Bank. We also intend to try to activate production in those farms that we have "liberated" from their debt liabilities after taking them over. We believe that it is possible to acquire finance for that purpose from the Labor Fund. We also expect that the government will take appropriate steps to assist us in the funding of our operations. Otherwise, the employees of our farms will end up as clients of employment offices, applying for money that ultimately comes from the same source but that would then be handed to them in the form of unemployment benefits.
