Responsibility for the implementation of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Decree "On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution" (hereinafter referred to as the amnesty decree) is placed: (a) on the bodies responsible for enforcing punishment -- for convicted persons kept in places of detention. Implementation of the amnesty decree is effected in accordance with a decision of the chief of the corrective labor institution sanctioned by a prosecutor. The following are attached to this decision: a record of rewards and sanctions, the convicted person's personal file, and other documents needed to decide on the application of an act of amnesty; (b) on inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies -- for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being processed by these bodies; (c) on courts: for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being processed by the courts and had not been examined prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree, and also for persons whose criminal cases have been examined but sentences have not come legally into force; for convicted persons for whom the enforcement of sentences has been deferred in instances and under the procedure stipulated by law and persons who have received a conditional sentence in accordance with Article 44 of the RSFSR Criminal Code (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by a court following a submission by the internal affairs body monitoring the convicted person's conduct); for persons sentenced to be fined, if the fine has not been paid prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which passed sentence); for persons released on parole and persons who have had the unserved part of their sentence commuted prior to the coming into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which made the ruling to allow parole or commute the unserved part of a sentence); for persons sentenced by Russian Federation courts who are serving their sentence on the territory of other states which were formerly part of the USSR (a ruling on the application of an act of amnesty is made by the court which passed sentence); (d) on internal affairs bodies: for persons whose sentences have come legally into force and who have been sentenced to imprisonment but who are not in custody; for persons serving their sentence in the form of corrective work not involving custody or disqualification from the holding of given posts or from given activities; (e) on the commands of disciplinary battalions -- for servicemen sentenced to be assigned to a disciplinary battalion. 2. A decision on the application or nonapplication of an act of amnesty is adopted for each person individually. In the absence of necessary information on the convicted person examination of the question of the application of an amnesty is deferred pending the receipt of additional materials. Bodies responsible for the implementation of the amnesty decree are granted the right to demand that the institutions in question provide court files and other materials needed to decide questions linked with the application of an amnesty. Such demands must be met immediately. 3. Decisions on the application of an act of amnesty adopted by inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies, internal affairs bodies, and also the commands of disciplinary battalions are sanctioned by a prosecutor. When an act of amnesty is applied by courts the participation of a prosecutor is mandatory. 4. The amnesty decree applies to persons who committed crimes prior to the entry into force of the present decree. 5. It is to be explained that when an act of amnesty is applied: (a) subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons who: served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed Forces during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945; participated in the Great Patriotic War as a member of a partisan detachment, people's volunteer militia, extermination battalion, or underground organization operating against the German occupationists; served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed Forces which participated in combat operations against Japan in 1945. Subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons awarded the "Victory Over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45" medal or the "Victory Over Japan" medal and also to persons who participated in combat operations to defend the interests of the USSR during the period preceding the Great Patriotic War or after it ended; to persons who participated in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl AES accident and are entitled to special benefits; and also to persons who have performed military service on the territory of the Transcaucasus and Baltic states and the Republic of Tajikistan; (b) subparagraph "b" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree also applies to female minors; (c) subparagraph "c" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to males born before 1 January 1934; (d) subparagraph "d" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree applies to persons deemed by the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population to be Group 1 and Group 2 invalids prior to the coming into force of this decree, and also to persons deemed by a Medical and Labor Commission of a Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs medical department to be Group 1 or Group 2 invalids, following confirmation of the group by a commission of the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population within six months of the entry into force of the amnesty decree; (e) paragraph 2 of the amnesty decree does not apply to persons who, in addition to a crime committed through negligence, have also been convicted of a crime committed deliberately; (f) paragraph 3 of the amnesty decree applies to males born after 1 January 1976; (g) the served part of a sentence stipulated in paragraphs 2 and 5 of the amnesty decree is calculated to the date that the present decree comes into force. 6. The serving of a sentence in the form of noncustodial corrective work ends from the day that internal affairs bodies file a decision on the application of an act of amnesty approved by a prosecutor. 7. The amnesty decree does not extend to persons subject to administrative punishment, including persons culpable under administrative law but freed from criminal liability in accordance with the procedure stipulated by Articles 50 and 51 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. 8. When applying an act of amnesty to persons whose length of sentence has been reduced by pardon or amnesty, it is necessary to proceed from the length of sentence prescribed in accordance with the acts of pardon or amnesty. 9. Amnestied persons are released from both their basic punishment and additional punishment if the latter has not been carried out by the date that the amnesty decree comes into force. 10. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the amnesty decree the part of the sentence which has not been served on the date that the said decree comes into forces is eligible for reduction. This point applies to convicted persons whose sentences have entered legally into force prior to the entry into force of the said decree. 11. When applying the amnesty decree convictions which have been quashed or lifted in accordance with the procedure stipulated by law and also convictions for crimes which have been excised from the RSFSR Criminal Code are disregarded. Furthermore, the convictions of persons previously convicted for crimes of negligence, irrespective of the form of punishment, and also of persons sentenced for premediated crimes to noncustodial punishment are disregarded. 12. Malicious violators of the terms [governing the serving of their sentence] are to be defined as persons who: (a) systematically violate established discipline and order while serving their sentence; (b) have been convicted, interned in deportation colonies, or sent to other types of corrective labor colonies if, after the court ruling that they be sent to a corrective labor institution, they have been in custody for less than one year on the day that the materials relating to the application of an act of amnesty is examined. The term is calculated from the date that the convicted person is taken into custody; (c) persons sentenced to noncustodial corrective work who, because they have deliberately evaded serving their sentence, have their unserved term of corrective work replaced by a custodial sentence, if they have been in custody for less than six months on the date that the materials relating to the application of an act of amnesty are examined. 13. In accordance with subparagraph "e" of paragraph 8 of the amnesty decree an act of amnesty cannot be applied to persons released early from custody since 1985 (irrespective of whether their conviction has been quashed or lifted) under the pardons procedure or on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium decrees: "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 40th Anniversary of the Soviet People's Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45," dated 26 April 1985; "On the Release From Detention of Certain Categories of Women," dated 6 November 1986; "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 70th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," dated 18 June 1987; and also on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet decree of 28 November 1989 "On an Amnesty for Former Servicemen of the Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan Who Have Committed Crimes," the USSR law of 1 November 1991 "On an Amnesty for Servicemen Who Have Evaded Military Service," and the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree of 18 June 1992 "On an Amnesty." Convicted persons who have been released in connection with the reduction of their sentence under the pardons procedure or on the basis of the aforementioned acts and persons who have had the unserved part of a term of detention commuted should also be regarded as having been granted early release from punishment. 14. Materials relating to persons affected by the amnesty decree who have had been ordered under the prescribed procedure to undergo treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, or venereal disease are examined after the convicted persons have completed the complete course of treatment but no later than six months after the completion of the implementation of the amnesty decree. The grounds for deeming that a course of treatment for venereal disease has been completed are a medical ruling or -- in the case of persons for whom a court has prescribed compulsory treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction -- a court ruling on terminating the compulsory treatment. 15. The amnesty decree also applies to persons who were convicted by USSR courts on the territory of another state and are serving their sentence on the territory of the Russian Federation. 16. In cases when the question of the application of an act of amnesty arises after the expiry of a six-month period from the day that the amnesty decree comes into force, application of the act is effected in accordance with the procedure stipulated by paragraph 1 of the said decree. 17. The regulation personnel strength of corrective labor institutions and remand centers and also of the prisoner escort service is not to be reduced. 18. Organs of executive power of the components of the Russian Federation are to ensure monitoring of the implementation of the amnesty decree. 19. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are to: (a) organize prompt record-keeping on all persons released from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree and make everyday and job arrangements for them no later that 15 days after they arrive in their place of residence; (b) find places in homes for the disabled for invalids and elderly persons who have been released from punishment and do not have relatives able to support them. 20. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are to ensure that juveniles released from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree are promptly included in their records when they arrive in their place of residence, passed into the supervision of parents or guardianship and wardship agencies, and found places when necessary in children's homes, boarding schools, or vocational and technical colleges and to coordinate the work of commissions for juvenile affairs, internal affairs bodies, and social organizations to reeducate juveniles released from punishment.
