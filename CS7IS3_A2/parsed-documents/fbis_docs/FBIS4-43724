It is not just the opposition that now suspects that taxes will go up after the elections.... [Solms] If the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] forms part of the government again, there will certainly be no tax increases. The tax burden is too high already. That is why we are going to make fiscal policy our central issue in the election campaign. In contrast to the Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Social Democratic Party [SDP], the FDP will make sure that the tax burden on citizens is not increased, but lowered. [Weckbach-Mara] But there are billions missing in the budget, and the next tax increase, the solidarity surcharge, has long been agreed.... [Solms] We will gradually abolish the solidarity surcharge, in three years at the latest, and the federal budget will be balanced through determined saving. [Weckbach-Mara] Would you risk a row with the Union on the issue of fiscal policy? [Solms] We will make clear demands for a future coalition. And we will not be deviated from that by the CDU/CSU's election program. In the new laender, tax reliefs, such as the temporary abolition of property and trade capital tax, must be maintained after 1996. In addition, we demand that the value-added tax on products from the new laender be lowered to facilitate their launch on the markets. We will continue to promote savings with building societies, and we will even double income ceilings, especially for families with children. And we want to support investible wage agreements in employment contracts. [Weckbach-Mara] Are there any other potential problems with the CDU/CSU? [Solms] We insist on a consistent debureaucratization. This means fewer authorities, fewer ministries, and performance-linked salaries for civil servants instead of automatic promotion. And we demand a reform of the educational system. As a first step the duration of schooling up to the final exams should be reduced to 12 years. University education should be divided into two parts. First, there should be a shorter, profession-oriented basic course of studies. And those who want to go on after that would have to prove certain achievements. [Weckbach-Mara] This looks like comprehensive amendments to laws, even constitutional amendments. [Solms] Yes, we also want specific constitutional amendments. One of the things we demand is for animal protection to be included in the constitution. I even expect that we will be able to get this aim adopted in the Bundestag and Bundesrat before the Bundestag elections.
