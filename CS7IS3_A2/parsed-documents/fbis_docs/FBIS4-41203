"Speaking on the reasons of the Abkhazia's tragedy we should take into consideration the general political context, the background of the tragic events taken place in Abkhazia", said the Head of the Georgian state. "The most important factor is the syndrome of some alienation and distrust between Russia and Georgia arisen in the period of the USSR's break-up and just after it has taken place. This confrontation during a long period of time wasn't overcome but, on the contrary, was strengthened". But the authorities of two states did their best to overcome this dangerous tendency and establish relations of good neighbors. The visit of Boris Yeltsin which took place in February 1994 became the decisive factor, according to the opinion expressed by Eduard Shevardnadze. The basic point in the conflict's settlement is the effective cooperation which was established between Russia and Georgia, from the one hand, and the UNO [United Nations Organization], its General Secretary and the Security Council, the CSCE and the whole international community from the other. The cooperation will settle the military, technical, humanitarian and other problems connected with settlement of the conflict. Answering the questions of journalists, Eduard Shevardnadze stated that the decisive word to the settlement of the conflict will be said by the Russian peace-keeping forces. Russia may be trusted in. The guarantee is the fact that "great political forces" are united round the conflict. The introduction of the peace-keeping troops into the zone of the conflict doesn't touch the political status of Abkhazia. The latter will be solved at the negotiations under the aegis of the UN with the intermediary role of Russia and "friends of Georgia" -- the Western states.
