Due to the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal, Macao has enjoyed social stability, work in all areas has continued to develop, and new progress has been made in the work of the transitional period. With the extensive participation and active support by people of all circles of Macao, drafting of the Macao Special Administrative Zone's Basic Law has been completed as scheduled, and the law was formally promulgated after it was examined and approved in March by the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress. The Basic Law establishes the principle and policy of "one country, two systems" in the form of law, providing an accurate and clear picture of Macao's future development and providing a fundamental assurance for Macao's stable transition and its long-term stable development; the Basic Law has been welcomed by people of all strata of Macao. Currently, the Macao Basic Law Promotion Society -- a civic organization formed by the former Macao Basic Law Drafting Committee and the former Macao Basic Law Counselling Committee -- is working actively to further publicize and promote the basic law in an effort to further deepen Macao residents' understanding of the Basic Law and to enable work of the transitional period to be in line with the Basic Law. In the late transitional period, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group's work and tasks have become heavier. In the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, the two sides have strengthened communications, enhanced mutual understanding, and strived to quicken the pace of work. Since the beginning of this year, the Joint Liaison Group, in addition to continuing consultations on the three major issues of the transitional period and the issue of Macao's participation in international organizations, has separately formed a work group on currency issues, a work group on aviation agreements, and a work group on government employees' pensions, to study and discuss the respective issues. Through friendly consultations, the two sides also have reached an agreement on issues concerning the Macao International Airport, signed documents on air transportation agreement, and begun to examine Macao's first aviation agreement with other localities, thereby ensuring the smooth proceeding of the construction of the Macao International Airport and of other airport-related work. However, relatively slow progress has been made in establishing the Chinese language's official status and in making government employees and Macao law more locally-oriented. However, the slight progress in the work in these areas attained so far has laid a foundation for quickening the pace of resolving these issues. Economically, Macao has always benefited from the mainland's reform and opening up. Promotion of the socialist market economy on the mainland has provided Macao with new opportunities and development space. Macao has enjoyed social stability and its industrial and commercial development has been steady. From 1987 to 1992, Macao's total output value increased 42 percent -- resulting in an average annual growth rate of 7 percent -- and the government's financial revenues increased 337 percent. Since the beginning of this year, affected by the economic recessions in Europe and the United States, Macao's total export value in the first 8 months decreased 2.1 percent from the same period of last year, and its imports increased 1.7 percent. However, Macao's tourist industry, financial industry, commercial activities, and other tertiary industries have performed very well. A total of 5.32 million tourists visited Macao in the first eight months of this year, an increase of 3.8 percent from the same period last year. As of the end of June, savings deposits by all Macao residents (excluding off- coast deposits) totaled 52.39 billion and local loans totaled 31.56 billion Macao dollars, up 5.1 and 21.9 percent, respectively, over the same period last year. Commercial investments have been brisk, with the number of companies inaugurated in the first six months and registered capital showing a fairly big increase over last year's corresponding period. Meanwhile, considerable progress has been made in improving infrastructure, and construction of a number of large engineering projects has proceeded smoothly. Of these projects, the new Hong Kong-Macao Passengers Pier, the Jiulong-Macao Deep-Water Harbor, a garbage incendiary, and the Songshan Tunnel have been completed and put into operation; the new Macao-Taipa bridge will be completed and opened to traffic early next year; and the construction of an international airport has proceeded smoothly, with two thirds of the artificial islands in the runway area being completed. Recently Macao and Guangdong have reached an agreement on extension of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai Railway and Expressway to Macao. The completion of these infrastructural facilities will make Macao more accessible to the outside world and will promote its economic growth. With the year 1999 drawing near, Macao has increased its contacts with the hinterland and witnessed record two-way investments as well as economic and trade activities; the footsteps of Macao businessmen have extended from the Zhujiang Delta to the central, eastern, and northeastern China. Exchange and cooperation in the areas of economics, science and technology, media, culture, education, sports, and health have brought about better understanding and greater trust, thus enhancing the confidence of people in various circles in Macao's future development. Authoritative sources here pointed out: Since the beginning of the transitional period, Macao has been able to effect smooth transition and promote social stability and prosperity primarily because China and Portugal have carried out friendly cooperation based on the Joint Statement to solve many problems facing the transition through consultations; it is also because of the active participation and concerted effort of the people in various circles in Macao. So long as the two sides continue to work concertedly in line with the spirit of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Statement, Macao will surely be able to smoothly carry out the work of various fields during the transition and create a favorable environment for the smooth handover of political power in the year 1999.
