Talking to newsmen on Monday, he suggested that such actions are very dangerous and only lead to resentment and indignation. He is convinced that in making such a decision, the mechanisms envisaged by the UN Charter should be set into motion, which necessitates a Security Council resolution. This is not the way to settle conflicts, the issue would be only aggravated by a decision to bomb, Shakhray said. In his assessment an air strike would slow down the process of negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs, and everything would have to be started all over again. [Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in Russian at 0800 GMT on 12 April adds: "Those who decided to call in air strikes bear personal responsibility for the breakdown of the peaceful settlement through a process of negotiation, Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, said to an Ekho Moskvy correspondent. He said that bypassing Russia to act is a slap in the face to the Russian president. Shakhray believes that the air strikes hit not only Serb positions but the internal political situation in Russia as well. He does not rule out that the latest events in Bosnia could also affect the process of reforms at home."]
