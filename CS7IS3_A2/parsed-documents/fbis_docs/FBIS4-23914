Mr Swart said the plan was drawn up by the department in consultation with the Board on Tariffs and Trade and the Department of Trade and Industry. The implementation plan provided for differentiated action to be taken on each of four categories of product grouping. The first category included all tariff products already identified and to which qualitative import restrictions no longer applied, or whose quantitative restrictions would be removed at a determined future date. The second category covered products with reasonable tariffs already in place but in respect of which quantitative import controls still applied. The third category included products to which certain tariffs and import controls currently applied. The fourth category includes products in respect of which specific statutory marketing measures were in place. According to the statement, the successful outcome of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations obliged South Africa to put tariffs on all agricultural products and to lift remaining quantitative import restrictions before the agreement's implementation date on January 1 next year. "Starting from that date South Africa will have six years to phase- in its implementation commitments according to predetermined formulas," Mr Swart said. "Notwithstanding South Africa's obligations under the GATT's Uruguay Round, it has been the official policy of the Department of Agriculture to move away from a policy of quantitative import control in favour of a tariff protection-only approach," the statement said. The successful implementation of the Uruguay Round had not brought about major changes in departmental policy, but had rather placed an urgency on its implementation. The statement said the Department of Agriculture was in favour of the abolition of surcharge on agricultural products.
