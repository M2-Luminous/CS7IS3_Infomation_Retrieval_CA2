FR941125-2-00056 FR941125-2-00045 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;45&hyph;000] Colorado Interstate Gas Co.; Notice of Filing of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff November 18, 1994. Take notice that on November 14, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised Tariff sheets: First Revised Sheet No. 243 Second Revised Sheet No. 254 First Revised Sheet No. 259 Original Sheet Nos. 260&hyph;268 Second Revised Sheet No. 359 CIG has requested these tariff sheets become effective December 14, 1994. CIG states it is proposing two changes to its tariff. First CIG is addressing the circumstance where a Shipper has released capacity and the Replacement Shipper utilizes a Secondary Point. CIG is clarifying that it will bill the Original Shipper for all reservation charges applicable at the Secondary Point(s) even if those charges are higher than the Original Shipper is paying at the Primary Point(s). CIG states it will bill the Replacement Shipper only the amount that such party bid in order to acquire the capacity (through the capacity release program) unless the Original Shipper requires payment or reimbursement of reservation charges by the Replacement Shipper. CIG states this change is being made in keeping with the holdings of the Commission in ANR Pipeline Company, 66 FERC ¶61,340 (1994) and 68 FERC ¶ 61,009 (1994). Secondly, CIG is proposing to change the section of its tariff concerning posting of affiliate discounts. CIG is proposing to post on its electronic bulletin board its discounts to affiliates 24 hours after the gas flows under the discounted transaction. CIG states that this change is being made in keeping with the Commissions holding in Order No. 566&hyph;A issued October 14, 1994. CIG states that copies of this filing have been served on CIG's jurisdictional customers and public bodies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211). All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before November 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29016 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
