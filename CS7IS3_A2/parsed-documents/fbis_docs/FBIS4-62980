FBIS4-62980 "drsov097_g_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Program on Monetary Merger Outlined Program on Monetary Merger Outlined LD1805122594 LD1805122594 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0835 on 17 May broadcasts a 40-minute program on the merging of the Russian and Belarussian monetary systems. The program is in two parts and consists of, first, a 25-minute live interview with Stanislaw Shushkevich, former chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, by Leonid Sviridov, Radio Rossii's correspondent in Minsk, followed by, after a break for the news, a 15-minute question and answer session with listeners. The live interview begins with Sviridov expressing surprise at Shushkevich's assertion, before going on air, that although the treaty on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems has been signed, the official text of the treaty does not show the date when it was actually signed. Commenting on this, Shushkevich says: "You are absolutely right to point this out. The Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus finds itself in a laughable situation. The point is that a different document was signed -- it was signed on 6 September last year and ratified by the Supreme Soviet. Now the Supreme Soviet is, so to speak, playing a joke -- or else it has had a joke played on itself. This is because the Supreme Soviet ratified an agreement which should have come into force on 1 January. Then our esteemed premier [Vyacheslaw Kebich] announced that its implementation was being postponed to 1 April. Well, this did not happen, of course, and now nobody knows when it will come into force, because this is an authentic copy of the treaty, and there is no date here. So, nobody knows when it was signed. "Furthermore, as you see, the signature of the chairman of the National Bank [Stanislaw Bagdankevich] does not appear here. In other words, he has objections." Sviridov then interjects to explain that Bagdankevich's objections were based on Article five in the Belarusian Constitution. Shushkevich continues: "Well, if the chairman of the National Bank felt that he could not sign it, his reasons are understandable. He did not dare to contravene the Constitution. What is more, I think that perhaps he objected to the agreement as a whole because he regarded it as unbeneficial. "But I would like to delve into the background of this treaty. Everything began with the establishment of the CIS. After all, the aim of setting up the CIS was to halt the disintegration. If anybody were to take the text of the Viskuli Agreement [setting up the CIS], they would see that it calls for a single currency and a customs and payments union. In other words, what was intended was an extremely integrated economic union, more integrated even than the European Community. We decided to build a law-based Commonwealth and to develop proper economic relations. "But what transpired? Very often, these days, we hear complaints that the agreement is not working. A very simple truth has emerged. In conditions of the market economy governments cannot impose from above those ties which they might prefer. Market economies are effective because they establish logical and necessary ties. So, far fewer ties have been established by all the agreements signed on the CIS than those initiated from below. But this process has gotten going. There is no problem here. Such ties as military ones, ties in the field of transportation and communications, for instance, can be established from above, by government decisions. The movement of citizens and the openness of borders must be handled in this way. Economic ties, however, will be established by the due logic of things. "Against this background it was announced that salvation for our structure -- the Republic of Belarus -- lay in the unification of monetary systems. I fear that Russia has very little idea of the state of our economy." Shushkevich goes on to say: "I don't want to tax the listeners with complex matters. A few days ago [Prime Minister] Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin had an article published in the FINANCIAL TIMES in which he said that the output slump in Russia amounts to 25 percent. That is a very big figure. But Russia has reformed itself. Obviously, reform is always accompanied by slump. Russia is building on a completely different foundation. The Russian prime minister put it this way: This is the low point; things will improve from here. Clearly, he must have reasons for saying so, since he made this statement to such an authoritative publication. "But what has happened in our republic? Here the slump amounts to 40 percent. Production fell by 40 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the first quarter of last year. Just listen to our radio and TV broadcasts. Everywhere, government servants -- I was going to call them satraps because of the mindless praise they go in for -- everywhere they forget about this catastrophic slump. Instead they say that everything is fine. I will not go so far as to quote the words of Utesov's song "Everything is fine, fair marchioness" but that is more or less what it amounts to. The collapse has actually been catastrophic. But we say that there is a way out of this predicament." Returning to the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, Shushkevich says: "The Viskuli Agreement also stipulated that we would all use the same ruble. But what happened subsequently? Every newly formed country strove to gain an advantage at the expense of others. The banks were unable to agree on how to control emission. In other words, no mechanism of confidence and control was worked out. So, I ask, won't the same thing happen if we unite? Does such a mechanism exist or not? Generally speaking, there is nothing new in this. I do not know of any legal agreements which have been reached. So, the same thing is bound to happen again. Assuming we do not want it to happen, let us ask what will be the significance of the transnational bank to be formed when the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus is abolished. This signifies that Russia and Belarus have to have a common budget. And how can we have a common budget without a single taxation system, because Russian citizens will not pay out for Belarusians or Belarusians for Russians? So, there will have to be a single, fair taxation system. That is obvious. "What does a single taxation system mean? Tt means there must be a single law on property. That is obvious. What does a single law on property mean? It means there must be a single procedure for privatization. But the show has never gotten on the road here in Belarus, if you don't mind my saying so. Grassroots privatization, voucher privatization, has not started. In Russia, by contrast, it is now ending. "What does a single procedure for privatization mean? It means joint administration of state assets. How can it not be joint? What does joint administration of state assets mean? It means centralized release of credit and identical rates of interest. When I was driving to the studio today, I heard someone on the radio saying that Russia has reduced its bank rate to 200 percent. Here, however, such an interest rate would be impossible, it would be equivalent to a subsidy because our inflation rate is so high. So, this is not realistic. "But if this were actually to be implemented, welfare benefits in the two countries would have to be the same. How can such a thing happen, I ask you? It can only happen in a unified state. Given the differences in our legislation and the state of our economies, this is unrealistic. So, why all this hypocrisy? Let me ask a blunt question: What basis is there for all this talk of unification, and so on, and so forth? There is a great deal of hypocrisy here. "Basically, the issue at stake here is not unification of monetary systems. These are populist election slogans, and our premier makes no effort to hide the fact. Speaking at the Belarussian State University a few days ago, he said that those articles of the law which have come into force, relating to the customs union, will operate until 31 July provided he [Kebich] is elected. Actually, they will stay in force after that. So, why is he dictating terms? What kind of interpretation is this?" Sviridov then refers to a warning by Kebich, reported by ZVYAZDA on May 14th, that Belarusia's entry to the ruble zone might not actually go ahead if there is an upset in the presidential elections. Shushkevich replies: "Who then should Russia, anybody in Russia, support? After all, such an attitude destroys the common strategy drawn up by the CIS, that is, the idea of mutual settlements through a payments union and an interstate bank. This is the decision of the CIS. We have an interest in this. Why can't we -- we have a very big interest in resolving questions with Russia -- but why can't we do the same with Ukraine? It can be done through a transnational bank. I think Russia has an interest in this, too. And the CIS has made a decision on this. "So, it has to be ratified by the states involved. But this is being put off. In other words, the agreements signed by all members of the CIS must be implemented. Why is this not being done in our republic? The answer is transparently clear. Our government is bankrupt and it hopes that Russia will settle our debts at the expense of the Russian taxpayer. "But I don't think this is very good for Russians. I repeat, I am convinced that the Russians do not realize how bad our economic situation is." Asked to explain his position with regard to monetary unification, which seems to have changed since 1991 from supporting it to categorical rejection of it now, Shushkevich says: "Let me make it clear. It is true that I was angrily criticized by the government because I said that I have nothing to do with this menagerie -- I mean all these hares, aurochs, and other beasts -- because I believed that we should carry out the same anti-inflation policy as Russia. However, this was not to be. It was decided that we would kill two birds with one stone. First of all, we were to introduce the cash that Russia could not give us, but at the same time we were to keep the exchange rate of one-to-one, and the two currencies were to be in parallel circulation. But there are no miracles. If we restrict the outflow, the consequences will be exactly as I said they would be. And I am not the only one to say so. I am not a prophet. Half the Supreme Soviet were such prophets. We explained all of this from the rostrum. In fact, the exchange rates began diverging and now the exchange rate is one-to-ten. So, what happened? It was decided that we would print as much money as we needed. If the agriculture is ruined, we will give credits. We have a catastrophically high inflation rate, that is, price rises are very much greater than in Russia. But at the same time, we wanted to have a stable monetary system. These are the naive dreams of the government. "So why is there such a desire now? Well, I was against the creation of this money. I understood what it would lead to, because no one can make miracles happen. It is impossible to make ordinary people live according to market rules, but let the leadership live according to distribution rules. And this is what they were trying to achieve here." Shushkevich goes on to say: "Look at what happened this year. [Viktor] Chernomyrdin believes that there is a slump in Russia, but it is dictated by the reforms, and one can understand this. Russia bravely decided to follow the path of reforms and create a new class of owners. But we have no reforms. All we've got are individuals close to the government, and they grab more and more property. And look what happened in one year! I have already said that there is a 40-percent decline in the gross national product, prices have gone up 24 times while incomes have increased 15 times. The decline in average income is 40 percent. And if you take into account the polarization of society, we have a lot of destitute people." Shushkevich is then given some statistical data about the general dissatisfaction with the pace of reforms by the ordinary people in Belarus. "Well, it is just one more shattered dream. See what the people have been told: that they can exchange 200,000 rubles one-for-one. So, those who have a million hares in the bank, well, they will be pleased, won't they?" But, he adds, because of various restrictions imposed by the government for the forthcoming exchange of the Belarusian currency for Russian rubles, only a very exclusive circle of people close to the government will benefit from it. He says: "In 1991, thanks to a very honorable offer by Russia, we had a zero agreement, which meant that we had no more debts. At present, we will have $2 billion in debts by the end of the year. Some say that there is no real debt. But this year, the officially determined sum allocated for servicing the debt is $305.5 million. We must amalgamate these debts right now. But at the same time, Belarus is going to lose rental payments from Russian military bases. We are also going to lose the land tax from these bases. Another tax that we are losing is the transit transport tax. "One would say that this is all very fine and that we will receive cheap oil in exchange for all of this, without any added value. But this is not exactly the case. And the first steps have already shown that excise duties are increasing, and the price [of Russian oil sold to Belarus] is slowly going back to what it was. All of this is a fairy tale, a myth, because once people start barter deals -- I will give you a bit of this if you give me a bit of that -- instead of counting everything in money, misunderstandings arise right away." Shushkevich goes on to say that Russia should refine all the crude oil it exports to the West, and that it should do it together with Belarus, because of transportation links existing in Belarus. He then adds: "A question arises. Who wants this treaty? Who wants to transport oil to the West, quickly and free of charge? Is it the Russian state? We are not going to take this money from commercial structures. Do you understand? One must always look for a reason, and it seems to me that it is not the Russian state which is more interested in this, but rather the Russian Gazprom and other commercial structures. They are forcing us to make our taxpayers pay for this transit facility, ostensibly for Russia, but it is not for Russia that we will be doing this, but for some entirely different structures. "Why is it that commercial structures will not be paying any taxes? Russian commercial structures will not be paying any taxes for the transit of gas through Belrusian territory! I don't think this is fair! And in general, I would say that whenever something somewhere is going for free, there is a culprit. And in the final account, Russia will be guilty. I do not think this is right, I do not think this is in Russia's interest." During the question and answer session at the end of the program Shushkevich is asked why he is giving his interview to Radio Rossii rather than to Belarusian radio. Shushkevich replies: "In our republic, you know, the authorities have what amounts to a monopoly over all the mass media. Our government has decided that no one holding views different from itself shall have airtime on Belarusian radio and, especially, Belarusian TV. There are very few exceptions." The program ends with a final question about why Belarusian sour cream is being exported to Russia.
