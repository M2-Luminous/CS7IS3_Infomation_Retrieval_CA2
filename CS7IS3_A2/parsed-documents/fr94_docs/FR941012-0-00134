FR941012-0-00134 FR941012-0-00011 Paragraph (h)(1)(ix) of the final rule prohibits the practice of domino felling. As previously discussed, domino felling involves cutting wedges and making partial backcuts in a series of trees that form a continuous line. The last tree is then felled into the line thus pushing the line of trees to the ground in a chain reaction fashion. This requirement was not included in the proposed rule, however, several commenters urged OSHA to prohibit domino felling in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46; Tr. W2 231, OR 659). NIOSH said that domino felling was a hazardous practice because there was a loss of stability in the standing tree when it had been backcut (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Therefore, NIOSH recommended that OSHA include a requirement in the final rule allowing only one tree to be felled at a time. There are also other hazards associated with domino felling. First, when trees are used to knock down other trees, the likelihood that the trees will not fall in the expected direction is greatly increased. A small miscalculation in the falling direction can be significantly magnified down the line and result in serious injury to the feller or other employees in the area. In addition, a falling tree could hit another object and either fall in another direction or become lodged. This would require an employee to fell the lodged tree, which is a hazardous operation. Second, the hazards can be magnified when domino felling is not successful in knocking down the entire line of trees. The feller may be placed in an extremely hazardous situation if he must try to fell any of the line of trees that may remain standing. For example, part of the line of trees may have fallen over and lodged against the standing tree. A feller who attempts to fell the final standing tree(s) could be injured when the lodged line of trees and the final tree finally do fall. The risk of injury is greater because it is more likely that the lodged trees may fall in an unexpected direction, and the combined weight of the lodged trees further increases the risk. In this sense, the prohibition against domino felling is similar to the requirement in the final rule that trees be felled in a manner that prevents them from striking things such as ropes, cables, or power lines. For these reasons, OSHA is requiring that trees be felled one at a time rather than allowing trees to be used to knock down other trees.
