The present Supreme Council of Ukraine is resigning. Fate has allowed us to play a truly historic role in consolidating Ukrainian statehood. We lived through a moment of unity when adopting the declaration of Ukraine's state sovereignty and the act of its independence. In the past four years we have laid a legislative foundation for the development of a democratic, law-governed state. Today, we have all of its integral features. Ukraine has been recognized by 145 states. It has been accepted as a rightful member of the European and world community. The Supreme Council of Ukraine 12th convocation, with all its shortcomings, was a stabilizing factor in society and helped prevent interethnic discord. The laws it passed on the issues of nationality, interethnic relations, and protection of the rights of ethnic minorities received high appraisal from the world community. Calling on the newly elected deputies to preserve the positive heritage of the present Supreme Council, we would like to warn them against the miscalculations and mistakes we made. We failed to ensure a proper attitude to the Constitution and the laws in the society, as well as coordination between the branches of power, the center, and the regions. The practice of transferring legislative functions to executive structures proved unjustified. The effective work of Ukraine's Supreme Council was often hindered by political confrontation. We call on the new members of parliament, political parties and movements, and their leaders to refrain from settling scores in the Supreme Council, and especially from involving their supporters in doing so. Such actions usually lead to destructive consequences for society as a whole. We appeal to the deputies who are replacing us to (?preserve) Ukraine's statehood, its independence and territorial integrity, and the inviolability of our borders. Whatever political movements or religious denominations we are part of, whatever our ethnic background, we are all citizens of Ukraine, and there is only one Ukraine for all of us. Adopting the new Constitution of Ukraine as soon as possible would assist in solving these problems. The most important thing today is to speed up the overcoming of the economic crisis, to stabilize and develop the national economy, and to strengthen its social orientation. This can be achieved on the road of economic reform by ensuring the equality of all forms of ownership and economic management. The financial, monetary, and credit policy and taxation require serious and essential changes. A further improved legal foundation is needed for an effective campaign against crime, first of all, organized crime and corruption, to strengthen law enforcement and ensure reliable protection of citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms. We hope that the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the new convocation will continue to work on strengthening Ukraine's authority as a large European nation, its economic integration with the countries of the CIS and other states of the world. We call on the people's deputies and all citizens to join efforts in the development of Ukraine, to do their best to preserve peace and concord in society. This is the only way we can survive the difficulties and improve people's lives. We have faith in your power and wisdom. We wish you honest and constructive work for the good of the Ukrainian people. [signed] The Supreme Council of Ukraine, 12th convocation, Kiev, 22 April 1994.
