According to calculations by the Economic Research Institute (Wifo), companies received more orders on an average over the past few months than one year earlier, and in November order books, for the first time, were fuller than in the previous year. The economy further consolidated in the fall. Industrial production remained almost stable,, falling short of production figures of one year ago only by about 1.5 percent between September and November. The economic researchers have based their optimism mainly on the recovery of the sector of products for further processing, which tends to precede economic developments. The textile and clothing industry and the producers of capital goods once more had to significantly cut back production. The negative developments in last year's export figures improved over the past few months. Remarkable results were achieved by Austrian exports overseas (Southeast Asia and the United States, in particular): November exports to the "Four Dragons" increased by 19 percent, and to the United States by 28 percent over the previous year. The increase in orders from abroad in a number of industries gives rise to the hope that the export industry will soon free itself from stagnation. One important condition for it is a stable upward trend in Germany. Developments in the German economy have been relatively favorable in the past few months. There is, however, a major discrepancy between increasing orders from abroad and a weak demand at home. The risk that lack of confidence among German consumers might impair the recovery must not be underestimated. [passage omitted] In Austria, the rate of inflation remained at 3.5 percent in December, too, falling by only about 0.5 percentage points in the course of 1993 despite the recession. The increase of prices for industrial products (plus 3.2 percent) and private services (plus 5.7 percent) remained almost undiminished. Public rates increased more strongly in the course of the year (reaching plus 4.9 percent in December). Prices for energy and food were tending to check price rises. On the labor market economic recession and the pressure of rationalization measures resulted in a major reduction of jobs in industry (October: minus 37,000 or minus 7 percent). Total employment, however, remained virtually stable due to additional demand for labor by the public sector, the health sector, economic services, and the construction industry. The increase in registered unemployed continually diminished: from plus 40,000 in March 1993 to plus 11,000 in January 1994.
