FR940706-2-00150 FR940706-2-00089 Each application for funding under this NOFA must contain the following items: (a) Request for Service Coordinator Funds All applications must contain the following information stated in a letter from the Executive Director of the PHA to the Director of the Public Housing Division in the local HUD State or Area Office (see sample letter format, Attachment 1): (1) The total number of HOPE for Elderly Independence Program participants. (2) The dollar amount of any PHA matching funds for supportive services costs under the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program that is attributable to the costs of a service coordinator. If funds are received under this NOFA to pay service coordinator costs that were formerly part of the PHA's required match, that dollar value match must be replaced with payment for other additional supportive services costs. The PHA's application must identify any replacement supportive services and their costs, and include firm written commitments from the service providers for at least the first year's funding. (3) The annual salary proposed for the service coordinator, plus any fringe benefits and administrative costs (e.g., additional office equipment, supplies, car allowance, copying, training, etc.) for the first year, the amounts needed for years two through five, and the total amount requested for the complete five year period. The service coordinator salary should be based on the following formula: (i) Determine the salary level, taking into consideration salaries for comparable jobs, modified by the hours worked. (ii) Set the annual salary, including any fringe benefits that pertain to the job. (iii) List first year administrative costs. (iv) Set the total cost for year one: Annual salary, plus first year administrative costs, equals total cost for the first year. (v) The estimates for years two through five (or less) may be based on an annual inflation factor of up to five percent. Any one-time, first-year start-up costs should be subtracted from the year one administrative cost before calculating the year two through five estimates.
