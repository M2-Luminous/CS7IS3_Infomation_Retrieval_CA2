Roberts said that the peacekeepers have started deployment Thursday [12 May] to take over full control of the demarcation line between the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia. The RSK was declared in 1991 by the Serbs on their ethnic and historic lands in the former Republic of Croatia in response to the latter's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of the Serbs in Croatia to a national minority. Since the spring of 1992 RSK has been declared a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA). UNPROFOR troops have been sent to locations where some units of the conflicting sides still remain, Roberts told a regular press conference. This marks the beginning of the implementation of the Akashi-Martic agreement reached in talks held on May 9 in Knin. Under the agreement the remaining troops of the two sides should fully withdraw by May 20. Speakivg about Akashi's visit to Knin and his talks with the RSK leadership there Roberts confirmed that the U.N. special envoy was satisfied with the results of the talks and that he had the impression that great progress had been made in the last 15 days towards the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, reached on March 30 in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Roberts also pointed to the difficulties in clearing up the mines on the main communication links, as well as on local roads, and that it was still unsafe for the population to return to the villages in Ravni Kotari. People nevertheless come to inspect their houses and land and some have started clearing up the debris, he added. Roberts said that special Canadian units with 35 experts would be dispatched to speed up the mine-clearing process and warned that the work could not be accomplished if both sides did not submit detailed maps of the mine fields. So far only the North Dalmatian Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army has done this, Roberts said adding that the maps supplied by the Croatian side were inaccurate. Since the beginning of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement the UNPROFOR has set up 69 observation posts along the 310-km long demarcation line in Sector South. A Jordanian battalion is now being deployed on Mt Velebit where observation posts already exist to monitor the cease-fire. The peacekeeprs are also setting up observation posts on Mts Dinara and Svilja.
