At the end of the rally the marchers released a resolution condemning the silence of the West and international forums, the U.N. in particular. They announced support for the defenceless Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina and said they would use all possible means to end the Serbian crimes against humanity. The resolution called on Islamic states to close ranks against the genocide of Europe's native Muslim population. It lauded Iran's logical stance on the B-H issue and urged the Foreign Ministry to provide necessary grounds for sending of Iranian forces to Bosnia. Placards carried by the demonstrators read: "Genocide in Bosnia- Herzegovina, U.S. Gift to the New Generations". A large group of women were also seen in the rally. Earlier on Thursday, university students had demonstrated in front of the U.N. mission to protest the indifference to the massacre of Bosnian Muslims.
