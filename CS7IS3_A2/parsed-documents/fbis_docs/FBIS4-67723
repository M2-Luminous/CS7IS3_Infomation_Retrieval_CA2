But it is not easy to make ends meet. There are too many beds for the small market. The operations are successful, the patients survive and are satisfied, but the hospitals are in financial trouble. Danish private hospitals have high medical standards and luxurious accommodations. Nevertheless, they continue to have big budget problems. The two largest private hospitals, as a consequence, have altered their course in the past few months. Most recently, Mermaid, a private hospital in Ebeltoft, has cut its operating costs by 10 million kroner. The hospital has also convinced its creditors to cancel half of its outstanding debt and for a third time the hospital is out looking for new capital, this time, 10 to 12 million kronor. At the same time, the entire management has resigned and will be replaced in the spring. A total of 200 million kronor has been lost on the hilltop above Ebeltoft since Mermaid opened its doors in 1989. On the other hand, "Danmark" Health Insurance provides substantial payment for care in private hospitals. Administrative Director Preben Hentzen has a number of explanations for why there are so many problems with the industry: "The number of beds in private hospitals is growing faster than the number of patients. It takes time for Danes to get used to paying for treatment," he stated matter-of-factly, and also pointed to the fact that patients from one county can get a new knee or a new hip at hospitals in another county and get treatment faster -- for free. There are about 200 beds in private hospitals in Denmark. The largest are Mermaid with 37 beds and Hamlet, a private hospital in Frederiksberg, with 33 beds. There are a number of smaller ones as well. An example of a successful one is Erichsen's Clinic in Charlottenlund, which is about to expand to 22 beds and is in good financial shape. But an industry-watcher finds that private patients bring the hospitals earnings of only about 100 million kroner, when treatments for infertility are not figured in. Coming In Mermaid has a turnover of 70 to 80 million kroner. But a quarter of this comes from infertility treatments. The hospital has also made an agreement with Frederiksborg County to perform a number of operations. But it has not been enough. The debt to Realkredit Danmark has now been reduced from 110 million kroner to 60 million. That cuts the rent in half. The Kirkbi Corp., which owns the hospital's equipment, has also consented to reduce the hospital's leasing payments significantly. The staff has been reduced from 90 to 75. All this has given Board Chairman Frank Bottrup confidence in the future: "We had 11,000 to 12,000 patients in 1993 and turnover of 70 to 80 million kroner. We are experiencing a very slight rise in patient intake. If we maintain the same turnover, the books could balance--for the first time," he said. But first he must find new management. Administrative Director Sten Christensen, the medical director, the head nurse, and a financial officer resigned after having put together and won approval for 10 million kroner in cutbacks. "We have a promise of 5 to 6 million kroner of new capital. We are now looking for a corresponding sum. I would like to have it resolved by the end of this month. It would be overdramatizing it, however, to call it a race against time," said Bottrup. Hoj: What has gone wrong? Bottrup: The interest is there and the competition from the public sector is not the problem. But patients from abroad have never come. And earlier, "Danmark" paid 85 percent of the actual costs. Beginning in 1993, the fixed contribution was reduced so that now patients must pay 40 percent themselves. That brought Mermaid's turnover down to a new level. Preben Hentzen of `Danmark' said that it was necessary to change the regulations because there was too great a price differential from hospital to hospital, and that now it was working satisfactorily. But he cannot confirm that Mermaid is getting more patients. On the contrary: "If the intake at Mermaid is rising, the patients cannot be members of `Danmark.' In 1993, we paid out more for care at private hospitals than we did in 1992, but it was spread over a number of clinics. There were fewer patients at Mermaid who received insurance payments," said Hentzen, who felt that the Ebeltoft location was geographically unfortunate for a hospital: "People do not want to travel to Mols for a service they could just as easily get in Copenhagen." Hamlet Hamlet, located in Frederiksberg, opened its doors in April of 1993 and presented new competition for Mermaid. At Hamlet they are also saying: "Next year." The French-English concern, GHG, withdrew from ownership at the end of last year after a disappointing first year. The hospital is now owned solely by Danica and Rasmussen & Schiotz. "January was not as bad as expected. February looks promising," said Hamlet administrative director Anne-Marie Traberg optimistically. She is expecting a turnover of 50-60 million kroner this year. If this materializes, the hospital will expand next year and move closer to a time when the figures will move from red to black, which they will at about 70 million. "Patients began to come in the fall and we expect about 5,000 patients this year. Danes are feeling increasingly confident about private hospitals and are starting to regard us as a natural part of the hospital community," she said.
