Opposition representatives gave a negative evaluation of the new budget, saying that it is socially unfair and a sham. We talked about the new budget with Seimas Economics Committee member Professor Kazimieras Antanavicius. [Kulakauskas] Perhaps you would compare for us this year's budget to last year's with respect to our economic development. Are there signs in the budget that our country's economy has stabilized or moved forward by at least a little bit? [Antanavicius] It is possible to compare the situation in this regard, and it should be done. And a reply to your question can be given after analyzing sources of revenue and changes in production. Data from the economics and finance ministries indicate that the gross domestic product for production, especially in agriculture, will be the same in 1994 as it was in 1993. But in real prices, the gross domestic product for 1992 amounted to only 47.5 percent of the 1989 level, and for 1993, only 35.4 percent. Therefore, compared to the previous year, production in 1993 dropped by 12 percent and will comprise only a third of the 1989 production level this year. So one cannot speak of any kind of improvement in the economy. Despite the fact that there is no economic upswing, revenues and outlays are being increased and will approximately double in 1994. Since there is a drop in production and stagnation, this means that revenues can only be increased when taxes are continually increased for the inhabitants. And the leadership, unfortunately, is going down this road. Although a majority of inhabitants already finds itself below the poverty level, the leadership keeps coming up with new taxes: for income, for resurveying land, for documents specifying the organization of land exploitation (land cadastres), various certificates, excises, etc. And all this is being done at a time when state enterprises are not settling accounts in time with rural inhabitants for agricultural production that has been delivered, and when limits are being set on the purchase of this production. This is simple robbery, and the reason it is becoming impossible to live in Lithuania. There can be two kinds of robbers in the country: those outside the scope of the law and those government officials who cloak themselves in the law. Even if the people can avoid the former by fleeing or by defending themselves, they are powerless against the latter. Groundless taxes smother the desire of the people to work better, ruin production and the entire economy, increase people's dissatisfaction and the social tension in the country. [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the proportions foreseen in the budget for financing the fields of economics and social matters? Is it right, for example, that the amount of funding being earmarked for maintaining the country's government apparatus is greater than that earmarked for culture and education, and almost as much as is being set aside for agriculture, health care, and social concerns? [Antanavicius] Unfortunately, we still have a very long way to go until we arrive at intelligent proportions. U.S. President B. Clinton--who was elected a year ago--and his administration started their work by looking for ways to decrease the funds used for governing the country. French president F. Mitterrand is undertaking to do the same thing towards the end of his term of office. But I--having already spent several years in the highest institution of our government--have never heard the verb "to save". This year, expenditures for governing the country are being increased approximately twice as much as those for other areas. This means that official plans call for appropriating 9 percent of budget funds in 1994--and in fact this is about 12 percent--to expand and maintain the government apparatus. In Latvia, meanwhile, 6 percent is being earmarked for this purpose, and in Estonia, Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the total is about 5 percent. And the latter three countries are markedly richer than Lithuania. It is incomprehensible how the government cannot see the poverty of thousands of its country's people and how it can completely uselessly give away to officials the money collected from the inhabitants who have earned it with their blood and sweat. In this situation, the justified question arises: whom does such a government represent--society, or only itself? [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the agricultural policy that the LDDP is implementing now? Is sufficient attention paid in the budget to agricultural financing? [Antanavicius] So far there is no normal agricultural policy at all. Lithuania is not going to be able to establish a market agricultural economy without government subsidies, because farmers will not have the funds for farm machinery, fertilizers, or the construction of farm buildings. Unless it has government support, the Lithuanian farm will remain a source of sustenance only for the elderly people living there, because the production of agricultural products will continue to fall. There was talk in the LDDP's election program about state support for agriculture, but that has now been forgotten. In the spring of last year, for example, funds earmarked for farm subsidies were transformed into credits, without giving thought to how the farmers would be able to repay those credits if the state itself does not pay them on time for the products they have produced and delivered and if the state cannot force state enterprises to settle accounts on time with the people. What kind of government is this? On the other hand, the state is obliged to foresee in the budget not only funds to support agriculture, but also to provide sufficient notice as to what kind of agricultural production it intends to buy up, and in what quantities, so that the people would know that their labor will not be for naught. The state should help the farmers venture into foreign markets. Unfortunately, no one is worrying about this and the farmers, especially those who have recently begun to farm on their own land, are left to the whims of fate. Also, there is one clause in the budget which states that subsidies, i.e. support, will be provided to the farm by decreasing agricultural taxes. In other words, the people will be "supported" by the money in their own pockets. This is real derision. Given this kind of government policy, one just wants to shout out to the farmers: "Work only as much as is necessary to satisfy your own needs and those of your relatives, because if you produce any more production, you will only have more worries, and possibly losses as well!" [Kulakauskas] How do you evaluate the ongoing argument between the government and the opposition on the indexing of people's deposits? [Antanavicius] Deposits have to be indexed. This should have been done quite a bit earlier, when the litas was introduced. I had prepared a draft of a law dealing with this and proposed it to the Seimas, but the majority in Seimas did not take it into consideration, as they also did not take into consideration many intelligent suggestions for better preparing the 1994 budget. [Kulakauskas] Do you have any regrets about withdrawing from the post of chairman of the Seimas Economics Committee? [Antanavicius] I don't, because to remain in this position would mean being responsible for the entirety of economic policy, and it is morally unjustifiable and inexpedient to be responsible for a policy with which one does not agree and which one has no possiblities to change.
