Synopsis of Memorandum Opinion and Order 1. In furtherance of the Commission's implementation of the carriage agreement provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), the Commission adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order reconsidering one of its regulations adopted in Implementation of Sections 12 and 19 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992_Development of Competition and Diversity in Video Programming Distribution and Carriage, MM Docket No. 92&hyph;265 (Oct. 22, 1993), 58 FR 60390 (Nov. 16, 1993), 9 FCC Rcd 2624 (1993); 47 CFR 76.1302. The action disposes of a petition for reconsideration filed by the Wireless Cable Association (``WCA'') requesting that the Commission amend its rules, to afford standing specifically to any multichannel video programming distributor (``MVPD'') aggrieved by an alleged violation of Section 616 of the 1992 Cable Act to file a complaint pursuant to 47 CFR 76.1302(a). WCA's petition was supported by Liberty Cable Company and GTE Service Corporation and was opposed by Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation. 2. Section 616 of the 1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 536, governs agreements between cable operators_or other MVPDs_and the programming services they distribute, and directs the Commission to establish regulations that prevent cable operators or other MVPDs from entering into carriage agreements that condition carriage of a vendor's programming on particular concessions. 3. Section 616(a) (1), (2) and (3), 47 U.S.C. 536(a) (1), (2), (3) specifically directed the Commission to establish regulations prohibiting MVPDs from: (1) Requiring a financial interest in the programming services as a condition of carriage; (2) coercing a programming vendor to provide exclusive rights as a condition of carriage, or retaliating against such vendor for failure to grant exclusivity; and (3) discriminating in carriage terms between affiliated and nonaffiliated programming vendors. 4. WCA claimed that ยง76.1302 of the Commission's rules is too narrowly drafted and could be interpreted to limit standing solely to programming vendors aggrieved by violations of the carriage agreement provisions, thus precluding a complaint from an MVPD aggrieved by the same anticompetitive behavior. WCA contended that if the rule was so interpreted, the purpose of Section 616 would be frustrated because a multiple system operator with sufficient market power over a programming vendor to coerce exclusivity would be able to employ the same market power to secure the programming vendor's silence. Opponents of the petition for reconsideration contended, inter alia, that Section 616 was intended solely to benefit unaffiliated programming vendors and that Section 628 of the 1992 Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 548), and the Commission's program access rules, provide the appropriate avenue of redress for MVPDs. 4. The 1992 Cable Act and its legislative history 1 indicate that Congress found that the cable television industry is highly concentrated with a high degree of vertical integration of cable systems and programmers. 2 When drafting the 1992 Cable Act, Congress was concerned that increased horizontal concentration and vertical integration in the cable industry had created an imbalance of power between cable operators and program vendors. Congress concluded that vertically integrated cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor affiliated programming vendors over unaffiliated programming vendors with respect to granting carriage on their system. 3 Congress also found that, in return for carriage on the cable system, some cable operators have required certain non-affiliated programming vendors to grant them certain concessions. 4 1 House Committee on Energy and Commerce, H.R.
