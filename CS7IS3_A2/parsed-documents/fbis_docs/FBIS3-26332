The full text of the speech is as follows: Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and comrades: Thw Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant officially started its commercial operation on 1 February 1994. Today, we gladly gather together to celebrate the completion of Number 1 generator set. First of all, on behalf of the State Council, I would like to express warm congratulations and sincere gratitude to the friends of China Light & Power Co. in Hong Kong who have been sincerely cooperating for many years, to the domestic and overseas suppliers and contract undertakers participating in the construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, to the Chinese and foreign experts and workers working hard day and night on the construction site, and to all friends and comrades who supported and cared about this construction project! The beginning of the commercial operation of Number 1 generator set in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant indicates that the nuclear power industry in our country had taken a new step. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is the first medium-sized nuclear power plant built in our country on the basis of our own researches and with our own designs and equipment made in China, while the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the first large-sized nuclear power plant we built by introducing foreign funds and advanced equipment and technology. The construction of these two nuclear power plants play an important role in starting our country's nuclear power industry, training the technical contingent, and mastering nuclear power technology. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a product of reform and opening up. In 1979, shortly after our country adopted the reform and opening up policy, the Ministry of Power Industry and Guangdong Province worked out the plan for using foreign loans to build a power plant and then selling electricity to repay debts by making use of the favorable geographical conditions of Shenzhen, thus opening up a new road of using foreign funds to launch a large-scale infrastructural project in our country. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the largest Chinese-foreign joint venture to be set up in our country recently. A modern enterprise management system was set up according to international practice, with the adoption of the general manager responsibility system under the leadership of the board of directors. Thus, enterprise operation was separated from government functions; responsibilities were clearly defined and assigned; and management was effected scientifically. In the process of building the nuclear power plant, the competition mechanism was introduced, and the tender invitation system was adopted. Thus, the outstanding Chinese and foreign suppliers and construction enterprises were selected to participate in the power plant's design, construction, testing, and consulting services. The valuable point of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is not only the introduction of advanced foreign equipment and technology but also the adoption of the advanced foreign experience in organizing and managing a construction project, thus substantially enhancing our own level of modern construction. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a project always cared about and supported by the party central leadership and the State Council. The State Council held many meetings to discuss and assess this project. In 1985, when the joint venture contract of Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation was signed, Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally received Lord Kadoorie, the joint venture's Hong Kong-side founder and chairman of China Light & Power Co., and expressed full affirmation and support for this new product of reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang Zemin was also deeply concerned about the nuclear power plant work and personally came to the site to give instructions. At crucial junctures, the central leading comrades personally attended to the project, which helped overcome difficulties in the process of construction and ensured the smooth development of the project. The Ministry of Power Industry, the Nuclear Industrial Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen City also did a great deal of work to create conditions for the construction of the nuclear power plant, and gave effective support to the project. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is also a product of the policy for giving play to the initiative of both the central and local authorities. It should be pointed out that the French company, Famatong [3127 7456 6639], which supplied the nuclear- island equipment for the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, the British company, General Power [tong yong dian qi 6639 3938 7193 3049], which supplied the conventional generator set, and the French Electric Power Company, which undertook the contracts of designing and testing the equipment, carried out effective cooperation with the Chinese design, construction, and testing institutions in the prolonged process of construction. We express heartfelt gratitude and respect for their cooperation. At present, number one generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has been put into commercial operation, and the testing of number two generator set is going on smoothly. The whole project is expected to be completed and put into operation within this year. It is hoped that the Chinese and foreign suppliers, contract undertakers, and all Chinese and foreign personnel on the construction side will, as usual, continue their efforts and continue to make contributions to the full completion of the nuclear power plant project in good quality and with high efficiency. We shall not only properly build such a modern nuclear power plant, but will also properly manage it. In a certain sense, it is even more difficult to manage it well than to build it well. Therefore, in the future operation of the nuclear power plant, the entire personnel must always carry out the principle of "quality first, safety first," and perfectly ensure that electric power is unceasingly generated and supplied in a safe way and in good quality to Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong region, thus serving the economic prosperity in these areas. Our country has a great demand for electric power, so when making great effort to develop thermal power and hydropower generation, we also need to appropriately develop nuclear power generation in suitable locations. The construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has provided successful experience for the development of the nuclear power industry in our country, and has also trained a large number of nuclear power experts. At the same time, favorable conditions for the second-phase project in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant have also been created. At present, our nation is further comprehensively carrying out the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and is deepening the reforms and expanding opening. Foreign investment in China also keeps an upward momentum, as the investment environment is being continuously improved and the scope of investment is being broadened further. We welcome foreign companies to participate in our construction projects in the basic industries and in the field of infrastructural facilities, and warmly welcome friends from various countries to further the economic and technical cooperation in the field of nuclear power generation. Now, I propose a toast to the completion and commercial operation of Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, to the friendly cooperation of Chinese and foreign constructors, and to our friendship! Thank you very much! 5 February 1994
