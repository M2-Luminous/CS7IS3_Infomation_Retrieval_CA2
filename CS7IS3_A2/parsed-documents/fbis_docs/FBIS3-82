Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-30MAR94-EGYPT Possible Electoral Change Further Strains Islamic Alliance SUMMARY Already tense relations between the illegal but largely tolerated Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its electoral ally the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) have been further strained by reports that the Egyptian government is considering a new change in the law governing parliamentary elections. While an official decision on changing the law is evidently still far off, the MB has evinced concern that such a change would benefit the SLP to the Brotherhood's detriment. END SUMMARY Over the past few months, both Egypt's state-owned and opposition newspapers have published reports that the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) is contemplating yet another change in the parliamentary election system, presumably to take effect prior to the elections expected to occur at the expiration of the current People's Assembly term in late 1995. According to the reports and news commentaries, the change being considered would restore in some form the recently abolished proportional representation party list system, which was introduced by President Husni Mubarak in 1984. Under that system, the banned Muslim Brotherhood could enter candidates only if legal parties integrated them in their lists. The party list system was abolished prior to the 1990 parliamentary elections, after the Constitutional Court ruled that it did not give independent candidates sufficient opportunity to compete; it was replaced by a system based on individual candidacies (see Note 1). According to the government-owned daily Al-Ahram, the government's interest in restoring the old system is largely motivated by its concern to rein in independent-minded NDP deputies by ensuring that they are beholden to the party (Al-Ahram international edition, 30 March). (Note 1) The Brotherhood--together with its SLP ally and two other parties--nonetheless opted to boycott the 1990 elections in protest against what they claimed was the absence of guarantees for free and honest elections. Minister of People's Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs Muhammad Zaki Abu-'Amir appeared to confirm in February that the government is seriously considering restoring the party slate system with modifications that would bring it into compliance with the 1990 court ruling. In comments reported by the weekly Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm, Abu-'Amir denied that he knew of any official inclination to change the system. He added, however, that the government's "economic liberalization policy will force a return to the proportional system," because individual candidacies are more susceptible to the "influence of money." The same report quoted Fawziyah 'Abd-al-Sattar, head of parliament's Legislative Committee, as saying that a compromise might be found in which half the seats in every district are reserved for independents and the other half for party slates (5 February). One suggested modification to the electoral system--lowering the threshold for parliamentary representation--would theoretically enable the SLP to contest the next People's Assembly elections without having to rely on its Muslim Brotherhood allies. Deputy Prime Minister and NDP Secretary General Yusuf Wali reportedly told SLP officials that restoring the proportional list system might also involve a lowering of the threshold for parliamentary representation from 8 percent of the vote that a party was required to win under the old system to 4 percent (Al-Ahram international edition, 5 January). It was that threshold that forced the SLP into its "Islamic Alliance" with the Brotherhood and a smaller party--the Liberals--in 1987 (see Note 2). Accordingly, lowering the threshold would make the SLP less dependent on the MB and would diminish MB opportunities to contest parliamentary seats independently, through the individual candidacies of organization members. (Note 2) The SLP fell just short of the threshold when it contested the previous elections of 1984 on its own. To the extent that the projected change could serve to undermine the MB-SLP alliance and damage MB chances in coming elections, it would be consistent with government attempts in the past couple of years to marginalize the organization through legislative action: --In February 1993, the People's Assembly passed a law aimed at turning back MB advances in professional syndicates by invalidating elections that fail to draw fifty percent of the eligible voters (Uktubar, 28 February 1993). --In December 1992, an amendment to the law governing political parties was passed, banning all political activities by organizations seeking party status that have not yet been legally recognized (Al-Ahram, 19 December 1992). That legislation followed rumors--evidently encouraged by NDP officials to intimidate the SLP and the Brotherhood--that the government was considering a bill to ban any alliance with an illegal organization. Rising Tensions in Islamic Alliance Concern over the possible electoral change has been an evident factor in recent tensions between MB and SLP leaders. Those relations have been particularly strained by the SLP's decision to engage in discussions with NDP officials on the "national dialogue"--which President Mubarak called for last November (see Note 3)--without MB representatives, despite the fact that the MB, along with most other opposition parties, signed a statement conditionally agreeing to participate in the dialogue (text of statement published in Al-Wafd, 7 December 1993). It was in a meeting with the SLP on the national dialogue that NDP Secretary General Wali reportedly indicated official openness to restoring the party list election system and lowering the threshold for representation. The dispute over participation in the dialogue broke out into the open last January with public bickering in the pages of the semiweekly SLP organ and MB mouthpiece Al-Sha'b, as well as the international edition of Al-Ahram. Although differences between leaders of the two groups have occasionally been expressed publicly in the past, such open bickering is extremely unusual, particularly in the Islamic Alliance's own paper. (Note 3) Mubarak invited "all the democratic forces in Egypt," including not only the political parties but "all of Egypt's thinkers and individuals, regardless of their affiliation," to join in a national dialogue that would "contribute toward drafting a sound scientific outlook for Egypt during the 21st century" (Cairo radio, 11 November 1993). More recently, Mubarak said he would call for the dialogue to take place in April (MENA, 20 March). Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi asserted in an interview that "only the legitimate forces will take part" in the dialogue and that "the Muslim Brotherhood is an illegitimate and illegal force" (Al-Musawwar, 4 February). But neither Sidqi nor his interviewer referred to press reports that the MB might participate in the dialogue at some point through the professional syndicates under its control. MB official Ma'mun al-Hudaybi used the organization's regular column in Al-Sha'b to attack the SLP together with four other opposition parties for allegedly agreeing to engage in the dialogue under reported government conditions that would exclude, at least initially, the MB and other parties (11 January). He devoted a separate box in the same column to chastising SLP Secretary General 'Adil Husayn for his account in the paper's previous issue of his meeting with NDP officials. Alluding, inter alia, to Husayn's report that the SLP representatives said they would "welcome" discussion of a change to the proportional list system as a topic of the "national dialogue," al-Hudaybi accused Husayn of flouting MB interests at the meeting "in the knowledge that your party leans toward agreement to the party list [electoral system] and that the political forces, foremost the MB, will be unable to participate in those elections if this is realized" (11 January). Responding to al-Hudaybi's remarks, Husayn objected to much of the criticism directed at him; but he made no effort to deny al- Hudaybi's allegation that the SLP supported a return to the proportional party list system (Al-Sha'b, 14 January). (For a summary of the exchange, see box.) Subsequent public bickering has brought to the surface other objects of longstanding tension between elements of the MB and SLP--tension that could increase if the government decides to restore the proportional party list system. Most notably, MB domination of the most prominent professional syndicates has evidently bred some resentment on the part of some SLP officials. Thus, SLP Assistant Secretary General and Secretary for Organization Affairs 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat was quoted as complaining that "the Brotherhood is working on monopolizing" the syndicates throughout the country and "not opening the door to participation by members of the party, except to a minimal degree that does not meet the party's aspirations." He asserted that the Brothers "view these syndicates as their legitimate party, as they have no legal presence" as an organization and thus believe "that the [Socialist] Labor Party may not compete with them in their party." This dispute, Barakat was quoted as saying, "has had a clear impact on the course of the alliance as it now stands" (Al-Ahram international edition, 15 January). Heading Toward a Break? The strains within the Islamic Alliance have led to open suggestions from SLP officials of ending the partnership; but it is unclear how much of the discussion is simply posturing or, if it is serious, whether it reflects the views of a significant sector of the party's leadership. Naji al-Shihabi, an assistant secretary general of the SLP and member of its Executive Bureau, was quoted in the press as claiming that a consensus was reached at a recent Bureau meeting in support of his proposal to end the alliance. He added, however, that it was agreed to wait until the thousands of elected local councils in Egypt are dissolved- -presumably as a result of an eventual court decision striking down that electoral system on the same basis that the parliamentary electoral system was earlier struck down (see Note 4). Noting that Alliance candidates won control over a number of these local councils in the elections of November 1992, al- Shihabi said the delay in ending the alliance would serve to prevent "a weakening of the members of the party in these councils" (Al-Ahram international edition, 8 January). While indicating that no firm decision has been made to abandon the Islamic Alliance, the SLP's Barakat, in his subsequent comments to Al-Ahram, implied that the party would be ready to break with the MB when the local councils are dissolved, unless the latter is ready to meet tough demands from the SLP. He was quoted as saying that "the existence of the local councils call for the continuation of the alliance in view of their division between the MB and Labor [Party]," adding that "should there be a decision dissolving the local councils, the matter will be reviewed" and certain understandings would have to be worked out before the alliance is renewed. (Note 4) The issue is awaiting a ruling by the Constitutional Court, to which it was referred immediately following the 1992 local council elections (Al-Wafd, 4 November 1992). Consistent with the SLP leaders' expression of a commitment to maintaining the Islamic Alliance at least until the local councils are dissolved, the open bickering between the MB and SLP ended in late January and al-Shihabi himself has made clear that party leaders unhappy with the alliance are not yet ready to burn their bridges with the MB. Most recently, al-Shihabi was cited as saying that his party is already "preparing for the possibility of a change in the election law to the unconditional proportional list system" --presumably referring to the absence of any threshold for representation--and that his party might form a "unified slate" that would include elements of both the MB and the [secular leftist] Nasirites (Al-Ahram international edition, 19 March). However, highlighting the potential for further discord, at least some within the MB leadership have reportedly opposed cooperation with Nasirites (Rose Al-Yusuf, 31 May 1993, Al-Yasar, February 1994)--anathema to many Brothers who recall the long years (mid-1950s to 1970) of brutal oppression of MB leaders by the late President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir and abhor the Nasirites' secular orientation. Complicating any assessment of prospects for the continuation of the alliance--even following a change in the electoral law--are the conflicting indications of the extent to which the MB has succeeded in taking control of the SLP party structure. Officials from both groups--but particularly the MB--often stress that they remain separate organizations. For example, al-Hudaybi was quoted as claiming that "there has never been a merger between the Brothers and the [Socialist Labor] party or a taking over of the party by the MB." Moreover, he pointed to what he claimed was SLP support for the regimes of Iraq's Saddam Husayn and Libya's Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi--regimes which the MB strongly opposes--as evidence of their separate identities (Al-Ahram international edition, 22 January). The very ability of the SLP to participate in the dialogue with NDP officials over MB objections appears to confirm al-Hudaybi's claims. Nonetheless, the SLP's Barakat acknowledged in his mid-January statements to Al-Ahram that "there did take place a certain merger of the organizational structures [of the two parties] in some areas," saying that it is "necessary to make this clarification publicly" and that "there is no embarrassment in that." In addition, the state-owned but relatively independent anti-fundamentalist weekly Rose Al-Yusuf claimed in a detailed report on SLP internal elections that, while the SLP leadership has attempted in some respects to curb the MB's influence in the party, the Brothers were increasingly taking over leadership positions in the SLP organizational structure. It claimed that "many" MB members "have spread throughout the party institutions" and that 28 of them had become members of the party's 45-member Executive Bureau (31 May 1993). Implications While the government's contemplation of a reversion to the proportional party slate system may be motivated largely by an interest in strengthening discipline among the NDP deputies, it may also be driven in part by a desire to drive a wedge in the Islamic Alliance and thus limit the organization's potential advances in the next elections. While such a change, if it materializes, might ultimately be extremely modest in light of constitutional constraints, Al-Hudaybi's expressed concern suggests that the Brotherhood itself assumes that it can only be hurt by the change--notwithstanding indications of growing MB domination of the SLP structure. The MB probably also fears that if the government is considering restoring a party slate system for parliamentary elections, it may also be determined not to abandon entirely the current party slate system governing local council elections--even in the face of the expected court ruling against the current system. BOX Brotherhood and SLP Leaders Exchange Bitter Words In his 11 January article, al-Hudaybi expressed astonishment at the reported agreement by five opposition political parties, including the SLP, to engage in a "national dialogue" with the ruling NDP that would exclude, at least initially, MB representatives as well as other parties and political organizations. "We say clearly that these six parties do not represent anyone but themselves," he asserted. In a separate box, he sharply criticized 'Adil Husayn for his 7 January account of a meeting on the national dialogue between the SLP and the NDP, accusing Husayn of ignoring MB interests. Although Husayn's account stressed the SLP's insistence on political reform, al- Hudaybi noted accurately: "You repeatedly said that the elections should be held with the participation of what you called the legal parties. You did not say one word about the need to recognize other political forces, notably the MB." Claiming that the SLP would not have reached the People's Assembly through the elections of 1987 without its MB partners, al-Hudaybi asserted that their joint campaign slogan--"Islam is the Solution"--was "originally an MB slogan." Responding to al-Hudaybi, Husayn took issue with both the substance and tone of his criticisms, claiming that "those who do not wish for the good fortune of the Islamic Alliance were gladdened by what you published." He claimed that, by signing the joint opposition statement welcoming the national dialogue, the MB had agreed to allow itself to be represented initially by the SLP. (According to its text, that statement asserted that the dialogue "must be conducted, at least during its first phase, among the parties and political forces through their leaders or accredited representatives"--a point stressed by Husayn.) Husayn took particular objection to al-Hudaybi's claim that the slogan "Islam is the Solution" was taken from the MB, saying "it is the slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every age" and that the SLP had used it prior to the formation of the Islamic Alliance. Expressing objection to the "tone" of the article from "beginning to end," Husayn concluded: "The enemies of Islam are lying in wait for its proponents and concocting plots and sedition. We must be wary and vigilant....I pray that God will clear up the differences between you and me according to righteousness. May this chapter be closed." END BOX (AUTHOR: BROWN.
