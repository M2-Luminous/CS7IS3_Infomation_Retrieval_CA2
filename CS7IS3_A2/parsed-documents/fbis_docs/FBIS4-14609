They discussed in detail all issues of concern to society, Rybkin told INTERFAX. Rybkin said Yeltsin had given him the draft agreement on civil accord in Russia which was still being worked on. Rybkin pointed out that no terms had as yet been announced for signing the document. He added that there was no reason for hastily working out the agreement since it was very important. He stressed that a large number of socially significant institutions were to sign it -- political parties, religious denominations, the government, trade unions, the president and the Federal Assembly chambers. Rybkin said the draft agreement would be considered by the State Duma's Council next Monday. Thereafter, it is to be considered by the parliamentary factions and only then will it be submitted at a plenary session of the State Duma. Commenting on the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the establishment of a Eurasian union, Rybkin emphasized that the single economic space already provided for similar legislation in this sphere. Serious efforts by the CIS Parliamentary Assembly are needed to bring the legislation together and some new institution like the one which exists in the European Union, a kind of common parliament, may be needed. Such a parliament is necessary as a body which will coordinate activities of countries seeking closer economic cooperation. However, Rybkin believes that the proposal on the introduction of a single currency on the territory of the Eurasian Union put forward by Nazarbayev is preliminary. Rybkin repeated that national currency units existed in the EU [European Union] together with the single currency unit -- the ECU -- and that this model must not be ignored.
