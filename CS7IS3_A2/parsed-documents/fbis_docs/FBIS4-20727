When MAYU went to factory owners and managers, they stated that these problems were pulling them back and not pushing them ahead, hampering production and leading to marketing difficulties and increased prices. In 10th of Ramadan City, Mustafa Fahmi, owner of the Egypt-Italy Business Machines Factory, said: "We have many bureaucratic problems in the administrative system of 10th of Ramadan City. For example, the administration asked for 14,000 pounds as surety for the building, although the license is sound and the buildings conform to specifications. This cripples the investor at a time when he is paying taxes and insurance payments." He added: "We suffer from the lack of a transportation network inside and outside the industrial city. This makes it very difficult to transport workers and market the product. It creates burdens that lead to increased prices." He indicated that the shortage of trained hands forces him to turn to Italian expertise to hold continuous courses to train workers in modern equipment and advanced technology. Bureaucracy Engineer Majid al-Sa'dani, director of the TCL industrial cleanser factory in 10th of Ramadan City, said that the city administration treats people in a disturbingly bureaucratic manner. It asks factory owners to do things that are unreasonable from the point of view of market mechanisms. He added: "I suffer from a shortage of skilled workers, but I am trying to overcome it by training trade school certificate holders for at least two years so that one can rely on them." He indicated that industrial surveillance was hindering investment and creating obstacles. For example, it was asking for the scientific names of imported raw materials in Arabic, when all the raw materials used in industrial cleansers were imported and were difficult to write in Arabic. It was demanding an official photograph and fingerprints from the factory owner and the warehouse manager and a specification of the area of the warehouse, even though a license and tax card had already been obtained. This had a negative effect on investment operations. He said that the company had been forced to turn to freight companies to handle the completion of customs procedures because of complications by minor officials. Problems, Production Requisites Sayyid Muharram, chief of accounts at the Modern Textiles Manufacturing Company (Montex), said: "We have many problems because of high duties on the already expensive imported raw materials that constitute more than 90 percent of production requisites. This prevents us from competing with the foreign product." He said that the shortage of skilled labor was leading to a struggle between different factories to attract skilled workers. Workers therefore did not settle down, which in turn affected production. Sayyid Muharram demanded protection for the Egyptian producer and consumer and the provision of favorable conditions for the Egyptian producer, as takes place overseas. He indicated that the obstacles to domestic production must be overcome in order to attract more capital to invest in Egypt and participate in solving the unemployment problem. Housing, Transportation 'Umar al-Faruq 'Abd-al-'Aziz, a member of the authorized board of directors at the Dana Ready-Made Clothing Factory, agreed with this view. He stated that the most important problem facing 10th of Ramadan City was the lack of workers residing in the city. The factory has 140 workers, only four of whom live in the city; the rest live outside the city. The factory pays large amounts of money to transport them to and from the factory. This is because housing located in the city is expensive. The down payment on a medium-sized apartment is 5,000 pounds, while the monthly installment is 196 pounds over 20 years. He called for extending the Cairo-Suez railroad line to 10th of Ramadan City and suggested that factory owners contribute to this to solve the work force problem. He indicated that duties must be lowered on accessories for ready-made clothing, as these were requirements needed to enable competition with the foreign product. The chemist Mustafa al-Hinnawi, owner of Gold Star Leather Company, declared that production in large factories was threatened with stoppage because of small factories that were proliferating haphazardly in small rooms and were manufacturing certain chemicals without conforming to standard specifications. Indeed, they were mixing the chemicals with other substances and affixing trademarks to them, thereby causing the domestic consumer to prefer the local product [original text language; writer probably meant "imported product"] to them, thus threatening national industry. Combatting Commercial Fraud Mustafa al-Hinnawi called for deterrent punishments to combat commercial fraud and imitation. Such firms should be shut down and confiscated. Their licenses, if they had any, should be rescinded, as is done in European countries. He stressed that importers of production requisites should be exempted from duties, so that national industry could compete with imports. A sales tax should be added to the flat-rate tax, to help lower costs. Mahmud Ghunaym, owner of a textiles factory at al-Qanatir al-Khayriyah, said that small factories suffered from lack of funding and therefore could not carry out replacement and modernization operations due to the high cost of loans--24 percent of the loan's value. Factory owners therefore are inhibited from replacing their old equipment with new modern equipment that would help increase production, improve quality, and lower the price over the long term. Hajj Kamal 'Abd-al-Basit, owner of a factory in al-Sharabiyah, asserted that 12 different kinds of taxes are levied on textile factories. The product is therefore encumbered with burdens that lead to high prices and difficulty in marketing at home and abroad. He noted that in the last 10 years thread prices had risen 250 percent over 1980 prices. In addition, the business sector had abandoned the policy of operating private weaving plants at its own expense by the method of providing the plants with thread and taking delivery of the cloth at a fixed rate--not to mention the irregular deliveries of many varieties of high quality thread to private factories. All these things affected work and the overseas contracts of these factories. 'Abd-al-Fattah Salim, owner of a textiles factory in Shubra al-Khaymah, said: "The main problem is a shortage of trained technical workers. The big factories attract these workers with high salaries that we cannot pay." He asked that trade schools train their students in the technical principles of textile manufacturing by practical, rather than theoretical, training in the factories next to the schools. Muhsin 'Abd-al-Jawad, owner of a factory in Shubra al-Khaymah, indicated that the high price of production requisites, electricity, taxes, and duties had led to high prices on products. It was thus impossible to market the product, especially in view of the intense competition with large factories that can market their product. He urged the state to concern itself with opening outlets to market the production of small factories. Fadil Mustafa Abu-Sinnah, director of a tannery, spoke about how problems arose from their not being allowed to import goat and cattle skins unobtainable in the country. He said that if these varieties were imported, excellently made shoes and genuine leather goods would be available at low prices. He added: "We are suffering from lack of chemical factories that specialize in dyes, even though some engineers specialized in this field are working in this industry in overseas factories."
