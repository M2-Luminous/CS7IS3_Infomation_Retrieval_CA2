Mr. Dhlakama has been shunned by many regional leaders since the peace pact in 1992 ended the 16-year-old civil war between Renamo and the Mozambican government. A report from Harare quotes a Mozambican official as saying that President Robert Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano have appealed to African leaders to put aside their hostility towards Mr. Dhlakama to promote peace in southern Africa.
