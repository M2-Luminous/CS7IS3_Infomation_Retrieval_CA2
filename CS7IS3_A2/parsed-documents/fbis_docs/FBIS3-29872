Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard met for 90 minutes and were expected to resume talks after a break, but they did not, the officials said. The meeting reportedly ended early when North Korea demanded that the terms of the Pyongyang-Washington agreement be written down on paper. American officials said they needed to consult among themselves on whether to accept the demand. Pyongyang and Washington reportedly negotiated the accord's details, specifically how and when the two Koreas will reopen dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States will announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. The U.S. State Department maintains that around the time that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume. After that, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be announced. Seoul officials said that despite repeated promises by Washington on these terms, Pyongyang wants a more concrete commitment. The two sides are not expected to exchange official documents on the agreement they are working on, but are likely to write down the accord's major points on non-official paper, they said. Although North Korea and the United States will meet again on Thursday, final and immediate agreement cannot be expected since the North Korean negotiators need time to consult with their home government, according to the officials. Chances are, therefore, that the IAEA inspection team will arrive in Pyongyang next Monday since the only remaining flight to Pyongyang from Beijing is this Saturday.
