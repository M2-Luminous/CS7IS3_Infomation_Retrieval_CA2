[Chornovil] On the contrary. Each party nominated its own candidates. We are accused of ignoring the agreement and printing up our own list of candidates. That is not true. We looked for an agreement with each district and achieved one with some districts. In places where we did not reach an agreement we did indeed publish our own list. Many other parties did this as well. But our list included not only Rukh members but also Konstantin Morozov, Volodymyr Lanovyy, and certain members of the URP [Ukrainian Republic Party]... From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting on 16 April: "Our modest results seem more significant against the background of the collapse of other noncommunist parties. The URP, which ran almost as many candidates in the elections as we did, gained only nine mandates, the PDVU [Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine]--five, the Democratic Party--three, Peasant Democrats--the same, and Social Democrats--two. And the leaders of all these parties except the Democratic Party lost. And if the loss of certain parties can be explained by the embryonic stage of their existence and their lack of ramified structures, the losses of the structurally stronger organizations with KNDS [Committee of National Democratic Forces] leanings must be attributed to the conciliatory policy of this party's leaders toward the ruling postcommunist nomenklatura." [Chornovil] ...at the same time, for example, the nominee from the oblast URP conference ran against me. He did not even get 1 percent. This fact in itself is instructive because the Rukh conferences did not run candidates against either the chairman of the URP, Mykhaylo Horyn, or against the leaders of other parties included in the democratic association Ukraina. It is clear to everyone today that this association was created out of one political force--the so-called KNDS, the nucleus of which is the URP. This party rallied around itself organizations which had no influence on the elections, but it wanted very much to create the appearance of a large association. Demonstrating our desire for unity and hoping that common sense will win out over ambition, we too joined this association. But it turned out that this association needed Rukh only for financial aid. As soon as it received this aid, everything possible was done to isolate Rukh within the framework of this association. The apparatus of Ukraina was formed mainly from URP members. They even accepted people we had fired from the Rukh secretariat because of their poor work. There were simply scandalous things, such as when they asked us to withdraw our strong candidates in favor of certain very questionable people. That is, weak but ambitious organizations wanted to take advantage of Rukh's structures under the shield of the Ukraina association to campaign for candidates who were known to be losers. Sometimes URP simply took candidates off the street... It was very insulting to see how the association's chairman, Levko Lukyanenko, forgetting about his "objectivity" and "freedom from party affiliation," traveled to the areas of Ternopol or Ivano-Frankov and campaigned for the candidates from the URP and against the candidates from Rukh, slinging mud all over me: Do not think about voting for so and so because he will be on Chornovil's team, and Chornovil is in favor of the collapse of the state and for two state languages. And what then? After this kind of "campaigning" the chairman of the oblast URP organization, who had a certain chance, lost to our candidate Andrey Zarudnyy. [Rukh-press] Do you agree that Galicia produced almost 15 votes from the extreme right? [Chornovil] Not 15. The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] ran under right-wing nationalist slogans, thinking they stood to gain something from that. But the KUN has repeatedly announced its support for democratic nationalism. So barely seven deputies from the KUN can be regarded as at the extreme right. Actually, there will be only six extreme right-wingers in the Supreme Council--three from the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense] and two from the UKRP (Stepan Khmara and another Khmara supporter, and even he is fairly moderate). On the other hand, Galicia produced a fair number of moderate candidates. The largest numbers of mandates were received by candidates from Rukh--Yaroslav Kendzyor, Mikhail Kosiv, Oleh Lavrinovich, Les Tanyuk, Bogdan Boyko, Boris Kozhin, Andrey Zarudnyy, and others. Both Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk were elected in Galicia along with other centrist politicians. [Rukh-press] Repeat elections will be held in 112 districts. Do you hold out the hope that the democratic forces will still unite in order to acquire approximately 10 more mandates? [Chornovil] We must look at things realistically. What are "democratic forces"? If democracy is a matter of bringing one another to our knees then I am against it. We have already exhibited that kind of "democracy".... [Rukh-press] Radio Liberty and UTN have reported that you supported Ivan Plyushch's candidacy for the post of president... [Chornovil] This "gift" was foisted off on us by the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty without checking the information received from Russian sources. We have not supported anyone yet. Rukh did not nominate its own candidate since it considers presidential elections unnecessary until the functions and status of the president are determined. Incidentally, it is apparent from the elections to the Supreme Council that we can significantly influence the course of the presidential campaign. We not only put through 30 of our own candidates but also stopped several dozen of the most odious communist candidates, sometimes at the price of allowing our own candidates to lose... From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting on 16 April: "I think that today the most dangerous enemies of the Ukrainian state and hence enemies of Rukh are not even the communists, who are living out their historical age through inertia, fed by the blind social protest of the eastern regions. Our biggest enemy today is the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR] headed by Kuchma-Grinev, who are not yet very well known to everyone. They are closely linked to the local nomenklatura, they have funds and support, including propaganda, from Russia, and they exploit pro-Russian slogans, which are very popular in the eastern part of Ukraine today. Finally, they have a leader who knows what he wants: to seize power. And when it comes to this they have no concern about either methods or people, surrounding themselves with people who are not without talent but who are cynical and greedy and who would sell not only Ukraine but even their own mothers for the sake of Mammon and power. In a year or two this political force, which is not very appreciable today (incidentally, its leader is bucking for the presidency...) could become the strongest anti-Ukrainian grouping in our state. And we must oppose this MBR wave, like the communists, today, since tomorrow will be too late." [Rukh-press] Many people accuse you of being on the side of Leonid Kravchuk, who is also against early presidential elections... [Chornovil] Is it not possible for our positions to converge at some point? This still does not mean that we are not in opposition to the president. It is simply that Kravchuk is thinking correctly in this case. His motives are another matter. He does not want to leave his chair and we do not want to fight for an empty chair. Nobody has abolished the laws of formal logic. Either for Kravchuk or for Chornovil. ...But--it is not the same for me.
