He deems them imminent because they will release the piled-up but deferred inflationary potential in the fixed prices of electric power and fuels. Mr. Avramov does not expect hyperinflation. "I am hopeful the main levers of the economic policy will not defeat each other as was the case in 1993," he says. In an interview in today's DUMA, Mr. Avramov attaches particular importance to income indexing. "Automatic indexing was the main culprit for tying the cabinet's hands in the field of budgetary policies and for the high deficit," he comments. Mr. Avramov thinks possible outside funding will be of prime importance throughout the year as the country was placed in total economic isolation. He also points to other important events, like the entry into force in April of the VAT [value-added tax] Act, which is expected to entail a single price rise and will restructure the tax base of the budget. Asked whether the monetarist model will have to be corrected, Mr. Avramov says the Bulgarian model is not a monetarist one "either as an ideology or least as real policies." "State-run enterprises are still functioning without fixed budget restrictions, though a great number of them have practically gone bankrupt," the deputy chairman of the Agency for Economic Coordination and Development explains.
