FR940425-1-00002 FR940425-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Federal Crop Insurance Corporation 7 CFR Part 406 Nursery Crop Regulations AGENCY: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) proposes to amend the Nursery Crop Insurance regulations, effective for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, by making a change in the policy to clarify the method of determining loss. The Nursery policy contains the term ``said damaged crop'' which has been interpreted, in some forums, to refer to the specific damaged portion of the crop instead of the unit as was the intent. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before May 25, 1994 to be sure of consideration. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning this proposed regulation should be addressed to Mari L. Dunleavy, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, 14th and Independence NW., Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mari Dunleavy, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 14th and Independence NW., Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1. This action does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of the regulations affected by this rule under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is October 1, 1997. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this interim rule can be found in 7 CFR part 400, subpart H. It has been determined under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that the policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. Kenneth D. Ackerman, Manager, FCIC, has certified to the OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought. This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. This proposed rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it is not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The effect of this rule is to clarify procedures already in use by reinsured companies and crop insurance agents. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 406 Crop insurance, Nursery.
