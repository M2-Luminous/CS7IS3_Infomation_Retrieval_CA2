FBIS4-5896 "dreas073_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 South Korea Seoul Withdraws Demand on Exchange of Envoys Seoul Withdraws Demand on Exchange of Envoys SK1504015994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0152 GMT 15 Apr 94 SK1504015994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government announced Friday it has decided to withdraw unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as a condition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with Washington. The decision represents a major concession by South Korea and the United States and will likely raise the pressure on North Korea to allow additional checks of its nuclear facilities. The government also said it will accept all North Korean escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia wishing to settle here. The deputy prime minister and head of the National Unification Board (NUB), Yi Yong-tok, made the announcement following a meeting of cabinet ministers concerned with reunification and national security policy. "The government has determined that it was practically impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through an exchange of special envoys," since North Korea has clearly shown that it has no intention of doing so, he said. Consequently, the government has decided against pushing the envoy exchange as a condition for a third round of U.S.- North Korea high-level talks any longer, Yi explained. "However, there is no change in the government's position that the nuclear problem will have to be resolved above everything else," he said. "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for mutual and simultaneous inspections of each other's nuclear facilities based on the joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Yi said. The deputy prime minister added that IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] checks of North Korea's nuclear sites will also have to be realized soon. With regard to North Korean loggers, Yi said the government, based on humanitarian grounds, has decided to accept all escapees seeking asylum in the South after following the proper legal procedures. Seoul has received a promise from the Russian Government on the matter, he said, adding that concerned South Korean ministries would take early steps to accept them. Based on the decision, the government is expected to discuss a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks and other problems related to the nuclear issue when Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, arrives in Seoul Friday. "The United States' talks with Pyongyang are linked with inter- Korean dialogue," Yi said. Therefore, any decisions on U.S.-North Korean negotiations will be made in close consultation between Washington and Seoul, Yi said. The deputy prime minister, however, hinted that inter-Korean dialogue besides the special envoy exchange would not be a condition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. Meanwhile, the government is expected to hold a working-level meeting of Foreign Ministry, Chongwadae [presidential office] and National Unification Board officials Friday afternoon to discuss ways to accommodate North Korean loggers seeking asylum in the South.
