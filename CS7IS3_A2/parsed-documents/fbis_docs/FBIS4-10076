Documents proving this remittance were seized at Casto de Andrade's fortress. Rio de Janeiro Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia said: "The numbers game is no longer just the game that so many people enjoy; it is a mask behind which several forms of organized crime hide." Attorneys examining the numbers game kingpins' accounts have also found that in January 1993, Castor de Andrade deposited $500,000 in the Swiss Banks Association. Biscaia said: "The numbers game has been used to permeate crime throughout society, by bribing policemen and judges, by supporting samba groups and soccer teams, and even by financing politicians' electoral campaigns." These accounting books list sums paid to several candidates and contributions to political campaigns. Biscaia said: "It is all written down in the books, even the $100,000 given to a major candidate."
