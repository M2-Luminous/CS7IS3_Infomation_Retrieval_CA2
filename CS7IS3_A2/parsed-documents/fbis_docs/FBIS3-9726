On the eve of its third anniversary, the EBRD, which was founded to help rebuild Eastern and Central European economies after the fall of communism, continues to be a source of controversy in the Czech financial community. In the wake of a recent flurry of EBRD investment in this country, many bankers are hoping they can gain backing. The forum, to be held March 21-23, should allow them to do some networking for loans. But behind the scenes, other bankers and economists question the value of the EBRD's activities here. "The EBRD is completely useless," said Vladimir Benacek, an associate professor at the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education. Since 1991, the EBRD has poured 384.3 million ECU ($430.4 million, or about 12 billion Kc) of loan guarantees and direct investment into the Czech Republic, the fifth highest total out of the 25 countries funded by the bank. But much of that money has been earmarked for big-ticket projects that would be attractive to any multinational bank, involving such business partners as Nestle and Air France. "Why was it created? These are very safe deals--no risk and high profit," Benacek said, implying that the EBRD is acting like any other big bank rather than living up to its mandate to help build a market economy. The EBRD has also drawn fire from other members of the banking community. "There's too much bureaucracy, their demands for documentation are too high, and they move much too slowly," said Pavel Strnad of Vienna-based Raiffeisenbank. The EBRD is reluctant to answer its critics. A bank official who agreed to an interview only when guaranteed anonymity defended the EBRD's investment policies. "A complaint we've had is we seem to be only interested in joint ventures and that we don't seem to be interested in Czech companies," the official said. But he blamed the level of loans on the companies themselves, saying they often fail to present detailed business proposals, the key to securing financing. "Many Czech companies can't give us what we need," he said. "They should be better prepared." With parliament's enactment of new auditing laws last year, he added, business plans are slowly improving. As to complaints of bureaucracy and slow decision making, the bank official said that "it can slow things down" when the input of 50 governments is needed. In addition, each potential project must undergo a rigorous and often lengthy environmental assessment before winning EBRD approval. The EBRD was founded in 1991 when 39 countries and 15 other founding members forked over $5.5 billion to create a financial promoter of free-market economics and democracy. The London-based bank's first year, however, was plagued with scandal. In 1992, the EBRD disbursed only $146 million in loans and investments, roughly half what it spent on operating costs. In what became known as "Marblegate," the bank spent $1.1 million to replace the travertine marble in its opulent headquarters with Carrara marble. "They invested much more in their marble than in Eastern Europe," Benacek said. Former EBRD President Jacques Attali, who resigned last June, was the target of much of the criticism. Since taking over in November, de Larosiere has reorganized the bank and stepped up the level of funding. Indeed, 75 percent of the total EBRD money allocated to the Czech Republic--288.2 million ECU ($322.8 million)--was guaranteed in the last five months. That leap in investment has fueled optimism in several Czech banks. Jaroslav Kroh, general manager of international banking at Komercni banka, is busy courting EBRD officials about several proposals. As chairman of the Clearing Bank Association, an Eastern and Central European organization, Kroh is lobbying the EBRD to act as a "corrector," extending risk limits for association members. In addition, the EBRD may be interested in Komercni itself. To build its capital base, Komercni will issue 2 billion Kc ($66 million) worth of shares by the end of April. An EBRD source said his bank is waiting for final approval from the head office to buy stock. "I believe it is a good sign," said Kroh. "Of course, there is a small danger. Someone can say if the EBRD has given [Komercni] an equity injection, it can't be so good." Meanwhile, officials at Investicni a postovni banka are hoping the EBRD can extend their export financing credit line and help fund a waste-disposal center in Oslavany, near Brno. Pavel Linhart, senior director of foreign exchange and project financing at Investicni a postovni, said both projects fall well within the mandate of the EBRD. Miroslav Klima, Investicni a postovni's head of export financing, said that he had met the EBRD's leading local representative but added that "one man cannot cover all the projects under way." Nevertheless, the recent increase in funding levels has led to "some modest signs of optimism" in the local banking community, said Ivan Angelis, secretary general of the Association of Banks. But, like many others in the industry, Angelis said he will wait for results before drawing his conclusions. "We shall have to wait and see," he said.
