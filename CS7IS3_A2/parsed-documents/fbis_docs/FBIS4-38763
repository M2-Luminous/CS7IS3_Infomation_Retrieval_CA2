Russian viewers have been left without sports, educational, cultural, and children's programs. Their small screens only come on at 1800 hours. The local authorities say that the two television companies owe the republic's Ministry of Communications 1 billion rubles for the use of 250 relay stations. Many Moscow newspapers stopped being printed in Uzbekistan even earlier, and you cannot find anything in the local kiosks now apart from TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. The "literary monthly" journals are not arriving either. For three years now there has not been a single theater, singer, or group from Russia on tour even in Tashkent. Television was the only salvation from a total cultural vacuum. Ostankino undoubtedly still has the highest rating in the republic. A recent sociological poll showed that the other channels broadcasting in Uzbek and Turkish get just a third of the viewers, at best. It is presumably the popularity of Russian television that irritates the primitive jingoists who see Ostankino as almost "subversive." Another story has it that local television personnel are interested in cutting Ostankino in order to "make a killing" out of the advertising profits. Typically the problem of Ostankino is not even being discussed in the local press. This is a clear sign, as is the custom in Uzbekistan, that top mandarins have had a hand in the decision to cut back broadcasting. Viewers in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] picketed the republic's television and radio company, the government immediately backpedaled and switched on Moscow television right away.
