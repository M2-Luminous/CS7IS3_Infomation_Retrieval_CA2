In this connection, our correspondent interviewed Turar Koychiyev, president of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Turar Koychiyev, what do you think about President Akayev's decision to hold the referendum? [Koychiyev] I think it is a necessary step. We are building democracy in our society, and I think that Akayevich is absolutely correct because it is a very important political question. The president needs to know the public's opinion. Our reform process seems to be developing. The path chosen for our development is diametrically opposed to what we had before. I think we passed one important stage in these three years and are finding ourselves at the second stage of our social and economic development. Our president is doing his best to improve the situation in the country. On 30 January, those who want (?equality) and prosperity for Kyrgyzstan should support President Akayev's policy.
