On January 24, the Yugoslav Government began implementing its monetary system reconstruction and economic stabilization program. A new dinar, fully backed by gold and foreign exchange, was issued in stead of the old inflationary dinar. Payment operations of the F.R.Y. with the RSK and the RS have not been discontinued in the meanwhile, but were carried out in old dinars. As it was announced, the RSK government will at the session of its parliament on Tuesday suggest the urgent adoption of laws and regulations which will make possible the RSK's joining of the single payments system with the F.R.Y. RSK Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic said the greatest difficulties are expected in the implementation of tax policy measures and in the domain of customs. The RSK was proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas in Croatia in 1991 in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation and its attempt to downgrade the status of the Serbian people to one of national minority. It has been a U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992. The RS was set up by Serbs in 1992 on their ethnical and historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina. Since Monday, February 28, the RS has been in the single payments system with the F.R.Y., Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic said. "The republican government has harmonized and adopted all provisions from the F.R.Y.'s monetary system reconstruction and economic revival program," Lukic said. It is now only a matter of technique, he added, when the new Yugoslav dinar will appear as the only means of payment in the RS.
