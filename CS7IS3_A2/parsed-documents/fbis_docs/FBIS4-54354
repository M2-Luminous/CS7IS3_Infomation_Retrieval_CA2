Among the 10 legislators were Katsuhiko Shirakawa, a House of Representatives member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the biggest opposition party, and Seiichi Kaneta, also a lower house member of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the No. 2 opposition group. The participants said they expect the new group to help establish a liberal government. They criticized the ruling coalition for practicing "totalitarian, high-handed way of management." Meanwhile, the ruling coalition said they have agreed to allow two SDPJ members and two former members of the Japan New Party (JNP) to take part in its policy forum teams. The JNP led by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is one of the ruling parties. The four are Masanori Goto and Churyo Morii both of the SDPJ, and Seiji Maehara and Yukio Edano, who bolted from the JNP. They will join in the capacity of individuals, coalition officials said.
