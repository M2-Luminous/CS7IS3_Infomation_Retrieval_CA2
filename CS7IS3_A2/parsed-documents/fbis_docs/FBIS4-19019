"There is a danger of infiltration, even by the Mafia," she said, adding: "I am worried.... Some names ring warning bells," referring to names of people who have recently joined the Forza Italia Clubs. Parenti, who worked as a junior investigator in the Milan corruption scandals before entering politics, declined to say which names caused her to fear that the Mafia may be trying to infiltrate the party, which has displaced the Christian Democrats and the Socialists as the new top gun of Italian politics. She recommended doing background checks on all those who join the Clubs, stressing that the so-called anti-Mafia Certification, a bureaucratic statement indicating that an individual has no criminal record, "may not be enough." Aside from organized crime, some discredited politicians who were ousted from power by corruption scandals and by the recent elections may try to reenter politics through the back door of the Forza Italia Clubs, Parenti also warned. "The Clubs," she said, "must be checked and rechecked to make sure they are formed by people who want to do clean politics. The clubs have been used as a way of coalescing people but thorough controls have not been possible until now because of the speed with which they were organzied throughout the country. But now is the time to watch carefully." Parenti admitted she knew of no specific cases of Mafia members joining the Clubs, but she said Berlusconi, too was "concerned." Berlusconi however denied categorically that organized crime could be connected in any way to his support Clubs. "I rule out, for all I know, infiltrations by the Mafia in our movement," Berlusconi claimed. "I don't see any convenience by anyone linked to these organizations in having members inside Forza Italia Clubs," which "for the time being" have no political influence, he added. Berlusconi reiterated his campaign promise that Forza Italia will fight organized crime and will do "more effectively than has been done so far."
