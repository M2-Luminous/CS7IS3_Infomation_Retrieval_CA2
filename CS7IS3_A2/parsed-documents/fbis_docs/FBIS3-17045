This is what I endeavored to tell our British partners in the current meetings and talks on the banks of the Thames, Republic of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed in a brief interview with PRAVDA. Answering my question about the extent to which official London is interested in the effect of the "Russian factor" on the situation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, the high-ranking guest from Alma-Ata [Almaty] noted that this question is not very indicative of current moods in Whitehall. The British leadership is making no secret of the fact that in recent days the spectrum of its priority interests has noticeably shifted in the direction of the conflicting opinions and political priorities in Moscow's corridors of power, and of general forecasts concerning the immediate future of the vast part of the planet which only recently was a united Union. In this context, Nazarbayev stated later on, I have already said many times what I want to repeat now: Yes, we need very close integration. Integration which is real and lasting, unlike now. Incidentally, the CIS must eventually become different from what it is now. Not loose and amorphous but highly effective, in line with the scale of the tasks facing all of us.
