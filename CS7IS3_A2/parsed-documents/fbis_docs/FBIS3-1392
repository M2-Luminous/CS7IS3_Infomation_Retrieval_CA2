FBIS3-1392 "drafr059_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA 14 Killed, 50 Injured MB2803114094 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1100 GMT 28 Mar 94 MB2803114094 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] At least 14 people have been killed and 50 injured during violent incidents linked to a march by thousands of Zulus in the Johannesburg city center. The police said the injuries ranged from gunshot wounds to serious hack- and stab wounds. Reporters at the scene have described scenes of chaos, with several bodies lying in the streets. Police say thousands of people are still streaming into the city to join the march. The march is to protest against next month's elections, and to show support for a Zulu kingdom. The marchers apparently plan to proceed towards the offices of the Independent Electoral Commission. Business in the CBD [central business district] has come to a complete halt, and the Johannesburg Traffic Department has advised motorists to avoid the city center. People in office blocks have been advised to remain inside the buildings. We have just heard that the police have returned the fire of shots which were fired from rooftops in the city center a short while ago. Several people appear to have been hit by gunfire. Another report says that at least five people were shot dead and eight wounded when Zulu marchers engaged ANC [African National Congress] security guards at the ANC's Shell House head office in Plein Street. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA [SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION] that there had been attempts by armed men to enter the building. He said security guards at Shell House had fired warning shots in the air, but were forced to open fire in self-defense.
