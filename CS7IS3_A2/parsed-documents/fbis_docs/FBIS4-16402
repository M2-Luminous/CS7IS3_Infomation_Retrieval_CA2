Thus, the fleet is Russian even with regard to its means of existence, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists after a news conference given by the CIS leaders. There can be no question of paying rent in this case, the army general stressed. Moreover, in these conditions Ukraine's security in the Black Sea is being provided at Russia's expense. Asked by journalists whether there has been any change in the top military circles' attitude to President Bill Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative, Grachev said: "Until very recently I was an active supporter of signing the proposed U.S. concept very quickly. The recent development of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, has shown that that the concept proposed by the U.S. President is good only in words. We have gained the impression that our 'partners' are acting behind our backs. I am not afraid to change my opinion if I have been mistaken," the Russian defense minister said in conclusion, "and I have now changed it."
