He said he had communicated his decision to African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday morning. The state of emergency would come into operation as soon as the necessary regulations were published. Mr de Klerk was of the opinion that the state of emergency was necessary because circumstances in the region threatened public safety. Ordinary law was inadequate to ensure pulic order, he said. Mr de Klerk told a news conference at the Union Buildings that negotiations with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr Buthelezi should continue despite the decision to declare a state of emergency over kwaZulu/Natal. Mr de Klerk said it was important that the position of the Zulu monarch should be accommodated constitutionally. He was of the opinion that the state of emergency would create the opportunity to find solutions, and that it would bring about an atmosphere that would facilitate free and fair elections. He declined to say how Mr Buthelezi and Mr Mandela had reacted to his decision, saying they would respond themselves. President de Klerk said the state of emergency, which would apply to Natal, including the self-governing area of kwaZulu, would see a substantial increase in security force manpower levels in the province. However, Mr Buthelezi would remain chief minister and run his own administration. Mr de Klerk also said the election would continue on the scheduled dates of April 26-28, and there was no need for the South African public to panic. Sufficient numbers of security forces would be deployed in South Africa to ensure law and order, and government would not allow anarchy to develop. He said there was no need for people to store up food as though they were preparing for a siege. Mr de Klerk said he envisaged that the state of of emergency regulations, which were still being drafted, would provide for stricter control of marches, public meetings, and would provide for the detention of people. There would also be "some form of prohibition" on the carrying of weapons, but this was still subject to discussion. It went without saying that there would be good co-operation between the South African security forces and the kwaZulu Police. The actual management of the state of emergency would be left in the hands of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the police. He said had the state of emergency not been declared, there would have been a serious deterioration in the security situation in kwaZulu/Natal. There were strategies from more than one side towards destabilisation, he said. He did not foresee a need for the call-up of additional part-time SADF members. Mr de Klerk said no date had yet been set for the meeting between himself, Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, and the Zulu king. Mr de Klerk was accompanied to the news conference by Justice and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee, a police General van der Merwe, and the chief of the army, Gen H Pretorius. Mr de Klerk said the state of emergency may be promulgated later on Thursday. He had only decided to declare the state of emergency on Thursday morning, and only he, as head of government and head of state, could declare a state of emergency. The decision was not initiated by any outside party or institution. The perception that the state of emergency had been ordered or requested by an outside source was wrong, he said. It had not been taken at the behest of the Transitional Executive Council, but on the advise and analysis of the government's intelligence services and security advisers. It was also wrong to see the development as a first step towards destabilising the kwaZulu government. The decision had nothing to do with any such goal, said Mr de Klerk. "I will only make inroads on their authority if there is maladministration and i have no evidence of that." He would also intervene if the kwaZulu government did not co-operate in making free and fair elections possible, but the kwaZulu government was giving its full co-operation in this regard. The state of emergency would help to protect the kwaZulu government against any threats or efforts to destablise its position, Mr de Klerk said. Action in terms of the state of emergency would be taken against anybody involved in any actions which constituted a threat to the security of kwaZulu/Natal, or a threat of violence, he said. Free and fair elections in the region would be compatible with the state of emergency, because free political activity and meetings would be allowed. But advance notice would be required in terms of the regulations, Mr de Klerk said. The declaration was made in terms of the legal prescriptions for interaction with the TEC, he added. The declaration would also enable the IFP to be free to continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, Mr de Klerk said. The state of emergency would see the deployment, on an incremental basis, of fairly large numbers of SADF [South African Defense Force] troops. In terms of the law the state of emergency would apply for a year but it would be lifted as soon as circumstances permitted. Mr de Klerk said the regulations might affect the freedom of the press. "It might, I do not know of any specific regulations in the draft regulations at this time. In the past it has. I do not think that the press has anything to fear however in this regard." Mr de Klerk had considered also placing the Witwatersrand, where unrest areas had been declared, under a state of emergency. "I would not say that it is probable that at this stage parts of the Witwatersrand would also be changed to a state of emergency, but we will continue to keep a close watch."
