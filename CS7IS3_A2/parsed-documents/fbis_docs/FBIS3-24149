A study of the post-Soviet space recently made by Andranik Migranyan in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA is based on a clearly expressed pragmatic concept defining real geopolitical interests of the current moment as well as interests that are not common but primarily Russian. Naturally, with such an approach the specific concept of "the near abroad" may be determined only with application to Russia. At the same time Migranyan's study is dominated by thinking characteristic of contemporary Russian political scientists: whatever is good for Russia is good for all, and Russia is the CIS. It is possible that this sense of succession and responsibility prevailed over a falsely conceived imperial guilt complex with political escapism prompted by it. But what if Russian interests become contrary to the interests of its partners, which, although Migranyan does take into account, he does not accept as being of equal importance? The same problem may have another aspect if one proceeds not from an absolutization of the interests of a certain state but from the possible long-range prospects of the CIS. But who is holder of CIS interests? Can there be Commonwealth interests different from the interests of each of the states forming it? Finally, does the CIS actually exist? Is that a legal form for the restoration of something akin to the Russian empire, or a channel through which former Soviet republics continue to "milk" Russia? Despite the contradictory nature of these publicist rather than political approaches they are similar in that they interpret the CIS as a certain extension of Russia. Therefore those "integrative processes" of which Migranyan speaks, may be conditioned only by its political will backed up with numerous control levers--from economic to military ones. In that form the CIS might develop through the purposeful weakening of all partners with a dominant Russia. It is necessary to remember that it was only military failure and anticipation of Russian aid that brought Georgia and Azerbaijan into the Commonwealth, and domestic problems made Ukraine more loyal. This, however, makes Russia itself weaker forcing it to keep those who are drowning "afloat" and interdicting attempts to involve "third parties." Will Russia have sufficient strength to act as the donor, creator of conflicts with subsequent peacemaking, supporter of regimes loyal to it, while also counteracting different blocs, particularly since CIS members are simultaneously members of other unions (the Black Sea Economic Organization, the Islamic Conference, the Turkic Conference)? Currently it is clear that the CIS will not become either a form for restoration of the Soviet Union, nor anything like the Sakharov model of a commonwealth of freely unified free peoples. With the weakening of Russia the CIS may immediately disintegrate or return to its 1992 state when relations between its partners were reminiscent of scenes in the lodging house from the stage play called "At the Bottom." It is, however, possible to view the concept at the basis of the CIS not primarily as a Russian one. Today the CIS is rather a club of presidents who for the most part are defending the interests of the elite they represent and supporting integration only to the degree agreeable to that elite. Out of the numerous declarations on the creation of various kinds of "unified spaces and zones" not a single one was ever created. But there is a unified psychological space, coinciding with boundaries of the former USSR, which does not depend on any decisions at CIS summit meetings and is not politically structured--it is a space common to all problems, where everyone, by virtue of his possibilities, resolves similar survival tasks. "The holders of CIS interests" are not only the national minorities and citizens who remained outside the borders of their national states. The small businessman-speculator negotiating at the airport with a minor bribe-taking customs official, a major industrialist lobbying the government for credit, the president signing another edict on measures for the social protection of the population, and the old woman begging for alms--all of that is devoid of any national features and is not delineated by current state borders. It is impossible to get away from this unified space of common crises, inasmuch as beyond the very first real foreign border post the criteria are completely different. At the same time prospects for the realistic development of the CIS lie not in political intrigues and pressure on weak partners, but in the appearance of forces, which for various reasons are interested in the development of the CIS. Thus far only the communists, who do not acquire any complexes resulting from accusations of restorative tendencies, are openly appearing as a transnational force, which discredits the very idea of cooperation. An alliance between nationalist movements, which in a paradoxical manner are unified by their opposition to transnational structures, is planned even though that is not advertised. But centrist and democratic forces, retaining loyalty to national sovereignty, are avoiding any organizational forms of cooperation. The interparliamentary assembly, which today exists more as an appendage to presidential conferences and not as a realistically operating political organ, could become such a form. Parliaments merely ratify decisions adopted at the presidential level, while their multiparty structure may serve as an effective feedback mechanism. The CIS interparliamentary assembly could assume a form close to the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council (which includes not only groups of deputies from individual countries but interstate factions as well), whose decisions, formally considered as recommendations, become the defining factors for interstate executive structures. Even with such a transformation, however, an interparliamentary assembly must be supplemented with a nongovernmental formation--a permanently operating forum representing regional cultural and ethnic minorities incapable of negotiating parliamentary selection procedures. Many problems may be eliminated if a regional approach, already adopted by the European Community and the European Council (known as "Europe of regions"), gains an upper hand. It assumes that Europe consists not just of independent states, but also of unified, historically formed regions, whose borders do not always coincide with state and ethnic boundaries. Expansion in the authority of local units of self-government and autonomies, transborder cooperation, and even interstate management through regional parliaments composed of representatives of local authorities in the neighboring states--all of these real integrated models have already proven their effectiveness. But the presently existing CIS structures do not promote integration and lead to one-sided, and therefore temporary domination by Russia. It is undoubtedly difficult to create political and civil institutions which would be capable of correcting decisions made by a narrow circle of individuals in power. But then the policy of Russia toward the near abroad, whose instability at present compels even its most loyal partners to remain on guard, will lose its quality of extemporaneous operations by appartchiks. Alternative approaches are particularly important in analyzing the situation in the Caucasus. In the study by Andranik Migranyan the Caucasus occupies a special place as a model of integrative processes. He proceeds from the political reality with sovereign Russia, Belarus, and Armenia with their presidents, borders and flags. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, however, goes on and its effects continue to be felt even in the most independent and sovereign Russia. It periodically finds itself on the verge of civil war. Its troops engage in battle along the Tajik border but do not have the right to enter the territory of Chechen. The position of others, particularly of the Transcaucasian states, whose actually controlled territories differ significantly from the national-administrative borders, is even more problematical. Migranyan overcomes one conditionality by viewing Northern Caucasus and Transcaucasia as "a unified geopolitical zone in which similar processes are taking place." But stops himself, concluding that "Caucasus represents a cultural, religious, and ethnic mosaic and, beyond the control of the great powers bordering it, the people of that region, by virtue of their cultural and historical characteristics, do not wish to or cannot carry out full integration. The creation of independent states in the Caucasus, however, is also impossible outside of the sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the region due to the ethnic composition of the population, the small size of such states, and the limited economic potential and geopolitical isolation." Therefore the solution proposed by Migranyan fails to account for the peculiarities of the region, but is adjusted to fit preexisting experience that has not justified itself: "In order to achieve stability and peace in that region Russia should establish itself as the guarantor of national and territorial autonomy of these formations. Just the observance of the rights of small minorities and cultural communities, guaranteed by Russia, must allow Russian authorities to guarantee and ensure territorial integrity of these new states. Considering the continued attachment of the Caucasus specifically to Russia, integration of a federalized Caucasian space with the Russian Federation within the CIS framework appears highly possible." All of that, however, was in the twenties. In the inevitably callous language of practical politics that means a return to the system of microempires, while the "integrating" role of Russia will boil down to performance of the functions of a policeman watching to make certain that the seniors (states-republics) do not harm the juniors (autonomies and minorities), and juniors listen to the seniors. In reality this means that Russia will be constantly drawn into conflicts either on one or the other side, which in the end will lead to its total loss of credibility in the region and then its final withdrawal, which will be welcomed both by the seniors and the juniors (those who manage to survive). I think that Andranik Migranyan is somewhat exaggerating the degree of "attachment of the Caucasus specifically to Russia." Russian tanks and bullets provide a rather swift cure for such sentiments. To consider that "the overthrow of the administrations of Gamsakhurdia and Elchibey is vivid evidence of the fact that they lost the support of the population when consequences of a rift with Russia became clear," indicates an unwillingness to analyze universally known factors. The reason for their downfall was certainly not national indignation with an anti-Russian policy of these "administrations," but rather obvious political manipulation. Andranik Migranyan considers that "the creation of independent states in the Caucasus is impossible outside the sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the region." Today, however, there is the political realization of the existing "cultural, religious, and ethnic mosaic." The Caucasus is a unified, even though a heterogeneous, finely balanced system of historically formed regions. That equilibrium is very easily disrupted: it is sufficient to intensify one of the elements from the outside. That is exactly the way the neighboring powers acted for centuries. Such a policy may pursue a variety of goals, with the exception of one--establishment of peace and stability in the region. The proposed federalization is highly reminiscent of Bolshevik experience with the Transcaucasian Federation which included Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan with the autonomous republics, oblasts, and even uezds contained in them. By virtue of historical peculiarities of the Caucasus, its real elements are not the three main nations--Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and Armenians, but historically formed mono and multiethnic regions. The natural geographic and linguistic boundaries promoted preservation of natural habitat regions which in the Middle Ages were politically established as semi-independent mini-states (gavars, beks, khanates, meliks) which could not be changed either by the systematically conducted unification (Russian authorities constantly changed the boundaries of gubernias and uezds), nor by the policy of the USSR aimed at consolidation of titular nations at the expense of minorities. Back in the 17th - 18th centuries small Karabakh consisted of five practically independent principalities (meliks). Another example, of an integrated multi-ethnic region (most lamentably it is no longer such), consisted of Abkhazia. Anyone who has any knowledge of the Caucasus, will readily suggest this version. First of all the regional structure of the Caucasus is more stable than its mosaic-like ethnic boundaries, secondly it serves as a natural guarantee of the existence of minority nations. Consequently federalization of the Caucasus could be carried out proceeding from the reality of the regions. By way of an example it is possible to cite the Swiss Confederation which is certainly not a confederation of Germans, French people, and Italians, but that of regions, cantons, and mini-states with their own parliaments, executive and judicial organs and a right to veto decisions of federal organs. The federation in the Caucasus would be not a system of ethnocratic states with certain autonomous features "guaranteed" by Russia but sovereign regions, possessing legitimate power and a certain form of representation in the CIS and international organizations. The "intensification of disintegration processes" of which Migranyan is speaking, is a natural continuation of the collapse of the Soviet Union. But it is not understandable why that process must be labeled as an ongoing "de facto federalization of Georgia and Azerbaijan" which must still be consolidated de jure with the aid of Russia. Quite the contrary: the federalization of these states within the USSR system was consolidated de jure. The result is well known. It would be more accurate to call the actual process as regionalization of the Caucasus. The present struggle of Transcaucasian states for "territorial integrity" and "intensification of executive power" (idioms, designating dictatorship, suppression of minorities and disassembly of structures of local self-government) merely confirms the actual disintegration of the Caucasus into regions. Russia, supporting that struggle, is joining in the victorious war of the "administrations" against their own citizens who are of a foreign race or against dissidents. The alleged inability of Caucasian nations to live together without the help of police is a myth. It is specifically the small size of elements comprising the ethnic system of the Caucasus that ensures a balance of power among them. The influence of Russia in the Caucasus can be stable and irreversible if it assumes the role of a guarantor ensuring peaceful creation of the final political map of the Caucasus. Russian military presence, particularly along the borders is permissible only as a restraining factor.
