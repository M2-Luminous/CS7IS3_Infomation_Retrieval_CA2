A delegation member said that "during last night's meeting, the delegation submitted seven written specific reform points and asked the Executive Committee members to take a stand on them." The "reform delegation," which is headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and includes seven other members, represents 120 Palestinian figures from inside and outside the occupied territory who signed a document delivered to the PLO leadership last month calling on it to modernize the PLO's institutions and promote a democratic leadership that would end the decisionmaking monopoly. The member revealed that, upon returning to Amman, the delegation intends to invite the signatories of the reform document to a meeting in the Jordanian capital within the next few days to report to them on the talks. The member, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis, specified these points as follows: 1. Formation of a planning and consultative committee to include qualified Palestinians from all fields, especially those needed for building the national authority. 2. Formation of a committee for comprehensive national dialogue (to include Palestinian factions, figures, establishments, and other bodies) consisting of independent elements enjoying the respect of the Palestinian people with the aim of strengthening democracy. 3. Creation of a department for the development of manpower. Its task will be to identify the Palestinian people's manpower qualifications in all fields and to retrain and rehabilitate the present cadres of the PLO. 4. Creation of a national authority reference body in Gaza and Jericho from elements inside the occupied territory to fill the vacuum before and after the Israeli withdrawal until the emergence of the national authority. 5. Submission of the proposed constitution for discussion at popular level. 6. Submission of a "modern" electoral law for discussion at popular level. 7. Revival of the negotiation steering committees which supervised the negotiations. The delegation member said that "Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat expressed reservations regarding the first point, pointing out that a planning council already exists and could be rejuvenated with the qualifications we propose." According to the member, 'Arafat is trying to find a compromise solution on that point. On the second point, the delegation member said, 'Arafat agreed in principle to the formation of a dialogue committee, giving responsibility for it to Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. The member added: "It can be said that 'Arafat did not agree to the formation of the kind of committee that we are calling for, one that would initiate a comprehensive dialogue with all the establishments and bodies inside and outside the occupied territory, not just a dialogue committee with only the opposition factions, to create an atmosphere of popular unity and of opposition to infighting, and to discuss points of agreement and come up with binding decisions." In reply to a question about the positions of 'Arafat and the other PLO Executive Committee members on the other points, he said that "they were not seriously discussed in the earlier meetings. Discussion was deferred until the final session which continued until dawn today." Asked about guarantees for the implementation of these demands, the member said: "To ensure implementation, we submitted a mechanism for the implementation of each proposal that would indicate the leadership's seriousness about its promises and would enable us to request implementation once the proposal is approved." On the positions of the Executive Committee members, the delegation member said that seven Executive Committee members, including 'Arafat, attended the meetings and that their positions can be summed up as follows: 1. 'Ali Ishaq (Palestine Liberation Front) (Abu-al-'Abbas): He did not comment but he did show some kind of displeasure. 2. Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front): Expressed reservations about the creation of new institutions. He called instead for the reactivation of the existing institutions. 3. Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin) (Fatah): He supported the demands. 4. Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) (Fatah): He did not attend the last two meetings because he was in Amman but he insisted on giving his opinion of all the points. His position was positive. 5. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh (Fida): His position was positive. 6. Sulayman al-Najjab (People's Party): He accepted all the demands.
