Our correspondent Morais Abel reports: In a vain attempt to cross Lucala 2 River, a number of clashes have taken place, particularly one in which the enemy lost a number of senior officers, including Colonel Chico Cuma, chief of the General Staff of the 45th Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Neto, commander of that regiment's 1st Battalion, and a captain in charge of the tank company. Two battalions of special forces, which the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] regards as the most powerful units involved in the ongoing offensive, have been put to flight. The two battalions suffered (?17) killed, including a lieutenant and three noncommissioned officers. Our forces captured 14 AK47's, and assorted ammunition. Noncommissioned officer Carlos Antonio Congumi, a member of the Luanda garrison command and born in Cuanza Sul, was taken prisoner during a clash. He revealed secret information which has helped Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola combatants in their defensive operations [words indistinct] on the Luanda-Dondo and Dondo-Dange-ia-Menha roads, which are used as supply lines for the MPLA. Enemy commanders and soldiers have become frustrated in view of systematic desertions and embezzlement of supplies [words indistinct]. On 10 April 87 members of the operational commandos fled, one of whom was captured by our forces. The others headed to their homes.
