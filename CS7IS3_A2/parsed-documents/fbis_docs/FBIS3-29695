Speaking at the Army Golf Course on 19 February about the intrusion by Cambodian soldiers at An Ma Pass, the army chief said should there be any new intrusions, the army will deal with them strictly. He said the incident at An Ma Pass was not serious because there were no houses there. Concerning the problem of the abduction of Thai villagers by Khmer bandits, he said he had instructed border units to deal with the problem harshly. He said: If they are rough with us, the army will be tough with them, no matter if they are civilians or soldiers. The army had been mild with them because they were considered friends. They have no reason to accuse us of supporting the Khmer Rouge. Gen. Wimon said Thailand suffered numerous losses from clashes between the government and Khmer Rouge forces. Thailand wants to see the fighting stop because it has brought difficulties to both soldiers and civilians on the Thai side.
