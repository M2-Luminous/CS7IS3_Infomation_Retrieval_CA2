When the issue of delimitation of powers arose, a law, although with a delay, was adopted. When the Crimean authorities raised the question of broader economic independence, this was granted to Crimea. That is to say, Ukraine was responding, and, what is more, it was responding sincerely and, let us say, with all good intentions to all those political, legal, and, partially, economic issues, because not everything is easily resolved. When they elected the president in Crimea, I congratulated him, invited him to visit Kiev, and here in this building, an agreement was reached during talks, not in the documents that we wanted to work with Crimea constructively, that we would do everything possible so that its economic independence could be expanded. However, the condition of the state's territorial integrity, its, let us say, status, stipulated by the Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, was a determining factor. It seemed to me then that we had come to this understanding. But right after this, they began to take steps of an absolutely opposite nature. Each decree, at least those that were issued on political issues, unitlaterally contradicted not only the Ukrainian Constitution but the Constitution of Crimea itself, not only Ukrainian laws, but Crimean laws as well. That is to say, virtually all, as they say, enforceable enactments were ignored. And now, the situation has reached the point where it has been officially announced that Crimea wants to secede, strictly speaking, from Ukraine, and its leaders are declaring that this is the drift, so to speak, at first toward their own state and then toward Russia. Both the chairman of the newly elected Supreme Council and other Crimean figures were saying this. This is why time has come for us to declare: ignoring the legislation of Ukraine, ignoring the realities, ignoring the anxiety over Crimea existing in the world, and ignoring international legal norms, stipulated both in the documents of the United Nations Organization and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Crimea wants to unilaterally adopt documents that go beyond the Ukrainian Constitution, its laws, and the law on the delimitation of plenary powers. This is why we have made a decision that if they do not abide by these fundamental provisions of principle, we shall act resolutely and consistently to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity and its state. I have issued decrees on subordinating the Crimean bodies of internal affairs directly to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, all the security services of Crimea to the chief of the Ukrainian Security Service, and all the judicial bodies to the Ukrainian minister of justice. I will further act within the framework of the Constitution, in the constitutional regime. If the Supreme Council adopts the documents you have mentioned, I will immediately submit to the Ukrainian Supreme Council a draft resolution on stopping the resolutions of the Crimean Supreme Council. That is to say, we shall act, I emphasize this, within the framework of the Constitution, our plenary powers, strictly proceeding from the fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, as is written in the Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea. Any revision of this fundamental provision of principle, entails inevitable grave consequences for those who carry this out. Everybody must understand that there is a limit for any society and for any state that no one is allowed to exceed. This limit is the territorial integrity of the state. And he who wishes to ignore this, to be guided by his ambitions and, let us say, other principles, he must know that he acts contrary to laws, he must know that grave consequences are possible, he must know that these grave consequences will occur, first and foremost, in Crimea itself, and will be experienced by the population of Crimea. And those who provoke these consequences will be responsible for this, no matter how high his regalia and plenary powers, as they say.
