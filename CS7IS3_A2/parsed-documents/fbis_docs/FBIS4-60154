Three days ago this regime's commandos kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, an official in Lebanon's Islamic Resistance, and took him to occupied Palestine. Al-Dirani is now being questioned and tortured by Israeli agents and, in their comments, Zionist officials have described this terrorist act as a sign of the Israeli army's capability, saying that the reason behind the kidnapping was to find out where one of its pilots whose plane crashed in Lebanon eight years ago is being held. The Israeli aggressors have always resorted to terrorist means and have abducted or martyred people and 'ulema in south Lebanon. Among these acts, reference can be made to the abduction of Shaykh 'Ubayd, a Muslim leader, and the martyring of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, the Lebanese Hizballah leader, and members of his family. But naturally, attacks on defenseless villages, armed attacks on homes where only women and children are being housed, and the killing of unarmed men actually show the weakness, not the military might, of the regime occupying Jerusalem. Another fundamental point is the silence by world forums on this flagrant violation of international regulations and the abduction of people from another country. In addition to trampling on the sovereignty of Lebanon, this act basically shows how Israel ignores international regulations and turns a blind eye to principles that it has apparently endorsed. Undoubtedly, a serious stance by the United Nations and support by free countries can lead to an effective condemnation of Israel and its mentors. At the same time, it should be expected that the most crushing answer to this feeble act come from combatant Muslims whose valorous deeds have always inflicted the greatest and strongest blows on the Zionist regime.
