A Belarusian cabinet member who wanted to remain anonymous told Interfax that the negotiating teams will discuss, as a matter of priority, mechanisms enabling the most important economic institutions of Russia and Belarus to function jointly and engage in business contacts with third countries. In his words, the two sides are about to agree on the need to have a transition period during which common approaches will be worked out in customs, budgets, pricing, crediting and social policies. He did not rule out that the replacement of Belarusian currency by Russian rubles will take six months or a year. The minister thinks that the gap between Russian and Belarusian positions has been narrowed on the two most controversial issues, the prices of fuel and raw commodities for Belarusian consumers and the exchange rate between the Belarusian and Russian rubles. Following comparison of prices of the 97 most important goods, one Russian ruble seems to be worth two Belarusian rubles while discussion will have to continue on the prices of oil and gas. Belarus wants to make these prices equal to those in Russia, while the Russian negotiators insist on freezing the existing prices for Belarusian factories and gradually making them equal to those at which oil and gas are sold to Russian factories. The Belarusian minister said that a compromise was possible. When the documents are agreed upon, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will go to Minsk for a signing ceremony.
