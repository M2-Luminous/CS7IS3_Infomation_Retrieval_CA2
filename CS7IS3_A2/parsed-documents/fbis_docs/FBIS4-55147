FBIS4-55147 "dreeu091__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-091-A Daily Report 10 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic 19-Percent Fall in Real Income Since 1988 19-Percent Fall in Real Income Since 1988 AU1105090994 Prague CTK in English 2045 GMT 10 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1105090994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 10 (CTK) -- Net monthly income per member of households with a common budget averaged 2,809 korunas, nominally 51 percent more than in 1988, but 19 percent less in real terms, according to a Czech Statistical Office report. The report, based on a "microcensus" of selected households carried out in March 1993, was made public yesterday at a press conference. Having collected data from 0.5 percent of Czech households, the office compared the results with a similar study undertaken in March of 1989. Cost of living indexes, which increased 88 percent between 1988 and 1992, were taken into account when determining real income. Households headed by a businessman had an average monthly income per member in 1992 of 3,730 korunas; by a farmer, 3,419; by a wage-owner, 2,849; by a pensioner (with economically active household members), 2,773; by cooperative farmers, 2,500; and by a pensioner (with no economically active household members), 2,445. The lowest income was reported by "other" households, usually headed by an unemployed individual, and by broken families living on child benefits -- 1,698 korunas. Real income decreased most for households headed by cooperative farmers -- 31 percent -- and least for those headed by pensioners without economically active members -- 13 percent. According to the data, differentiation increased both among the categories and within them. Just under three percent of households had incomes putting them under the poverty line at March 1993. Almost half of these were from the other households category.
