This is a provocative step to lead the situation to extremes by further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. Under its intentional scheme to create the situation of confrontation with us, the United States has broken up the DPRK-U.S. talks by fully overturning the 25 February agreement made at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and has more openly strengthened a military threat and has pressured us by announcing that it will resume the Team Spirit 1994 joint military exercise. The order by Clinton to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea is a grave threat to us. This clearly shows that the United States is leading the Korean peninsula to the situation of war.
