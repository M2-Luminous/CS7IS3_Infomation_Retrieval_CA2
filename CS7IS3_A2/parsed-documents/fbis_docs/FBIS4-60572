The United Arab Emirates Refer to al-Bid as `His Excellency the President'"] [Excerpt] The official EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY yesterday referred to 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential Council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], as "his excellency the president," an expression seen by political circles as "United Arab Emirates [UAE] media recognition of the DRY." According to informed sources in Abu-Dhabi, "the use of the expression 'his excellency the president' in reference to al-Bid was made on the instructions of political authorities." Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, DRY Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said that "the declaration of the new state was a foregone conclusion because of the situation which prevailed following the announcement of unity between the two parts of Yemen on 22 May 1990 and because of the failure to build Yemen's unitary state as a result of the insistence of the authorities in the Yemen Arab Republic on the old methods of government, until the war came to end the pending situation." Al-'Attas emphasized that "the declaration of the DRY is a station to stop at and pause, so as to prevent matters getting out of hand and prevent expansion of the scope of the war in a manner that would lead to the emergence of new entities. It is, therefore, better to restore the pre-22 May 1990 situation and then use our brains to think about the unity march, taking into consideration matters which were ignored in the past when emotions ruled supreme and reason was totally absent." The UAE sources said that "the media move may be an expression of extreme displeasure with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's disregard for the cease-fire appeals made by UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly on more than one occasion." They added that that "may be a new way of putting pressure on Sanaa to respond and of warning it of the consequences of further escalation of the fighting to include densely populated towns." Whereas the sources pointed out that the media recognition "might be a prelude to an official recognition of the DRY as an independent state, making the UAE the first state to recognize the new political situation in south Yemen and its declaration as an independent state," diplomatic observers noted that the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY "avoided describing al-Bid as chairman of the DRY's Presidential Council and just gave him the protocol phrase preceding the name." The sources also said that the UAE "was perhaps holding intensive contacts with other states to coordinate its steps with these states, although it may be the first to implement such steps." It is worth noting that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that there has been some kind of shift in the U.S. position away from insistence on Yemeni unity as called for by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Furthermore, the statements made by [Egyptian Foreign Minister] 'Amr Musa at his news conference yesterday denoted a similar shift with emphasis on a cease-fire in Yemen. The diplomatic sources said that "the UAE's recognition of the DRY may depend on the development of military operations on the ground, and if the south Yemeni forces managed to regain the initiative and stand fast in the face of the northern forces, that would not only pave the way for recognition but also for abandoning the neutral line taken on the conflict and making initiatives that would compel the intransigent party to accept mediation and good offices." Al-'Attas said that the declaration of the southern state was "the only realistic way out in the current circumstances, placing on the shoulders of the northern leadership the responsibility of preserving a minimum degree of national unity to be developed in the future, while at the same time searching for a formula for new relations between the two Yemeni states and the states of the region to provide security, stability, and development for the entire region in the new conditions." Asked what he thought of the position of the tribes and organizations opposed to Sanaa's leadership in northern Yemen, al-'Attas said: "That is an unfamiliar situation, a position of inaction despite the fact that there are patriotic figures and oppressed tribes there. The fighting taking place in the south is in defense of those people and their rights against the rulers there." He added: "Had they acted and supported the steadfastness of the southern and eastern governorates, the situation would have been different now and the label of north-south conflict would have disappeared, and the military clique would not have had the chance to strike at the unity forcing us to declare the southern state."
