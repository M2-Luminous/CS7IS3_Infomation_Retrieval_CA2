The national economy continued to grow, and the people's living standards continued to improve. The major improvements can be observed in the following: First, gross domestic product [GDP] exceeded three trillion yuan, topping the figure from the preceding year by 736 billion yuan. On a constant price basis, the growth rate was 13.4 percent higher than that of 1992 and was the highest since 1985. Zhang said: [Begin Zhang recording] The output of major industrial and agricultural goods set record highs, the infrastructure became stronger, the scientific and technological progress was greater, and the state's foreign exchange reserves increased. All this was favorable for achieving sustained national economic growth. Second, the people's living standards continued to improve, and their incomes continued to grow. In 1993, urban and rural dwellers' incomes grew by 10.2 and 3.2 percent, respectively. The scope of their consumption continued to broaden; and the standards of their clothing, food, spending ability, housing, and transportion continued to rise. Third, the nation's reforms continued to deepen. The various reform programs carried out around the main goal -- namely building a socialist market economic system -- continued to deepen during the past year. New progress was made in reforms carried out in rural areas and state-owned enterprises and in reforms relevant to wages, social security, housing system, macroscopic regulation and control, and prices. Fairly significant breakthroughs were made in two areas: 1) The efforts made to rationalize prices through correcting the perennially low prices for primary goods and infrastructure services have played an important role in forming market mechanisms. 2) While exercising macroscopic regulation and control, the nation did away with conventions and achieved positive results and gain valuable experiences from conducting experiments in introducing new measures at the right time and adjusting the degree of intensity. Fourth, the nation's opening up programs continued to broaden. In 1993 China's opening up programs continued to deepen in all sectors and in all directions. Import and export volumes continued to expand, and the mix of import and export goods continued to improve. The use of foreign capital grew substantially. New records were set both in the number of new accords signed on the use of foreign capital and in the actual amounts of foreign capital used. Fairly substantial progress was also made in developing economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries and in promoting international tourism. The key economic problems were: The decline of actual incomes of some people owing to rising commodity prices in the market; excessive investment in building fixed assets; and incompatibility between the development of basic industries and infrastructure on the one hand and rapid national economic growth on the other. On the whole, however, the economic situation in 1993 was satisfactory. The new changes appearing in various sectors are favorable for the nation to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, promote development, and mantain stability in 1994. In 1994, we must continue to implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; always pay attention to properly handling the relationships among reform, development, and stability; and continue to intensify and improve macroscopic regulation and control. Priority will be given to appropriately controlling investment in fixed assets and the growth of the money supply and guarding against serious inflation so that the targets set for reform and development this year can be attained. [end recording] Answering a question on commodity prices, Zhang Sai said: The substantial increase in commodity prices is primarily triggered by demand, especially the high demand for resources needed for investment in fixed assets. Second, it is due to rising costs. This is particularly noticeable as result of the readjustment of the prices of primary goods. Moreover, price increases were also caused by consumers' anticipation that commodity prices would rise, as well as by unwarranted and covert price rises and speculations. Thus, during the transition toward a market economy, it has become increasingly noticeable that market prices have been affected by the law of supply and demand. During 1994, price controls, as an important macroscopic regulatory measure, will still be useful for controlling price rises at a level consumers can tolerate. In respond to a question about China's economic growth rates in 1994, Zhang Sai pointed out: Seen from the law governing economic cycles, we still can expect a fairly high economic growth rate this year, but the rate will not be as high as those of 1992 and 1993. This is because of the increasingly obvious restrictions from basic industries. The utilization ratios of basic industries are already vary high, ranging from 80 to 100 percent in most cases, and communications and transport services can only satisfy 60 percent of the needs. Because of the restrictions from these bottlenecks, China's economic growth will decline somewhat this year. We must stress, however, that what is important is not high growth, but high economic returns. Continual readjustments will be made until the best point has been found for both growth and returns. [Begin recording] [Unidentified male reporter] I am reporter from [words indistinct], I want to ask Director Zhang a question. Some people used to think that statistical figures were inflated. This being the case, what positive efforts has the State Statistics Bureau taken or will take to make the figures more accurate? Can you [words indistinct] differences of major figures can be controlled so that they can more credible? [Zhang] It is a common occurrence for statistics to be confronted with skepticism in varying degrees in all countries. If we observe specific facts, people more often than not approach statistics with skepticism. Macroscopically speaking, however, statistics can basically reflect facts because of the development of statistical sciences. Today when we are moving toward building a market economy, we have accomplished much in the way of reforming our method of processing statistics, and we have adopted some major measures for controlling the accuracy of statistics. Generally, these reforms and measures are based on 1) science and technology; and 2) laws. Regarding science and technology, we have, first of all, established a scientific system for processing statistics. This is a scientific, three-in-one system for processing social, economic, and scientific and technical information. This system has functions for controlling and verifying statistics according to requirements. Second, we have a system for assessing the national economic development. This system can process all types of statistics in a way similar to assembling a large machine. If a certain figure does not seem to fit, this figure is considered to be incorrect and must be checked and verified. Third, we have a scientific way to compile statistics. This way is based on a number of methods, but primarily on surveys and samplings. Fourth, we depend extensively on computers which can distinguish correct from incorrect figures. Fifty, we have a scientific management system which can reject interference from various sectors when information is being processed. Because of the development of modern science and technology, we can be sure that our statistics are basically in line with objective facts. In China, where statistical science has not been popularized, it is understandable that people are skeptical of it. Even people in developed countries often express doubts over statistics. I think this is a normal phenomenon. Then we have to count on laws. In addition to the PRC Law for Statistics, all provinces and municipalities have their own local statistics regulations, by which those who do not report statistics according to state regulations or those who obstruct statisticians from collecting statistics will be punished. So I think you can be confident with our statistics. This is particularly true for statisticians like ourselves. A Chinese saying goes that a melon seller will certainly brag about the melons he sells, but I think our statisticians can take pride in their work of ensuring the accuracy of our statistics.
