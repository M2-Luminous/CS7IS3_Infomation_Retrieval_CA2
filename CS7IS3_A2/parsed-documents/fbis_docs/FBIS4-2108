The conference was held at the same time as a provincial propaganda and ideological work conference. The radio and television propaganda work conference was attended by nearly 30 people, including autonomous prefectural, prefectural, and city radio and television bureau chiefs; persons in charge of the Qinghai People's Radio Station, the Qinghai Television Station, and the Qinghai Provincial Radio and Television Department; as well as the individuals in charge of the other departments concerned. Wang Huiru, provincial radio and television department director, delivered a speech entitled Clearly View the Situation, Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, Live a Plain Life, Work Hard, and Strive To Promote the Continued Development of Radio and Television Undertakings. Director Wang Huiru reviewed the basic situation of Qinghai's radio and television work over the past few years, relayed the spirit of a recently concluded national radio and television propaganda work conference, called for implementing to the letter the spirit of a recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference and the spirit of the ongoing provincial propaganda and ideological work conference, and spelled out some new tasks and goals for Qinghai's radio and television work. After conducting study and discussion, the conference participants unanimously said: Now that we have clear-cut principles and policies to follow with regard to propaganda and ideological work, we should strive to unify ideology, heighten understanding, conscientiously implement the relevant principles and policies to the letter, and carry out work in a down-to-earth manner in light of Qinghai's actual conditions. The conference participants also reached consensus on a number of major issues and called on all comrades concerned to view, from the high plain of the proletarian party spirit, the importance and necessity of successfully relaying the central and provincial radio and television programs. They also urged that every effort be made to ensure that the central and provincial radio and television programs are relayed in their entirety. In view of the fact that there are some areas in the province where people are still unable to watch radio or television programs, the conference called for making redoubled efforts to build more radio and television relay networks; sticking to the correct public opinion orientation; creating public opinion favorable to reform, opening up, socialist market economic structure, and socialist productive forces; whipping up public opinion that is conducive to urging people to live a plain life, work hard, and strive to build a strong and prosperous country; improving the people's livelihood, pushing forward social progress; and creating public opinion that is conducive to national reunification, nationality solidarity, ease of mind among the people, and social and political stability. The conference stated: The propaganda departments should strengthen management by focusing on such key links as announcers, programs, and the like; should take resolute measures to wipe out substandard programs; should set a limit on the number of foreign movies and programs, especially in prime time; should conscientiously implement the spirit of advocating the main theme and airing varied programs; should ensure efficient information supply and satellite television programs reception; should strengthen, consolidate, and develop radio broadcasting networks in rural areas; should develop cable television networks in a planned and efficient manner, and should conscientiously implement all legal documents promulgated by the State Council and the ministry of radio, film, and television. The participants also exchanged experiences during the conference.
