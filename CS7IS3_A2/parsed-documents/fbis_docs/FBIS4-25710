By early May, Guangxi had investigated a total of 1,427 price-related cases, confiscated illicit incomes totaling 27.62 million yuan, handled a total of 1,043 price-related cases, and collected price-related fines totaling 2.4 million yuan. In view of a series of problems exposed during the region's commodities prices examination, including an unbalanced crackdown on price-related cases, ineffective measures against price-related cases, slack regulation and control of daily necessities and services prices, and so on, the regional people's government held a regional prices examination work conference in Nanning on 9 June. Liu Xueyue, regional people's government secretary general, said in his speech to the conference that the second-stage of the regional commodities prices examination will be directed at certain basic daily necessities, production means, and services prices, including grain, chemical fertilizer, agricultural goods and materials, electricity, and so on. With regard to grain and other basic necessity prices, Liu noted that conscientious efforts should be made to implement the state grain prices reform plan and relevant measures, market prices control measures, and so on. The whole region should strictly control price hikes, especially those relating to bus and train fares; prohibit enterprises and operators from raising chemical fertilizer prices, agricultural goods and materials prices, and electricity prices without state approval; and prohibit enterprises and operators from altering state guidance prices as well as other prices set by the state, such as, prices set by the State Council or the regional people's government. Moreover, Liu stated that the whole region should strive to implement to the letter a series of preferential prices set by the state for farm and sideline products and prohibit relevant units from raising basic services prices, such as, rent, water prices, electricity prices, bus fares, and telephone charges.
