ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing a new rule and proposing to amend its rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to reduce existing regulatory distinctions between debt securities listed on a national securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter market. The Commission also is proposing to simplify registration procedures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for listed debt securities. The proposals would: exempt listed debt securities from restrictions on borrowing and the proxy rules; provide for the automatic effectiveness of a Form 8&hyph;A registration statement for listed debt securities; and eliminate the filing fee associated with the Form 8&hyph;A registration statement for listed debt. Comment also is being requested as to whether it is advisable to extend reporting requirements to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the over-the-counter market under certain circumstances where the issuer is not otherwise subject to periodic reporting requirements. DATES: Comments should be received on or before August 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington DC 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;16&hyph;94.
