Good morning, Dr. Pastrana. [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] Are you satisfied with yesterday's event? [Pastrana] I am very happy, but it is more important that Colombians be satisfied, not me. Also, the truth is that we succeeded in unveiling most of our platform. The truth is we are very happy. [Arizmendi] What do you think are the highlights of your platform? [Pastrana] I think it is the whole area of social investment, something I think has been missing in our country, and all the opportunities now arising in Colombia. That is why I think most... [pauses] I think this recaps most of what we wanted [word indistinct] the time for Colombia has come. I think that through the efforts and hard work of all Colombians we are going to move ahead. [Arizmendi] Some analysts feel that in last night's speech, in some of your promises and chiefly in your slogans, you evoked Jose Maria Aznar and his presidential campaign in Spain. His slogan was: Spain now. As I understand it, you concluded your speech by saying: Do not be mistaken, we are going to win; we are going to win. That is how Aznar always concluded his speeches. Is your friendship with Aznar responsible for this similarity? [Pastrana] [laughs] We did not do it with that in mind, despite my friendship with Jose Maria Aznar. I think yesterday we tried to create a different style of presenting politics by way of a much more direct speech. As you could see, it contained examples. The language of the speech appealed to the people much more. I tried to explain most of our platform. I think the time for Colombia has indeed come, and this is why we must begin to work soon to begin to resolve the country's problems. [Arizmendi] Are you still a Conservative? [Pastrana] Yes, of course, I am still a Conservative, as I said yesterday. I think I was a little repetitive in outlining the campaign. Sometimes campaigns center on the wrong things. I think the topic of whether or not I am Conservative.... [pauses] this was defined a long time ago. I am and will remain a Conservative, but I am bringing to the attention of the Colombian people an eminently nationwide, suprapartisan [suprapartidista] candidacy. As I said yesterday, the campaign cannot be centered on whether or not I am Misael Pastrana's son. I am the son of Misael Pastrana, whom I love, admire, and respect, but as I said yesterday, we have led different lives and have been active in politics at different times. I also said yesterday that I will not shave my moustache. I said I was not going to shave it, and we were going to keep it throughout the electoral process. [Arizmendi] Do not worry, I will not shave mine either. [laughs] Dr. Pastrana, what role will your father -- former President Misael Pastrana Borrero -- play in your political campaign? [Pastrana] No, Dario, I believe that.... [pauses] in preparing for our campaign we have made great efforts to consolidate a significant group that will support us and work with us. I believe this was evident yesterday, when our candidacy was proclaimed. Naturally, Dario, my father has always been close to me. He is an excellent adviser, but naturally we are maintaining our organization, and we have clear proposals. I believe this is the first time a candidate has presented such a complete plan. Not only are we saying what we will do, but how we will do it, which in my opinion is the most important aspect of our government platform. [Arizmendi] By accepting a suprapartisan Conservative candidacy, we imagine your running mate as vice presidential candidate will be a Liberal candidate? [Pastrana] That is possible, Dario. You know that from the Senate I was possibly the one senator who was most opposed to a constitutional amendment by which the vice presidential candidate had to be of the same political affiliation as the presidential candidate. We won that battle in the Senate, and now that door remains open. I believe, Dario, that we must wait. The process is just beginning, the parliamentarian elections will be in March, and I believe later on in the elections process we will elect -- at least in my case -- our running mate. [Arizmendi] What profile will that person have, Dr. Pastrana? [Pastrana] First, he must be someone who is identified fully with our government plan, and logically a person the president of the Republic can trust. Those are two conditions I feel the vice president should have. [Arizmendi] What are your views regarding the presence of foreign troops in our country? Give us your views. [Pastrana] Dario, I believe that troops in Colombia based on cooperation agreements that deal with technical aspects or aspects related to drug trafficking and terrorism must be welcomed here. I believe Colombians should not reject any help that will enable us to eradicate drug trafficking and terrorism from our country. In facing that situation, I believe we must clearly say that the signing of various agreements has been very important for our country and that it will continue to be important in the future to maintain foreign troops and advisers in those fields. I believe this should be clear. What possibly has happened in the Juanchaco case -- and even the government has admitted this -- is that there has not been enough clarity on the subject. Colombians are demanding clarity. In that sense, I believe Colombians have always reacted [word indistinct] with regard to the participation of foreign troops or advisers in matters important to the country. I believe we must support and maintain their presence. [Arizmendi] What is your opinion of the way in which President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo reacted to the decision and statement issued by the State Council on how the government handled the presence of foreign troops in Juanchaco? [Pastrana]) I believe all positions should be respected. What we are having now is a debate with regard to whether the Constitution was properly applied or not. The State Council has clearly stated its juridical position, and the president of the Republic has replied to this position. I believe it is important to mention -- and I said this in a news release -- that we are talking about the implementation of international treaties that are current [words indistinct] and I feel it is important and still possible to convoke the Foreign Relations Advisory Commission to clear up any doubts that might exist with regard to the implementation of current international treaties Colombia has signed. [Arizmendi] Will you extend a friendly hand to the five members of the Conservative Party who will run against you? [Pastrana] Not only to them, but friends from various sectors. We want Conservatives, Liberals, and independents to support our presidential candidacy. [Arizmendi] You have identified with President Gaviria's economic policy. Some sectors have criticized that policy, which has been described as neoliberal and having a high social cost. Will you continue the same policy as Gaviria? [Pastrana] Yes, definitely. I believe I said this clearly yesterday. On the subject of economic opening, I have said we must consolidate the process. President Gaviria has laid the foundations for a policy; now we must start building it. Some adjustments must be made to the foundations. In our speech yesterday we noted that today the government is seeking efficiency from the industrialists, but we are not giving them the tools to do this. As I said yesterday, I believe if we create a good infrastructure to project our country abroad, and if we make the necessary adjustments, our country will move ahead in the opening process. I also believe -- and I have been serious about this -- that we must consolidate all the necessary conditions to help the country in the area of social investments. We must make great efforts to obtain funds to conduct a revolution in education and to consolidate and develop rural areas once and for all, as well as consolidate peace and tranquility, which is what all Colombians want. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, you have said you will not receive any contribution or aid from the Santo Domingo Group for the election campaign. Will you adopt the same position with regard to other economic groups? [Pastrana] I did not say that. What I have said publicly, as you know, is that issue is behind me. I have adopted a clear position regarding Colombia's privatization process. I have expressed the hope that Colombia's privatization process will not constitute a transition from a state monopoly to a private sector monopoly. What is at issue is the democratization of our institutions and our ability to plan for the future as other countries have done under similar circumstances. In Chile and other Latin American countries, privatization processes were employed to democratize institutions instead of creating monopolies. [Arizmendi] Dr. Andres Pastrana, if you have not said publicly that you will not receive economic contributions from the Santo Domingo Group, what is your position regarding contributions made by various economic groups to your political campaign? [Pastrana] You are well aware of the Santo Domingo Group case, Dario. The position I have adopted has nothing to do with public opinion; it is a personal position. I believe it is important to establish rules that will preclude concentrating power in the hands of a few and instead truly foster the decentralization and democratization of institutions, especially those that belong to the state. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, forgive me for insisting, but perhaps I did not understand your position. Does this mean you will not accept economic aid for your campaign from the Santo Domingo Group? [Pastrana] You have asked that question three times, and I understood you each time. If the decision were mine to make I would say no, but it is a political decision. [Arizmendi] What about other economic groups? Will you accept aid from the Ardila Group, Sarmiento Group, or Chavarria Group? [Pastrana] Dario, what matters is the management of campaign finances, which will not be done directly by Andres Pastrana. For that I have appointed Hernan Bell, who is very capable, and I have a large group of friends who are helping us amass resources to consolidate the upcoming political process. I believe, Dario, that it is important and fortunate that democracy exists in Colombia and that the state is largely financing the elections. Today the state, through the Electoral Law, is supplying funds to congressional, senatorial, council, assembly and presidential candidates, depending on the number of votes they receive. I believe this is a very significant aspect of the Colombian political process, because without that aid many people would be unable to campaign. Because of it, however, the political process is much more transparent. [Arizmendi] As for transparency, Dr. Pastrana, it would be nice to have an explanation of what happened between you and the Santo Domingo Group. What did the group do to you or what happened to create this situation and to prompt the remarks you have made? [Pastrana] I believe this is an internal issue; it is not an electoral campaign issue. The fact is that the Santo Domingo Group and I know what happened and I do not believe this is an issue in the campaign. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, during your speech last night at the Convention Center you referred to a reduction in beer taxes. Would you briefly explain your position? [Pastrana] Yes. It is largely an effort to defend the incomes of municipalities and departments. I believe we should ensure that they maintain a large part of their income from taxes on beer, which has been essential to certain municipal and departmental projects. [Arizmendi] You have spoken of complete, irreversible openness. Do you believe it is equitable for the national beer industry to compete with contraband beer on which taxes are not paid? [Pastrana] I would not put it that way, Dario. I do not like to analyze politics [word indistinct] the way you are doing it. I believe you should listen again to the speech I delivered yesterday. If I came down hard on anything it was on contraband in Colombia. I even made a statement I would characterize as very harsh but which truly represents the feelings of the Colombian people. I said I believe Colombia's Customs Service is an embarrassment and we cannot allow contraband to compete against the industrial sector in our national markets. While industry is paying manufacturing costs and the VAT [value-added tax], contraband is invading our markets. Because of this very situation, I have said we must consolidate customs in Colombia because the country must try to compete in international markets under fair conditions. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, in the past Belisario Betancur, also a Conservative, made the same call you are making today. The Liberals who backed him later paid a high political price and lost the elections. Do you believe that they learned their lesson and will not support you? Or do you really believe that your call on sectors other than the Conservatives will be answered? [Pastrana] I believe the call will be heeded, and we know that the call has already been heeded in other important sectors, Liberal Party friends are accompanying us in this campaign. Independent sectors are accompanying us in this campaign. I think the country believes in something more than the simple political programs of one party or another. What we need to present is a true government program, with national coverage, which will allow us -- everyone in Colombia -- to begin working on a political program in search of the development we desire so much in Colombia. This is the invitation we have extended to Conservatives, Liberals, and independents, and we are certain that with all of their help and effort we will consolidate the political program we started yesterday. [Arizmendi] What have you calculated to be the cost of your political campaign, Dr. Pastrana? [Pastrana] The truth is that I am not familiar with the issue. This information is known by those who handle the financial aspects of the campaign. I think this is a very good question for (Dr. Kelskey), who is in charge of this. I believe that as a candidate my job is to go out and tour the country and continue to talk with the people. This is what I began doing today with my trip to Medellin and Antioquia. [Reporter] Within eight days the Conservative Party convention will be held, summoned by the directorates that came together after remaining apart right up until a few months ago. This convention will probably proclaim you as the official Conservative Party presidential candidate. What will be your attitude in light of this proclamation? [Pastrana] We truly hope to receive the support of the Conservative Party. At the October convention we were asked to run as a national candidate. On 18 February, the party will decide which candidate it will back in the next elections. The truth is that I hope the Conservative Party gives me its support, and not only the Conservative Party, but also my Liberal Party friends and the independents. I insist that we can consolidate the political program I officially presented yesterday. [Arizmendi] Will you allow the Conservative Party to exploit your image and candidacy? [Pastrana] No, no, the truth is that today the country, if it has anything clear, Dario, is that we are presenting a national candidacy. Logically, I want and trust I will receive my party's support, but we will continue with the political program -- a national program and plan that goes beyond the party. [Reporter] Are you willing to engage in a dialogue with rebel candidates such as Rodrigo Marin, Gabriel Melo, and the others who have said they will put up a fight to the very end? [Pastrana] If they have said they will put up a fight to the very end it will be difficult. Given such circumstances, it is important that next Friday -- when the Conservative Party, through the method it has chosen, elects a candidate or candidates by [words indistinct] -- I gain the Conservative Party's support. I believe this is important; my goal is to obtain the support of the Conservative Party. [Arizmendi] What is your position on the process that is beginning to unfold in the country? This is in reference to the surrender to justice and negotiations with members of the Cali cartel. [Pastrana] Dario, I hope that this endeavor will be realized. Nevertheless, I believe that we Colombians are waiting to be told what the final goal of this process is. At least from what we have heard in the media, the goal is peace, and, therefore, I believe it is positive. The truth of the matter is that I have been very clear in this regard. I believe the policy of surrendering to justice is sound and good as long as it is the criminals who surrender to justice and not justice that surrenders to the criminals. [Arizmendi] In the Juanchaco case, do you believe that the president of the Republic and the defense minister have told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to the Colombia people? [Pastrana] The president of the Republic has said that the information on the issue was scant, and this is why I believe it was important to accept this and clarify the matter. [Arizmendi] Mr. Pastrana, thank you very much for your discussion with Emisoras Caracol. Our microphones are at your disposal, as the Colombians have the right to information. Will there be equal opportunity for the various media in covering your political campaign? [Pastrana] We expect the opposite will be true. We hope there will be balanced coverage in the media of our activities. In this way, we will be able to engage in a good electoral struggle awaited by all Colombians. [Arizmendi] Do you believe that up until now the media has been fair in handling your political activity and your campaign? [Pastrana] Yes, Yes, Dario, I believe that to a great extent they have been fair. This is why we hope that now that the process has been initiated [words indistinct] our name, we will have the opportunity, not only through Emisoras Caracol, but also through the various other media, to present to the Colombian people what we think and how we expect to resolve the nation's problems. [Arizmendi] When I asked what happened to you with the Santo Domingo Group, it was to give you an opportunity to clarify this incident on the airwaves, directly to the nation. I understand it is not a serious incident and it does not have significant repercussions. But when matters are not explained, as happened in Juanchaco, when the whole truth is not told, then the people start speculating. They think: What could have happened? What could have they told each other? How did they hurt each other? I understand that a serious incident did not take place, regardless of whether the dispute is ongoing, and regardless of any type of decision you may have made. Nevertheless, as a reporter, I believe it would be good for the nation to know why the Santo Domingo Group and Andres Pastrana had a falling out. What happened? What is behind the group's attitudes, which have started to give way to other attitudes? [Pastrana] What attitudes are you talking about? [Arizmendi] For example, it has been said that you want nothing to do with the Santo Domingo Group, that nothing will be demanded from the Santo Domingo Group, but that, eventually, requests will be made to other sectors. [Pastrana] I am surprised by your question. If I am not mistaken, I believe it was through Caracol that I heard a communique from the group's president with regard to the issue that you are presenting. Theoretically, in that communique maybe everything that happened was not explained, but perhaps the president of the Santo Domingo Group wanted to give his side of the story. [Arizmendi] Very well, Mr. Pastrana, I hope the campaign will be conducted in a respectful manner, respecting the rules of the game for the good of democracy and the good of the nation.
