Bolivia will participate in a meeting with the Paris Club in October to reschedule the bilateral foreign debt. The dates were confirmed by Finance Minister Fernando Cossio, who also confirmed a meeting with the IMF for late May to reach a new agreement on structural adjustment. Bolivia seeks financing from the Consultative Group. In 1993, Bolivia received commitments for more than $1 billion over a four-year period. This year, Bolivia will go to this international forum to renew this financial support. Cossio said the government's economic team is preparing a strategy to negotiate with the IMF. The new agreement with the IMF will be in effect for three years and include the main structural reform programs the current administration has in mind. The finance minister mentioned that basically the capitalization's and the popular participation's impact on the fiscal program would be included in the agreement. The minister said it is too early to discuss the amount that might be agreed upon with the IMF. He added that the amount required by our national economy would be negotiated with the IMF. Nevertheless, it is necessary to emphasize that this involves a grants-in-aid program, including a 10-year repayment period, a 10-year grace period, and a 0.5 percent interest rate.
