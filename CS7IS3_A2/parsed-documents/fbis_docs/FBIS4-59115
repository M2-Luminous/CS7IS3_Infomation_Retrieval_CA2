The report notes that the Islamists won the four seats and that 93 percent of the voters gave their support to the Islamists in a democratic atmosphere. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD APPEALS TO YEMENI PARTIES TO PRESERVE UNITY A 150-word unattributed report on page 1 notes that the Muslim Brotherhood appealed to the parties to the conflict in Yemen to safeguard the public interest and settle differences within the framework of a constructive dialogue based on the shari'ah and to place Yemeni unity above all other considerations. The report says that the Muslim Brotherhood called on the Arab and Muslim leaders and organizations to play the required role in closing the Yemeni ranks and stopping the bloodshed. MILITARY COURT SENTENCES AL-SHA'B MILITARY EDITOR A 200-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Fattah Fayid says that after one hearing, the military court sentenced AL-SHA'B military editor 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn to one year with hard labor and ordered him to pay a 500-pound fine. The paper notes that he was arrested after publishing a report on the Bright Star maneuvers between Egypt and Western countries. The report says that the military editors of the Journalists Syndicate and journalists doyen Ibrahim Naf'i sent a memorandum to the defense minister urging him not to ratify the ruling. ISLAMIC WRITER CRITICIZES GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF VIOLENCE In an approximately 2,000-word article on page 3, Islamic Brotherhood writer Dr. Ahmad al-Malat claims that a trustworthy mosque preacher told him that mosque prayer leaders receive instructions directly from the Awqaf Ministry "not to mention Palestine, talk badly of Jews, or comment on Bosnia in their Friday sermons." Al-Malat asks the Awqaf minister if this is the mosque's mission in the country that is home to the al-Azhar Mosque. He asks: Shouldn't the Muslims know about Islamic issues that are the focus of world media? He says what he calls the intelligence henchmen want the Egyptians to forget the peoples of Palestine and Bosnia and leave them to their fate. He asks if a mosque and a preacher's mission have become so trivial. He argues that this attitude does a great injustice to the sublime mission of Islam and the Muslims' right to know about Muslim issues. Discussing violence by Muslim youths, al-Malat says: We "agree" with these youths on the goal of serving the Islamic call but "differ" with them over the means. He says Islam calls for preserving the sanctity of life, property, and honor and draws limits that Muslims should not exceed. He says: We the Muslim Brotherhood "cannot accuse these youths of being mercenaries, hirelings, or renegades," as we have no evidence. But we maintain that they are Muslim youths who have "gone astray." Addressing government officials, al-Malat states that they have a right to pursue crime but within the framework of Islamic shari'ah, not their laws that they call democracy. He claims that government officials have no right to take power, deactivate the laws, and impose the emergency law to "humiliate the people and subjugate them." He suggests that they have no right to prevent particular preachers from addressing the masses. He argues that the Muslim Brotherhood is "more capable of understanding" these youths and closer to the right path of holding a dialogue with them, especially in view of the failure of every government effort embodied in the enlightenment convoys that tour the country. If the officials "think rationally and avoid wielding a heavy stick" it will be easy to address this problem. "Direct dialogue" with these youths is the way to get closest to their minds. This, the author believes, requires "recognition of the right of the Muslim Brotherhood to free movement among the youths without control or spying." He contends that the government can silence voices with whips but cannot stop resentment "seething" in the hearts of youths, which will eventually give vent to disaster. WRITER ASSAILS GOVERNMENT'S BID TO FOIL POLITICAL ISLAM Muhammad Jamal Mishhat, in a 500-word column on page 8, discusses the escalating acts of violence in Egypt. He claims that the government and its media "endorse a policy hostile to Islam." He suggests they "penetrated" the Islamic groups, "distorted" their image, and shed their blood. The Muslim Brotherhood, he says, learned from 20 years of experience in jail and notes that "no Muslim Brotherhood member has been involved in acts of violence." The Muslim Brotherhood accepted democracy and entered the People's Assembly and various other associations. They achieved reforms but their "achievements have been fought" and the government is "escalating the confrontation" because it wants to "foil the success of political Islam" in the same way it foiled the attempts to revive economic Islam.
