FR940324-0-00028 FR940324-0-00008 With respect to persons who manufacture list I chemicals, DEA has made a preliminary determination that registration will not be required for persons who manufacture a list I chemical solely for internal consumption with no subsequent distribution or exportation of the List I chemical. Those persons who manufacture a list I chemical for distribution will be required to register. Specific details regarding DEA's determination will be set forth in the Federal Register notice proposing the regulations to implement the DCDCA. The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration hereby certifies that this interim rulemaking will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This interim rulemaking grants a temporary exemption from the registration requirements of the DCDCA pending completion of the regulatory amendments necessary to implement the DCDCA. This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the interim rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 1310 Drug traffic control, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, List I and List II chemicals. For reasons set out above, title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, part 1310 is amended as follows. PART 1310_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 1310 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 802, 830, 871(b). 2. Section 1310.09 is added to read as follows: ยง1310.09 Temporary exemption from registration. Each person required by section 3(b) of the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;200, effective April 16, 1994), to obtain a registration to manufacture, distribute, import, or export a list I chemical (other than those list I chemicals exempted under ยง1310.01(f)(1)(iv)), is temporarily exempted from the registration requirement. The exemption will remain in effect for each person until the person has made proper application for registration and the Administration has approved or denied such application, provided that the application has been submitted within 45 days following the effective date of the regulations in part 1309 implementing the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993. This exemption applies only to registration; all other chemical control requirements set forth in the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 and in parts 1310 and 1313 of this chapter remain in full force and effect. Dated: March 17, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Acting Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6884 Filed 3&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
