FBIS4-1584 "drchi063_b_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 United States & Canada China Reportedly `Willing To Be Helpful' on MFN China Reportedly `Willing To Be Helpful' on MFN HK0104111394 Hong Kong AFP in English 1059 GMT 1 Apr 94 HK0104111394 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Hong Kong, April 1 (AFP)--China has signalled that it is ready to make concessions to sustain its most-favored-nation (MFN) trading privileges with the United States, a US business leader in Hong Kong said Friday. Gerald Murdock, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, who returned from two days of meetings in Beijing, said the Chinese officials he met did not specify what precise steps they might take. But he said the officials--including Li Lanqing, vice premier in charge of foreign trade--indicated they were "willing to be helpful," so long as the steps taken fell in line with Chinese law. "I don't think they'd describe it as concessions, but they did give us the impression that they're willing to be helpful to the (MFN renewal) process within the framework of Chinese law," Murdock told AFP. "I interpret that as meaning there would be some action on the Chinese part that would make (President Bill Clinton's) decision to renew easier," he said. Asked when China might act, Murdock replied: "It's got to be soon. They don't have much time left." Clinton is to decide by June whether to maintain MFN for China, after declaring a year ago that renewal would depend on "overall, significant progress" in human rights. While the United States extends MFN status to nearly all its trading partners, many US congressmen are still in favor of revoking it in China's case, five years after the Beijing massacre of pro-democracy activists. Earlier this week, the US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific affairs, Winston Lord, suggested that MFN might be revoked on a limited basis, with state-owned exporters targeted. But Murdock said: "There is a better understanding by the Chinese side of how the US side feels about this issue, how it should approach it and what (Washington) is looking for." The American Chamber, with about 325 corporate members, is in favor of China keeping its MFN status, saying the continued presence of US business in the country can help guarantee human rights in the long run. Murdock and other chamber members are to be in Washington on May 2-5 to urge legislators to support MFN renewal, in a mission that will dovetail with a similar lobbying effort by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy, Chief Secretary Anson Chan.
