In legislators' opinion, this is "an illegal order inflicting material damage on Ukraine". The difficult economic situation in the CIS countries has brought about a situation when some enterprises and organisations went bankrupt and did not pay for delivered goods or paid with great delays. Former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma forbid to ship goods to former Soviet republics without preliminary payment or without guarantees by a foreign bank which could vouch for payments in time. But, six months later, Zvyahilskyy signed a decision permitting the Kiev Elektronmash, Kharkov bicycle factories and other leading engineering enterprises to deliver goods to the CIS countries without the confirmation of preliminary payments.
