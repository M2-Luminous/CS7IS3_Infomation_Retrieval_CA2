Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin met with Charles Kartman, a minister at the U.S. Embassy, and delivered a note explaining Seoul's position on the status of disputed facilities that include the embassy compound downtown and embassy staff residence quarters in Yongsan. It is the first time that the Seoul government has requested overall negotiations on all the facilities in question. The Board of Audit and Inspection ruled last summer that the U.S. Embassy must pay rent for one of its twin buildings formerly occupied by American AID [Agency for International Development] organizations. The board said that since the AID organizations have left South Korea, there is no legal basis for rent exemption. The embassy agreed in principle that its rent-free status has ended, but not on when it expired. The embassy took over the building on Oct. 1, 1980. Seoul also demands negotiations on relocating embassy staff quarters in Yongsan Army Base since the South Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) bars use of the American military base for non-military purposes.
