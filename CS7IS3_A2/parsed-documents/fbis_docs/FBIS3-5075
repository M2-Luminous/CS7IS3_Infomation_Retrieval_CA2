The Japan-U.S. framework talks, which broke down at the latest Japan-U.S. summit in February, are now in a "cooling-off period," (as Prime Minister Hosokawa has said). This is the first time that Japanese and American officials in charge of the talks will meet informally. Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura intends to explain to U.S. Under Secretary of State Spero about Japan's posture to work voluntarily for opening the Japanese market and discuss ways to resume the framework talks with the American official, (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official).
