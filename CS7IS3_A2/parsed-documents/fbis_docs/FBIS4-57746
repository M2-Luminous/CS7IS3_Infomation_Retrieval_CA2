Sousa Lennox, current director of the National Association of Cattlemen (Anagan), will head the Agricultural Development Ministry (Mida) as of 1 September when Perez Balladares' presidential term begins. Moscoso de Gruber added: "Sousa Lennox believes agricultural interests are more important than the interests of the PA, so he resigned." Perez Balladares offered the PA two ministries, but the Arnulfist leadership forbade its members from occupying posts in the incoming government and threatened to expel them from the party if they did. According to Gruber, Sousa Lennox's resignation did not puzzle or surprise her and she accepted it without demanding an explanation. The PA leader said: "He was offered the ministry, and we knew he would accept and resign from the party. That is why I personally accepted his resignation without delay." Sousa Lennox presented his resignation at the beginning of the week, saying that the interests of the agricultural sector and of the group of producers he represents are more important than his party's zeal.
