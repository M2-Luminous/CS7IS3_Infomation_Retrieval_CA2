In a statement where he expressed his condolences to the family of Martinez, Sison also rejected the suggestion by a rebel faction opposed to him that the current leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) could be behind the killing. He said the murder was most likely carried out by the government to sow "bloody intrigue" between the two conflicting sides within the communist movement. "There are prevalent indications that this killing is the deed of certain men who enjoy the authority and protection of the Ramos regime and who seek to sow intrigue against the national democratic movement," Sison said. He warned that unless the government desists from pitting one group within the rebel movement against the other, there would be "absolutely no basis for any kind of talks between the Manila government and the NDF." Although Sison denies being the CPP chairman, he admits to being a consultant to the NDF in its current peace efforts with the Ramos administration. In saying that the CPP had no hand in the murder of Martinez, Sison said the former rebel commander "was known to have served well the revolutionary movement and to have distanced himself from the group of Arturo Tabara." Tabara was one of four former CPP officers now facing possible trial before a "people's court" for various charges. The other three are Romulo Kintanar, Filemon Lagman and Ricardo Reyes. They have been accused of "serious crimes" such as gangsterism, gross malversation of party funds and instigation of a bloody witch hunt within the movement that led to the death of hundreds of suspected government agents. Sison said Martinez was never in the list of those accused by the CPP of serious crimes. Apart from having distanced himself from Tabara, Sison said Martinez was subsequently suspected by the former of turning against his group. "It is highly probable that a military and police group in combination with the Tabara group killed Martinez as the sacrificial lamb in the Ramos regime's scheme," he said. Sison reiterated that Tabara is known to have been a government agent since 1988. Explaining why the CPP could not have been behind the killing, Sison said, even those facing charges "are not subject to summary execution." They are guaranteed the right to due process, the very same principle which they trampled upon in committing their crimes in torturing and killing suspects in the course of the anti-informer campaigns," he said. Martinez was killed in front of his wife and three children last 2 January by men introducing themselves as government agents.
