I have the last word on the issue. There is no need to conduct discussions that do not involve me. Demirel received a delegation of ANATOLIA Agency [AA] administrators and representatives from other news agencies, headed by AA Director General Ekrem Karaismailoglu, at the Cankaya Mansion today. Demirel replied to questions on the recent political and economic developments. In reply to a question on discussions regarding the extension of the term of office of General Gures, the chief of the General Staff, Demirel said that the Turkish Armed Forces should not be dragged into polemics through such discussions. Demirel continued: The Armed Forces should not be put in the position of defending themselves, discussions should not be held on behalf of the Armed Forces, and a situation that will put the Armed Forces in such a position should not be created. I want these discussions, which have been going on for a few days now, to end. As the head of state, I am responsible for the chief of staff's appointment. I have not yet been submitted any proposals because the time is not ripe. August is the month of appointments, and we have another four months ahead. There is no need for discussions four months in advance. Let the time come, and we shall consider. What shall we consider when the time comes? We shall consider the country's interests. What shall we consider? We shall consider the legal aspects. If the legal requirements do not lend themselves to an extension, these current discussions will have been futile. If a new law is enacted, it is a different matter. These discussions, however, are futile. The issue will be considered at the appropriate time. Demirel stated that there is no such thing as irreplaceability in the Armed Forces. Recalling that the request to extend the terms of the GATA [Gulhane Academy of Military Medicine] commanders was rejected at the Supreme Military Council meeting held in March, Demirel added: The Armed Forces are the apple of our country's eye. The stronger they are, the better off we are. The strength of the Armed Forces rests on the fact that they do not depend on the irreplaceability of individuals. An institution whose officers have not become irreplaceable, an institution where new appointments can be made and the newcomers can perform their duties with efficiency is a strong institution. This was the reason for the decision made at the council's March meeting. As to the decision to be made when the time comes in August, it will be made in line with Turkey's interests. Demirel stated that the inclination of the Armed Forces is in line with the council's decision. Demirel said: Let these discussions end. I have the last word on the issue. There is no need to conduct discussions that do not involve me. Let us close this matter. All issues can be discussed in Turkey. I, however, am not convinced that futile discussions are beneficial for the country.
