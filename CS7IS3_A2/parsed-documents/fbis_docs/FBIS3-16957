Hence the obvious tension in the struggle for parliamentary seats among candidates for people's deputies. However, during the debates in the mass media and meetings with the electorate, some candidates are resorting to stirring up unhealthy passions against the Ukrainian president. In particular, rumors to the effect that Leonid Kravchuk has a summer house in Switzerland are being spread actively and deliberately. The goal of these insinuations is clear: By "exposing," in this manner, the president, who was elected as a result of nationwide elections, they are trying to picture themselves as champions of the interests of the working people. The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service states this: This theme is not new. It already surfaced during difficult periods in the history of independent Ukraine. The Ukrainian president and the mass media were even earlier approached by people seeking explanations about the gossip on the so-called "dacha issues." Both the president and the mass media have also repeatedly stated that Leonid Kravchuk does not have and has no intention of having any property outside our state. As Ukrainian president, he adheres to norms specified for the head of state by the relevant Supreme Council decision. The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service has been authorized to state that, also at present, such "revelations" regarding the Swiss dacha are nothing more than unseemly and provocative fabrications on the part of those who would like to acquire political capital by dishonest methods. This becomes even more obvious if one realizes that there are very simple and effective ways to check such information. For this, it is necessary simply to turn to the competent Swiss bodies either in Ukraine (the Swiss Embassy) or abroad and, in accordance with Swiss laws, obtain the necessary information.
