FR940928-0-00015 FR940928-0-00003 The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of fresh prunes. In comparison, this is $2.00 less than the $3.00 per ton assessment rate that was approved for the previous fiscal year. Shipments of fresh prunes for 1994 are estimated at 6,500 tons, which would yield $6,500 in assessment income. Adequate funds exists in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $22,800, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. Major expense categories for the Committees are for the administration of these marketing orders and for fresh prune research and sweet cherry market development activities. Administrative expenses include those for salaries, travel, and office operations. The stone fruit marketing Committees share office expenses, based on an agreement among the Committees. An interim final rule was published in the Federal Register [59 FR 39415, August 3, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment apply to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and prunes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committees at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change.
