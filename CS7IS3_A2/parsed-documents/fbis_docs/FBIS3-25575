The amendments to both the interim constitution and to the Electoral Act provide for greater taxation powers for provinces and guarantees that powers granted now will not be taken away once a constituent assembly sits after the April elections. They also provide for the establishment of a "volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] council" to propagate a volkstaat within the constituent assembly. The Electoral Act amendments provide for a double ballot and the extension of registration for the April elections until March 7. The amendments are due to be passed by Parliament next week. Several delegates questioned whether the council was going far enough in meeting the alliance's demands for exclusive powers. Others criticised the amendment on a volkstaat. Ciskei's Mickey Webb said the amendments could be "too little, too late". Answering his criticism, African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said he doubted it was too late. He said Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had said that even if his demands were met he would not participate in the election because it was too late to start campaigning. He said the alliance's negotiating tactics made him doubt whether they had ever been serious about taking part in an election in the first place. Mr Ramaphosa said that while Section 126 of the constitution was not being amended to create exclusive powers for provinces, other provisions meant their powers were exclusive even if the term was not used. He claimed the alliance had constantly changed the goalposts in trilateral negotiations on the issue of exclusive powers. He said that even as late as midnight on Monday, the ANC had been asked by the alliance to amend Section 126 in a new and different way. He said the alliance was being offered a provision that powers granted would not be taken away. "These powers all amount to exclusive powers because the provincial governments will take the initiative in passing legislation on these issues," he said. An amendment to Section 126 would have been superfluous. "We do have exclusive powers for provinces. The word exclusive is not used, but when it is looked at closely they are exclusive." Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said no reformulation of Section 126 was acceptable to all three parties involved in the trilateral negotiations. He said he had asked the alliance for specific proposals on Section 126 but had received none. Mr Meyer said that while negotiations with the alliance could continue, Monday was the last chance for amendments to the constitution. Answering criticism on the provision of a mechanism for the attainment of a volkstaat, Mr Meyer said a volkstaat could not be in conflict with provisions of the constitution guaranteeing fundamental human rights.
