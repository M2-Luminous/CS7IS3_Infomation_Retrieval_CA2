At a Meeting With Heads of Other States, Ion Iliescu Introduces Adrian Nastase as the Future President of Romania"] [Text] We have learned through foreign diplomatic channels and from well-documented and verified sources that Ion Iliescu, at various meetings held with leaders or prime ministers of other countries, is introducing Adrian Nastase [president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian parliament and leader of the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] as the future president of Romania. If Nastase is not present at the respective meeting, the current president is recommending him to foreign diplomats as the major partner for dialogue in his absence and the person who will accomplish the reform and the current political orientation (which is basically a neocommunist orientation!) of Romania. The respective situation should not surprise us if we recall the behavior of the president of the Chamber of Deputies in the past year: He blocked the extraordinary session of the parliament in December 1993, has come closer to the tough wing of the PDSR, and mainly, repeatedly threatened that if the opposition continues to support the idea that His Majesty Mihai I of Romania is the only solution for pulling Romania out of crisis, the party that he leads will institute a dictatorial regime. Thus, after confiscating the revolution and after pushing the country into chaos and poverty, Ion Iliescu is not letting things slide but is carefully preparing our future. Considering that at the next general elections the current president of Romania will not be able to run for office again, and that the levers of a rule-of-law state (is it indeed a rule-of-law state?) are in the hands of the ruling party, it is obvious that the PDSR president must "graduate" on time from Ion Iliescu's political school.
