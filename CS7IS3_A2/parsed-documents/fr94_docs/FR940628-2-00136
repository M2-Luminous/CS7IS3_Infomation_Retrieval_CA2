DATES: Applications for assistance will be available beginning June 28, 1994 and must be received by the appropriate HUD Office of Native American Programs by no later than 4:00 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the office where the application is submitted) on September 12, 1994. At the time of submission, one copy of the completed application must also be sent to HUD Headquarters at the address stated below. A determination that an application was received on time will be made solely on receipt of the original application at the Office of Native American Programs.

In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2506&hyph;0135. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority and Purpose The ESG program was first established in section 101(g) of Public Law 99&hyph;500 (approved October 18, 1986, 100 Stat. 1783&hyph;242), making appropriations for FY 1987 as provided in H.R. 5313. The program was reauthorized with amendments in the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;77, approved July 22, 1987, sections 411&hyph;417) (as amended, ``McKinney Act''). Section 832(f) of the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990, 42 U.S.C. 11371&hyph;11378) (NAHA), provided for the explicit eligibility of Indian tribes for ESG program assistance and established a set-aside allocation for Indian tribes that is equal to 1 percent of the amounts appropriated for the ESG Program. Funding was provided for this program in the Department's appropriation acts for fiscal years 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;507, approved November 5, 1990), 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 29, 1991), and 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992). Regulations governing the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program are found at 24 CFR 576, except where superseded by statutory amendments under NAHA and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act), as discussed below. Assistance provided to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages under this NOFA will be used to help improve the quality of existing emergency shelters for the homeless, make available additional emergency shelters, meet the costs of operating emergency shelters and of providing essential social services to homeless individuals, and help prevent homelessness. The term ``emergency shelter'' is defined in 24 CFR 576.3. This ESG set-aside allocation will increase the availability and expedite receipt of program funds to Native American communities. (1) Definition of ``Indian tribe.'' Section 832(f)(1) of NAHA provides that the definition of the term ``Indian tribe'' has the same meaning given that term in section 102(a)(17) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. An Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, group, or nation, including Alaska Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos and any Alaskan Native village, of the United States, that is considered an eligible recipient under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450) or was considered an eligible recipient under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (31 U.S.C. 6701) before repeal of that Act. Eligibility for assistance under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. (2) Emergency shelter means any facility, the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary or transitional shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of the homeless.
