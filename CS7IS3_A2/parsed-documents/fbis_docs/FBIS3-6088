At the meeting, the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa was taken up. In a joint announcement released after the meeting, it was specified that "the two sides pledged to continue their efforts for consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas, particularly on Okinawa." At a vice ministerial meeting held at the Defense Agency after the joint announcement was released, U.S. Defense Undersecretary Frank Wisner reportedly hinted at the possibility of the early return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. Since the coalition government was inaugurated, Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota; concerned cities, towns, and villages; and civic groups have been looking forward to seeing progress in talks on military base affairs. We appreciate the fact that at the first security consultative committee meeting under the new government, the United States indicated a forward-looking attitude on the return of lands being used by the U.S. forces and the abolition of military practices. When the U.S. official's remarks on the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield by end of this year were reported, Yomitan residents welcomed the report with happy expectations. However, the relocation of the parachute training area and the maintenance of functions of the adjacent communications facility are preconditions for materializing the "early return" of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. When Director General Yoneyama of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] visited the United States on 26 February, a high-raking U.S. official showed him a forward-looking attitude in connection with the return of the airfield. In view of this, it can be said that Defense Undersecretary Wisner's reported remarks were to reconfirm what the high-ranking U.S. official said to DFAA Director-General Yoneyama. About this time last year, it was constantly reported that the U.S. forces were considering relocating the parachute training area to Camp Hansen adjacent to Kin town and Ginoza village, which later objected to the relocation of the training area. Unless this issue involving both Kin town and Ginoza village is settled, Yomitan villagers will not be able to openly welcome the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. At the ministerial meeting, Foreign Minister Hata and Defense Agency Director General Aichi singled out the issues stemming from the military bases and called for the return of the Naha Port, the stoppage of live-fire exercise across highway 104, and the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. In response, Secretary of State Christopher reportedly said that he is aware of the situation. If the U.S. forces should again study possible construction of the parachuting training area in Kin town, which is calling for stopping the live-fire exercise, it would run counter to the Japan-U.S. announcement that "the two sides pledged to continue their efforts for consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas." The two governments have to bring those issues to a satisfactory settlement with the outcome of the ministerial meeting confirming that each military base issue is an important issue to be solved. The Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, which was originally started as a vice ministerial-level meeting, was upgraded to a ministerial meeting in December 1990. The two sides held the first ministerial meeting recently with the goal of reconfirming the two countries' stand of maintaining the Japan-U.S. security system amid worsening bilateral economic and trade relations. On the issue of military bases on Okinawa, the joint announcement says: "The continued harmonious use of facilities and areas by U.S. forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence and to the readiness of U.S. forces in Japan." We believe that maintaining harmonious relations between towns and villages is also indispensable in addition to harmonious relations between the locals and U.S. forces. The Yomitan Village Office has already mapped out its own plan for use of lands after their return. But before that, it is necessary to solve such issues as land ownership involving former land owners and farmers who are tacitly allowed to engage in farming in the area of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. At the same time, it is necessary to take this opportunity to give impetus to moves calling for the return of military bases and the solution of issues resulting from military exercises.
