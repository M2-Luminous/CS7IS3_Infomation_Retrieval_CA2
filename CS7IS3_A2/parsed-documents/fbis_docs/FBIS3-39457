This was confirmed by the German liaison command with the Western Group of Russian Forces in Berlin on Wednesday [16 February]. In view of the high risk, the Bundeswehr demands immediate clarification. It was stated that the missing ammunition cannot be found on any list. According to an official statement by Matvey Burlakov, the commander in chief of the Russian forces in eastern Germany, the ammunition was used up at training sites, said Bundeswehr Lieutenant Commander Klaus Heermeier. However, he thinks that this is completely unlikely. [passage omitted]
