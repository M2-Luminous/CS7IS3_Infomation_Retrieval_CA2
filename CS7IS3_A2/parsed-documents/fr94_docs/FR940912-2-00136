FR940912-2-00136 FR940912-2-00093 The CNG/Sabine Center will introduce the ``super-hub'' concept by offering services at points along the 7,400 mile pipeline system of CNGT, a wholly-owned pipeline subsidiary of Consolidated. The Application states that the use of the CNGT pipeline system would be under the open-access provisions of Order 636 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as now applicable to CNGT. Initial services to be provided by the Partnership will consist of an intra-hub transfer service, a market activity reporting service, and a transportation, parking and short-term storage agency service. In addition, other gas market center services may also be offered at the CNG/Sabine Center to meet the evolving needs of the natural gas industry. The Application states that the proposed activities of the Partnership satisfy the requirements of either Section 2 (a) or (b) of the Gas Related Activities of 1990. CNG Energy proposes to raise funds to invest in CNGMC, and CNGMC in turn proposes to raise funds to invest in the Partnership, by (i) selling shares of its respective common stock ($1,000 par value each in the case of CNG Energy and $10,000 par value each in the case of CNGMC) to the issuer's immediate parent; (ii) open account advances from the borrower's immediate parent, or the CNG System Money Pool (``Money Pool''); 2 and/or (iii) long-term loans from the borrower's immediate parent, in any combination thereof, provided that the amounts and terms of CNG Energy to CNGMC financing (or Money Pool in the case of open account advances) shall be the mirror image of the same respective type of Consolidated to CNG Energy financings. CNGMC proposes to become a full participant to the Money Pool. 2 The Application states that the Money Pool was authorized by Commission order dated June 12, 1986 (HCAR No. 24128). The open account advances and long-term loans will have the same effective terms and interest rates as related borrowings of Consolidated in the forms listed below: (1) Open account advances may be made to the borrower to provide working capital. Open account advances may be made, repaid and remade on a revolving basis, and all such open account advances will be repaid on or before a date not more than one year from the date of the first advance to such borrower with interest at the same effective rate of interest as Consolidated's weighted average effective rate of commercial paper and/or revolving credit borrowings. If no such borrowings are outstanding, then the interest rate shall be predicated on the Federal Funds' effective rate of interest as quoted daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Such advances may be made through the Money Pool. (2) Consolidated or CNG Energy may make long-term loans to its respective immediate subsidiary, CNG Energy Or CNGMC, for the financing of its activities described herein. Loans shall be evidenced by long-term non-negotiable notes of the borrower (documented by book entry only) maturing over a period of time (not in excess of 30 years), with the interest rate predicated on and equal to Consolidated's cost of funds for comparable borrowings. In the event Consolidated has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates will be tied to the Salomon Brothers Inc. indicative rate for comparable debt issuances published in Salomon Brothers Inc. Bond Market Roundup or similar publication on the date nearest to the time of takedown. All loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Application states that Consolidated will obtain the funds required for CNG Energy through internal cash generation, issuance of long-term debt securities, borrowings under credit agreements or through other authorizations approved by the Commission subsequent to the effective date of this Application. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
