A declaration is expected to be issued at the conclusion of the talks in Amman tonight on the establishment of a joint cooperation committee to implement the financial, monetary, and banking policies until the central Palestinian monetary body has been established. This declaration is an alternative to the PLO's refusal to sign a joint economic agreement, which has been awaiting its approval for over two months. This declaration gives Jordan the green light to reopen branches of its banks in the West Bank. However, the kingdom is more eager to reach a comprehensive economic agreement without isolating the issue of the banks, as an authoritative Jordanian source said. The joint declaration will include broad outlines on the use of the Jordanian dinar in the occupied territory and the establishment of banks specialized in development in the fields of housing, industry, and agriculture, and will encourage investments without discussing details as was the case in the joint economic agreement. The Palestinian side has also committed itself to participation in the six joint committees as soon as possible.
