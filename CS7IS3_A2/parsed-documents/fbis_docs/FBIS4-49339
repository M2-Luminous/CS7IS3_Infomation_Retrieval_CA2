Ryo Man Chol, 48, a former police officer from Hamhung province, his wife and three children, were kept at a secret location in Hong Kong while applying for political asylum in South Korea. The South Korean consulate is refusing to release details of where the family stayed in Hong Kong and it is not known how they managed to elude Chinese authorities for weeks while travelling by train from northern China to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is not commenting on the Ryo family's ordeal, fearing that they could be the first trickle in a potential flood of refugees from hardship-stricken North Korea entering the territory via China. A Security Branch spokesman said: "We cannot give out information on this sort of case because it is very sensitive and involves other countries." The spokesman refused to detail how the Ryo family entered Hong Kong, saying the Government did not want to publicise how it was done for fear of encouraging other defectors -- including thousands already thought to be living in China -- to make Hong Kong a pipeline to a fresh start in South Korea. At a press conference in Seoul yesterday, the Ryo family told of how they decided it was better to risk being killed while escaping than face slow starvation at home. A spokesman for South Korea's National Security Planning Agency told Eastern Express that agency officers had spent the past two days questioning the Ryos to establish that they were genuine defectors and not spies. Ryo said an ethnic Korean named Kim who helped them on arriving in China first suggested they go for help to the South Korean embassy in Beijing. Deciding Beijing was too dangerous they fled into northern China across the frozen Yalu River and went to Shenyang, where they met Kim, before moving south by train. Ryo, who said he was sacked from the police force for taking a bribe over a traffic violation, had been listening to banned South Korean broadcasts for several months before deciding to defect. The family decided to steal across the river on the pretext of gathering food. Ryo's daughter Gum Ju, 20, and one of his sons, Gum Ryong, 18, went first to make sure the ice would hold. They made it and on March 16, sent a telegram saying all was well. Ryo, his wife, Li Ok Gum, 45, and their other son, Un Ryong, 16, followed. Li, 45, a kindergarten teacher, cried as she told how her family had been forced to subsist on corn and pine-bark porridge since last August, when food rations ran out. "We were so hungry that I had to go to the countryside and beg for grains," she said. Ryo said revolution was imminent because the Kim Il Sung regime was unable to feed its people. His account matches the tales of other northern defectors but has met with scepticism from some analysts in Seoul, who say the South has its own propaganda agenda. Visitors to Pyongyang say they have not noticed food shortages. However, its government has admitted to "economic problems".
