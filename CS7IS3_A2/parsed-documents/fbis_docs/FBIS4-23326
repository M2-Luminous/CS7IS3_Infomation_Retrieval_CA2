The assurance was given in Blantyre today by the permanent secretary of the British Overseas Development Administration, Mr. (John Burke) when he held discussions with the vice president, the Right Honorable Justin Malewezi and the minister of finance, Hon. Aleke Banda. Speaking to MBC, Mr. (Burke) said his government was pleased with the peaceful transition in Malawi to a multiparty democracy and wishes to reaffirm its support for this country. Mr. (Burke), however, pointed out that further development aid will depend on the new government's determination to tighten controls in public spending, crack down on corruption, respect for human rights, liberalization of markets, and other initiatives which, he said, are crucial to all developing countries. On his part, the vice president said the UDF government will exercise prudence in its accountability of public resources, as promised in its manifesto. Hon. Malewezi also disclosed that the government has already ordered the auditing of books in the civil service, a practice which, he said, was largely neglected in the former government.
