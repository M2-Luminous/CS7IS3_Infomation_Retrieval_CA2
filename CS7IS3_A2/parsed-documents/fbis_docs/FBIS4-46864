'Clannishness' Has Begun"] [Text] Kiev-Lvov--On the very first day of the session of the new Supreme Council, it became clear that the flow of Ukrainian politics had ultimately split into two streams--the one that is next to the microphone and the one that is beyond it. The first works for the benefit of television, whereas the second works for the benefit of history. At the front stage, next to the microphone, a provisional presidium consisting of the representatives of leftist, rightist, and centrist forces was elected in a traditional manner. Meanwhile, in the space away from the microphone, the civilized process of the formation of parliamentary factions and groups of deputies went on. The Supreme Council gave its preference to the association of people's deputies on the basis of their political sympathies rather than along regional or clan lines, thus breaking down the walls between oblast delegations and setting the minimum strength of a faction at 25 persons. This was a favorable solution not only because it would stop the "Brownian motion" characteristic of the previous Supreme Council, but also because, having structured itself, the parliament will for the first time reveal to the voters its true, although terrifying, identity. Small deputy groups which do not have the needed 25 persons will be forced to choose between ideologically similar allies and the heroic fate of Don Quixote. It appears that the new reality will alter the party array of Ukrainian politics beyond recognition. No trace of the old parties will remain half a year from now. New political bearings will call for new leaders. The formation of the Reforms deputy group, in which two reformist centers joined, is considered to be the most prominent among the latest events away from the microphone. The centers had peacefully drifted through Ukrainian politics without drawing closer to each other prior to that. Two presidents--of the Market Reforms Foundation and the Foundation in Support of Reforms--Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, united in a single parliamentary group, having neglected the intense issues of leadership. Serhiy Sobolev (the We electoral association from Zaporozhye) became the coordinator of the bloc. Rule-of-law democracy and economic reform are the political priorities of the Lanovyy-Pynzenyk alliance; their accomplishment is guaranteed by lawyers, economists, and politicians well known in Ukraine who became members of the Reforms deputy group--Serhiy Holovatyy, Viktor Shyshkin, Taras Stetskiv, and Hryhoriy Omelchenko. It is paradoxical, but a few deputies who were supported during the election by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists] signed the statement on the creation of the Reforms group. Having covered all of Ukraine, from the Donbass to the Carpathian Mountains, with authoritative individuals, the Reforms group has firmly taken the position of the political center. The prototype of the Statehood deputy group, with which 16 deputies announced their affiliation as of 13 May, is found to the right of the Reforms. A group of deputies who are URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] members initiated the creation of the group. Statehood includes deputies from Right-Bank Ukraine and focuses its attention on preserving the integrity of Ukraine and separating it from the Russian umbilical cord. If the group fails to reach the 25-person cutoff, most of its members will undoubtedly migrate to the Pynzenyk-Lanovyy alliance. An association that survived under the rubble of the MBR [Interregional Bloc for Reforms] and merged with the remnants of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in the Unity group shows the opposite tendency. Valeriy Babych, who inherited from the MBR a program of federalization and the closest possible relations with Moscow, was destined to become its leader rather than Hrynyov or Kuchma. Contrary to its name, the Unity group is a motley, unstable parliamentary creation in whose entrails the replenishment for adjacent parliamentary groups will always be growing. As of 17 March, the documents of the MDF-Center faction, headed by Leonid Kuchma--yet another MBR splinter--were also sitting in the secretariat of the Supreme Council. The Center deputy group promises to be the heavy artillery of Ivan Plyushch on the parliamentary front. Its foundation consists of the party of power of all hues, which has roots in the most remote nooks and crannies of our state. This association will suffice for two parliamentary groups. The Plyushch party will certainly take advantage of this, considering that two groups mean two votes in the presidium. The quality of the cadre composition of the Communist-Socialist-Peasant swarm of people's deputies dictates its own laws of association in the left wing of the Supreme Council. More respectable Socialists might want to dissociate themselves from the clamorous Communist limited-liability company, but they are lacking five or six individuals in order to form a faction. They would have taken in several of the most reasonable Communists, but Lenin's tribe would not want to palm off less than 20 on them, fearing an independent game of the Moroz party. The Communist Party has decided not to go for small change and to face the parliamentary trial as the monolithic bloc For Social Justice and People's Power (95 persons). In turn, it is very doubtful that there will be enough radicals to create their own group. They will hardly scrape up 25 persons even if the combined UKRP [Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party], the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] and all nationally concerned Rukh members (of the Host of Volyn kind) belong to it. The KUN with its deputies firmly sat down between two stools. They will now either have to place themselves under Khmara, having ultimately left the democratic camp, or honestly join the pole of Statehood, having forsaken nationalist principles. Actually, it will be both. Understandably, this current in the parliament will not transcend the borders of Western Ukraine, as it remains a single-region, marginal problem. While lively packs of deputies from more abundant blocs vigorously milled around the hallways, the "heroes of all times and nations" remained in ominous solitude. As always, Rukh is in a haze. God only knows whom its people will join. The bright star of Serhiy Holovatyy is already shining in someone else's sky. The radicals are looking toward the door; Ivan Zayets is quarreling with the "great hetman"; it is unknown what is next. The migration of deputies in the corridors revealed what it should have revealed--an array of forces in Ukraine to which no external movements and parties correspond. There is a clearly defined liberal center, which has struck equally powerful roots in the east and the west. The spectrum between Lanovyy and Pynzenyk holds everything--from Donetsk to Lvov. The post-Communist camp is to the left of them. Geographically, this means the center of the Right Bank and the Left Bank. Politically, it means the party of power and its immediate environs all the way to the Labor Congress. Further on, the steppes of the Left Bank and the south are represented by leftist extremists drawing on a powerful stratum of the local Russian-speaking underclass. Ukrainian national democrats who cultivate the political values of statehood, that is, Christian-Democratic values in European terms, are located to the right of the center, to the right of the steep bank of the Dnieper. All key Ukrainian parties have placed themselves under this common denominator. The extreme radicals rave on the left and right banks. Those on the Right Bank draw on the "nationally aware" underclass which is socially symmetrical to its Donbass counterpart but is separated from it by an insurmountable barrier of "nationalist" demagoguery on one side and "internationalist" demagoguery on the other. Amid all of this, the pro-Russian camp proper, which is concerned about just one problem--how to go back to the condition from before 1 December--springs about on the Left Bank. This company embraces everything--from the Civic Congress to what remains of the MBR. The system of factions in the new parliament that was approved right away will force our politicians to occupy a niche in one of the blocs one way or the other, and will thus slow down the process of "building a party for yet another charismatic leader," which will be worse for the leaders and better for the people. So far, this process has developed in the space away from the microphone. However, it will shortly reverberate in the parliament one way or the other.
