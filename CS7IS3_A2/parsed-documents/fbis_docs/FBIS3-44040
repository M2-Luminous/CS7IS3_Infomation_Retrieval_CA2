Recently, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] government came under intense criticism from both the opposition Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] movement and the UN representative in Mozambique for not sending its troops into the UN assembly areas as fast as the former rebels of Renamo were doing. But now it seems the government is at last getting its act together, as Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo. The movement of government soldiers into UN assembly areas increased dramatically over the last week. Since last Monday, 1,500 Frelimo troops have arrived in assembly areas across the country, compared to a mere 60 in the first two weeks of 1994. Many UN observers, who had been twiddling their thumbs in previously deserted assembly areas, finally had some work to do, as the first Frelimo troops showed up. Aldo Ajello told a Maputo press conference yesterday that he was satisfied with the speed with which government forces were assembling. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama had threatened to paralyze the peace process unless he had received an explanation by today from President Chissano as to what was going on. In the light of the improved situation, that threat seems to have been quietly forgotten, but as so often in the Mozambican peace process, it is a case of two steps forward, one step back. Today, the problem of funding for Renamo resurfaced. Afonso Dhlakama told the first edition of the independent SAVANA newspaper that money that had been promised to Renamo by the international community to assist the former rebels as they attempt to transform themselves into a political party was still not forthcoming. Dhlakama laid down another ultimatum: If there is no money by February, he told SAVANA, Renamo will not contest the elections. In the past, Dhlakama's bark has proved worse than his bite. The donors meeting in Maputo on Monday will [words indistinct] bear his words in mind.
