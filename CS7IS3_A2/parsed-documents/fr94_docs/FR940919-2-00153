FR940919-2-00153 FR940919-2-00062 [Docket No. 50&hyph;458&hyph;OLA; ASLBP No. 93&hyph;680&hyph;04&hyph;OLA] Atomic Safety and Licensing Board; Hearing September 13, 1994. In the Matter of: Gulf States Utilities Co., et al. River Bend Station, Unit 1. Before Administrative Judges: B. Paul Cotter, Jr., Chairman Dr. Richard F. Cole Dr. Peter S. Lam This proceeding concerns two license amendments for the River Bend Station, a nuclear facility located in Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. The amendments: (1) Authorize Gulf States Utilities Company to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation; and (2) designate Entergy Operations, Inc. as a new licensee to operate, manage, and maintain River Bend. In response to a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, 58 FR 36,423, 36,435&hyph;36 (1993), Cajun Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Cajun) petitioned to intervene in this proceeding. On December 16, 1993, the NRC Staff issued the license amendments requested, and on January 27, 1994 an NRC Licensing Board admitted Cajun as an intervener (LBP&hyph;94&hyph;3, 39 NRC 3). The decision to admit Cajun was subsequently affirmed by the Commission on August 24, 1994 (CLI&hyph;94&hyph;10, 39 NRC XX ). Please take notice that a hearing will be conducted in this proceeding. Matters currently at issue are Cajun's contention that the proposed license amendments may result in a reduction in the margin of safety at River Bend caused by underfunding of the facility. During the course of the proceeding, the Board may hold prehearing conferences, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.752, as well as evidentiary hearing sessions, at times and places to be announced hereafter, through notices published in the Federal Register and made available at the Public Document Rooms noted below. In accordance with 10 CFR 2.715(a), any person, not a party to the proceeding, will be permitted to submit a written limited appearance statement setting forth his or her position on the issues. These statements, which may be submitted at any time during the proceeding, do not constitute testimony or evidence but may assist the Board and the parties in defining the issues to be considered. Persons desiring to submit a limited appearance statement should transmit any such statement to the Office of the Secretary, Docketing and Service Branch, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555. A copy of such statements should also be served on the Chairman of this Licensing Board. At a later date, the Board will consider whether or not to hold a session in which to hear oral limited appearance statements. Documents related to this proceeding are available for public inspection at the NRC Document Room, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20555, and at the local public document room, Louisiana State University, Troy H.
