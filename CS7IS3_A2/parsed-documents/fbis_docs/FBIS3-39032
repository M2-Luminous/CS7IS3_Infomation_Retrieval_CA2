Decentralize Tax Yields -- Taxes will not be decided and collected by the government only. Half of them will end up in Rome and the other half will be set and administered by the regions and the municipalities, which until now do not have any responsibility. The local authorities will thus have to be directly responsible for the services rendered to the citizens in proportion to the taxes raised. This project will be easy to realize because it already exists in federal states like the United States, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. End to the Fiscal Jungle -- The system of the thousand heavy taxes which obsesses taxpayers will be drastically simplified. Local income tax, ICIAP [local tax for professionals], health tax, various health contributions, regional surtaxes. The tax system will also be simplified because a shopkeeper should not be required to carry out the same bureaucratic tasks as a large company. The financial administration will be called to undertake a major effort to hit evaders with maximum severity, but also to provide reimbursements in time. Less Tax for Everyone -- Our companies are the most heavily taxed in Western Europe. The tax rate will be reduced from 52.3 to 40 percent. Receipts can be maintained at the same level by simply doing away with the laws which favor tax dodging and removing provisions for special categories and reductions like the one which [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi had made to measure in order not to pay tax on assets allocated to TV from 1985 to 1990. There is also a need to untax social security contributions and reduce indirect burdens for all those activities (like many craft activities) where the income is below the average. Another need is for incentives for companies to take on registered unemployed persons or workers looking for their first jobs. Taxes on Treasury Certificates and Wealth Worth -- These are categorically excluded, even if the tax on government securities and bonds will be standardized at 12.50 percent. The hard line of the Communist Renewal which insists on a "wealth tax" will be softened. Taxes on Shares -- This is the magician's trick which has backfired. Visco assures people that there will not be a worsening in relations with the stock exchange, but at the same time he states that he will shift the tax burden from the companies to the companies' owners, that is, onto the shareholders. In short a program which, on paper, can please the worker as much as [industrialist] Agnelli. And indeed the day before yesterday, Mandrake-Occhetto came out triumphant from his meeting with the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of Lombardy] industrialists: "We have passed the exam," he announced in a conference. It is a pity that the economy is not just a conjuror's illusion.
