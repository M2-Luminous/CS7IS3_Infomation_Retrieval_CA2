Upon his return to Honduras, Paz also said the 110 members of the Nonaligned Movement support Honduras' candidacy for the UN Security Council seat, which is up for election in October. During the recent nonaligned meeting in Egypt, Paz was invited to visit Cuba by his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina. The Honduran minister would not say whether he had accepted the invitation. The foreign minister said: Cuba must show signs of democratization in order to return to the OAS, and the rest of the inter-American community must be "flexible" in efforts to normalize the Cuban and Haitian situations. He noted: "We support the democratization process in Cuba and the restoration of democracy in Haiti." The foreign minister indicated that both cases must be resolved peacefully within the framework of the OAS. In the case of Haiti, the United States has proposed that Central America become a sanctuary for those fleeing from Haiti, but at the last meeting of the region's presidents, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said the United States "called on the wrong place." In Honduras' Caribbean region, there are more than 50 Haitians who do not want to stay in the country and have asked the government for visas to travel to either the United States or Canada. Honduras broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in the 1960's.
