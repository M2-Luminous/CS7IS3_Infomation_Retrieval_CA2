Bernd Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in the Research Ministry, said that cooperation projects in research and development are profitable for both sides. Neumann announced that during his government talks, which will begin in Moscow on Monday [30 May], three new technical agreements are to be concluded on water and environmental research as well as on biotechnology. In addition, the final discussion about an agreement on ocean and polar research is planned. Particularly in the fields of space flight, ocean and polar research, and laser technology Russian scientists have large know-how. An outstanding example for successful cooperation in space flight is the joint development with Japan of the "Express" retrievable space capsule. At the international level, Germany is involved in the International Economic and Technology Center in Moscow, which was founded at the initiative of the German foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state. The institute is to open up new opportunities of employment to Russian scientists, who have so far worked in weapons development. The international association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists form the independent states of the former Soviet Union (INTAS) in Brussels, which works in the civilian sector and has the same goal, is also supported by Germany beyond its contribution to the European Union. At the national level Bonn will spend about 37.5 million marks [DM] by the end of 1994 for a science support program, which was initiated in 1992. In addition, Russian scientists are involved in more than 100 projects for technical programs, which are financed by the Research Ministry with DM240 million.
