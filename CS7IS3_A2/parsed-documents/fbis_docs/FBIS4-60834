It had been thought that the agreement on a cease-fire would come into force. However, according to news agency reports, last night was not a quiet one. Today the Russian Foreign Ministry sent the following explanation. It says, and I quote: It proved impossible to draft the agreement on a cease-fire from midnight last night, although generally positive, but differing replies have been received from Baku and Stepanakert. The response from Nagorno-Karabakh, the Foreign Ministry says, does not accord with Russia's latest specific proposal. Russia is, however, continuing its efforts to bring the positions closer together.
