The government has prepared a detailed list of individuals delinquent in repaying loans showing that they owe a total of 62 billion rupees. Reportedly, up to now 700 million rupees have been repaid to banks and other financial institutions. According to press reports, the candidacy papers of 63 individuals who wanted to run for National Assembly seats from various parts of the country have been rejected because these individuals did not repay their loans and their names appeared in the list of delinquents. These individuals will not be able to participate in the elections. Twenty-six of these individuals whose candidacy papers have been rejected because of delinquency are residents of Punjab; eighteen are from Sindh; six from the Frontier Province and twelve belong to federally administered tribal areas or "FATA" [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]; the candidacy papers of ten individuals were accepted on the condition that the individuals would repay their loans to the bank or financial institution within the legally designated time. The people in general have expressed their approval of the actions taken to end the curse of drug addiction. These measures were approved in a meeting of the federal cabinet and included certain legal amendments which will allow the immediate arrest of individuals involved in drug dealing and smuggling and the confiscation of tbeir goods and property. Such individuals could also be sentenced to death. At the same time, laws enforced in other parts of the country would apply to federally administered tribal areas as well. The jurisdiction of the special court which hears drug smuggling cases has been extended to the FATA areas. In order to end the curse of drugs, the civilian control of the special task force has been given to the Army thus making the military responsible for dealing with the drug mafia. The government of the Frontier Province has declared a dozen individuals who were suspected of connections with the drug mafia unqualified to participate in the elections. Three of these twelve individuals are former members of the national assembly. Everyone is aware of the ignominy suffered by the nation and the country as a result of the black drug trade. Drug addicts in Pakistan are the living dead whose families face great hardship; these pitiful families are a common sight on every street and alley. The black wealth of drug dealers and smugglers has promoted various forms of evil in the society and overwhelmed the respectable members of society so that now the entire society is a hostage to "money". No one cares whether the money has been acquired by putting in jeopardy someone else's honor or life. The merchants of evil and death are now the nouveau riche who, in order to ply their illicit trade, do not hesitate to destroy human values and the dignity of the country and the nation. Some of the drug dealers have acquired greater influence and power by marrying into prominent families, whereas others have tried to gain power by winning elections as the candidates of political parties. This time as well, merchants of evil were expected to use their black wealth to run in the elections; however, the measures taken by the caretaker government may prevent them from doing so. The actions of the caretaker prime minister and the caretaker government deserve commendation. Ten or 15 years ago, there were no drug addicts in Pakistan nor were there any drug producers. Today, there are 2.5 or 3 million drug addicts in Pakistan. According to a CIA report, over the last 15 years, Pakistan has changed from a corridor or way station for the drug trade into a large scale producer of narcotics. Obviously, when narcotics are prepared on a large scale, its use will increase as well; thus, the number of drug addicts has increased over this period. According to the statistics available, illegal drug trade brings an annual profit of $120 billion. This huge sum has strengthened to an overwhelming degree the power of evil. The great wealth which narcotics dealers have acquired now gives them the power to attempt everything possible to ensure the continuation of their business. On the face of it, the cultivation and preparation of opium is forbidden in Pakistan, but in reality, the opium poppy is planted on 8170 hectares and about 100 modern factories in remote tribal areas produce heroin from opium. Opium grown in Pakistan as well as opium from Afghanistan is brought to these factories and a total of 70 metric tons of pure heroin is produced annually. Two thirds of the total heroin produced is used in Pakistan so that now there are 2.5 to 3 million addicts in this country. Opium, hashish and heroin are produced in the remote areas of the Frontier Province and distributed throughout the country. When the drug Mafia is unable to send a shipment of heroin to the Middle East, Iran, Turkey, Europe or the U.S., it sells the entire quantity locally in Pakistan and thus keeps the domestic addicts supplied with heroin. Actually, one could say that the heroin and narcotics prepared in Pakistan pose a greater danger to this country than to Europe or the U. S. Up to 1979, very few people in Pakistan were aware of heroin addiction, but, gradually, the addiction spread. Whenever addicts were caught, they generally told the same story to the effect that an individual gave them free heroin to smoke and when they became addicted to the narcotic, he began to charge them for the heroin. Such statements and stories appeared in many newspapers. Organizations and departments formed to control drugs have failed to do so generally because they have seized drugs now and then for the sake of appearance and in order to have the photographs of such seizures appear in the press. The fact is that to be able to control narcotics, it is necessary to stop the cultivation of opium and the production of heroin and to arrest and punish the prominent drug dealers who control the business but these measures have not been taken. Past governments acting under emotional or foreign pressure prepared impressive plans to end the curse of drugs and made tall claims but did nothing. Departments in charge of drug control do exist but their performance is zero and one reason is the black wealth of drug dealers which is spent relentlessly in order to allow the black drug trade to continue. Departments in charge of controlling drugs should be made effective and active and, at the same time, measures should be taken to make chemicals and other paraphernalia used in heroin production unavailable in Pakistan at any price. These chemicals are imported from outside. More effective measures than those taken in the past are required to stop the cultivation of the opium poppy in the Frontier Province. Cultivators should be encouraged to plant other crops instead of opium and the government should make up the resulting financial loss to the cultivators. The objective should be to make better use of the aid Pakistan receives from Europe and the U. S. in this connection and to phase out the cultivation of the opium poppy gradually. The hundred or more heroin producing factories should be destroyed otherwise it will not be possible to eradicate drug addiction.
