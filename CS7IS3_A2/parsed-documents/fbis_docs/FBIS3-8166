Does the recent measure correspond to your ideas of energetic action? [Woerner] It is a first and, as I believe, very useful step, which, however, must be followed by others. Military action is not a purpose in itself. The goal must remain, and that is improving the safety of the people -- in all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and contributing to a peaceful agreement among the parties. [Bertram] The military intervention by NATO may have started some movement in this respect. Do you think that further military steps by the West are necessary? [Woerner] For me, it is not military steps that are in the foreground but the political efforts -- and at all levels: at the level of the United Nations, then at the level of the two big powers United States and Russia, but also at the level of the NATO members. These political steps will, however, be successful only if they continue to be accompanied by the determination of taking military measures when necessary and wherever nothing else helps. In this respect, our primary concern in NATO is that we do not gamble away the reputation we have gained by precipitate and insufficiently planned operations. We are engaged in some sort of tightrope walk here. On the one hand, the stimulus must not be lost. We must use it. What we have done in Sarajevo must not remain a unique operation. On the other hand, what is done now must be planned just as thoroughly and must then be implemented with equal determination -- perhaps with different methods. [Bertram] Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, is calling for more ground forces. He needs an additional 3,000-5,000 blue helmets just to stabilize the situation in and around Sarajevo. What are the prospects of getting these 3,000-5,000 men from the NATO countries? [Woerner] I fully sympathize with General Rose and he has my support -- first, for the determined way in which he is acting and second, for his demand for more troops. However, I do not see where they are supposed to come from at the moment. I get the impression that our member countries, which are already providing the majority of troops there, are very restrained in this respect. [Bertram] If there is something like a private opinion of the secretary general, who is German: Are you convinced of Boon's arguments that German soldiers must not or should not get more actively involved in peacekeeping in Bosnia? [Woerner] My personal opinion: Most of these arguments have not convinced me. I have never considered the constitutional argument correct, and the other arguments must be weighed carefully. However, I would be very restrained about using German ground forces in areas where German troops operated in World War II. This applies in particular to the areas where we are dealing with Serbs. This is a necessary consideration. [Bertram] There are also other possibilities.... [Woerner] There are other possibilities, in which I would recommend to be more generous. [Bertram] If the West does not send any more troops, will then Russia not be virtually invited to jump into the breach? How do you assess Russia's role in this conflict? [Woerner] One will be able to come to a final assessment of Russia's role only when it is clear how the Russians themselves define their role. I hope very much that they do not understand themselves as the Serbs' protective power but as a power that is trying to tackle the problem impartially. [Bertram] Do you welcome the presence of Russian troops in Bosnia? [Woerner] When some people complain today that Russia is becoming active there, I do not share this view at all. First, I think it is unavoidable. Second, I even think it is helpful since it has been done with the intention of making the Serbs give in. I believe that we have to include the Russians in such a way that they continue to use their influence in the spirit of a solution that is acceptable for all parties. [Bertram] And what if they do not let themselves be included? Does Moscow then have a veto right? [Woerner] It is out of the question that Russia is going to gain a certain influence on the actions of NATO. We have done what we considered appropriate and correct, following a decision by all our member states, and we will continue to do so. We are ready and interested in cooperating with the Russians and also in consulting them. However, the Russians are not a member of NATO. And just as Russia has interests, this also applies to NATO. One must not confuse Russia's welcome role as a participating big power with a right to veto NATO actions. [Bertram] The West has for a long time hesitated about getting militarily involved in the Balkans. Is NATO now irrevocably involved -- after the ultimatum and after the enforcement of the flight ban? [Woerner] I think so. This was unavoidable anyway; this just had to come. This is also part of NATO's tasks in our time. We are the only functioning collective defense alliance in the world. We are the central factor of stability for all of Europe. One cannot just claim this role, but one must make a specific contribution in situations of crisis. We have done this and we will continue to do so. [Bertram] Do you sometimes ask -- perhaps with a bit of bitterness -- why action was taken only now? What could have been avoided if action had been taken earlier? [Woerner] Here I once again answer as Manfred Woerner and not as secretary general. I do indeed ask myself this question -- more and more every day. My own conviction was and is: Timely intervention would very probably have prevented an expansion of the conflict and would have facilitated a political solution. At least, now we have taken determined action.
