FR940707-2-00165 FR940707-2-00091 [Docket No. 50&hyph;336] Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;21, issued to the Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the Licensee), for operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to change the Administrative Controls section to require an individual who serves as the Operations Manager to either hold a Millstone Unit 2 senior reactor operator (SRO) license or have an SRO license at another pressurized water reactor (PWR). If the Operating Manager does not hold a Millstone Unit 2 SRO license, then an individual serving as the Assistant Operations Manager would be required to possess an SRO license at Millstone Unit 2. The proposed change would permit Millstone Unit 2 to accelerate efforts to strengthen the Millstone Unit 2 Operations Department. Exigent action is justified in order to permit the licensee to proceed with their efforts to strengthen the Millstone Unit 2 Operations Department in a prompt and decisive manner. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change affects an administrative control, which was based on the guidance of ANSI N18.1&hyph;1971. ANSI N18.1&hyph;1971 recommended that the Operations Manager hold an SRO license. The current guidance in Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS&hyph;3.1&hyph;1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license for a similar unit and the Operations Middle Manager hold an SRO license. While the Operations Middle Manager position does not exist at Millstone Unit No. 2, we are proposing to create the position of Assistant Operations Manager (staffed by an individual with an SRO license at Millstone Unit No. 2). This individual will be required to meet the requirements for, and will have responsibilities as recommended in ANSI/ANS&hyph;3.1&hyph;1987 for the Operations Middle Manager position.
