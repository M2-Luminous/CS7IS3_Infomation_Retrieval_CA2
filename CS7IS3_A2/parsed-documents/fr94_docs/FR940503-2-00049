Liberty Pipeline Project: Second Notice of Postponement of Draft Environmental Impact Statement April 26, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) staff notifies all parties that Liberty Pipeline Company (LPC) filed a request on April 5, 1994, to suspend work on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) of the Liberty Pipeline Project (Liberty Project). LPC states that the postponement for at least 90 days is necessary to change the upstream Liberty Project facilities in response to changing market requirements. We regret any difficulties to the public and all parties and agencies that might result from this second revision by the Liberty Project applicants to the proposed project. After the Commission's staff receives and analyzes the information in the forthcoming amended applications, it will announce an EIS schedule as soon as it is practicable. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
