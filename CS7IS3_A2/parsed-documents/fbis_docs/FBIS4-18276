Everything needs to be rebuilt in that devastated country, making Bosnia the biggest market in the world for public works, President of the Sarajevo Chamber of Commerce Mensur Smajlovic said Thursday. A cooperation agreement was signed Thursday by Smajlovic and his Paris counterpart Bernard Cambournac to help the ravaged economy and the emergence of a private sector. Projects should include cooperation in trade and manufacture, the transfer of engineering and banking know-how, advice to companies on reorientating themselves to Western markets, and training programmes. Further talks were expected Thursday evening with French companies at a meeting organised by the employers' confederation CNPF. A group of French industrialists is due to visit Sarajevo in the next few weeks to assess priorities, with advice from the French military which has a large presence in Bosnia's UN Protection Force. A delegation has already been sent by the French ministry of defence to work out ways of assessing damage quickly, a ministry official said. Thursday's Paris visit also came a day after the United Nations named the American William Eagleton as international coordinator for reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian delegation, invited to Paris by French Defence Minister Francois Leotard, outlined the terrible toll taken by three years of economic blockade and two years of war. Smajlovic estimated the loss to the country's gross domestic product at more than $15 billion and the loss of world exports at $5 billion over three years. In Sarajevo alone, 500,000 apartments have been destroyed and most roads, bridges, tunnels and water supply systems in the republic are unusable. Several hundred factories are also out of use. Damage on the railways is put at between $300 and 500 million. Rebuilding the most important line, between Sarajevo and Ploce, would cost around $15 million, he said. The director-general of Bosnian telecommunications, Hajrudin Suman, put the damage to the telephone network at a total $2.5 billion. Around $100 million worth of aid has already allowed some parts of the system to go back into operation, he said.
