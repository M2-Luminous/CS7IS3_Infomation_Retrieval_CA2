FBIS3-24660 "cr00000008594001" 16 February 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-023--SYRIA SYRIA: NEWSPAPER TREATMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S STATEMENT Syrian press coverage of the joint press conference held by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad at the conclusion of their summit meeting in Geneva on 16 January suggests that Damascus sought to achieve at least two objectives in its coverage: to emphasize the comprehensiveness of an eventual Middle East peace settlement, while obscuring the notion of normalizing relations with Israel, and to embellish al-Asad's role in the peace process and his status as reflected in President Clinton's remarks. On 16 January 1994, at the conclusion of the Geneva summit, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton held a joint press conference in which both presidents made opening statements. The entire press conference, including President Clinton's remarks, was carried live on the Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network and was published in the 17 January editions of the Arabic-language Damascus dailies AL-BA'TH, organ of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, AL-THAWRAH, and TISHRIN. An English text was also published by the English-language Damascus daily THE SYRIA TIMES. An examination of the official U.S. Government text of President Clinton's statement and the corresponding Syrian versions, both Arabic and English, reveals discrepancies that, in several instances, change the emphasis of President Clinton's original text. The three Arabic-language Damascus dailies carry the same text of President Clinton's statement. The English text published in THE SYRIA TIMES is basically identical to the Arabic version but contains some inconsequential stylistic changes. They all digress from President Clinton's original by omitting, substituting, or reformulating some of the President's ideas. Below are examples of the most noteworthy discrepancies between the official U.S. text of Clinton's statement and the Syrian version, which is translated from the Arabic text, except where noted. The portions between slantlines are where the texts differed. The examples below are arranged in the order in which they appear in President Clinton's statement. U.S.: From the first days of my administration, the achievement of a comprehensive peace //between Israel and its Arab neighbors//,based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace has been //one of the highest foreign policy objectives.// Syrian: Since the first days of my administration, the achievement of comprehensive peace //in the region based// on Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace was (one of) //the priorities of my administration.// U.S.: ....I'm now pleased to have had this opportunity to hear personally President al-Asad's views about how to best make this year a year of breakthroughs.// Syrian: //I am personally happy to have held this meeting with President al-Asad and to listen to his point of view on the best ways to make peace.// U.S.: During our meeting //I told President al-Asad// that I was personally committed to the objective of a //comprehensive and secure peace that would produce genuine reconciliation among the peoples of the Middle East.// I told him of my view that the agreement between Israel and the PLO constituted an //important// first step by establishing //an agreed// basis for resolving //the Palestinian problem.// //I also told// him that I believe //Syria is the key to the achievement of an enduring and comprehensive peace that finally will put an end to the conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbors. Syrian: During our talks, //I assured// (akkadtu li-) President al-Asad// that I was personally committed to the achievement of //peace in the Middle East,// and I told him that the agreement between Israel and the PLO constituted a //first step toward creating a basis for// resolving //the conflict. I assured him that Syria's role is a decisive one if we want to produce a real and lasting peace in the region.// U.S.: President al-Asad, as you have just heard, shares this objective: not just an end to war, but the establishment //of real and comprehensive peace with Israel that will ensure normal, peaceful relations among good neighbors.// Syrian: President Hafiz al-Asad, as you have just heard, shares this objective with me: //the achievement of a lasting and comprehensive peace.// U.S.: Crucial decisions will have to be made by //Syria and Israel// if this common objective is to be achieved.... Accordingly, //we pledged today to work together// in order to bring the //negotiations that started in Madrid over two years ago to a prompt and successful conclusion. // Syrian: Decisive decisions have to be made by the //concerned parties// for achieving peace. . .Today, //we have worked together// to make the peace //negotiations that started in Madrid a success.// U.S.: //Critical issues// remain to be resolved, especially the questions relating to withdrawals, to peace and security--//excuse me--the question of relating withthdrawal to peace and security.// Syrian: There are //numerous problems// (THE SYRIA TIMES text has "several problems") that must be solved, and there are //questions relating to withdrawal, peace, and security. We shall try to find solutions to these questions.// U.S.: President al-Asad and I also discussed the state of relations between the United States and Syria, and //agreed on the desirability of improving them. This requires honestly addressing the problems in our relationship. // Syrian: We also discussed bilateral relations between Syria and the United States, and we //agreed to improve these relations.// We want that. //This requires making efforts to improve these relations.// (QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT BRANCH AT (703) 733-6408) ENEAG/15 Feb/POLCHF/NEASA Division/PF 15/2050z Feb
