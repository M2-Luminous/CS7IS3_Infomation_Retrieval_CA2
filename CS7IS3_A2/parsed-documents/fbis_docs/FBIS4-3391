At the same awards giving ceremony, 75 technologists were presented with the service award of the Zhenhua poverty relief by technology fund. The fund has been donated by Hong Kong academic circles. A leading official of the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC) said at the ceremony that the fund was of great importance, because the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong are jointly promoting the work of poverty elimination through technology. Sponsored by the society of Hong Kong Scholars (SHS), the fund aims to encourage and support technological and professional personnel to go to poverty-stricken areas to help citizens there to escape poverty. Elimination of poverty and common prosperity are considered as the basic requirement of socialism and a reflection of the advantages of a socialist system in China. At the national conference on poverty elimination held last month, China promulgated an ambitious seven-year plan to wipe out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing shortages for the remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens. The official said that the key to the goal lies in the advancement of science and technology and improvement of knowledge and skills of farmers. Since 1986, the state commission for science and technology has given 8.5 million yuan of special funds for poverty elimination, and 200 million yuan in loans. Furthermore, it helped poverty-stricken areas to bring in more than 400 poverty elimination projects and 2,700 suitable techniques, which made direct profits of 800 million yuan for the poor. Most of the below-poverty-line citizens live in rural areas of 699 counties in the central and western parts of China.
