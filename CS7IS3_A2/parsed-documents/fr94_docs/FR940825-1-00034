FR940825-1-00034 FR940825-1-00008 3. Section 236 of the NHA The section 236 program provides for payments to a mortgagee on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by low income families in order to reduce the owner's payments to the amount that would be payable if the interest rate on the mortgage loan were set at a figure such as one percent. These lower mortgage payments enable the owner to charge qualified tenants lower than market rate rents (``basic rents''), although tenants who are not qualified for the benefits of the program may be charged market rate rents. In addition, rental assistance payments are available for some units in these projects to enable the rents charged to tenants who cannot afford the ``basic rent'' to be reduced to an amount based on a percentage of income, similar to the rents charged in the public housing and section 8 programs. This rule applies to all the tenants of a section 236 project who pay a below market-rate rent. It does not apply to tenants who pay a market-rate rent. (It should be noted, however, that a market rent tenant would be required to submit evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status if he or she subsequently applied for tenant-based assistance.) 4. Section 101/Rent Supplement Program The program authorized under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (12 U.S.C. 1701s), is the Rent Supplement program. Under this program, HUD makes payments to a housing owner that is a private nonprofit entity or limited dividend entity and whose purchase of the property is financed by a mortgage loan insured under certain HUD programs, or is financed under a State or local program approved by HUD. These payments are for the benefit of low income tenants to enable the owner to charge these tenants rents based on a percentage of their incomes, similar to the rents charged in the public housing and section 8 programs. B. HUD Programs Not Covered by Section 214 HUD-assisted housing programs that are not covered by 42 U.S.C. 1436a, and consequently are not covered by this rule, are: (1) The section 221(d)(3) and (d)(5) program of interest subsidy for projects with mortgages insured under those sections of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 17151); (2) the programs developed to serve the homeless (see 42 U.S.C. 11361), except for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation SRO program (24 CFR part 882, subpart H); (3) the HOPE Homeownership of Multifamily Units program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12871; (4) the HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12891; (5) the HOME program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12741; (6) the Supportive Housing for the Elderly program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1701q; and (7) the Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 8013. The above listed programs are not covered unless any of these programs is used in conjunction with a covered program, such as section 8 housing assistance payments. VI. Overview of 1994 Proposed Rule The proposed rule published in today's Federal Register (the 1994 proposed rule) is substantially similar to the proposed rule published on October 19, 1988 (1988 proposed rule). In many respects, section 214 allows little discretion on the part of HUD to expand or reduce the statutory provisions by regulation. As noted above, section 214 is very specific about what HUD programs are covered by the statute. Section 214 is also specific about what categories of noncitizens are eligible to receive HUD financial assistance, the procedures to be used to verify immigration status, the types of documentation that must be submitted and who must submit this documentation, the appeal procedures to be provided to persons initially determined to have ineligible status, and the special assistance to be provided to certain families with members who have eligible status and those who have ineligible status. A. Summary of Principal Provisions of 1994 Proposed Rule The following provides a summary of the principal provisions of the 1994 proposed rule. 1. Eligibility for HUD Financial Assistance Noncitizens eligible for financial assistance are limited to statutory categories. Noncitizen students who are nonimmigrants are excluded from receiving financial assistance in accordance with section 214. 2. Evidence of Eligible Status (Who Submits What) For citizens_ A written declaration only. (The proposed rule removes the 1988 proposed rule language concerning suspicion of submission of false declaration of citizenship.) For noncitizens 62 years of age or older, and receiving HUD assistance on the effective date of the rule_ A written declaration, and Proof of age document. For all other noncitizens_ A written declaration, A verification consent form, and Evidence of immigration status. Election not to declare eligible status. The 1994 proposed rule also contains a provision that permits a member of a family to elect not to contend that he or she has eligible status (i.e., the person elects not to submit a declaration of eligible status), and if other members of the family declare eligible status and have eligible status, the family may be eligible for continued assistance, proration of assistance (see discussion of proration of assistance under section VI.A.11 of this preamble), or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, as appropriate. Permissible to incorporate declaration in housing application assistance. The 1994 proposed rule does not prescribe a specific declaration. A responsible entity may provide for the declaration to be incorporated in the application for assistance, or make it a separate document. The declaration, however, must cite the statutory authority under which it is required to be provided, and the purpose for the requirement (i.e., that financial assistance is contingent upon the submission of the form). Additional guidance on implementing the requirements of section 214, that is to be issued at the time of publication of the final rule, will include model language for the declaration, as well as the verification consent form. 3. When to Submit Evidence of Eligible Immigration Status For applicants, the 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of the evidence by the date the responsible entity anticipates or has knowledge that verification of other aspects of eligibility for assistance (i.e., income, family composition) will occur. For persons already receiving assistance, the rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of evidence at the first regular reexamination of eligibility (i.e., reexamination of income and family composition) that occurs after the effective date of the final rule. For new occupants in an assisted unit, the rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of evidence at the first interim or regular reexamination following the person's occupancy. One-time submission for continuous occupancy. The proposed rule clarifies that evidence of eligible status is required to be submitted only one time for each family member that maintains continuous occupancy in an assisted unit.
