FR940610-2-00104 FR940610-2-00062 INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China; Request for Comments Concerning the Institution of a Section 751(b) Review Investigation AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. ACTION: Request for comments regarding the institution of a section 751(b) review investigation concerning the Commission's affirmative determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473 (Final), Certain Electric Fans from the People's Republic of China (China). SUMMARY: The Commission invites comments from the public on whether changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant the institution of an investigation pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)) (the Act) to review the Commission's affirmative determination in the above investigation. The purpose of the proposed review investigation is to determine whether an industry in the United States would be materially injured, or would be threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States would be materially retarded, by reason of imports of ceiling fans from China if the existing antidumping order on such merchandise were to be modified or revoked. 1 Ceiling fans are provided for in subheading 8414.51.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 1 Although the scope of the Commerce's investigation included both ceiling fans and oscillating fans, the Commission found these fans to be separate like products of separate industries and determined accordingly on the question of injury. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vera Libeau (202&hyph;205&hyph;3176), Office of Investigations, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW. Washington, DC 20436.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 25, 1991, the Department of Commerce gave notice that imports of certain electric fans (including ceiling fans) from China were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of section 731 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673) (an amendment to its determination, modifying the margins accorded to specific companies, was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 1991 (56 F.R. 64240)), and on December 2, 1991, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 735(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)(1)), that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason of imports of ceiling fans. 2 Commerce thereby ordered that dumping duties be imposed. On March 2, 1994, however, Commerce published in the Federal Register a revision to its original dumping determination, effectively excluding one of the Chinese producers from the order and reducing the margin for non-specified firms (59 FR 9956). Consequently, on May 4, 1994, counsel for Encon Industries, Inc., an importer of the subject merchandise, filed a request with the Commission to review its earlier affirmative injury determination pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)). 2 The Commission also determined that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason of LTFV imports of oscillating fans; however, that determination is not at issue in the petition. Written Comments Requested Pursuant to section 207.45(b)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.45(b)(2)), the Commission requests comments concerning whether the alleged changed circumstances, brought about by Commerce's revision of its dumping order, are sufficient to warrant institution of a review investigation. Written Submissions In accordance with section 201.8 of the Commission's rules (19 CFR 201.8), the signed original and 14 copies of all written submissions must be filed with the Secretary to the Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436. All comments must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the Commission in confidence must request business confidential treatment under section 201.6 of the Commission's rules (19 CFR 201.6). Such requests should be directed to the Secretary to the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. Each sheet must be clearly marked at the top ``Confidential Business Information.'' The Commission will either accept the submission in confidence or return it. All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Secretary. Copies of the request for review of the injury determination and any other documents in this matter are available for public inspection during regular business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary to the Commission; telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Issued: June 7, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14153 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
