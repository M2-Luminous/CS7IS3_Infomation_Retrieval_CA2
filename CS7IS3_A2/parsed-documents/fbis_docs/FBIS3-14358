Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa chaired the Egyptian delegation. Our radio correspondent has learned that during its first meeting today, the council adopted a resolution on developments in the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The resolution expressed regret at the security and military agreement France signed with Israel, which helps Israel to occupy Arab lands by force. The resolution called on the UN Security Council, particularly the cosponsors of the peace process, to make efforts to avert the deterioration of the peaceful process due to aggressive Israeli practices in the occupied territories. It called for speeding up the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements and views them as obstacles to peace. The resolution affirmed that the establishment of a just and all-embracing peace in the region depends on Israel's commitment to implementing UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on enabling the Palestinian people to set up their independent state with honorable Jerusalem as its capital. In the meantime, the Arab League ministerial council voiced its deep concern at current developments in Yemen. In a statement issued today, the council appealed to Yemeni political leaders to double efforts to resolve differences in a manner that enhances unity and contributes to the establishment of stability and peace in Yemen. The council pointed out that unity in Yemen is a national gain and a pan-Arab accomplishment that should be preserved and enhanced. In another development, the seven-member Arab committee of the council held a meeting this evening under the chairmanship of Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. The meeting discussed ways to find a peaceful solution to Libya's crisis with the West that preserves Libya's national sovereignty and respects the principles of international law, which stress solving disputes peacefully. The committee has issued a statement to this effect. The outcome of the committee's meeting will be referred to the ministerial council this evening. Egypt, Syria, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania are taking part in the committee's meeting.
