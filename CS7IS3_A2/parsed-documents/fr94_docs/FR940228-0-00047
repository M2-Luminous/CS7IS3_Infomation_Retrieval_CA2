FR940228-0-00047 FR940228-0-00009 24 CFR Parts 792 and 892 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1708; FR&hyph;3487&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2501&hyph;AB65 Implementation of Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes procedures for public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to follow to permit HAs to retain a portion of certain section 8 fraud recoveries from tenants and owners for use in section 8 programs. Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 expands HA retention of section 8 fraud recoveries to include recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements, as well as litigation (including settlement of a lawsuit) or a court-ordered restitution. This rule applies to the section 8 rental certificate, rental voucher, moderate rehabilitation programs, and private owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 30, 1994.

Background: Some tenants receiving section 8 assistance submit false statements which underreport income to obtain excessive housing assistance. Similarly, some owners also commit fraud in order to receive section 8 rental assistance payments to which they are not entitled. Examples of owner fraud include billing for vacant dwelling units, charging more rent for assisted units than unassisted units in the same building, receiving sidepayments from assisted tenants, and knowingly admitting ineligible tenants into section 8 substantial rehabilitation and new construction projects. Through various methods, such as direct observation, informants, investigative action and computer matches, HAs discover that tenants and owners have committed fraud in order to receive either benefits or payments for which they were not entitled. In 1981, Congress enacted legislation aimed at stemming this fraud and abuse. Section 326(d)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;35; hereafter referred to as ``1981 HCD Act'') allowed HAs to retain ``out of judgments obtained by them in recovering amounts wrongfully paid as a result of fraud and abuse'' a portion of the fraud recoveries to encourage HAs to recover amounts overpaid as a result of such fraud and abuse. On August 20, 1986 (51 FR 29633), the Department published a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD Amendments. In the final rule, HUD construed the term ``judgments'' to allow HAs to retain amounts recovered by means of litigation, including a settlement of litigation. However, most section 8 fraud recoveries result from administrative repayment agreements between the HA and the families, or between the HA and the owner. As such, nearly all tenant and owner fraud recoveries have gone to HUD, and HAs have had little monetary incentive to identify tenant and owner fraud and pursue repayment. Section 129 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992; hereafter referred to as ``1992 HCD Act''), allows HAs to retain a portion of rental assistance fraud recoveries obtained through litigation, court-ordered restitutions, and administrative repayment agreements pursuant to an administrative grievance procedure except in cases where HUD is the principal party initiating or sustaining the recovery action. By allowing HAs to retain a portion of the monies recovered under administrative repayment agreements, the Act provides an additional incentive for HAs to aggressively pursue cases of suspected fraud. Under the Act and this regulation, an HA can retain the greater of: (1) 50 percent of the amount collected or (2) the actual, reasonable, and necessary expenses related to the collection, including the cost of investigation, legal fees and collection fees. The recoveries may be obtained through litigation (including settlement of a lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution, or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to an administrative grievance procedure. The rule applies to the Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and private owner/HA new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects subject to an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between HUD and an HA.
