The chamber's chairman, William Fung, criticised Chris Patten's plan to give all 2.7 million workers a second vote in functional constituencies, and to scrap block voting by companies. "We felt that the administration's proposals to create new, large, functional constituencies, representing an electorate of some 2.7 million from nine industrial and commercial sectors, to be a major departure from the concept and character of the existing functional constituencies," Fung said. Jimmy McGregor, who represents the chamber in the Legislative Council but who was voted off its general committee last month, said Fung's statement was an example of bias as a result of business interests. "It shows that the chamber is very much China-orientated politically, which is not surprising. So many members of the chamber have investments in China," he said. Fung said the chamber believed that the nine new functional constituencies should retain the essential features -- representing specific interests of each group with a limited electorate -- of the existing 21 functional constituencies. Although McGregor supports Patten's proposals on the new functional constituencies, he had reservations. "I have always supported [the idea] that the nine new functional constituencies have to be aligned with the existing 21 functional constituencies," he said. At the last elections in 1991, only about 100,000 people were allowed to elect members to functional constituencies. One constituency is made up of 36 local councillors. A former representative, Gilbert Leung, was jailed for vote buying. Functional constituencies will make up half the 60 seats in the legislature next year. Patten believes widening the electorate will make legislators more accountable to public opinion but China has accused him of trying to introduce direct elections by the back door. A government spokesman denied this, saying: "Every independent test of the Governor's proposals, be they by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee or independent legal experts who have given evidence, have all said the Governor's proposals are within the framework of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. "The Governor's proposals, including that on functional constituencies, have been considered by the Legislative Council on three occasions." Fung also gave his opinion on the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal, delayed by the Legislative Council's refusal to endorse a Sino-British agreement. Fung said the chamber backed its establishment as soon as possible. "Many members of the chamber would have preferred some discretion to be allowed on the number of overseas judges to rest with the court," Fung said. "Nevertheless, agreement has been reached in the Joint Liaison Group to restrict the number of overseas judges to one, and therefore this agreement must be honoured." Fung said the court needed to be set up as soon as possible in order to build credibility before 1997 and to help maintain confidence in Hong Kong's position as a leading commercial and financial centre.
