The statement expressed indignation at the United States who is bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, kicking up a nuclear row against the DPRK, and urged the United States to cancel at once the planned resumption of the "Team Spirit" and deployment of Patriot missiles and make sincere preparations for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. The statement also urged that Japan, too, should stop making mischief between the South and the North, and bury the hatchet for peace, deeply mindful of the lessons of the past history. It denounced, in the name of the nation, the towering crimes of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, who as a servant of the United States, has been conspiring to do harm to the fellow countrymen, crying for "cooperation in taking sanctions".
