A. Belyayev, chief, Production Analysis and Forecasting Administration, Center for Economic Conditions under Russian Federation Government: "Conversion of Military Production"] [Text] The production slump in defense sectors of industry continued to deepen in the first quarter of 1994. According to Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] data, the reduction in product output was 35 percent with respect to the first quarter of last year, which is more than for industry as a whole (25 percent). According to 1993 results, the production slump in the defense complex was 16 percent, i.e., it was equal to the Russian Federation industry average. The drop in production affected all defense sectors without exception. Compared with the first quarter of 1993, product output was cut almost in half at enterprises of the aircraft industry and armament industry and by 40 percent in the electronics industry and communications equipment industry. A significant reduction in production volume also is seen in the atomic industry, previously distinguished by stability. The output of defense products was reduced by 40 percent in the first quarter. Its rates of reduction continue to exceed those of civilian production, but a trend has appeared toward rates of decline in military and civilian production gradually drawing together. The reduction in output of civilian products, which was 11 percent in the defense complex according to 1993 results, accelerated in the fourth quarter of that same year, and during January-March 1994 reached 33 percent compared with the corresponding period of last year. For the first time during conversion the slump in production of civilian products proved more substantial than in civilian sectors of production. A further drop in output of civilian products for technical and production purposes was predetermined by the continuing limited nature of investment opportunities for all consumers of machine-building products. As a result of a drop in demand on the part of light industry, the agro-industrial complex, transportation and a number of other sectors, output of equipment for light industry in the defense complex fell by 55 percent in the first quarter of 1994, output of equipment for processing sectors of the agro-industrial complex fell by 44 percent, output of equipment for trade and public dining fell by 41 percent, output of mainline freight cars fell by 76 percent and so on. At the same time, the need for replacing equipment in sectors where the defense complex is the major supplier remains very high. For example, the proportion of main technological equipment in light industry over 10 years of age was one-third as of the end of 1992, including more than a third of spinning machines and almost half of looms. Existing replacement rates of main kinds of technological equipment in light industry (around 3-5 percent a year) make its overcoming of technological backwardness, transition to new technologies and output of competitive products problematical. The very same situation also is taking shape in other sectors of the economy putting out products needed by the country's economy and its population. Production of consumer goods in defense sectors developed relatively successfully in 1993. With an overall 7 percent reduction for many of the most important kinds, a production growth of 7 percent was achieved for television sets (including 4 percent for color sets), 7 percent for refrigerators and freezers, 1.2-1.4 times for small farm machinery, and more than one and one-half times for automobile spare parts. But a trend toward a slump in production of non-food consumer goods (less light industry) appeared in the defense complex in the fall of last year, and their output in the first quarter of 1994 was only 63 percent of the first quarter of 1993 (70 percent for industry as a whole). The production of television sets (including color sets), knitting machines, electric meat cutters and juicers was cut by a fourth, and that of washing machines, electric vacuum cleaners, radios, bicycles, sewing machines, and paints and varnishes by half. The output of tape recorders, microcalculators, cameras and motorcycles was cut by almost two-thirds, and children's strollers and bicycles by three-fourths. Production of multipurpose kitchen appliances remained at the previous level. The production of double and triple refrigerators rose somewhat. Population demand is of greatest importance here. Imported durable goods are beginning to occupy an ever greater proportion in satisfying that demand. Therefore substantially increasing quality characteristics, technical level and, as a result, competitiveness of goods manufactured for the population while observing a sensible pricing policy becomes one of the main tasks of defense sector enterprises. The process of a decline in capital investments in enterprises of Goskomoboronprom [State Committee for the Defense Industry] continued in 1993 against the background of an overall reduction in investments in all sectors of the national economy. In 1993 Goskomoboronprom enterprises assimilated R530.2 billion from all sources of financing, which, according to the center's calculations, is 36 percent lower in comparable prices than in 1992. The decline in volumes of capital investments was 29 percent for industry as a whole, including machine-building. There was a reduction from 2.8 percent in 1992 to 2.1 percent in 1993 in the proportion of capital investments assimilated by Goskomoboronprom enterprises and organizations in the overall volume of capital investments for the national economy. Under conditions of a limitation of financial resources, there was a reorientation in use of funds in Goskomoboronprom enterprises from the construction of production facilities to the construction of nonproduction facilities. While 62 percent of the total volume of capital investments were expended for production construction in 1992, it was 55 percent in 1993. The proportion of funds being directed toward production construction was 60 percent for the national economy as a whole. As a result of a redistribution of funds, 1.6 million m[.sup]2[/] of housing were placed in use, which is 16 percent below last year's level, but the overall reduction of investments for Goskomoboronprom was more significant. Internal and borrowed funds of enterprises continue to be the basic source for financing capital construction, despite the fact that their proportion in the overall volume of capital investments dropped from 88 percent in 1992 to 84 percent in 1993. The proportion of centralized capital investments increased from 12 percent to 16 percent. In 1993 the volume of centralized capital investments increased, albeit slightly, at the expense of funds of local budgets, which previously essentially had not financed the defense industry. While R0.3 billion were allocated to defense enterprises from local budgets in 1992, it was R5.2 billion in 1993 (in existing prices of the corresponding years). The greatest proportion of investments from centralized sources was directed toward developing the shipbuilding industry (21 percent) and armament industry (18 percent). Assimilation of capital investments in Goskomoboronprom enterprises on the territory of Russia in 1993 was concentrated basically in two economic areas, Central and Urals, where almost half of all capital investments were assimilated. With respect to centralized investments, the Central area accounts for a third. The direction of qualitative improvement both of military as well as civilian products remains one of the main tasks of defense complex investment policy even under the extremely difficult conditions which have taken shape. It is necessary to consistently implement a line toward tieing in investment activity above all with qualitative parameters of manufactured products, since measures of state paternalism alone cannot protect the domestic market against the inflow of imported products nor preserve positions of military equipment in world markets. The number of industrial-production personnel in the defense complex declined by 14 percent in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 1993, which is somewhat greater than last year (12 percent). The outflow of the labor force from defense sectors is occurring faster than for industry as a whole. As happened last year, the greatest first quarter drop in numbers occurred in the electronics industry, where a deep production slump and the lowest pay (two times lower than for the industry average) are seen.
