FR940930-0-00027 FR940930-0-00005 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism'') and DOT has determined the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments will affect only large certificated U.S. air carriers accounting for at least 1 percent of U.S. domestic scheduled passenger revenues (over $450 million annually for the 12 months ended March 31, 1993). The Department's economic regulations define ``large certificated air carrier'' to include U.S. air carriers holding a certificate issued under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, that operate aircraft designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 60 seats or a maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds. Consequently, small carriers are not affected by this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act The reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with this rule were sent at the NPRM stage to the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 under OMB NO: 2138&hyph;0041. The final rule adopts those requirements. OMB has approved 14 CFR Part 234 through July 31, 1995.
