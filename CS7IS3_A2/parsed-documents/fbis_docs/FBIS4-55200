Kuncze told us that the SZDSZ did not give up the idea of becoming a governing party after the elections. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will the SZDSZ election strategy change in view of the fact that the three parties participating in the liberal cooperation fared far worse than expected in the first round of the elections? [Kuncze] We want to continue to conduct a positive campaign in which we would like to win over as many voters as possible for our program. At the same time, it is no longer sense to talk about the emergence of a liberal-dominated coalition after the elections, because the results of the other parties that signed a cooperation agreement with us do not make such a coalition possible. In any case, the aforementioned agreement continues to be valid. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In addition to replacing the current government, the SZDSZ also aimed at creating a liberal-dominated coalition. After failing to achieve this, what is the major goal of the SZDSZ? [Kuncze] We are now drawing the voters' attention to the fact that only votes for the SZDSZ can prevent an absolute majority for the MSZP. For this, we highlight the differences between the election programs of the SZDSZ and the MSZP. We call upon the voters to give us the authority to represent our program adequately in the coming period. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It is hardly possible to efficiently represent a program from the opposition. Therefore, what you have just said means that the SZDSZ wants to participate in the next coalition. [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not given up the idea of becoming a governing party if it can adequately represent itself in Parliament after the elections. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What if the MSZP gets an absolute majority? [Kuncze] This would harm the chances of a coalition between the two parties. Our previous position on the possibilities and conditions of a coalition is unchanged. The SZDSZ will participate in a coalition if it can represent itself with an adequate weight. I would stress once more: We ask the voters to give us a mandate for this. All the questions about the future coalition can only be answered after 29 May, when we know the results of the second round. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you agree with the conclusion that the "national cooperation" declared by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] to contain the further advance of the MSZP will harm the election chances of the SZDSZ? [Kuncze] On the one hand, such a cooperation does not add to the chances of the conservative bloc. On the other hand, such an attitude on the part of the right-wing parties could facilitate an absolute majority for the MSZP. The MDF has already contributed greatly to the success of the MSZP, and we think it would be unfortunate if the MDF continued this mistaken policy between the two election rounds.
