FR941003-0-00003 FR941003-0-00001 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the Effective Date paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) for Program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Public Participation and Effective Date The amendment to section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2014(e)) which is reflected in this rule was enacted in 1990 as section 1717 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Relief Act (1990 Leland Act), Title XVII, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624 (104 Stat. 3783, Nov. 28, 1990). This amendment was effective February 1, 1992. The provisions of this rule are required to be implemented not later than October 1, 1994, in order to assure that all State agencies are in full compliance with the amendment as soon as possible. For this reason, Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 that public comment on this rule prior to implementation is impracticable and that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after its publication. However, because we believe the administration of the rule may be improved by public comment, comments are solicited on this rule for 60 days after publication. All comments received within the comment period will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes will be incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final rule. Background Section 351 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 (102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988) (HPA) amended Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to require State agencies to offer eligible households with an elderly or disabled member a method for claiming a deduction for recurring medical expenses in place of provisions that had required households to report and verify expenses monthly. On June 7, 1989, the Department published an interim rulemaking at 54 FR 24518, which implemented Section 351 of Pub. L. 100&hyph;435. The interim rules are still in effect.
