FR941020-1-00041 FR941020-1-00012 In early 1989, the City placed an impermeable tarpaulin plastic liner over the pesticide disposal area to prevent surface water infiltration through the soil cover. The liner covers an area of approximately 100 feet long x 36 feet wide. A warning sign is currently posted next to the pesticide disposal area. In June 1989, the City and the Virginia Department of Waste Management (VDWM) entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) which required the City to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to develop and evaluate cleanup alternatives. The AOC additionally required that the City implement a temporary leachate collection system (TLCS). The TLCS has been implemented and is currently being operated by the City Department of Public Works. The collected leachate has been periodically sampled and transported to Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD) sewage treatment plant for treatment in accordance with a permit issued by HRSD. During the remedial investigation (RI), surface water, sediment, and groundwater samples were taken at locations at and around the Site. These samples were analyzed for target pesticides, volatile compounds, semivolatile compounds, and metals. Although pesticides were the focus of the RI, no pesticides were detected in any surface water, sediment, or groundwater samples, including samples taken from a groundwater monitoring well located immediately downgradient of the pesticide disposal area (HRW&hyph;7). In addition, no organic compounds were detected at levels that presented an unacceptable risk to human health. No metal contamination was detected above levels of concern in seven of the nine monitoring wells. Slightly elevated levels of arsenic were detected in two wells (HRW&hyph;3 and HRW&hyph;6) in the northern section of the landfill. Arsenic concentrations in filtered samples collected from these wells were 71.9 and 55.7 μg/l, respectively, slightly above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 50 μg/l established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In the second sampling round, which was conducted in October 1991, the level of chromium detected in an unfiltered sample from one monitoring well (HWR&hyph;3) was 190 μg/l, exceeding the MCL of 100 μg/l. However, chromium was not detected in the filtered sample taken from this well for the same sampling event. Chromium levels in samples collected in the first sampling round (May 1991) from this well were also well below the MCL (23.6 μg/l in the unfiltered sample and below the detection limit in the filtered sample). Surface water sampling in unnamed streams N and E showed arsenic and chromium levels well below the Virginia standard acceptable for the protection of aquatic life. In addition, the levels of these compounds in the stream sediments are below the average levels in soils of the eastern United States. Sampling of benthic community in a nearby stream was conducted to provide further information for the determination whether the Site has impacted the surrounding areas. The results of the benthic sampling indicated low species diversity of benthic organisms in a sample taken in the area immediately downgradient of the landfill near the confluence of the unnamed streams N and E. However, subsequent surface water/sediment sampling at a nearby location in this stream revealed the absence of contamination, indicating the current Site condition was not likely the cause for the low benthic species diversity. An animal survey in areas around the Site was also conducted. This study consisted of a comparison of animal species including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish species in areas around the Site to determine whether Site contamination has potentially impacted the local animal community. The results showed that animal species in different areas around the Site are similarly diverse except at the benthic location from unnamed stream N in an area northeast of the Site. Although onsite groundwater in the northern section of the Site presents slightly elevated risk, the offsite risks are expected to be significantly reduced from the onsite risk levels. As the groundwater migrates offsite, the arsenic and metals in the groundwater are adsorbed by the soils in the aquifer. Most of the water in the Columbia aquifer, the shallow aquifer, discharges into unnamed stream N, where surface water/sediment sampling showed no contamination.
