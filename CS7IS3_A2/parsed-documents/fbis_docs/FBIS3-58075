He was addressing the heads of foreign missions in Ankara, for whom he hosted a reception on the occasion of the new year. Demirel recalled that after the decease of President Turgut Ozal in 1993 he was elected president and meanwhile, leaders of leading political parties have also been replaced. [sentence as received] Before being elected president, Suleyman Demirel was premier and leader of the major coalition partner True Path Party. "All this process took place without hindering the normal functioning of the government and the daily lives of citizens, within the Constitution and current legislation," he said. Demirel went on to say that Turkey faced great problems in the field of foreign policy in 1993. "Instability in the Caucasus and the Balkans and terrorist activities aimed from other regions to Turkey, were the main issues troubling us. "However, the Turkish governments which were not influenced by provocations chose to seek solutions by calling the international community to enter multifaceted cooperation. "Turkey has at all times displayed an attitude of compromise and moderation," Demirel said. "We hope that 1994 becomes a year which the aggressors eventually come to common sense, Armenians withdraw from the Azeri land they invaded, the disputes in Georgia are resolved and the embargo which creates great grievances for the Iraqi people ends and efforts to bring peace to the Middle East finally yield a solution," he added. "I am aware that the year 1993 had been a very busy one for you diplomats who endeavoured to follow developments in and around Turkey. I assure you that the year 1994 will not be dissapointing for you," he concluded.
