FR940826-1-00087 FR940826-1-00017 B. Preliminary Studies In the Proposed Plan EPA described six preliminary studies either completed or underway, and announced that it intended to begin two preliminary studies in 1995, and three additional studies in 1996 (59 FR 25864&hyph;5). The studies assist the Agency in selecting industries to be subject to future effluent guidelines rulemaking. The Agency is proceeding as proposed with studies for the Textile Mills category (40 CFR part 410) and the Inorganic Chemicals category (40 CFR part 415), both of which will be completed by December 1994. Studies of the Steam Electric Power Generating category (40 CFR part 423) and Iron and Steel Manufacturing category (40 CFR part 420) were started earlier this year will be complete in late 1995. Studies on the Petroleum Refining category (40 CFR part 419) and the Metal Finishing category (40 CFR part 433) were recently completed. Three additional existing effluent guidelines categories are listed in the consent decree for preliminary studies: Leather Tanning and Finishing (40 CFR part 425); Coal Mining (40 CFR part 434); and Onshore/Stripper Oil and Gas Extraction (40 CFR part 435). EPA may study these categories or other categories, based on public comments received and other available information. EPA has not yet selected the categories to be studied in 1995 or 1996. C. Summary of Changes from Proposed Plan Today's Effluent Guidelines Plan is substantively identical to the Proposed Plan. However, some clarifications are provided below in response to several comments the Agency received on the proposal. V. Public Comments The public comment period for the Proposed Plan closed on June 17, 1994. The Agency received comments that covered approximately 18 topics from 6 commenters, including industries and an environmental group. The summary in this section highlights the more significant comments submitted. The administrative record for today's notice includes a complete text of the comments and the Agency's responses. A. Scope of Specific Effluent Guidelines Rules Several comments addressed the scope of coverage and other issues pertaining to specific effluent guidelines rules which EPA recently proposed or will propose in the next few years. EPA will forward these comments to the dockets for the appropriate rules. The Agency has not made final decisions about the scope and applicability of these guidelines. B. Effluent Guidelines Planning Process One comment questioned the Agency's commitment to planning for the Effluent Guidelines Program, and stated that EPA should demonstrate that it has actually engaged in planning for future development of Effluent Guidelines, rather than using the 304(m) plan as a status report and vehicle to request further information from outside sources. EPA has devoted substantial resources to planning for Effluent Guidelines. Most significantly, the Agency has supported the Effluent Guidelines Task Force, an advisory committee, that has investigated ways to improve the planning process, expedite the promulgation of effluent guidelines, and better promote pollution prevention practices. The Task Force recently submitted its Report and Recommendations on ``Selection Criteria for Preliminary Industry Studies'' to the EPA Administrator. The Task Force agreed with EPA on the limitations of various data sources, although it encouraged the Agency to take greater advantage of the information and experience available from state and local governments in dealing with industrial dischargers. EPA looks forward to working more closely with state and local governments on preliminary studies and effluent guidelines planning in general. While the Agency does invite submissions of data from outside sources to assist in Effluent Guidelines planning, it also conducts preliminary industry studies. EPA believes that conducting preliminary studies is the most effective manner in which to learn about industries discharging toxic and nonconventional pollutants. Two studies have been completed, and additional studies are underway, pursuant to the Consent Decree. Consistent with the previous Plans, the 1994 Proposed Plan states that the ``total priority pollutants discharged'' factor has been ``among the most useful indicators for selecting categories for effluent guidelines'' (59 FR 25863). The preliminary studies provide this kind of information, but most of the other data sources the Agency consults do not support calculating national estimates of discharges by category.
