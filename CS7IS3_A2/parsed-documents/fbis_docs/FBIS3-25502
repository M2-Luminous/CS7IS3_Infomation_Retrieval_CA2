This work has been done by a technical commission made up of more than 10 economists and some jurists. That commission was led by the secretary of state for planning and the deputy finance minister, with the help of the Council of Ministers assistant secretary. That commission has proposed that prices be readjusted. In other words, there must be changes in the foreign exchange and interest rates. Salaries and prices must be readjusted. That commission has also proposed the scrapping of administrative methods for managing foreign earnings; a reduction in public expenditure and in the General State Budget deficit; an increase in fiscal revenue; a public investment policy; a set of measures to stimulate Angolan private investment and to attract foreign investment; and to define a strategy to reschedule the foreign debt. In short, conditions are sought to stabilize the national currency, increase salaries, make investment viable, and recover economic growth. Some of the measures are harsh, but intentions are good. This time, we predict that we will be able to move from good intentions to practical action. Obviously, this continues to be the program that is possible under the circumstances of war currently besetting our country. Nevertheless, let us not use the situation of war to justify all insufficiencies and failures to achieved planned goals. The fundamental measures in this program were approved in September of last year. They have not been implemented only because of a lack of firmness or failure to carry out the required tasks at the right time. The performance period we are entering into now is one of the greatest responsibility. If the proposed program is implemented with rigor, discipline, and seriousness, we may be able to stanch the country's serious economic crisis. Gradually, we may start overcoming it with a view to improving our people's living standards. Faced with a war effort and an undeclared state of emergency, the state has been forced to divert important resources to provide logistical support and to reequip the army and the police. Those resources had initially been earmarked for the economy and for national reconstruction. The state was also forced to return to an administrative system to allocate foreign exchange resources. This was the situation until the third quarter of last year. The armed forces and the national (?police force) have discharged their duties with dedication and a high degree of patriotism. Starting virtually from scratch in October of 1992 and having to fight against an army that was well equipped and which Jonas Savimbi had kept hidden, our forces proved, as far back as August of last year, that the democratic government elected by the Angolan people could not be overthrown by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] military forces. However, the government lacked the necessary mobility to created the conditions needed for moving from emergency to economic reform programs. This situation allows me to conclude that it is well nigh impossible to manage an economy facing a crisis without the existence of a government organ that will be responsible for devising, coordinating, and managing economic programs. In view of that, I believe there is an urgent need to create an organ, which will be equivalent to a ministry, and which will be responsible for dealing with structural and macroeconomic problems in the medium and long terms. I think that some preconceived ideas in regard to the former Ministry of Planning and its cadres have now been laid to rest. Studies on economic reform guidelines have always come from that ministry. The coordination of the government's economic sector could be handed over to the current Planning State Secretariat, which might evolve to become the Ministry of Planning and Economic Coordination which, in general terms, would be responsible for drawing up the government's economic programs, for devising general economic and social development policies and, eventually, to bring order to Angolan territory and to define strategies for negotiation with the principal international financial institutions. The Finance Ministry is currently entrusted with those duties because there is no organ that deals specifically with them. It can readjust its organizational structure to meet the important tasks it has been allocated daily to deal with problems arising from the economic crisis and other economy-related matters. Certainly, there is a need for other forms of restructuring in terms of the government's organization and its higher structures responsible for management and executive affairs. To that end, it is my belief that pertinent studies will be made concerning strategic management and the promotion of cadres capable of guaranteeing sucess for the aforesaid program. We must not wait for the war to end so we can move resolutely in that direction. If peace arrives sooner rather than later, then all the better. It will expand our room for maneuver and increase our responsibilities concerning the complete promotion of national reconciliation. However, we must continue to follow our path if peace does not arrive so soon. UNITA continues to carry out offensive military operations in various parts of the country. It has been killing innocent people. It has been destroying economic infrastructure. It has hindered or impeded productive work as well as the free movement of people and goods. Obviously, such military pressure from UNITA will not change the government stance at the negotiating table. What is more, this government must not fold its arms in the face of that military offensive either. The Angolan Armed Forces must reply to the attacks being carried out by the UNITA military forces and defend the people. By the same token, such pressure will not force the government team to abandon the Lusaka peace talks, particularly in view of the great progress that has been made at those talks. In short, we must reply on the ground when we are attacked and, simultaneously, deal correctly and constructively with developments at the Lusaka peace talks, until a lasting and verifiable cease-fire agreement has been reached. It is my belief that both the mediators and the observer countries are attentive to all ploys aimed at sabotaging the Lusaka peace talks and that such ploys will not be tolerated.
