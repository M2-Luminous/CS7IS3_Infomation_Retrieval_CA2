"I hope that you sympathize with the considerations which forced me to sign the decree. At the same time, I share the apprehensions of the public, the deputies, and your own fears that during implementation of the decree threats to constitutional human rights could arise," reads a letter by the president of the Russian Federation, the text of which was circulated by his press service. "I believe that until the relevant federal constitutional law has been adopted, the representative for human rights should proceed in his activity on the basis of the principle of Article 15 of the Russian Constitution, according to which the constitution has direct force and is applicable throughout the territory of the Russian Federation," the document notes. "In your work you can rely on the assistance of the heads of constituent parts of the Federation and of the president's authorized representatives." Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that within the next few days Boris Yeltsin will submit to the State Duma a bill on introducing additions and alterations to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural Code of the Russian Federation in order to bring the decree on combatting gang violence into line with Russian legislation. He is participating in today's meeting of the lower house of parliament together with Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Russian president's authorized representative at the Federal Assembly. Deputies are expected to again express their views on the decree which has met with a mixed reaction among politicians. Having told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "Boris Yeltsin does not intend to suspend this decree," Sergey Filatov, head of the president's administration, added that "if violations of human rights are observed in the course of its implementation, adjustments may be made to the document. It is not a dogma."
