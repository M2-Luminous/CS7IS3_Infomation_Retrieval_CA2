SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representatives 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end investment management company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On August 17, 1983 applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N&hyph;8A and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1 pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on December 1, 1983 and the initial public offering commenced shortly thereafter. 2. On December 13, 1993, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant would become a separate series of Merrill Lynch Funds for Institutions Series (the ``Acquiring Fund''). The Acquiring Fund is a series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Acquiring Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of shares in different series and authorizes the Board of Trustees to establish and create additional series and designate the rights and preferences thereof. Pursuant to such authority, on December 13, 1993, the Board of Trustees designated a new series of the Acquiring Fund to be known as the ``Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt Fund'' series (the ``Series''). 3. Applicant and the Series share the same investment adviser, Fund Asset Management, L.P. Accordingly, applicant and the Series may be deemed to be affiliated persons by reason of being under the common control of the same investment adviser. Applicant therefore relied on the exemption provided by rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act to effect the transaction. Consequently, the trustees of the Series determined, in accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8, that the purchase of the assets of applicant by the Series was in the best interest of the shareholders of the Series, and that such purchase would not result in any dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders of the Series. 1 1 Rule 17a&hyph;8 provides relief from the affiliated transaction prohibition of section 17(a) of the Act for a merger of investment companies that may be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 4. On December 17, 1993 preliminary copies of proxy materials were filed with the SEC. On January 6, 1994, definitive copies were distributed to applicant's shareholders and transmitted to the SEC. At a special meeting held on February 18, 1994, the shareholders of the applicant approved the reorganization.
