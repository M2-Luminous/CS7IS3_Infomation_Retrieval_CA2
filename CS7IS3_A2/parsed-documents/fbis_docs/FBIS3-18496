Can you tell us something about that? [Rexrodt] I can tell you a lot about that. The Cabinet has just presented a program to clearly improve the competitiveness of German companies, because they are the ones that abolish or create jobs. With a package of 40 to 50 measures the Federal Government wants to make sure that, for instance, research and innovation and their transfer into new products are promoted and that the labor costs of companies are reduced so that new companies can conquer new markets. [Rappe] These are measures that have a medium-term effect and about which we agree in many areas. However, what are you doing to overcome the current economic crisis? We need a program so that the horses drink again [as published]. [Rexrodt] The biggest economic development program that has ever existed in Germany is currently underway -- with new debts of 70 billion German marks [DM] incurred by the Federal Government alone and a gigantic transfer of money to the new laender. [Rappe] We should make a clear distinction here. The reconstruction of the new laender is a structural task. What we need is an additional economic development program amounting to DM30 to DM40 billion to stimulate demand, also at the cost of higher debts. This would be compensated for by additional tax revenues. [Rexrodt] I think that your demand for even higher new debts is irresponsible. This would push up interests and prices and finally strangle the economic development. [Rappe] Then I do not see how we are going to overcome mass unemployment. [Rexrodt] In 1994, we will have a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent. In 1995, at the latest, the rapid improvement of the international economic development will also have an effect in our country; at the same time our measures to improve competitiveness will begin to have an effect. [Rappe] You know just as well as all economic researchers that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent, which is still doubtful anyway, will not reduce unemployment at all. On the contrary: The rationalization and technology effect of 2 to 2.5 percent will make sure that even more jobs will be abolished. This will change only when the growth rate lies above the technology rate. However, you can only dream of that. [Rexrodt] We simply cannot incur any more debts. There is no way out, Mr. Rappe, we must all tighten our belts. The ancillary wage costs must be reduced, and wages must be lower in real terms for a certain time. [Rappe] But that means that you damage the economic development even more if the people have less and less money to spend and those who have enough money do not spend it either, because they do not know how bad the future will be. In addition, in almost all companies the benefits that are above the collective wage agreement are being abolished. All in all -- including inflation -- this means a loss in purchasing power of almost 10 percent for 1993-94. [Rexrodt] I do see the problem that people have less money to spend, even though I do not see it as being as drastic as you do. However, we must get through that. This is the only way in which we can ease the cost burden on the companies so that they can sell more on the world market again. Then, in 1995, we will have at least a stabilization of the labor market and, afterwards, new jobs again. Otherwise, we will ruin our economy. [STERN] Are you also referring to the imminent strike in the metal industry? [Rexrodt] A strike in the metal industry or elsewhere would be an economic disaster. This would nip the incipient recovery process in the bud. [Rappe] If the employers in the chemical industry were to demand from us the same concessions that are now demanded from the working people in the metal industry, I, as trade union chairman, would never sign that. This is unacceptable and extremely damaging to the national economy because of the purchasing power. We agree, Mr. Rexrodt, that the cost burden on the companies must be eased. But there are many other possibilities to achieve that apart from a one-sided renunciation of wages. For instance, a reduction of ancillary wage costs, by, for instance, making self-employed people and civil servants contribute to the general expenditures for caring for the labor market, namely by a labor market contribution. You can also raise the limits for contributions to the social insurance so as to include those who earn more to a greater extent. Why have you been blocking that for years? [Rexrodt] First, there are constitutional difficulties regarding the civil servants. And, regarding those who earn more and the self-employed, in such difficult times one must not ill-treat those in society who perform most. [Rappe] You could also divide the Federal Employment Office into a pure insurance for unemployed that is financed by contributions, and a labor market policy institution. [Rexrodt] We agree on that. The cost of labor market policy must be carried by all tax payers. This would clearly reduce the contributions and thus the ancillary wage costs. The burden on the companies would be eased. [Rappe] Why is your government not initiating this? I get the impression that you are just saying this year, and in reality you mean to limit yourself to social cut-backs to reduce ancillary wage costs, which would mean an even greater loss in purchasing power. [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, this is not true. You hear that I am thinking about that. I do not want to abolish the social state. I want to safeguard it by making sure that it can be financed. However, I also state clearly: Social benefits must not be taboo nor the roughly 40 percent of the ancillary wage costs that are regulated by collective agreements. [Rappe] I am of a completely different opinion in this respect. Why are we not talking about other possibilities to reduce costs, about the cumbersome management in the companies, which is not even able to use the already existing possibilities of flexible work time? This would improve production costs and create new jobs. In the chemical industry, for instance, there is the possibility of part-time wage agreements with half-day work. Only about 3 percent of the companies use that. This is miserable. Most wage agreements also provide more flexible machine-time. [Rexrodt] I can even add one thing to that. The middle management echelons, in particular, have ignored the possibilities for part-time work and flexibility models in an incredible way. Certain fields of management have not done their work. [STERN] Mr. Rexrodt, you also want to create new jobs through low-wage areas. [Rexrodt] We have to think about how we can give jobs to people who are little qualified and would otherwise turn into long-term recipients of social welfare. Particularly in the service sector there are innumerable possibilities for that, for instance in trade, in the transportation sector, and in gastronomy, but also in private households. If simple work can be paid for again, it is also in demand. However, for that we must also find other possibilities for dismissal. After all, many companies do not hire people, because they cannot get rid of them again or, if they can, they have to use an expensive social plan. [Rappe] That catches my attention. What kind of working conditions are these supposed to be? [Rexrodt] The trade unions have to work that out with the employers, Mr. Rappe. [Rappe] Dismissals at the whim of the entrepreneur cannot be achieved with the trade unions. I do not want American conditions. [Rexrodt] Neither do I. But if it turns out that a little qualified person cannot live up to the requirements, it must be possible for the company to dismiss him again without any major complications. Otherwise, this is not going to work. [Rappe] We will not agree to wages below the collective wage agreement, which sets down the minimum wages. [Rexrodt] Then you deprive many people of any opportunity for employment. [Rappe] No. The Federal Government could, for instance, provide subsidies to finance work instead of financing unemployment. Then one can talk about various things. [Rexrodt] Granting state subsidies for wages would be absurd. I think the discussion about a second, financially supported labor market is dangerous, because the people then settle down there instead of seizing professional opportunities. [Rappe] I just want to bridge the next four to five years. How long do we want to watch rising unemployment? I am just as afraid as you are of a lasting second labor market. [STERN] In view of millions of unemployed, will the Germans have to work more or less in the future? [Rexrodt] The future requires a labor market, which provides individual people with the opportunity of working very much less and thus, naturally, also earning less; 10, 20, or 30 hours per week. However, 40, 50, or 60 hours must also be possible, depending on how this can be made compatible with the operational and personal requirement. This will be a completely flexible labor market. And the conditions for that must be negotiated by the individuals themselves. [Rappe] First of all, the people will certainly not, generally, have to work more. This would just increase unemployment. And we will quite certainly prevent such a wage policy wilderness as you propose. What I can imagine, perhaps, are annual work time contracts. How the work is distributed over the year remains the business of the parties involved on site. They must negotiate this in a way that both sides benefit. [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, area wage contracts are outdated, both regarding wages and work time. [Rappe] Of course, I also see that, in the future, more and more company-related elements will play a role. However, the area wage contract is indispensable as a framework so as to prevent distortions of competition between the companies and a wage wilderness. We will never agree to a situation of wage policy lawlessness, Mr. Rexrodt.
