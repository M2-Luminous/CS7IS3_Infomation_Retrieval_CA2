It is a political and economic challenge -- that of the integration of the former Soviet bloc into the Partnership for Peace (if not into NATO) and into a great trading community. But it is also a challenge between different generations -- that of continuity between the Liberation 50 years ago and the present struggle for democratic principles. Clinton will ask the young Europeans to avoid the mistakes of the thirties and to espouse the ideals of Europe's liberators. His visit to the heart of World War II, which will also take him to Britain and France, culminating in Normandy, the scene of D-Day, will be an implicit appeal to the values of the Resistance. His security adviser, [Tony] Lake, said that the President will ask Europe to "display the same unity of intent" in strengthening democracy that it displayed on the battlefields against Hitler. At a time when neofascist thrusts are emerging, he gave to understand, Clinton's message will leave no doubts about America's position. The choice of Italy as the first leg of his tour was no coincidence. His visits to France and Britain, the major allies in the conflict, were obligatory. But Italy was an enemy. "We have come here," Clinton will say, "to bring to your attention the fact that 1944 was the victory of a principle that unites us not only with Italy but also with Germany and Japan." And he will praise our country for what it did to free itself from fascism, and will not enter into the recent controversy over the AN [National Alliance] and Mussolini. Clinton brings with him two specters -- that of Reagan, who 10 years ago in Normandy put himself forward as the symbol of freedom from the Soviet Union, and his personal specter as a "malingerer" who dodged the draft for the war in Vietnam. It will not be easy to get rid of them. This is why he has prepared himself very carefully, with a daily diet of footage of the Anzio and Normandy landings and discussions with the most famous historians. Clinton is the first American leader born since World War II: At the personal level his only link with it is his father's participation in the Italian campaign in a support unit based at Caserta (he never knew his father, who died three months before Bill was born). The President will defend the legacy of the builders of Europe. And he will consign it to the young people. His day tomorrow at the Nettunio and Anzio cemeteries will impart the tone to his entire European visit. Clinton will surround himself with World War II veterans. In practice he will show that America has forgotten nothing; that it is not isolationist; that it is Europe's big sister. There will be thousands of Americans there. The older ones will remember the bravery of paratroop General Maxwell Taylor, who in September 1943 entered Rome secretly, woke up [Prime Minister Marshal] Badoglio, asked him whether the Eternal City could be conquered, and, having received a negative reply, halted the bombers that were already on their way. They will recall another event in 1944 -- the lightning advance of Commander of the Fifth Army Mark Clark, who ordered his men to enter Rome by 1600 hours (they did so) in time to be photographed for the following day's newspapers. And they will return to America convinced that they have contributed to a historic turning point. Of course, there will be controversies. Over Germany's and Russia's exclusion from the commemorations, over Fini's assertion that his party is basically an Italian equivalent of the Gaullist party in France and of the Republican Party in the United States. But they will not spoil this great celebration for Italy and Europe.
