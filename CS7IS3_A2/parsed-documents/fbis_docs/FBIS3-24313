Pay the Tax!"] [Text] A year has elapsed since the adoption by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers of the Decree "On Tax Rates for Owners of Transport Means and Other Motor Vehicles and Machines." However, quite a few questions are still coming into our offices on this matter--from motor-vehicle owners and buffs, as well as from the leading officials at enterpriss. In this connection, the editors turned for the necessary explanations to the Administration for the Application of Tax Legislation under Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate. Our interviewee was Valentina Barishpolets. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Have there been any changes in taxation since the adoption of the above-mentioned Decree? [Barishpolets] Yes. In particular, the Law "On the Ukrainian State Budget for 1994" increased taxes levied on those juridical persons who are owners of foreign-made transport means obtained for SKV [freely convertable currency]. As of now, this tax amounts to 2.4 times the minimum wage per horsepower. Other amounts of the tax rates have remained unchanged. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Could you please tell us in greater detail about the procedure for paying this tax. [Barishpolets] Enterprises pay it annually during the first six months of the year. Citizens, however, can pay this tax once every two years, but not later than during the first six months of the year in which the technical inspection is conducted. For example, if a person has to have a technical inspection carried out in 1994, he must present a tax receipt for the years 1993 and 1994 to the GAI [State Motor-Vehicle Inspectorate] organs. A Person who did not pay this tax last year shall pay a tax for two years (1993 and 1994); moreover, the amount of this tax is determined on the basis of the minimum wage in force at the moment the tax is paid. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] And how is the tax computed? [Barishpolets] Computations are carried out directly by enterprises and organizations, based on accounting data concerning the number of transport means owned as of 1 January of the current year. No recomputation of the tax amount is to be carried out in connection with the retirement or acquisition of transport means during the course of the year in question. Citizens who have acquired transport means during the second six months of a particular year shall pay half the amount for that year. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Let's say, for example, that a motor vehicle is not used for certain reasons (its owner is on a lengthy business trip, there is a prolonged breakdown, etc.). What happens then with regard to the tax? [Barishpolets] If transport means are not used, the tax is--nevertheless--still levied on their owners, based on general principles. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] To whom are tax privileges granted? [Barishpolets] The following categories are exempt from paying this tax: --general-purpose automotive transport enterprises, but only for transport means which are engaged in hauling passengers; --institutions and organizations which are on the state budget; --Heroes of the Soviet Union, persons who have been awarded the Order of Glory of Three Classes, disabled persons from the Great Patriotic War, and other persons who also have such privileges in connection with existing legislation; --disabled persons having motor-scooters or motor vehicles with manual controls; --citizens relegated to Categories 1 and 2 of those persons who have suffered as a consequence of the accident at the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Power Station], as well as citizens relegated to Categories 3 and 4--prior to their being moved from the zone of guaranteed voluntary resettlement and the zones of intensified radiation ecological monitoring controls; --citizens resettled from radiation-contaminated zones of territories as a consequence of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl AES to other population centers over the course of three years after resettlement. Enterprises, associations and organizations, kolkhozes and sovkhozes situated in zones of guaranteed, voluntary resettlement and zones of intensified radiation ecological monitoring controls are exempt from taxation except for payments and contributions to local budgets. And one last point in this regard. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes are exempt from taxation on fire engines, first-aid vehicles, ambulances, and buses used to carry persons. But if the kolkhozes and sovkhozes have been converted into joint-stock companies, enterprises, and the like, they are obligated to pay this tax, based on general principles. [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Naturally, there are certain fines to be imposed on persons who fail to pay this kind of tax, are there not? [Barishpolets] Of course. If an enterprise has concealed an item subject to taxation or has reduced the sum-total of the tax, it must pay into the budget the entire sum of that tax, plus a penalty fine amounting to twice the amount of the aforesaid sum. For failing to submit an account of taxable items or executing such an account with violations, as well as for submitting in an insufficient or untimely manner computations or other documents to the tax organs, an enterprise shall pay into the budget an additional 50 percent of the necessary tax sums. Service personnel guilty of these and other violations shall be held administratively liable. For paying a tax late, a fine shall be exacted amounting to 0.2 percent of the sum for each day it is overdue.
