Rexrodt Criticizes Business's Innovation Failing"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] Berlin, Tuesday, 30 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Technology and founder centers have proven their worth as a tool for regional business development and promotion of innovation in the federal republic. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Technologie- und Grï¿½underzentren e.V. [Association of German Technology and Founder Centers Registered Association] (ADT) has drawn this conclusion. The occasion is the establishment of the first German technology center in Berlin (BIG) 10 years ago, which thus far has been followed by 161 additional foundings of centers over the entire territory of the federal republic. However, innovation centers are not a wonder drug by which jobs can be guaranteed in inefficient or uncompetitive companies, said Heinz Fiedler, head of ADT's managing board, putting a damper on excessive expectations at the fifth anniversary of his association. Particularly in the new federal states, where a real boom has developed since the change, "creating the bases for the development of small and medium-sized businesses" is of prime importance. Therefore, according to Fiedler, the centers in Eastern Germany are not serving mainly technology companies, but on the whole are oriented toward the promotion of entrepreneurship. In this sense, in the association's opinion, German innovation centers could also serve as a model for comparable institutions in the East European countries. However, a copy of the successful models from the West is not possible. Instead, the designs have to be adapted to the particular requirements in East Europe. However, Fiedler judges that this should cause no problem, because in Germany too each center is oriented toward local concerns and therefore is "somewhat different from the others." According to ADT, by now 100 founder centers exist in the former COMECON countries. Fifty-two centers have come into being in the new federal states, and they are distinguished by strong expansion of their regional offerings. Today they are offering to 500 companies with 3000 employees a business-oriented infrastructure that is assisting in the move into independence. More than 22,000 employees of just under 2700 companies are now working at innovation and founder centers in all of Germany. Just a few have given up in the last 10 years according to ADT. Because the innovation centers are regional initiatives, their spatial distribution differs very much over the territory of Germany. For example, while Bavaria has just four such centers, the intensive development in North Rhine-Westphalia has resulted in the establishment of 49 facilities. Saturation has been reached by now in some federal states, says ADT head Guido Baranowski. In his opinion both public and private-industry models have proven their worth in financing. In any case, the innovation centers have to make their terms and conditions market oriented in the long run, in their own interest and also in the interest of their companies. Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Rexrodt (FDP [Free Democratic Party]) in the prelude to ADT's anniversary criticized German industry's failing in innovation. The reasons for this lie in companies themselves too, the minister said. Financial relief and beneficial tax incentives alone can bring about no fundamental changes. In this connection, Rexrodt also called for a better functioning venture capital market in Germany. In spite of the numerous venture capital funds in the meanwhile, no breakthrough has been attained to date in this area.
