According to his assessment, the situation in Kazakhstan is characterized mainly by negative processes and unstable phenomena: "The crisis and its extreme manifestations in the form of the slump and rising inflation are nullifying many of our efforts to stabilize the economy and are a heavy burden on citizens' shoulders." The speech and the president's message outline the main areas of what N. Nazarbayev sees as the best option for Kazakhstan's development. Center stage goes to a money-credit and banking reform "which takes real and not formal account of the sovereign state's demands on the market economy" in which the key task is to halt galloping inflation and strengthen the national currency. The president believes that Kazakhstan has only one path to financial stabilization -- the reduction of all state spending apart from the most essential: appropriations for the payment of wages, pensions, and social security grants. According to this program all subsidies to enterprises, both direct and hidden, are to be terminated with the result that loss-makers will face bankruptcy but the state will not bear any responsibility for that. It is necessary to cut spending on the upkeep of state agencies. In addition, prices for all types of goods and services are to be decontroled. The head of state dwelt in particular on the problem of stability in Kazakhstan. He dealt in greatest detail with the sensitive question of migration, noting that he is enraged both by the "attempts to overdo it" and the "desire to embellish reality a little and pretend that there is nothing special happening." Population loss due to migration has been characteristic of Kazakhstan for a quarter of a century now but in recent years has increased more than tenfold, reaching 222,100 people last year. N. Nazarbayev cited factors which, in his view, have been encouraging non-Kazakhs to leave Kazakhstan and said that the prime reason was mistakes in language policy and the definition of the status of the state language. N. Nazarbayev asserted that "it is necessary immediately to adopt a new law on languages and remove all discrimination against the Russian language, which is just as necessary to the development of the Kazakhs and other peoples as it is to Russian-speaking population itself." A negative role, to use the president's phrase, was also played by the "distortion in cadre policy" and the "imbalance in the admission of school-leavers to higher and secondary specialized educational institutions." In addition, N. Nazarbayev believes that the time has come to draw attention to manifestations of vulgar nationalism and said that "there must be severe penalities for racial abuse." All these conclusions are correct but are they not too late? In addition, the author of the message ignored questions relating to the domestic political reorganization in Kazakhstan. He believes, among other things, that the best option would to be reform parliament as a bicameral body, empowering it to impeach the president and empowering the president to dissolve parliament. There must also be a fundamental restructuring of the legal system. As for the activity of the government, which is presently receiving most criticism, the president said that the Cabinet of Ministers should be given carte blanche for 15 months in order to implement the updated program of anticrisis measures. However, that did not stop N. Nazarbayev from carrying out a reorganization and a reshuffle in the government cabinet literally just a couple of days later. The most interesting of the cadre reshuffles is the appointment of 40-year old Kozykorpesh Yesenberlin, head of the Alemsistem Finance and Investment Corporation, one of the largest nonstate production and commercial structures in Kazakhstan, to one of the key posts in the government -- chairman of the State Committee for State Property. Whatever else, it is hard to describe the change of holders of government portfolios as anything other than positive.
