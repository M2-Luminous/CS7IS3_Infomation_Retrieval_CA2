Al-Zahhar: If this police force is here to serve the community, we will receive it willingly, but if it becomes the hands of Israel to establish a tyrannical regime in this area, I believe that they will do what Israel wishes. The people will endure no more tyrannies. They have resisted the occupation since 1967 and paid a high price -- thousands of years of imprisonment, thousands of martyrs. We seek the elimination of any kind of occupation. [passage omitted] Cymerman: Will Hamas take part in the general elections for the autonomous entity? Al-Zahhar: [passage omitted] Hamas will not take part in the elections and will not assume the role of opposition in the Palestinian autonomous entity. Hamas will continue to resist the Israelis' presence by all means.
