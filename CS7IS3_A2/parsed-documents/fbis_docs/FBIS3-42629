It was complicated further by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. In total, about 5.9 million hectares of land have been polluted, of which 3 million hectares are farmland. A zone of adverse ecological influence extending along a radius of two to three kilometers is immediately formed around the drained territories. This zone exceeds the drained area by factors of four or five. On 0.25 million hectares of sandy soil, the yields of potatoes fell by 18 percent; of flax, by 22 percent; and of winter rye, by 27 percent. The level of subsurface water in summer came down by almost one meter. One-half of the small rivers are tied to land reclamation systems, which has brought about the internal redistribution of their runoff; at times, water becomes unfit for use. The number of typical marshland plant species declined by more than one-half. The area of cranberry bogs fell from 93,000 to 23,000 hectares. The environment for the reproduction of wild fauna was disrupted; the area of hunting grounds was reduced. The fish catch dropped by a factor of almost five. Forests are drying up over a considerable area. For this reason, taking into consideration these unfavorable changes in the environment of the region, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine has prepared and submitted for coordination the draft decree of the Cabinet of Ministers "On Developing and Implementing a Program of Priority Measures for the Abatement of the Unfavorable Effect of Land Reclamation by Drainage and Radioactive Contamination on the Ecological Condition of Polissya." Within the framework of this program, it is envisaged to suspend the draining of marshes and forests in the territory of Polissya and to switch to the technical retrofitting of drainage systems with a view to improving their effectiveness.
