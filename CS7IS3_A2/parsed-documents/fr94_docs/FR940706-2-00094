FR940706-2-00094 FR940706-2-00053 Studies are needed (1) to describe more fully the pattern of SIPP_CPS differences in poverty estimates for the aged, and (2) to establish, if possible, the factors giving rise to the observed differences. SIPP-CPS differences should be delineated for population subgroups defined in terms of salient characteristics such as marital status, more broadly defined aspects of family composition, including the presence of nonaged family members, age, race and ethnicity. Differences should, at a minimum, be characterized in terms of poverty counts, rates, and the poverty gap. Particular attention should be given to evaluating possible differences between the two surveys in the portrayal of poverty as it relates to increasing age. Given that the pattern of poverty by population subgroup is of particular interest, the relatively small sample size available in single SIPP panels as compared with the CPS is likely to be of some concern. If, as is suggested by review of published estimates, it can be shown that the basic patterns of SIPP-CPS differences are stable across the post-1984 SIPP panels, serious consideration should be given to pooling the post-1984 panels in order to support as detailed a subgroup analysis as is possible, given the substantially larger sample sizes available from pooled samples. If the combining of SIPP panels seems feasible, the combined panels should be employed to support the explanatory phase of the overall study, as well. After developing a plan for documenting more fully SIPP-CPS differences in the portrayal of poverty among the aged, the grantee might discuss how the observed differences might be explained. In this regard a critical review of the literature that has considered the differences between poverty rate estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the CPS might prove quite useful in generating hypotheses and in formulating empirical approaches to testing the hypotheses. While several possible factors are likely to be suggested by this review (e.g., sample weighting, particularly that component of the overall weighting scheme designed to deal with panel attrition; differing operationalizations of the income unit; differing income concepts; and the quality of income data), emphasis in empirical work should be given to the last factor, the relative quality of the income data from the two surveys. However, some attention could also be given to the change in SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates that occurred with the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. 1 The nature of each hypothesized factor to be considered and how it might cause the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences might be described. A closely reasoned plan for empirically assessing the possible impact data quality on the differences in SIPP-CPS poverty rates for the aged may be presented. Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the relevance of each proposed test for clarifying the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences, notwithstanding the fact that it may not be possible to devise fully unambiguous tests of the effects of income data quality on the observed SIPP-CPS differences. 1 The prospective grantee will find it useful to consult recent work conducted by the Bureau of the Census comparing income estimates for calendar year 1990 from the two surveys and Report no. 17, Studies in Income Distribution, for similar material related to SIPP/CPS differences for the 1983&hyph;84 period. Recent work conducted at the Bureau of the Census by Lamas, Tin and Eargle about the effect of attrition in the SIPP context on differences in SIPP-CPS poverty rates should also be consulted. Given the level of available funding, empirical work should be limited to describing the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates (rates, counts, and gaps). As much of the study will revolve around comparison of alternative estimates within or between survey contexts, issues of statistical inference also need to be given careful consideration. In particular, given the results of SSA research on the variance properties of SIPP-based estimates of the aged, standard errors for SIPP estimates should be based on the generalized variance parameters as estimated by SSA (see the note by Bye and Gallicchio appearing in the winter 1993 Social Security Bulletin) or calculated directly from the survey file using the methods outlined in the Bye-Gallicchio article. Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding not to exceed 17 months in duration. The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant.
