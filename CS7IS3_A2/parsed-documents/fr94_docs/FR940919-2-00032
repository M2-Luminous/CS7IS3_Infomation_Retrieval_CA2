FR940919-2-00032 FR940919-2-00030 Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Name of Firm: Sunset Boulevard Car Wash Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 Case Number: LEF&hyph;0112 Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund proceedings. 10 CFR 205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations. In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by ERA on July 20, 1993. In that Petition, ERA specifically requests that we formulate refund procedures to disburse funds that had been remitted to DOE by Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset). The funds at issue in that Petition were obtained through a Remedial Order (the Order) issued by our Office on October 22, 1980. Under the terms of the Order, Sunset remitted $52,092.73 to the DOE to remedy pricing violations which Sunset committed between August 1, 1979 and January 27, 1980. 1 These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. The present Decision and Order sets forth final procedures for the distribution of those funds to qualified purchasers of Sunset's refined products. 1 Sunset remitted a total of $52,092.73. The PDO inadvertently stated that Sunset remitted $52,093.73. I. Jurisdiction and Authority The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981) and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). II. Background The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Sunset was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 210 and 10 CFR part 212, subpart F. The Order states that from August 1, 1979 to January 27, 1980 (the audit period), Sunset charged prices higher than those permitted by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make its records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b). Sunset was ordered to reduce its prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of gasoline had been sold at reduced prices to remedy the violations. 2 After decontrol, the Order was modified to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 20 FERC ¶62,319 at 63,537 ( Sunset ) (1982). Under the terms of the modified Order (the MO), Sunset was required to disgorge and remit to DOE the violation amount and the profits it had acquired as a result of its violation of the aforementioned provisions of the pricing regulations. 2 The Order imposed no sanctions upon Sunset as a result of its failure to make its records available in accordance with 10 CFR 210.92(b). See Remedial Order at 1 and 7. Sunset objected to the remedial provisions of the MO at every available tier of administrative and judicial review. As a result, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) affirmed the MO on August 12, 1982. When Sunset renewed its objections in proceedings before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the District Court affirmed the MO. Finally, on March 9, 1993, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals definitively disposed of Sunset's objections. Bush v. U.S. , 989 F.2d 509 (Em. App. 1993). III. The Proposed Decision and Order On November 24, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the funds that Sunset had remitted to DOE pursuant to the MO. We proposed implementing a two stage refund proceeding and we stated that purchasers of Sunset motor gasoline would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event funds remained after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the remaining funds would be disbursed in the second stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4501) (PODRA). We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received no comments since the PDO was published in the Federal Register more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally outlined. Set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications during the first stage, as well as, the provisions governing distribution of any remaining funds in the second stage proceeding. IV. First Stage Refund Procedures Refund applications submitted in the Sunset special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we often adopt rebuttable presumptions which relate to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our belief that adoption of these presumptions permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger numbers by avoiding the need to incur inordinate expense; and facilitates our consideration of first stage refund applications. 10 CFR 205.282(e). For those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding.
