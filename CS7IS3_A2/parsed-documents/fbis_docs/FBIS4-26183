Of the higher learning institutes, 15 have been authorized by the State Education Commission to confer diplomas and the rest are supervised by provincial, regional or municipal educational and administrative departments. Apart from that, there are still around 30,000 private schools engaged in short-term staff training, vocational education and other social and cultural education. The private schools are well in compliance with the market economy in how they are run, from interior management to their hiring of teachers. These schools have extended their range from adult education to primary, technical and higher education. Private school students generally pay for their education themselves and find their own jobs after graduation. In Shanghai, private schools have now turned to training urgently needed personnel in the fields of financial insurance, real estate development, and foreign-related trade and law. In 1987 the agricultural province of Jiangxi set up a correspondence college to help rural areas to prosper. Already 132,000 students have graduated from the college. Now the correspondence college has set up branches, tutoring stations and classes all over the province. They all focus on one or more special skills and have greatly helped to promote the development of local agriculture. With the boom in private education, China is enhancing law-making and management to guide it. According to an official from the State Education Commission, a regulation on private education is to be published by the State Council soon and the Education Commission will also make detailed rules for practice.
