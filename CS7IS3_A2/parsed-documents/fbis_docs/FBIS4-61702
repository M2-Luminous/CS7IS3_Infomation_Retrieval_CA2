Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 6 May, she said that that report was outdated as she had submitted an application to the Central Electoral Commission for her candidacy to be withdrawn. "I was nominated when Leonid Kravchuk had not yet decided to take part in the presidential election. When that happened, I wrote a letter declining to run," she said. In Larysa Skoryk's words, she did not expect to win but wanted "to spoil a little bit the mood of such contenders as Leonid Kuchma." Larysa Skoryk said that in the event of the presidential election being held, the Nationwide Movement of Ukraine would back Leonid Kravchuk "who will undoubtedly gather 100,000 in his support." The organization led by her has taken part in the collection of these signatures. UNIAN has been informed by the Central Electoral Commission that Larysa Skoryk's application for the withdrawal of her candidacy was dated 5 May. She received forms to collect signatures in her support on the same day.
