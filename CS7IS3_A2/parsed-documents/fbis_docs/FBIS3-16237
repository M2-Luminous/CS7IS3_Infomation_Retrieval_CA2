On Friday [11 March], at the end of a shuttle trip between PLO headquarters and Israel, Moscow's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev "announced" the imminent resumption of the negotiations broken off after the Hebron massacre. In fact, Yasir `Arafat was rather reserved, and all attention is now shifting to UN headquarters, where the Security Council is due to vote Monday on a resolution on the massacre, the text of which is now almost completely ready. In his joint press conference with the PLO leader Friday evening, Kozyrev treated this as a fait accompli, talking in terms of Yasir `Arafat's "great courage." The latter confined himself to reaffirming the "political" commitment to resume negotiations, which has in any case never been denied. Yesterday Palestinian sources specified that it is necessary to await the Security Council vote before negotiations can resume and that Russia and the United States, as "co-sponsors" of the peace conference must provide "practical" guarantees of the Palestinians' security. This is precisely what Israel does not want. In any case Washington clearly told `Arafat a few days ago that it would prevent the approval of the UN resolution unless the PLO pledges to resume the dialogue with Israel. Yesterday the U.S. Government received Kozyrev's "announcement" with great circumspection. Be that as it may, Moscow's foreign minister seemed determined to exploit the Middle Eastern arena, too, in order to bring Russian foreign policy to international attention again, and `Arafat for the present seems willing to provide him with the opportunity to do so. This obviously pleased Kozyrev, who was in Genoa yesterday on an unscheduled stopover necessitated by fog over Rome airport: "It is the critical nature of the present situation that demands that all forces mobilize for peace," he told journalists, recalling that he had spoken two days ago with the U.S. State Department's second-in-command, Strobe Talbott: "We are agreed in our impression: Either we succeed in salvaging the peace process in the Middle East right away, or we are bound to lapse back into conflict. Our efforts are shared by the United States. When the house is in flames, everyone must help to quench the blaze." [LA REPUBBLICA] But some people have the impression that the United States really is not pleased with this latest Russian diplomatic initiative. [Kozyrev] We spoke the evening before my departure, and I explained my intentions. I was assured that there are no objections to the plan. In any case, we are in constant contact. After the Hebron tragedy, the main problem is for everyone to do their utmost to safeguard peace. This task involves Russia and the United States, but also the Security Council, within which we have gone to very great pains to establish a text acceptable to both Israel and the PLO. [Kozyrev ends] After a brief stroll through the city accompanied by Russian Consul Valeriy Karassev (he wanted to visit Columbus' house), he had a conversation with journalists at the airport in which he gave an account of his meetings in Tunis and Jerusalem: "Rabin and Peres in Israel and `Arafat in Tunis agreed on restarting the peace process and negotiations. It was more difficult for `Arafat, of course, who is demanding guarantees for the Palestinian population in the occupied territories. Partly for this reason, I believe that the resumption of the dialogue is a wise move on his part, and also a very courageous one." [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a success for Russia? [Kozyrev] Let us call it a joint achievement by Russia and the United States. At my meeting Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok, we will talk about how our two countries can make themselves useful at this stage. We are willing to provide all the technical assistance necessary to organize the negotiations. [LA REPUBBLICA] But when can the negotiations resume? [Kozyrev] It is up to the Palestinians and Israelis to decide where, when, and how to meet. We will accept whatever decision they may make. It does not matter whether they meet in Washington or in Cairo: The only thing that counts is that an opening be created. And that the two sides agree on the need to settle the issue of Gaza and Jericho right away. And to proceed from there to extend their agreement. [Kozyrev ends] The only uncertainty hanging over the peace process, Kozyrev said, is precisely the Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre; its section covering measures to protect the Palestinians living in the territories occupied by Israel, which the PLO regards as a precondition. "But it is not only the PLO now," the Russian foreign minister said. "Israel, too, has clearly stated that the opening is conditional on the adoption of the UN resolution." However, the text of the resolution, presented yesterday evening by Russia, Spain, France, and Britain, is very vague about how security should be guaranteed. It calls for unspecified "measures" to ensure the protection of Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied territories, including "a temporary international or foreign presence." This is exactly what the Palestinians are demanding and the Israelis refusing. The wording of the UN resolution is vague, however, and cites the "Declaration of Principles" signed by `Arafat and Rabin in Washington on 13 September, which refers only to Gaza and Jericho and which in any case requires agreement between the two sides. The United States has objections on this point and on the section of the introduction that explicitly cites Jerusalem as being among the territories occupied by Israel. According to the Israeli Government, however, the city is the country's sole and indivisible capital, and there must be no discussion of its future for the present.
