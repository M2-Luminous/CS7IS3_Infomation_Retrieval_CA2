The discussions centered on the current education crisis, violence, and freedom of the press. Siaka Konate has the details: [Siaka] The education crisis and the violence it engendered were at the center of this news conference. (Ameyi Dicko) of the Union for Democracy and Development gave a lot of information on the causes of the crisis and the opposition's contacts with the government aimed at ending it. For his part, Ousmane Edmond Traore of the National Committee for Democratic Initiative [CNID] made suggestions aimed at ending the violence. [Begin Traore recording] It is necessary and compulsory to release the students who were arrested, namely the Association of Malian Students and Pupils [AEEM] activists who were recently arrested. We condemn their acts of vandalism and violence but we call for their release since peace in this country is priceless. Also, we call on the AEEM and even demand the AEEM to stop its acts of vandalism because vandalism has never solved any problems. We appeal to the government for multilateral dialogue as the AEEM no longer trusts the government. Since the association no longer trusts in negotiations, it is forced to obtain some guarantees and such guarantees are the other social forces. There is a need for multilateral dialogue to put an end to confrontation and misunderstanding due to mistrust. [end recording] The CNID official also condemned what he described as verbal threats uttered by some top state officials, the excesses of the security forces, and the behavior of private militias. Concluding, he denied that the AEEM was manipulated by the opposition, adding that the AEEM is manipulated by its own problems. For his part, the PSP [Progressive Sudanese Party] representative called for a national debate to be attended by all the social partners to help end the crisis. According to Ousmane Dicko, this debate which will aim at restoring social peace as well as security of goods and people will tackle all the nation's major problems, namely the education crisis, fraud, insecurity, structural adjustment, and so on. Another issue discussed at this news conference was press freedom. The related paper was read by Ibrahim Diakite of the National Front. After stressing the media's role in the advent of democracy in Mali, the official said government is stifling press freedom. In this regard, he denounced the closing down of Radio Kaira, the censorship in force at the radio and television broadcasting corporation, and the lack of statutes for independent radios. He therefore made some suggestions to safeguard press freedom. [Begin Diakite recording] We suggest, first, the presence of media practitioners elected by their colleagues, representatives of the Malian Association for the Defense of Human Rights and of the Malian Bar Association within the national committee on equal access to state media. Second, we suggest the extension of the committee's responsibilities beyond the period of electoral campaigns. The opposition wants the Higher Communication Council to include media practitioners elected by their colleagues. It calls for the division of the Malian Press Agency into three different directorates: First, a directorate of publications for ESSOR, PODIUM, and so on; a directorate of the news agency in charge of gathering news; and a directorate of advertisement. Finally, the opposition calls for the review of the provisions of the law on the media and related offenses. [end recording]
