Japan could not concede to Washington because what they asserted in the talks was unreasonable. Japan is also to blame for its inappropriate response to U.S. demands. Japan flatly rejected U.S. demands for setting "objective criteria," saying: "They will lead to managed trade." Although the rejection was reasonable, Japan had no counterproposals. Washington was very dissatisfied and said: "What can Japan propose instead?" Japan should have a sense of remorse over its actions. The relationship between Japan and the United States in the postwar era has been like that of a child and an adult. However, now that Japan has become a powerful state, it is no longer allowed to yield and act under pressure. In other words, I think Japan is now in the process of freeing itself from "gaiatsu [external pressure]" by the United States. The recent summit meeting was a reflection of this process. Japan will not be free from gaiatsu unless it makes decisions and implements them on its own. I told foreign and finance ministers that the future of Japan-U.S. relations depends on how Japan deals with the United States. What Japan should do now is to achieve economic growth through the expansion of domestic demand. Also, it should promote deregulation in priority areas in the framework trade talks. There are undesirable trends both in Japan and the United States. In Japan, people tend to praise the "Japan that can say no." This is very dangerous. On the other hand, some Americans are in favor of "Japan bashing" measures. Japan should watch this trend carefully. There are arguments in the United States that Washington should take punitive actions against Japan and that it should incite the yen to rise. These arguments are wrong and too emotional. It is necessary for both the United States and Japan to refrain from becoming emotional. If Washington imposes sanctions on Japan, Tokyo should react calmly. Since it is obvious that such sanctions run counter to GATT rules, Japan should file a complaint with GATT. Concerning the appreciation of the yen, I think Japan will be able to avert a further hike if it makes efforts to open Japanese markets wider and increase imports. The Japanese system, practices, and rules are slightly different from those in the United States. However, the two nations have the common goal of achieving reforms in accordance with principles of the market economy. I do not think the conflict of opinion between the two nations will intensify and become serious. In the recent summit meeting, the two leaders confirmed that Japan-U.S. relations are more important than anything else in such fields as politics and security. I want to stress that this is a great result. They also noted that despite severe economic relations and many twists and turns, the two nations should continue to cherish their entire relationship. First of all, Japan should decide what it should do and implement what it has decided. After having done so, it should consider how to deal with the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting.
