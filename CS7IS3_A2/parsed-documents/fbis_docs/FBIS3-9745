Early elections at the time being "would hinder Romania's political and economic functioning," opined Adrian Nastase. The PSDR leader said also that the PSDR could reasonably consider the opportunity of local elections as much as certain political forces were asking for general elections. By the time of the local elections of February 1992, the PSDR had not been formed yet, reminded Adrian Nastase. As the local authorities are the ones to administer the general elections, the ruling party would have no degree of involvement in the territory in case of early parliamentary elections, said Nastase. The PSDR would therefore assign a higher priority to early local elections, ahead of general elections. The PSDR leader reminded also that the recent polls confirmed that the PSDR had maintained its popularity with the electorate as revealed by the past parliamentary elections of September 1992, some 28 percent.
