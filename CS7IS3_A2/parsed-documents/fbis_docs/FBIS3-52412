During a popular rally in Ismailia today, the Awqaf minister said that a stable Egypt that is influential on the world stage is a safety valve for the Arab and Islamic worlds. He stressed that Egypt's leading role in the Islamic world will not ebb because the country is greater than any attempt to undermine it. He said such attempts will merely serve to enhance its role. Mahjub added that everyone must know that Egypt has no designs on others, that history is witness to this, and that it is only concerned with the security of its sister countries. He urged the nation's ulema, in the name of Islam, to seek to unite the nation's ranks and protect its ideology, declaring that any negligence in this sphere is a crime against religion and the homeland. Regarding freedom in Islam, Mahjub said that freedom in Islam means commitment and good behavior, not chaos and disunity. He added that any attempt to slander religion is a call to dismember the homeland and cannot be termed freedom of expression. Mahjub said: Slandering religion is as unacceptable as terrorism under the guise of religion.
