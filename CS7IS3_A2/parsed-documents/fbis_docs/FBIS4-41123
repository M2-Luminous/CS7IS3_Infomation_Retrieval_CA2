At the founding session of the Baltic Council of Ministers we adopted Terms of Reference for the Council. The Minister President of the Republic of Latvia was elected chairman of the Baltic Council of Ministers for the first year, until 1 July 1995. We also signed an Agreement on Baltic Parliamentary and Governmental Cooperation between the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. We view the signing of this Agreement as an historic step towards the integration of the Baltic States into the European Union. We consider that there is still much to be done to strengthen practical cooperation. Among the first priorities is to ensure the provision of social security for citizens of one Baltic State living on the territory of another, the standardization of customs systems and the facilitation of border-crossings between our countries. Signed by Valdis Birkavs, Minister President of the Republic of Latvia; Adolfas Slezevicius, Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania; Mart Laar, Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia Tallinn, 13 June, 1994
