In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that the date of the meeting has yet to be set. Observers believe that Yeltsin had been putting off the meeting with Dudayev, waiting for his old foe, former Russian parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov to leave the Chechen Republic where he stayed after his release from prison under amnesty earlier this year. Now that Khasbulatov is in Moscow, the last obstacle has been removed.
