Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly briefing that there are doubts about the timing. "We think nothing now must detract from the priority of the possibility of removing Serbian positions (around Sarajevo) by an air intervention." "Our demand and expectation from NATO is that it takes decisions to produce action and results without delay," Ataman said. "We are hopeful and optimistic." Ambassadors of 16 NATO members gathered for a crucial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to decide whether to send an ultimatum to Serbs to withdraw forces besieging Sarajevo in 10 days or face air strikes. "We observe a strong and general wish to take measures to stop this savagery without delay," Ataman said. "NATO is at an important junction. Its credibility is at stake." Turkey has had a squadron of F-16 planes attached to a NATO force based in Italy since last year to patrol Bosnia skies and Ataman said the force could be utilized if NATO command wanted. Sixty eight civilians were massacred and 200 wounded when Serbian mortar turned a Sarajevo marketplace into a pool of blood.
