Ernesto Suarez, secretary of the National Assembly of the People's Government, ANPP, today told GRANMA that the ANPP will study the main topics discussed by the workers during the so-called workers parliaments (approximately 800,000 meetings attended by more than 3 million workers and which were held in February and March). Suarez said everyone understands that the ANPP will not approve a capitalist-type "package of measures" aimed at solving the country's problems. The ANPP secretary said the measures adopted will be implemented gradually, as the government has been doing since last year. Ernesto Suarez said that even though the measures will be implemented gradually, they will most probably represent some sacrifice for everyone, but, Suarez stressed, no citizen will be abandoned. The ANPP will hold an extraordinary meeting to study and approve work policies, ideas, guidelines, and plans to confront the serious economic and financial problems Cuba is confronting. These measures will be added to those already implemented.
