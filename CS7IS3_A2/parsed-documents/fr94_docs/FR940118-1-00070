FR940118-1-00070 FR940118-1-00010 Proposed ยง600.55 (current ยง601.4) Additional criteria for determining whether a foreign graduate medical school is eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. The Secretary proposes to add to the criteria in current ยง601.4 a requirement for a foreign graduate medical school to employ as faculty members only those with academic credentials equivalent to credentials required of faculty members teaching the same or similar courses in the United States. The Secretary considers this requirement necessary for determining the comparability of foreign graduate medical schools to medical schools in the United States. The Secretary proposes to replace the current requirement in ยง601.4(e) concerning the pass rate of students and graduates of foreign graduate medical schools on ECFMG examinations with new requirements. The new requirements are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA. Under those statutory changes, for the year preceding the year in which any of a foreign graduate medical school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally at least 60 percent of the school's enrolled students and 60 percent of its graduates must have been neither citizens nor nationals of the United States nor eligible noncitizens for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs. Further, for the year preceding the year in which any of the school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally at least 60 percent of the school's students or graduates taking ECFMG examinations must have received a passing score on those examinations. The Secretary, in implementing these requirements, proposes several clarifications to ensure the statistical accuracy and uniformity of a foreign graduate medical school's calculations. For purposes of the calculation concerning the citizenship of the school's students and graduates, the school would count only those enrolled students who are full-time regular students. The Secretary believes that it is necessary to restrict this calculation to full-time regular students to prevent institutions from enrolling a significant number of part-time students who are not seeking a degree or certificate in order to obtain the required percentage. The school would count as graduates only those from its most recent graduating class during the academic year preceding the year for which the calculation is performed. For purposes of the calculation concerning the pass rate of the school's students and graduates, the school would count all enrolled students, regardless of their enrollment status or their regular student status. The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to count all enrolled students or graduates in the pass rate calculations in order to obtain a larger sample, thereby ensuring statistical accuracy and validity. A second reason to include all enrolled students in the pass rate calculation is that the statute requires the Secretary to consider the pass rate on the examinations administered by the ECFMG as a measure of comparability to medical schools located in the United States. Performance on the examinations administered by the ECFMG reflects both the quality of the education at the foreign medical school and the knowledge of the individual student who takes the examination. Thus, it is appropriate to include the scores of all students in this calculation to fully reflect the comparability of the institution and its students and graduates to medical schools located in the United States. The Secretary also notes that the statute did not expressly exclude any students from calculation of the pass rate. The school would count as graduates those persons who graduated from the school during the three years preceding the year for which the calculation is performed. The ECFMG examinations are administered separately in two steps: Step 1 includes basic medical sciences and Step 2 includes the clinical sciences. A person may take each step in different years. In addition, the ECFMG administers an English test for purposes of satisfying the requirement for demonstrating English language competency to obtain ECFMG certification. Therefore, the Secretary would require the school's calculation for any year to include any student or graduate who took any step of the ECFMG examinations, including the English test. Section 481(a)(2) of the HEA exempts from both of the above calculations a foreign graduate medical school whose clinical program has been approved by a State as of January 1, 1992. The Secretary would include this exemption, but would further require the school's clinical program to maintain current State approval. The Secretary believes that this additional requirement is necessary to establish that a school that does not meet the applicable minimum percentages at least has a clinical program comparable to one provided by an eligible institution of higher education in the United States. This section also would require a foreign graduate medical school to be accredited by an accrediting body legally authorized to evaluate the quality of graduate medical school educational programs and facilities in the school's country. The accreditation standards used by that accrediting body would have to be evaluated by an advisory panel of medical experts appointed by the Secretary and that panel would have to determine if those standards are comparable to those used for accrediting medical schools in the United States. A public or nonprofit school that is not accredited would have to be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency designated by the Secretary. (Currently, the Secretary recognizes the Liaison Committee on Medical Education for the accreditation of programs leading to the M.D. degree.) These accreditation requirements are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA.
