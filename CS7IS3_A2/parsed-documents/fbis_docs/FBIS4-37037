[Paris AFP in English at 1900 GMT on 15 June in a Cairo-datelined item adds the following: ["Egyptian security services have arrested five lawyers just hours after the prosecutor's office refused to release 33 others being held on public order charges, a human rights body said Wednesday. ["The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said the five were arrested overnight and condemned the measure, saying it could only aggravate the tension between the government and the bar association. ["Earlier the prosecutor retained in custody 33 lawyers arrested during a rally organised by the bar association to protest the death in custody of colleague 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, a legal source said. ["Most of the 38 now being held belong to the outlawed but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood. ["The human rights group said the lawyers had been accused of "disturbing public order, inciting demonstrations and holding leaflets they intended to distribute. ["In a statement it condemned the fact that such acts were banned although they "form part of the right to non-violent expression. ["The group also called on the government to release its findings into Madani's death. Lawyers have charged Madani was tortured to death in April, but the prosecutor's office has said he suffered an asthma attack."]
