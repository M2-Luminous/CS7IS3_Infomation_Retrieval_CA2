Velasquez conceded that the Venezuelan Government's insolvency is due to a "huge foreign debt," as well as to an "even greater social debt, which cannot wait." According to Velasquez, the social debt is pending with 48 percent of Venezuelans living in extreme poverty and whose incomes fail to cover the price of essential goods. Aside from this, the current situation is that the government's social debt also affects the middle class, which has been hard-hit constantly since "the government for the poor" made everyone poor. This is the way we have felt since that tragic Black Friday. Since that time, and in a sustained manner, the "middle class," which does not receive any food stamps or other state subsidies, is becoming ever smaller. The middle class only has a salary, from which growing amounts are being deducted for taxes, social security, and the housing fund without receiving any benefits in exchange. The Venezuelan "middle class" is one that does not illegally hook its homes into the electric power grid but, rather, pays its entire bill, including monthly "adjustments," and accordingly, the bills for other services -- if they work -- such as water, gas, telephone, and garbage collection, which also have extra charges. The middle class comprises those Venezuelans who can no longer afford a car, not only because a car is now as costly as a luxury home used to be, but also because they cannot pay for insurance to protect themselves from a very high theft risk. It includes those who had to stop dreaming about owning a decent home of their own because they had to give up their hopes for credit because of rising interest rates. The middle class also includes those who this year will have to forget about providing a better future for their children because they have no access to private schools or private medical attention, needless to say a well-balanced diet. The middle class also comprises those who today, in addition to witnessing a decline in their purchasing power, must face losing their savings if they had an account with Banco Latino or are afraid of losing them if the crisis spreads to other institutions. The middle class comprises professionals, technicians, and office clerks who, regardless of having a professional background, see their hopes disintegrating. Venezuelan society was always an open society where, with work and effort, the poor had the hope of becoming a member of the middle class. Leaving the shack was an achievable goal. Currently, the poor feel as though they will never leave the shack, while the middle class feels increasingly pushed toward the shack. The middle class builds the country. In Venezuela, these builders are being destroyed. It is important that the national leadership and, especially the new government, understand that that social debt is much greater, and that it cannot be paid with petty grants or food stamps. The solution to this problem lies in an open and valiant fight against inflation, which is impossible without a deficit reduction.
