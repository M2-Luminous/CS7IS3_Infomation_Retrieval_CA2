In a telephone message, the acting chairman of the Central Committee of DPRK's Red Cross Society, Yi Song-ho, told South Korean Red Cross President Kang Yong-hun that Seoul should return the two Korean People's Army soldiers, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. DPRK's red cross has sent messages to its South Korean counterpart on April 26 and 27, demanding the return of the two prisoners of war. However, the South Korean Red Cross has made no response. "This cannot be deemed righteous behavior on the part of the Red Cross officials whose essential mission is to show noble humanitarianism by saving human beings from misfortunes and helping them," Yi said. The two soldiers were taken prisoners by the U.S. Forces while engaging in guerrilla activities in the South Korean area during the Korean war, he noted. "They are obviously prisoners of war taking in account international law, and your side is obliged to send them back to our side," read the message. Yi urged the South Korean Red Cross not to follow the south side's authorities pursuing north-south confrontation, but to remain faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization. Meanwhile, Yi also asked the south to allow Kim Chi-hyon, daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, who was an unconverted prisoner, to return to DPRK for medical treatment. Kim Chi-hyon, who was born in the north, was suffering from "a serious illness," according to the message.
