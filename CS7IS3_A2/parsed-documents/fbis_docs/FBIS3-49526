This was the reaction of the Belgrade Patriarchate to the claim by Archbishop Mihail, newly-elected head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which have recently been published in the media, that Patriarch Pavle said that "Macedonians are a people, they have their state, and they have the right to have their own church."
