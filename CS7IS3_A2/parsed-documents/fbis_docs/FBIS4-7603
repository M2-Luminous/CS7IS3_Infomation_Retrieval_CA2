Over the last few days in Prijedor at least 7 Bosniak civilians were killed in retaliation for casualties the aggressor's army suffered in central Bosnia. The civilians were murdered after bodies of six of the aggressor's policemen, killed in the fighting around Doboj, were returned to Prijedor. All the Bosniaks have had their telephones cut off. The UNHCR was first informed of this terrible crime by a Muslim woman hiding in the house of her Serb neighbor. [Word indistinct] is continuing in Sanski Most, where Serb refugees are moved into the homes of Bosniaks, Kris Janovski said. Exposed to constant pressure and unbearable living conditions, the Bosniaks are simply forced to leave their homes. Some 850 Serbs, refugees from Zenica, Zepce, and Zavidovici have recently arrived in Banja Luka, and they are accommodated through the expulsion of Bosniaks.
