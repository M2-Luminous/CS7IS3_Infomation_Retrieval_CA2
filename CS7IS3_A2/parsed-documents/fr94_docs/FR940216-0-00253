FR940216-0-00253 FR940216-0-00010 (1) Exhaust benzene emissions, simple model, 6.77; (2) Exhaust benzene emissions, complex model, 34.68 mg/mile; (3) Exhaust toxics emissions, 53.20 mg/mile in Phase I, 109.7 mg/mile in Phase II; (4) NO X emissions, 750.1 mg/mile in Phase I, 1534. mg/mile in Phase II. (viii) When compliance is achieved using the simple model (per §80.101), increases in each of the annual average baseline values (per §80.90) of sulfur, olefins and T90 due to work-in-progress adjustments are limited to the larger of: (A) The unadjusted annual average baseline value of each specified fuel parameter specified in this paragraph (e)(5)(viii); or (B) The following values: (1) Sulfur, 355 ppm; (2) Olefins, 11.3 volume percent; (3) T90, 349 ○F. (ix) All work-in-progress adjustments must be accompanied by: (A) Unadjusted and adjusted fuel parameters, emissions, and volumes; and (B) A description of the current status of the work-in-progress (i.e., the refinery modification project) and the date on which normal operations were achieved; and (C) A narrative describing the situation, the types of calculations, and the reasoning supporting the types of calculations done to determine the adjusted values. (6) Baseline adjustment for extenuating circumstances. (i) Baseline adjustments may be allowed, upon petition and approval (per §80.93), if a refinery had downtime of a gasoline blendstock producing unit for 30 days or more in 1990 due to: (A) Unplanned, unforeseen circumstances; or (B) Non-annual maintenance (turnaround). (ii) Fuel parameter and volume adjustments shall be made by assuming that the downtime did not occur in 1990. (iii) All extenuating circumstance adjustments must be accompanied by: (A) Unadjusted and adjusted fuel parameters, emissions, and volumes; and (B) A description of the current status of the extenuating circumstance and the date on which normal operations were achieved; and (C) A narrative describing the situation, the types of calculations, and the reasoning supporting the types of calculations done to determine the adjusted values. (7) Baseline adjustments for 1990 JP&hyph;4 production. (i) Baseline adjustments may be allowed, upon petition and approval (per §80.93), if a refinery produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in 1990 and meets all of the following requirements: (A) The refinery is the only refinery of a refiner such that it cannot form an aggregate baseline with another refinery (per paragraph (f) of this section) or all of the refineries of a refiner produced JP&hyph;4 in 1990 and each of the refineries also meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(7)(i) (B) and (C) of this section. (B) The refinery will not produce reformulated gasoline. If the refinery produces reformulated gasoline at any time in a calendar year, its compliance baseline shall revert to its unadjusted baseline values for that year and all subsequent years. (C) The ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production to its 1990 gasoline production equals or exceeds 0.5. (ii) Fuel parameter and volume adjustments shall be made by assuming that no JP&hyph;4 was produced in 1990. (iii) All adjustments due to 1990 JP&hyph;4 production must be accompanied by: (A) Unadjusted and adjusted fuel parameters, emissions, and volumes; and (B) A narrative describing the situation, the types of calculations, and the reasoning supporting the types of calculations done to determine the adjusted values.
