The relatives, who on Thursday ended their visit to Qiandao Lake with a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation led by deputy secretary-general Hsu Hui-you, said in a joint statement that the trip "hasn't increased their understanding of the truth" behind the tragedy, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew and guides were burned to death in the lower deck cabin of the tour boat they had been cruising on. "On the contrary, it did increase our doubts of the result of investigation," they said. Four mainlanders were arrested for robbing and murdering the tourists. The incident provoked a storm of protest in Taiwan and led to a boycott organized by local travel agents of tour groups to the mainland. The SEF delegation, which also included criminal investigators, visited Qiandao Lake and were able to inspect the boat on which the victims perished. In a meeting with mainland police Friday morning in Hanzhou, however, the group raised 50 questions pertaining to the incident, all of which went unanswered. Taiwan has accused the mainland of attempting to cover up the incident, and has demanded that it clear up remaining questions, such as the kind and number of weapons used by the killers, the time of the killing, and whether mainland police set fire to the boat a second time to destroy evidence of the crime. Meanwhile in Taipei, vice chairman Kao Koong-lien of the Mainland Affairs Council said that the SEF delegation will publish the results of its investigative trip prior to its departure for home Saturday. He called on local travel agents to continue the tour group boycott until mainland authorities make known all the facts of the case.
