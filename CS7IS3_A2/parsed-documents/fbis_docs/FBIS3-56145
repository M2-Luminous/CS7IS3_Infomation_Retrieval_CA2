It will also have great moral significance," Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko told a news conference in Minsk on Wednesday. The visit will break through the information vacuum caused by the fact that Belarus was not a sovereign state and will help it acquire its political face in the international arena, Kravchenko said. He added, however, that President Bill Clinton's visit to Belarus is not incidental. This is a recognition of its tactful, logical and well-balanced foreign policy, he said. The minister noted that during the talks the sides will discuss compensation to Belarus for nuclear disarmament. The visit will also give a fresh impetus to the development of bilateral relations between the two states. He did not rule out the possibility that a set of agreements may be signed after the visit, including agreements on investment privileges and protection of investments, on scientific cooperation and banking. As for the programme of Clinton's stay in Belarus, there will be a 30-minute welcoming ceremony at the airport. Then the U.S. delegation will proceed to Kuropaty, the burial place of the victims of Stalin repressions. In Kuropaty Clinton will also meet with Belarusian opposition leader Zenon Poznyak, confidential sources told the BELINFORM news agency. Closer to noon, Clinton is expected to hold talks with Belarusian Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. Clinton will also meet with Belarusian deputies. After the talks Clinton, Shushkevich and Kebich will attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the war memorial in the city centre. The U.S. President will address young scientists with a 15-minute speech at the republican Academy of Sciences. At Minsk airport Clinton will meet with U.S. diplomats working in Belarus and then leave for Geneva. In the evening, Shushkevich will hold a news conference. Clinton will not be present. It has been known, however, that the American side plans to hold a news conference at the Hotel Planeta where foreign journalists will be staying.
