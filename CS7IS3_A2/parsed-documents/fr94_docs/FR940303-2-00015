FR940303-2-00015 FR940303-2-00012 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 021594H] Atlantic Bluefin Tuna; Peer Review of the Scientific Basis of Management of the Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: NOAA has requested that the National Research Council (NRC) undertake a technical review of the scientific basis of management of the fisheries for Atlantic bluefin tuna. This notice solicits comments pertaining to the review to be forwarded to the NRC. DATES: Comments must be received by NMFS on or before March 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be directed to: Dr. Kevin Chu, Executive Secretary, ICCAT Advisory Committee, room 14247, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin Chu (301)713&hyph;2276. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: At the 1993 Annual Meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the United States announced that it would undertake a peer review of the scientific basis of management of the fisheries for Atlantic bluefin tuna. To ensure that the review is independent and unbiased, NOAA has asked the NRC to undertake a technical review of this subject. In order to prepare for the 1994 Annual Meeting of ICCAT, the NRC has been asked to complete an approved report of its review by June 30, 1994. NOAA has given the NRC the following general questions for the review to address: •Are the current Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) assessments of the status of eastern and western Atlantic bluefin the most valid interpretation of the available data? •Is uncertainty in the assessments adequately expressed? •What is the status of the Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks, relative to the Convention's goal of managing tuna to achieve maximum sustainable yield? •Does the available information support treating bluefin tuna as separate eastern and western management units (i.e., how much mixing is likely and is it enough to invalidate two separate management units)? NOAA has stated that the list of questions should be considered preliminary. It has requested that the NRC provide an opportunity to receive the views of the public and that the list of issues addressed be refined and, if necessary, expanded based on that input. By this notice, NMFS is soliciting comments on any matters that pertain to the peer review. All comments received by the closing date will be forwarded to the NRC for its consideration. Dated: February 24, 1994. Rolland A. Schmitten, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service.
