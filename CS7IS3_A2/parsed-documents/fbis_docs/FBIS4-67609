Statistics available say the adults have got infected with the AIDS virus mainly through unprotected heterosexual contacts (49.7 percent), while homosexual contacts caused only 7 percent of the cases. While drugs-use cases have not been singled out, for about 30 percent of the cases the infecting pattern has not been explained. The majority of the afflicted children have got infected in hospitals and orphanages (32 percent) especially through blood transfusions (24.7 percent). The largest number of AIDS cases (373) are registered in Bucharest, followed by the counties of Constanta (with a rate close to the Bucharest one), then Giurgiu, Galati, Bacau. Several counties such as Cluj, Alba, Salaj, Maramures have each registered only one case. In spite of the last four years' education of the public and severe measures to bar the AIDS spreading, Romania still holds the first place in Europe with the number of AIDS cases at children, because of the negligence before 1989.
