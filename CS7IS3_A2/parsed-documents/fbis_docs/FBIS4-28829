Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda and other senior Keidanren executives made the request during a breakfast meeting with high-ranking officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), including Eijiro Hata, the trade minister. The fiscal 1994 national budget should be enacted at the earliest possible time, while tax reform and deregulation packages should be worked out by the end of this month, Toyoda was quoted as saying by the MITI official. Yutaka Kume, Keidanren's vice chairman, asked for the corporate tax burden be eased and a landholding tax to be abolished, to spur overall corporate activity in Japan. Kume, chairman of Nissan Motor Co., also proposed the government support research activity at universities and national institutes as part of efforts to upgrade Japan's industrial infrastructure, the MITI official said. Hata replied that the ministry will respond to these requests "positively," the official said. On the worsening of employment prospects for college graduates, Toyoda said Keidenren will urge business corporations to step up new recruitment, especially of female graduates, who are finding it extremely difficult to get jobs.
