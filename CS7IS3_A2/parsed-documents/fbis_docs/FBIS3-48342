Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a challenge to the desire of the fellow countrymen for detente and peace and a deliberate move to lay one more stumbling-block in the way of the DPRK-USA talks. The analyst says: The suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint manoeuvres is aimed at removing nuclear threat, not at changing the codename. If a joint nuclear military drill larger than the "Team Spirit" is staged, the suspension of the "Team Spirit" is meaningless. The puppets' scheme to stage nuclear war exercises against the North together with foreign forces under changed codename is a mockery of the world opinion. Not only the "Team Spirit" but all other nuclear war exercises against the North must be discontinued in South Korea. Otherwise, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can not be solved any time nor can detente and peace be achieved. The North is prepared for both dialogue and war. The South Korean puppets will be held wholly responsible for the irrevocable consequences arising from their wildcat war exercises and aggravation of tensions.
