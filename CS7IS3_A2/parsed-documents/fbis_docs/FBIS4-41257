O.M.: Yes, I will. The main thing is that such business should not be criminal. Vybir: What are the ways to overcome the Crimean crisis? O.M.: The only way is for the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments to observe the Constitution of Ukraine. My visit to the peninsula is intended to reach this goal. It was a mistake on the part of our ruling bodies to neglect situation in the Crimea. I want to explain to the Crimean parliamentarians the position of our parliament and my personal position to this effect. Vybir: Will left-wingers win the June 26 elections? Given this, will Ukraine change its foreign policy? O.M.: Left-wing views start to dominate in our society. People understand that their prosperity depends on common efforts. This means that the broad public will mainly back up the left-wing candidates to the Soviets and the president's post. Ukraine's foreign policy will also be somewhat changed. Left-wing orientation is going strong all over the world. This process brings our civilization to optimal alignment of political forces. I believe that sharp political turns (whether to the right or left) should not physically or morally affect men in the street. Still, the foreign policy concept was fixed by the parliament and will not undergo cardinal changes. Everything depends on situation in the countries with which we will cooperate. Vybir: What about the possibility of Ukraine's entering into NATO? O.M.: Look, NATO is not the world community. Ukraine has always been and wants to remain an active member of such community. I do not want Ukraine to enter military blocs, I want it to be respected by the world community. Ukraine is the only country that declared its nuclear-free status and liquidates its nuclear arms. Unfortunately, other countries do not follow our example. Ukraine could initiate creation of the international club of the countries that wish to liquidate their nuclear weapons. Vybir: What will be the Ukrainian-Russian relations? O.M.: Russia is a great neighboring state having historically strong ties with Ukraine. People should adequately understand our history. Vybir: Who is your strongest rival in presidential elections? O.M.: All of them are strong enough. If they were weak, it would not be of great interest to me to run for presidency. Vybir: What about your chances to be elected? O.M.: They are rather high. Vybir: What is the difference between you and other nominees? O.M.: Unlike me, almost all of them occupied high official posts. I am not responsible for the consequences of the so-called economic reforms. Frankly speaking, among other candidates only I know well the problems of people. I do not accuse my rivals since they were "separated" from such problems. Vybir: Why do so many people negatively assess the actions of President Kravchuk? O.M.: This is because of the consequences of the policy conducted by the highest authorities while the president represents such authorities. This was proved by the results of parliamentary elections. Vybir: Many people think that the Crimean crisis occurred as a result of sending some additional Ukrainian troops to the peninsula... O.M.: Last Saturday I met with Interior and Defense Ministers. I proposed not to send additional troops and national guard to the Crimea. We must not use force but economic and political arguments. Vybir: Will the president's powers be limited? O.M.: This will be hard to do since such changes limitations must be fixed by the Constitution. If I am elected the president, I will enhance economic powers of the Cabinet. As I see it, today the president has too many functions which he is unable to perform in full scope. Still the president decides all personnel questions relating to the government. So, delegation of economic functions to the government helps the president fulfill his duties more efficiently. My cabinet will never hinder the process of reforms that are really useful for Ukraine. Vybir: What are the ways to divide the Black Sea Fleet? O.M.: As far as military interests are concerned, Ukraine gains nothing from the Fleet division. I often proposed to lease the Fleet either to Russia or the CIS. I am afraid that Russia may refuse to take lease of the Fleet or buy out a part of it. Given this, Ukraine will never be able to finance this huge Fleet. All this is relevant to economic restructuring. For instance, Ukrainian metal is sold all over the world which testifies to our mighty industrial potential. But on the other hand, it proves that we are bad businessmen because not a single country sells its rolled stock. The Ukrainian ship-building industry is one of the world biggest, it accounts for 80 percent of the USSR capacity in this field. Today it mainly works for export. Why don't we also use it to build our own merchant fleet or men-of-war? Vybir: Thank you.
