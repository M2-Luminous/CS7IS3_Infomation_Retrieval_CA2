In his opinion, the only way to save the peace process is to initiate talks immediately on the fate of the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and to begin evacuating them. "The settlers," Halevi feels, "have got it into their head to prevent the application" of the interim autonomy agreements and the "Israeli Government has so far not had the courage to prove them wrong." That is what must now change. [Vernet] According to the Israelis, the Hebron massacre was an "isolated act," and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even called the person responsible for it a "psychopath." The PLO, however, sees in it a plot involving some 30 settlers. Why? [Halevi] Since yesterday morning, Palestinian witnesses have reported that there were "several gunmen." In addition, it is difficult to believe that a lone gunman, even with a machine gun, could have left so many victims. That is the first point. The second suspicious aspect is the speed and insistence with which the Israelis -- from the head of government to the ambassadors, like the one here in Paris -- tried to push through the version that this was the act of a lone madman. And they did this before the inquiry had even gotten under way there! [Vernet] Who could be implicated in this attack? Do the settlers have links with the Israeli Army? [Halevi] I believe that there are elements within the Israeli Army which are seeking to add fuel to the flames. The country's press has already mentioned it. There are officers capable of doing this kind of thing in an effort to derail the peace process. [Vernet] Do you feel that the responsibility for the massacre lies at this level? [Halevi] No, it is the Israeli Government itself which is clearly responsible. Since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principle in Washington, the Rabin government has made no clear statements about the settlers. Even worse, it has let the settlers believe that they have the power to block the peace process. They demonstrated this bloodily yesterday. [Vernet] Did they succeed? Is the Oslo process definitively grounded? [Halevi] Everything depends on the reaction and attitude of the Israeli Government. The ball is in its court, not in the settlers'. Rabin cannot be content with making condemnations, there must be suppression, arrests, imprisonments, and sentences so that light can be shed on any collusion wherever it may be found. And of course the settlers must be disarmed. Otherwise, the entire peace process will be discredited once and for all. [Vernet] Exactly, so should we not once again question the feasibility of the Oslo agreement? [Halevi] The great weakness in this agreement is primarily the fact that the way was left clear for the Israelis to postpone "sine die" the talks on the future of the settlements and the status of the settlers. This is what they have been seeking since the beginning: Gaining time on the ground and not tackling the matter before the final phase of the negotiations, which will be lay down the definitive status of the occupied territories, because the Rabin government fears nothing more than a wide-ranging public debate by Israeli society on these settlements. It had been noticed well before yesterday's massacre that it is the presence of the settlers that is the main obstacle to the application of the Oslo agreement. [Vernet] Why this hesitancy? [Halevi] For so many years, their leaders have hammered home to the Israelis that by settling in the occupied territories they were merely exercising their "sacred right." For Likud and the religious groups, it was the sacred right to the land. For the Labor Party and the pragmatists, it was the Israeli people's right to security and self-defense. That is how they justified the supposedly irreversible fait accompli of the settlements. Today, the government has to explain to the Israelis that it always lied to them and that they have no divine right to occupy the land of others. [Vernet] In concrete terms, do the Palestinian negotiators have the resources to force their Israeli counterparts to discuss the fate of the Jewish settlements? [Halevi] Yes, because according to the terms of the Oslo agreement, i.e., the declaration of principle signed on 13 September at the White House, the negotiations on the definitive status must begin "as soon as possible" -- and in any case no later than two years after the implementation of the interim autonomy agreement. So, the soonest possible is today. We must begin these talks and begin evacuating the settlements before this problem blows up in our faces once and for all. [Vernet] Is that the substance of the appeal made by 'Arafat to the United Nations? [Halevi] The immediate objective of taking recourse to the United Nations is to have emergency measures taken to protect the Palestinians not only from the settlers, but also from the Israeli Army. The Europeans must assume their responsibility within the Security Council -- and the Americans must not use their veto -- in order to define the ways and means for international intervention in the occupied territories. [Vernet] So far, the Security Council, although it has recently passed resolutions condemning Israel, has never passed any sanctions against it. It has never imposed any decisions on the Jewish state which Israel feels are unacceptable...as the deployment of an peace-keeping force might be? [Halevi] This odious massacre could give the international community the chance to tell the Israeli leadership clearly and firmly: Do not indulge the settlers or be weak with them, and make a commitment to evacuating the occupied territories. In short, the Security Council must prevent the Israelis from sabotaging that which they themselves have committed themselves to doing. As early as last 13 December, Israel showed the world that it does not keep its word, by flouting the schedule provided for in the Oslo agreement (which made provisions for the beginning of Israeli's military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 December.) [Vernet] Two years ago, U.S. President George Bush refused to grant credit guarantees to the Jewish state, precisely because the Shamir (then in power in Jerusalem) government's continuation of the settlement process threatened the peace process. Will Bill Clinton prove to be just as firm? [Halevi] That is hard to say, especially since the Clinton administration has granted credits to Shamir's successor, Rabin. Yet, Rabin has only met half of the American demands which were based on -- it must not be forgotten -- international law. Indeed, the celebrated "freeze" decided by the Labor Party only regards one part of the settlements, since settlements are continuing in so-called security zones, and especially in "greater Jerusalem." Nevertheless, we must hope that the Clinton administration will prove to be firm toward its protege.
