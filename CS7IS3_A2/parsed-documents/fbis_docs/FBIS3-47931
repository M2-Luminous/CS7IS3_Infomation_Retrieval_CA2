Following Tuesday's unveiling of the action program to overhaul Japan's public works bidding system, the United States announced Wednesday it had removed trade sanctions set to go into effect Thursday. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also lauded Washington's move, saying in a statement that he is convinced that the settlement of the issue will contribute to progress in ongoing bilateral framework trade talks.
