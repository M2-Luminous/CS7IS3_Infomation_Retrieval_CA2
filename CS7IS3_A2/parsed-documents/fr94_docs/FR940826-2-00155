FR940826-2-00155 FR940826-2-00080 The Applicants assert that the purpose of this structure is to: (1) localize management of domestic and foreign office staffs; (2) operate domestic and foreign business activities efficiently; (3) limit liability (domestic and foreign); (4) minimize taxes, both domestic and foreign; and (5) increase flexibility to respond to foreign business opportunities. CSWI will engage exclusively in Permitted Activities by serving as a holding company for CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and Project Parents. CSWdM anticipates engaging in Permitted Activities primarily in Mexico. However, CSWdM may also engage in Permitted Activities in other foreign countries through joint ventures with third parties (``Joint Ventures''). The nature of the independent power market in Mexico is such that CSWdM's nonaffiliate Mexican entity partner(s) in a Joint Venture may seek to have such Joint Venture engage in Permitted Activities in a foreign country other than Mexico. It is, therefore, desirable that CSWdM, in order to attract Joint Venture partners, have the authority, directly or indirectly, to engage in Permitted Activities in foreign countries other than Mexico. CSWdM Servicios will provide services to CSWdM and Project Parents that shall conduct Permitted Activities outside of the United States. Such services shall include management, administrative, employment, tax, accounting, engineering, consulting, utility performance and electronic data processing services and software development and support services in connection therewith. CSWdM Servicios will provide localized management of Mexican employees, increased efficiency from a consolidated foreign office staff and a vehicle to insulate CSW and its affiliates from tax, labor and other liabilities that may apply under Mexican law. CSWdM Servicios will not provide services to any subsidiary company or affiliate of CSW other than CSWdM, CSWI, their subsidiary companies or Project Parents that shall conduct Permitted Activities outside the United States, without prior Commission approval. Project Parents will engage in E/F Activities and be special purpose domestic corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies or foreign corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies (or the equivalent thereof), and will include Joint Venture(s) engaged in E/F Activities. CSW's experience, in connection with its foreign project development activities to date, including the preparation and submission of bids in connection with foreign government energy privatization programs, is that the organization, formation or acquisition of one or more Project Parents is necessary or desirable to facilitate E/F Activities. A holding structure of one or more Project Parents may be necessary to minimize foreign and domestic tax liabilities (e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable tax treaties among foreign countries). Project Parents may be necessary or desirable for bidding on FUCOs or EWGs through Joint Ventures, since each member of the Joint Venture will typically want to have at least one consolidated subsidiary in the final FUCO or EWG ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Project Parents would insulate CSW, CSWI and CSWdM from certain business, tax and labor risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among or by the members of such Joint Venture. A Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests in both FUCOs and EWGs. Any such indirect investment by CSW in any Project Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof and after giving effect thereto, CSW's ``aggregate investment,'' determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of CSW's ``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule 53(a)(1)(ii). Investments by CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, directly or indirectly, in any Project Parent may take the form of any combination of acquisition of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable. Any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value. Any investment in any particular Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection with making the underlying investment in any FUCO and/or EWG with respect to which such Project Parent was organized, taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs and cash reserves required to be maintained in accordance with any financing document. Within 45 days after CSW, CSWI or CSWdM determines that the purpose for owning any Project Parent no longer exists, it shall liquidate, dissolve or sell such Project Parent, unless, within that time-period, CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, as the case may be, determines that such Project Parent may be used in connection with a proposal or plan to develop or acquire an interest in a different FUCO or EWG. The Applicants request authority to liquidate, dissolve or sell any Project Parent under such circumstances. CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios propose to enter into agreements with CSW Services and Energy concerning services to be provided in connection with the Permitted Activities. CSW Services and Energy will initially provide services necessary or desirable for the operation of CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios. CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios will not provide services to any subsidiary of CSW other than Energy, themselves and their subsidiary companies.
