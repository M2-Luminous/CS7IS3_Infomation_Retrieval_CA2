C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- Shih Ming-the, the newly elected chairman of the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said Monday [2 May] that if he is elected president of the Republic of China [ROC], he will not abruptly announce Taiwan's independence. Shih pledged that he would not make Taiwan independent by means of revolution or violence. "Whatever the DPP does will be in compliance with the will of Taiwanese people," he said. The new DPP chairman said he was confident that he would win a popular vote for ROC president. Previously, the president was selected by the National Assembly. But a special session of the assembly that opened Monday to consider constitutional reforms is expected to mandate the popular election of president. Shih, 53, was elected the DPP's sixth chairman during the party congress Sunday. Shih beat Ms. Yu Chen Yueh-ying by a vote of 206 to 145. His tenure will be two and a half years. Shih had served 25 years in Taiwan prisons. He was jailed for 10 years for participating in an anti-government riot in the southern city of Kaohsiung in 1979, and was also jailed from 1962 through 1977 for his attempts at organizing the overthrow of the government. He has been a devoted advocate of Taiwan independence, a goal in direct opposition to the ruling Kuomintang's policy, which seeks Taiwan's eventual reunification with Mainland China. The DPP was founded in 1986 in defiance of a decades-old ban on the establishment of new political parties. The ban was lifted in 1987 as part of ongoing democratic reforms.
