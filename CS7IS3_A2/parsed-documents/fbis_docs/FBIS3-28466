The information says the recent bayonet and teargas suppression proves that the Kim Yong-sam group is a pack of rare traitors, fascist gangsters and foolhardy blackguards. It goes on: What must not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam issued a repressive order, branding the righteous struggle of South Korean people as "violence", and that even Kim Chong-pil, a remnant of the "Yusin" system, arbitrarily insulted the resistance of peasants, saying "to totally deny the Uruguay Round in the era of internationalization means that they are ignorant of what is going around the world." As for Kim Yong-sam and Kim Chong-pil, they are the very ones who directly sold off the South Korean rice market to the United States. They are despicable criminals who committed a never-to-be-condoned arch crime against the nation. Repression can by no means be almighty, the information says, stressing: The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must immediately stop playing such foolish tricks as trying to prolong at the point of the bayonet the remaining days of the "civilian regime" now in the grip of a crisis and step down without delay.
