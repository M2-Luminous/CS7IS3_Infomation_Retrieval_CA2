Sandro Roazzi reports: [Roazzi] Bruno Trentin has come out against Silvio Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini, and Umberto Bossi. He said that they are the leaders of a dangerous right that threatens workers and the development of the country. [Begin Trentin recording] No one, not even Ronald Reagan, has planned such an attack on the rights of the individual and the trades unions--an attack on the constitutional rights obtained by the Italian workers over the past 30 years. [end recording] [Roazzi] This is why the CGIL will discuss its numerous proposals on job-related matters and development only with individuals from those groups led by Mario Segni and Fausto Bertinotti. He said that Berlusconi's proposals on taxes and the social services were only empty slogans, which would either lead to an increase in the rate of inflation or to new social injustice. The CGIL is asking that workers' salaries, companies, and homes have some protection from the tax office. Nevertheless, all forms of wealth should be taxed, including shares in the newly privatized state industries. However, such taxes should be very low and should exclude the small investor.
