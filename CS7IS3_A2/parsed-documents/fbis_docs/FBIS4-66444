In November 1993, JICA dispatched its first survey group to China. The group, in cooperation with the PRC's National Science and Technology Committee and municipal environmental protection bureaus, plans to draft by October 1994 a general anti-air-pollution program (to run through fiscal year 2005) that will monitor and control acid-rain concentrations in the areas. Recently, environmental cooperation between Japan and PRC was accelerated with the December 1993 conclusion of the Sino-Japanese environmental cooperation pact while Chairman Jieng Song of the National Science and Technology Committee, PRC, was visiting Japan. Liuchow City was chosen as the main monitoring site because of the concentration of iron works and heat-and-electric power plants in the city. The city's industrial production ranks the fourth in the self-governing district and the 18th among the 190 industrial cities in the entire nation. According to Seiji Kaiho, chief of the Second Social Development Survey Section of JICA, Liuchow's industrial activities at times ``have a considerable effect on the environment for residents in Hong Kong and the Ju River delta.'' The broad-area acid-rain-monitoring survey will be carried out by installing three or four precision measurement instruments at each of a total of 16 sites: five sites in Liuchow, five in Gueilin (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District), two in Wuchow (Kwansi Chuan Self-Governing District), and four in Kwanchow (Kwanton Province). In the PRC, acid rain is defined as having a pH of less than 5.6. In 1991, rain pH of 4.29 was recorded in Liuchow, where the acid- rain rate was as high as 98 percent. These values were about the same as or higher than the other cities in the area; i.e., Gueilin (4.78 and 64 percent), Wuchow (3.98-4.5 and 87 percent), and Kwanchow (4.1 and 72 percent). Thus, the broad-area monitoring was deemed necessary. The investigation concerning air pollution will target three points: (1) types of pollutants; (2) meteorological data collection; (3) measurement of emission components at factories, i.e., emission sources. There will be 10 monitoring locations designated within Liuchow City.
