Interfax was told at the Russian Foreign Ministry that the terrorists failed to put the radar equipment out of action since the staff immediately switched over to another power line. As is known, there was talk at the Russian-Latvian negotiations of renting the Skrunda radar station for four years. However, certain political forces in Latvia are in favor of closing it down by the time Russian troops are withdrawn from the country this summer.
