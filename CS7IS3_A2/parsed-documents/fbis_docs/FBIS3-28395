[passage omitted] The Thao Nguyen Regiment has served as a model training unit for Group B-24 and the Fourth Military Region. Last year, the regiment completed its training program in a satisfactory manner. Those participating in skills contests in land transportation, artillery, engineering, communications, and air defense all won first or second prizes from the Fourth Military Region and the Ministry of National Defense. Despite difficulties with budget allocations, lack of seeds, and bad weather conditions, the cadres and soldiers of the Thao Nguyen Regiment and other units under Group B-24 actively participated in production to improve their living conditions. The quality of their daily meals has improved considerably. Tens of hectares of land have been turned into ponds to raise fish. Each cadre or soldier has turned out 11 kg of vegetables per month. Cultivation and animal husbandry have generated additional income. As a result, meals have been supplemented by 250 to 300 dong each. Group B-24's personnel usually have three dishes at each meal. This has put an end to the bad practice of making one's own cooking arrangements and other negative habits. As many as 97 to 98 percent of the troops stay healthy and participate in learning and training activities. The work performance of 10 of the Thao Nguyen Regiment's 12 troop feeding units has been rated as good. As an example, one can cite the troop feeding units of the 4th and 5th Battalions and the regimental command. Also on this occasion, Gen. Doan Khue called on a number of mothers of fallen combatants who live near the group's bivouacking area. He visited Mrs. Duong Thi Nga and her family. Two of Mrs. Nga's sons have been listed as fallen combatants. Besides the care provided by the local party committee and administration, Mrs. Nga and other mothers of fallen combatants here are also assisted by the cadres and soldiers of Group B-24. Gen. Doan Khue also visited Mrs. Nguyen Thi Vung and her family. Mrs. Vung's three sons and one son-in-law have been listed as fallen combatants. Mother Vung is 90 years old. During the course of the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle, Mother Vung actively motivated her children to set out and fight the enemy. Now, as in the past, the mothers of fallen combatants always motivate the soldiers to undergo training and stand ready for combat.
