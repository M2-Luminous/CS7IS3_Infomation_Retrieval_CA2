Spokesman Wu Jianmin made the remarks at a weekly news briefing here this afternoon when asked to comment on the report that on may 18, Wu Hongda and U.S. Congressman Smith asserted that China is continuing to export prison labor products (PLPs) to the U.S. "This is sheer fabrication," Wu said. With regard to export of PLPs, China and the U.S. have signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prohibiting import and export trade in PLPs. China has acted in strict compliance with the MOU, he said. Not long ago, China and the U.S. also signed a statement on cooperation for the implementation of the MOU, Wu said. Both Chinese and U.S. sides share the view that the two documents are being implemented smoothly, he noted. "It is out of ulterior motives for a handful of people to spread lies and make vicious slanders on this issue," the spokesman said.
