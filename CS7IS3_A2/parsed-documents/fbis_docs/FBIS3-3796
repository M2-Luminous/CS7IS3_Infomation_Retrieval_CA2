I wanted to come and visit Shanghai for a long time. Today I have realized my wish. I am very happy indeed. While giving his impressions of the visit to Pudong, Hosokawa pointed out: I am moved that Pudong has managed to develop to the present scale within a very short period. Hosokawa showed great interest in the development of Pudong New Area. He said: Pudong should step up efforts to publicize itself in order to attract more Japanese entrepreneurs, especially those of medium and small enterprises, to come and invest here. He also hoped that Pudong New Area would provide facilities for schooling and housing for children of Japanese investors. Speaking on efforts to strengthen economic cooperation between Japan and China, Premier Hosokawa pointed out: Strengthening economic cooperation between Japan and China is conducive to the economic development in the world. Economic cooperation between Japan and China can further push forward the world's economic development. Japan will continue to make efforts toward this end.
