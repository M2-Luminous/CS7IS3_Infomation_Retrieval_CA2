It is not merely a matter of the weather or the migration of refugees who are creating bottlenecks and traffic-jams in all modes of transportation. It is a matter of crime, which--according to the data provided by the authoritative organs in this field--should increase significantly during the summer. And whereas the summertime growth of "adult" crime will--as anticipated--be the usual one, as in previous years, the situation with regard to crime among juveniles--according to the forecasts--must be considered disturbing and inauspicious. In the first place, the children will be on vacation.... Whereas previously the virtually en masse "Pioneerization" of children provided the police with a calm and tranquil life, this cannot be counted on nowadays. Camps are being closed down everywhere; in Moscow alone such an unenviable lot has befallen hundreds of children's institutions. They lack sufficient funds. Admissions tickets to those camps that are still afloat will cost R400,000-R600,000. It is a rare parent that will be able to scrape up such a sum. Of course, the governments of Moscow and other Russian cities have allocated subsidies. And--judging by all appearances--50 percent of the cost of an admissions ticket will be paid by means of social insurance. Moreover, as we were informed in the Russian Ministry of Education, approximately R500 million have already been allotted from the federal budget for summer vacations. Allocation of an equal such sum was discussed yesterday at a session of the government. But the forecasts of the criminologists are, nevertheless, quite disturbing inasmuch as even the funds that have been allocated are patently insufficient. In the opinion of the specialists, the principal trends in juvenile crime manifest themselves more clearly during the summer. Whereas the increase in crime as a whole during the last five years has amounted to 50 percent, and--moreover--one out of every six crimes committed by juveniles is serious (robbery, theft, larceny), during the summer the increase in crime will amount to approximately 60 percent over last year's figure. In the main, these will be extremely diverse types of larceny--ranging from the activities of pickpockets to those of shoplifters. There will be more street-type hooliganism and squabbles between gangs. Statistics show that last year the number of crimes committed by juveniles while in a state of intoxication increased by approximately 70 percent. Moreover, it has been officially acknowledged that throughout the country as a whole there are about 100,000 underage drunkards, and that--generally speaking--one youth in three who has reached the age of 14 drinks on a regular basis. St. Petersburg and Moscow will be affected worst of all by the above-mentioned problem. Crowds of migrating homeless children will rush to these cities in order to live from hand to mouth. Some 20,000 "drifters" will be added to the 60,000 St. Petersburg gamins and the 40,000 already in Moscow. Rough computations show that in the winter the number of Russia's homeless varies from 150,000 to 180,000; but in the summer, because of seasonal homelessness, there will be approximately 250,000-300,000 of them. And the Law on Education merely adds to the trouble. Through its inadvertence--according to data provided by Deputy Prime Minister Yu. Yarov--there will be about half a million juveniles on the streets; these are kids who have been expelled from the system of secondary education. Because nowadays each school is free to accept or reject anyone at its own discretion. And this is not in conflict with the Constitution inasmuch as the latter has guaranteed only a mandatory incomplete secondary education. Taking into consideration the complex difficulties of job placement and the reduction in the number of vocational-technical schools, most of these 600,000 juveniles will simply waste their time in idleness, or else terrorize the neighborhoods and surrounding areas.
