Athens News Agency reported today from Washington that after meeting U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes and U.S. Presidential Adviser George Stephanopoulos, the prime minister said he is optimistic about the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Papandreou stressed that many opposing forces operate in politics and no one can predict developments with certainty. Papandreou added that in the United States he found a very warm welcome and support for Greece and noted that for the first time it was recognized that Greece has rights that are being violated. Discussing Greek-Turkish relations, the prime minister said that Washington is under the impression that the possibilities for positive Greek-Turkish relations are greater than we think. In light of Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with international mediator Cyrus Vance in New York, U.S. Presidential envoy to Skopje Matthew Nimetz met Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis at the Greek Embassy. The official part of Papandreou's visit to Washington concluded last night with a reception hosted by the Greek ambassador at the Embassy. The prime minister and his delegation will leave for New York today.
