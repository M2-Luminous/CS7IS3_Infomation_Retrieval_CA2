The British magazine THE ECONOMIST a few days ago published a report that was reprinted by a Quito newspaper about the possibility of a coup d'etat in the next two years. The report stated that the Ecuadoran president plays merely a symbolic role. Vice President Dahik said that democracy has the support of the Armed Forces. He added that these types of reports originate in the country to discredit Ecuador's leaders abroad. Marcelo Santos said that, God willing, President Sixto Duran-Ballen will complete his term. As government minister, he said, I can assure the country that there is no evidence to make us suspect that the country will experience such a situation in the near or distant future. Industry Minister Maldonado said that the British magazine's analysis is not objective because it does not take into account the government's great willingness to strengthen the democratic system or the people's struggle to maintain democracy. THE ECONOMIST said that Ecuador is one of the countries with the greatest risk to investments because it has had weak governments that have not fulfilled their programs.
