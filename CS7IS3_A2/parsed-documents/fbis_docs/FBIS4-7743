Our tabulation examines the present situation in the individual industries within the food industry group and establishes what has been privatized to date and what has yet to be privatized. The AVU regards the food industry group as one of the success stories of privatization. Most of the group's 162 state or municipal enterprises have been transformed into corporations. Only 56 of them were sold by the end of 1993, but they accounted for 46 percent of the 162 firms' combined registered capital. It is practically impossible to judge whether the experts of the AVU handled a specific sale well or badly. After all, there is no basis of comparison: A developed market that could determine the real value of a firm is lacking. Thus the AVU is able to go about its business practically without any risk, and only rarely is it forced to admit that it goofed. According to the data provided by the AVU, the net worth of the food industry corporations can be estimated at 157 billion forints. Of this amount, 72.2 billion forints worth of assets were sold by the end of 1993. Except in a few insignificant minor cases, there has been no suspicion of any corruption. This is the more commendable because AVU employees are exposed to exceptional temptation: Each chief counselor-deputy director prepares the privatization of assets worth billions. Several basic principles for privatization within the food industry group had been laid down as guidelines back in 1991, but the indications are that the AVU is not paying much attention to them. Basically the decisive factor is money, although officials at the AVU are able to cite numerous examples of rejecting the highest bid. Some experts are of the opinion that, in most cases when it was truly "interested," foreign capital managed in the end to get what it wanted. It may be said to be a general practice at the AVU to offer 25 percent of the equity, plus one vote, to a specifically targeted large-scale agricultural producer, when a large firm is being privatized. But experience indicates that raw material producers are not really interested in acquiring such a small stake. Others are of the opinion that it would hardly be possible to devise something better than the AVU's extremely pragmatic approach. Admittedly, it does seem expedient in principle to give control of individual food-processing firms to groups of domestic capitalists who would be able to gain significant markets for both the underlying agricultural activity and trade. However, the managements of the undercapitalized and debt-ridden agricultural cooperatives and food industry firms respectively would be ill-suited for this role. Most agricultural cooperatives are glad merely to be able to survive; in the extremely unlikely case of being given a food industry firm free of charge, they would have no opportunity (money) to finance the firm's production. In these circumstances it is no wonder that--instead of complying with the laid-down principles--the AVU is selling everything for which effective demand exists. Understandably, foreign capital is seeking primarily safe businesses in the apparently risky Hungarian market. Thus foreign capital's attention has focused mainly on the tobacco and distilling industries, whose products are taxed; on the sugar industry, which consists of a few players and produces a foodstuff of strategic economic importance; and on the vegetable-oil industry, primarily because earlier only one firm had been established in Hungary for the processing of oil seeds, and it enjoys an absolute monopoly to this day. For instance, five international corporations--Philip Morris, Austria Tabakwerke, RJR Nabisco, BAT [British-American Tobacco] and Reemstra--now own the four tobacco factories in Hungary. The better-known distillery firms also have attracted foreign capital. (It will suffice to mention Peter Zwack's purchases.) The immensely keen Western interest in sugar factories is more difficult to explain. Indirectly, three large concerns share most of the market in the sugar industry: Sud Zucker-Agrana (21 percent); Tate Lyle-Amylum (18 percent); and Eridania Beghin Say (34 percent). First Hungarian Sugarmaking and Trading Consortium comprises 60 growers and holds the majority interest in five sugar factories, which enables it to claim 27-percent share of the market. Some people are assuming that this unexpected "craving for sugar" was triggered by alarm among the world sugar industry's multinationals over the Austrian Agrana's sudden appearance in Hungary, causing them to acquire small or substantial stakes in Hungarian corporations, merely to establish their presence in East Europe. The Hungarian sugar industry does not hold out much promise of big business opportunities, especially not if we consider that three or four of the 11 sugar factories in Hungary will have to be shut down in the near future because there is simply no demand for that much capacity. Besides the sugar-industry consortium, in the entire food industry group there were few other examples of the AVU selling all the shares in a firm exclusively to Hungarian investors. Precedents existed primarily in the meat industry. In addition to Zala County Meat Corporation, the Vas County Meat Industry Corporation, and the Papa Meat Corporation, however, the shares of the Dunakeszi Refrigeration Industry Corporation, the Hajdu County Grain Corporation, and Vardadrink Rt., a manufacturer of alcoholic beverages, are also 100-percent Hungarian-owned. It is not surprising that the meat industry has the most domestic players. Processing capacity is estimated to be three times greater than what is actually needed, and--sooner or later--a significant proportion of the processing plants that are being offered for sale will inevitably go bankrupt. Lately, with the decline of export opportunities to East Europe, the significance of the domestic market has increased perceptibly, and there was relatively greater interest in acquiring equity only in those firms that earlier had gained significant market shares, even though they too are not very sound economically. Thus the shares of Vas County Meat sold for 105 percent of par; those of the Papa integrated meat plant for 165 percent; and the initial public offering of Pick Szeged Rt. shares on the stock market was likewise successful. With the exception of a few larger meat-industry firms--Gyula Integrated Meat Plant Corporation and Debrecen Meat Corporation, for instance--not much foreign interest can be expected in the remaining ones when they are put up for sale. Perhaps there might be interest in the firms that are wholesale meat distributors. Like in the meat industry, the situation is difficult also in the dairy industry, because it too has considerable excess processing capacity. For the time being, foreign capital appears to be skimming the bargains, picking out the firms with the most promising markets and developed secure supplier bases. Parmalat, for instance, has established its headquarters in Szekesfehervar, by acquiring Fejer County Dairy Corporation. In the dairy industry, including also the successors of the former dairy industry enterprises, the AVU had earmarked 48 firms for privatization. It sold 21 of these firms by December 1993, and will put another 21 on the block in the first half of 1994. At present, 21 players share the dairy market. Up to the end of 1993, privatization brought 1.5 billion forints of additional capital into the industry. The monopoly of Budapesti Tejipari Vallalat (Budapest Dairy Industry Enterprise) has gradually weakened during the past two years, and today several provincial dairy firms also have significant shares of the capital's market. According to experts, really harsh measures have yet to come in the dairy industry. The trimming of surplus capacities will become inevitable in 1994. That will be accompanied by a substantial rise in unemployment in some regions. The situation is ambiguous also in conjunction with privatization in the grain industry. Originally the grain industry comprised 20 county grain-trading and flour-milling enterprise (GMV's), and a number of firms servicing them. The GMV's operated 117 flour mills, 67 feed-mixing plants, and 181 separate granaries. In March 1993, the AVU board of directors approved a detailed plan for the grain industry's privatization. On its basis, 71 flour mills, 36 feed-mixing plants, and 154 separate granaries were earmarked for decentralized privatization. According to a summary report prepared in mid-January, 48 flour mills but only 14 feed-mixing plants and 29 separate granaries have been privatized so far. The AVU attributes the conspicuously meager interest in the feed-mixing plants and granaries to the drought and the livestock population's decline. By the end of last year, 15 of the 20 GMV's had been transformed into corporations, and the one in Veszprem County is in liquidation and is expected to be wound up by June 1994. However, only two of the transformed GMV's have been sold so far. The shares of Hajdu County Grain Corporation were bought by its MRP [Employee Stock Ownership Program] organization; and the state's stake in Hungarograin Rt., into which the Komarom County GMV had been transformed, was bought by a consortium comprising the MRP organization and a Hungarian company. In the opinion of the AVU, future foreign interest can be expected only in Cerbona Rt. It is hoped that domestic investors will buy the remaining firms, if there is effective demand for them. In the near future the AVU intends to make initial public offerings of the shares of three companies: Alfold Grain Corporation, South Transdanubian Grain Industry Corporation, and Pannonian Grain Corporation. There seems to be hardly any foreign interest in the state baking industry, with the sole refreshing exception of Danube Bread Corporation. The AVU does not even know how many players there are in the market, because the number of private firms in the baking industry has increased dynamically since 1991. It is estimated that at present the private firms jointly have approximately a 60-percent share of the market and account for 55 percent of the industry's total capacity. At the commencement of privatization, incidentally, there were 37 enterprises in the baking industry, and 19 of them were assigned to the so-called program of self-privatization [enterprise-initiated privatization]. Mainly the firms with smaller capacities were assigned there, while the privatization of the 18 larger corporations is being handled by the AVU itself. So far the success of the AVU's efforts has been very modest: Only four firms had been privatized by the end of 1993. Of the nine refrigeration-industry corporations in which the state holds a majority interest, only six have been privatized. The investors include the multinationals Unilever and Shamrock; domestic entrepreneurs own the refrigeration plants in Gyor and Dunakeszi; while the refrigeration plant in Szekesfehervar has been purchased, for compensation bonds, jointly by individuals and legal entities. It is undeniable that the refrigeration-industry firms, which earlier had enjoyed a monopoly, have lately been forced to compete both on the domestic and the foreign markets. On the basis of the earlier invitations to tender, the AVU estimates that the refrigeration industry will attract nearly 1 billion forints of foreign direct investment in 1994. As a result of this among others, the AVU believes that export earnings this year could reach as high as $70 million, after last year's very modest export of $30 million. In professional circles opinions are divided about the pace of privatization within the food industry group, just as they are about the pace of privatization in general. Many people find it amazing that the AVU has at all been able to sell so many firms in financial straits. Others believe that the AVU is following the path of least resistance, selling off assets on the principle of "let us be glad we have a buyer," instead of privatizing individual industries on the basis of comprehensive conceptual plans. The future will determine who was right on this issue. In any case, practically every political party has already announced that, once it came to power, it would investigate the earlier practice of privatization within the food-industry group.
