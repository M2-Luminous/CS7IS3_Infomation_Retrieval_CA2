FBIS3-30797 "dreeu027_i_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Karadzic, `Experts' Comment on 5 Feb Massacre AU0802221794 AU0802221794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Belgrade Television RTB Network in Serbo-Croatian dedicates its 8 February edition of the "Aktuelnosti" current affairs program, broadcast at 1938 GMT, to the explosion that killed 68 and injured 200 people at a Sarajevo market on 5 February. The anchor man in the Belgrade Television studio is Milorad Komrakov. He is joined by the following guests: Captain 1st Class Dusan Jelusic, Yugoslav Army expert on mortar ammunition; Lieutenant Zoran Stankovic, Yugoslav Army pathology expert; military commentator Petar Knezevic; and machine engineer Colonel Milan Rundic, explosives expert. Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, and General Major Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the General Staff of the Army of the republic of Srpska, join in the program live from the Pale television studio. At the beginning the program replays the footage of the Sarajevo massacre, which is followed by reportage rounding up all major massacres that have taken place in Sarajevo from the beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Komrakov then asks Radovan Karadzic to explain the contents of his letter to U.S. President Clinton and Russian President Yeltsin in which he claims that "a great and feeble deception took place at the Sarajevo market" as well as the findings on which he bases his conclusions. Karadzic replies: "We base such conclusions on the findings that we are mostly receiving from the Croatian side in Sarajevo, on the analyses of our experts, on simple examination of the footage taken by the Muslim side, and on statements given by the Muslim listeners to Radio Hayatt, which are recorded and undisputable. Namely, if one looks carefully at the footage, one sees clearly that there are very few goods on the market and that very few market stalls have goods. One must try to imagine that in such a small place at least 300 people were caught in this explosion, and it must be assumed that there might have been another 300 who were not effected. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to imagine and justify the presence of some 300 to 600 people in such a poor market. Furthermore, we have some reports from the Muslim side, which I hope we will be able to hear tonight, that no noise characteristic of a mortar bomb was heard, and the Muslim witnesses have also said so. There have been some reports that there were not many people there at all. We have reports, and this can also be concluded from this television footage, that the bodies of people who had died much earlier were also used. Now we can see on the film something that resembles a stuffed mannequin, plastic or made of fabric. There are also indications of plastic mannequins. "In short, an enormous deception has taken place. Something tragic happened at that market, that is for sure. However, whether so many people died, whether the bomb arrived from elsewhere, or whether an explosive device exploded on the site, all this gives rise to great suspicion. Furthermore, it can be clearly concluded that this was stage-managed -- just look how much this resembles a mannequin -- and that these were concoctions that should shock the world, that is to say, turn the world against us." Karadzic also says that "the Muslim side has rejected any sort of joint investigation by a joint commission, that is to say, any sort of international investigation." "We demanded that Russia and the United States not to allow their policies to be ruled by such a fake," Karadzic says, "and we demanded an international expert examination of this and any other case." "The fate of the nation and the fate of peace in the region is at stake," he exclaims, "and not a single serious country in the world should allow itself to rely on the Muslim sources alone." The program then broadcasts a roundup report on ways in which foreign media have reported on the same event. Afterward Komrakov asks Karadzic to comment on the "warning to the Bosnian Serbs to remove the artillery positioned around Sarajevo or face the risk of NATO air strikes," and the statements by "U.S. and Russian representatives." Karadzic replies that "Russia has a balanced and correct attitude toward the crisis." "It is clear," he goes on, "that any sort of involvement in a civil war would really mean the proliferation of the war and would be completely unjustified. Anyone who would attack us would become our enemy and our attitude toward the enemy would, naturally, be defined on the basis of a natural right of any nation to defend itself. Unfortunately, in the United States many circles are completely uninformed. Sarajevo is not surrounded, it is a divided town. We have a part of Sarajevo that we will not give to anyone. We are willing to negotiate on how much of Sarajevo will be Serbian and how much Muslim. However, the idea of abandoning a town populated by 200,000 Serbs is out of the question. We can agree, within a peace plan and possibly under the UN administration of Sarajevo, to reduce and remove our artillery. However, how far do they think we should move artillery when artillery has various ranges? We will not move our artillery out of the borders of our republic." Speaking further about the attitude of the international community toward the Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic says: "We are absolutely sure that governments and their secret services know the truth. They have known it since the very beginning when they started destroying Yugoslavia." According to him, "they knew that a war would break out in Bosnia-Herzegovina and did not hurry with this war until the war in Croatia had ended." "They planned to finish with Bosnia by the end of May 1992, when it would have been Kosovo's turn, perhaps even that of Sandzak and Vojvodina. However, their scenario was thwarted, because the Serbs in Bosnia held out much longer than anticipated." "The governments that know the real truth," Karadzic continues, "the governments that make decisions, will opt for peace at a moment when the advantages of a war will disappear." He goes on to say that "one can already see that numerous European countries that used to favor war no longer favor it, that is, the war has started to cause damage to them. When this will also be the case with Germany and the United States, peace will come very quickly. Namely, it is clear that the Muslim leadership listens obediently to its patrons and masters." "The fact is," Karadzic remarks, "that the United States managed to compromise and upset Europe to the utmost with Bosnia-Herzegovina. I still do not see any readiness on their part to drop the possibility of arbitrating in the region and, perhaps, strengthening their presence in the region, on the assumption that Russia will recover some day and there will be a need to monitor it from close up." General Gvero is then asked to comment on the 5 February massacre. "We know our units and what orders they have," he says, "and they obey our orders. We are sure that, on that date, there were no activities, just as during a period prior to that, against the part of Sarajevo controlled by the Muslims." As he says, for this reason, the Serbian side proposed the formation of a "mixed, neutral commission" immediately after the explosion. "Speaking of the truth, we know the truth as well as all the people of good intentions. The truth is that a Serbian hand did not do this and this is a criminal fabrication of an event," Gvero assures. When Gvero was asked about the alleged evidence held by the Bosnian Serbs that "a foreign intelligence service was directly involved" in the planning of this massacre, as well as "a group of Muslims from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina active in the Islamic lobby in the United States," Gvero replies that the Serbian side has been monitoring very carefully everything that was happening "before and after this event." He confirms that they "hold certain information of various origins, which is in the process of being checked." Gvero reminds that a Turkish official at the beginning of January announced that "something that will make the world speechless" will happen in Sarajevo, which he finds indicative. However, as he says, "until we hold firmer, more definitive proof that can be verified, we would not like to make public statements." He says that this massacre must be "thoroughly investigated" to prevent similar such events happening in the future. At the end, Karadzic says that "the international community must soon change its attitude toward the warring sides. Their attitude must be perfectly balanced. They must lift the sanctions against the Serbs for the Muslims to realize that this game is over and sign the peace plan. If the international community really wants to proliferate and intensify the conflict, then it will believe the Muslim fabrication, or some country will order it." Komrakov here thanks Karadzic, who must leave the studio due to "pressing duties," for his participation in the program. After Karadzic leaves Studio Pale, the program returns to Studio Belgrade, where studio announcer Milorad Komrakov begins interviewing his guests. First, Komrakov turns to 1st Class Captain Dusan Jelusic, an expert on mortars in the Yugoslav Army, and asks him to give his expert opinion. Jelusic says that it is impossible for a mortar shell to disintegrate into so much shrapnel, yet not damage any of the market stalls. After Jelusic, Komrakov turns to explosives expert Milan Rundic, who proceeds to give vital statistics of a type of mine that could have been used, but says that even if the mine or shell had exploded under ideal conditions, it could not have caused as many casualties. He then proceeds to give a lot of scientific details and to explain the diagram he has drawn of how the shrapnel disperses after the initial detonation. Komrakov then introduces archive footage of site of massacre shot by an unidentified foreign television crew, which shows a man, allegedly a Bosnian official, who is taking measurements. When asked to explain what he is doing, he answers that he is investigating and cannot give any more details. Following this, Komrakov introduces an excerpt from a phone-in program of Radio Hayat. In the program, listeners phone in and urge citizens to take up arms and advocate the killing of all Serbs. Some also advocate killing all the Croats in addition to the Serbs. Only one listener says that it is not normal to call for such violence. Following this, Komrakov turns to military-political commentator Petar Knezevic, who says that the 5 February massacre was evidently a terrorist act. Asked to assess the seriousness of air strikes, Knezevic says that air strikes would not give the desired results and that in his opinion, the allies will not go ahead with their threats. Komrakov now turns to Dr. Zoran Stanojevic, army forensic pathologist, and asks him to assess the investigation carried out at the site. Stanojevic says that in order get real results, the investigators should not concentrate as much on the site of the explosion but rather on the bodies of the deceased. He maintains that no proper autopsies were performed and that the time of death was not established. Otherwise, claims Stanojevic, had proper autopsies been carried out, it would have been established that some of the bodies had been dead for some time before they were brought over to the market. He offers to take his team and go to Sarajevo to perform the autopsies in the presence of experts from all sides involved. After this, Komrakov thanks his guests and reads a TANJUG report that arrived in the editorial room some time earlier, which says that the shell that landed on Markale market was launched from Bosnian Army positions some 2 km away. With this, he thanks the viewers for watching the program and wishes them goodnight.
