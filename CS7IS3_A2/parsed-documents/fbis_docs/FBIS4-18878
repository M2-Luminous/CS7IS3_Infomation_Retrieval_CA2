This was agreed by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and his Ukrainian counterpart, Vitaliy Radetski in Bonn on Monday [11 April]. They signed a joint declaration to this effect: The Bundeswehr and the Ukrainian Army intend to cooperate intensively mainly on restructuring the armed forces, training of recruits, guiding personnel, and arms control. The declaration notes that the "successfully initiated cooperation at different levels" should continue. Ruehe started the security policy dialogue with Kiev during his visit last August. With his Ukrainian guest he discussed the design of the European security structure, the hot spots of the world, and cooperation between Kiev and NATO. Ukraine is one of the 14 East European countries that have meanwhile opted for close military and political cooperation with the Western alliance in connection with NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. In their declaration, the ministers emphasize that "their joint objective is the consolidation of peace, stability, and security in the Euro-Atlantic area within the framework of the all-European process." Both sides concur "that under the current conditions creating and maintaining good relations between their countries is an essential factor for strengthening peace, stability, and security in Europe." Bonn and Kiev express their readiness "to contribute to this process through intensifying comprehensive relations in the military sphere and through making them transparent and predictable." Radetski is due to visit the 31st Fighter Bomber Air Wing "Boelcke" at Noervenich, and the 19th Armored Infantry Brigade and the 203d Tank Battalion at Hemer.
