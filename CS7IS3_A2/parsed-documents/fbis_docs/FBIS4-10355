Arce emphasized the need to support--and not for electoral purposes--the agricultural and industrial producers "who do not see their work yielding any profits," and who are harassed by high bank interest rates and a fiscal policy that makes it impossible for their products to compete in Central America. The Sandinist leader said the FSLN should form alliances for the 1996 elections in order to offer Nicaraguan society a consensus political platform. In speaking of the selection of candidates for the 1996 national elections, Arce said that "any member will have the right to seek the nomination or to propose nonmembers of the FSLN as candidates. No one should be disturbed by that or reject those potential candidates or suggestions for candidates." [Irias] What should the FSLN's priority be until 1996? [Arce] Our top priority must be to stand at the side of civil society to defend its interests and solve its problems. We cannot seek an election victory with fancy words and abstract concepts. Coffee growers and cattlemen now face severe credit problems that threaten them with the loss of their properties. Business and industry have serious problems because they can not even compete in Central America because of the current fiscal policy; and there is terrible and growing unemployment. Our priority must be to stand in support with those sectors. And in 1996 to offer alternatives so the nation can move forward. It is a vital and strategic necessity for Sandinism to win the 1996 elections. Sandinism is the only political force in the history of Nicaragua that has presented innovative alternatives. We broke with the either/or dichotomy of liberals and conservatives and gave Nicaraguan society a number of political and economic options, multiple possiiblities for expressing itself. If that program were to suffer a political setback in 1996, it might well mean that an exclusionary and absolutist concept from the past could be reinstated, in which only liberals and conservatives could take part in the process. That is the intention of liberals and conservatives when they say: "We have to get rid of Sandinism and other small political groups." That would be catastrophic for the nation's future. [Irias] Does that mean that the FSLN should stand in support with those sectors in order to win the elections? [Arce] Standing with sectors of society wins you the status of a credible negotiator, but we are not doing that just to win votes. We defend the transformations which we brought about. When we support the rights of people who were helped by Agrarian Reform or who were given urban lots, we do so for the principle of economic democratization, although we know that many of those people voted against the FSLN. Because of that democratizing principle, we support the privatization of businesses, with their workers to become the owners of these businesses. If those workers worked to build them and keep them going, it is just that they should have the possibility of becoming the owners of those businesses. In addition, we say that properties which were improperly confiscated should be returned when that is possible, and when it is not possible to return those properties, compensation must be made. [Irias] The FSLN's secretary general, Daniel Ortega, said the 1996 election will be between Sandinism and Somozism. Do you agree? [Arce] When Daniel Ortegs says the 1996 election will be between Somoza and Sandino, I think he means that the strength shown by the PLC [expansion not given] in the Atlantic Coast makes clear the danger of bringing back those exclusionary concepts which were expressed in Somozism. Arnoldo Aleman talks about getting rid of Sandinism and calls us SOB's, thieves, and murderers. Those are pejorative descriptions to use in a democratic system. Still, I do not believe that Aleman's group represents Somozism; Somozism was an integrated economic and military force. Accepting that idea would mean that the National Police and the Army are acting in support of that exclusionary and repressive philosophy. I would be very careful about saying that the antagonism is between Sandinism and Somozism. Many of the young people who will be voting in 1996 were not yet born when the dictatorship was overthrown. They have no idea of what Somozism was. I think Daniel is warning people that the danger exists that those elements of Somozism might be restored. [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for the 1996 elections? [Arce] I personally believe the FSLN should form alliances to run in the 1996 elections. We have to seek an alliance, and not just in order to neutralize the danger of a restoration of Somozism. The polarization of the nation has reached such profound levels--despite the attempts made to establish a philosophy of reconcilation--that Nicaraguan society is still divided, wary, and suspicious. That is why it is so important to offer society a consensus platform in which other political, economic, and social groups will take part, no matter what their size, so that through the alliance a truly national platform may be developed. [Irias] What might be the mechanism for selecting candidates? [Arce] If you start from this idea, obviously the FSLN will have to establish a mechanism to select suitable people and a mechanism to round off those candidacies with candidates from the other groups in the alliance. We cannot go to the 1996 elections simply to win votes and declare that we are winning. We have to do so with suitable people who can really put this national program into practice, candidates who are sensitive to the people. [Irias] And how might the FSLN candidates be chosen? [Arce] The present FSLN Statutes--and I do not think they are going to change--say that the Congress selects the candidates. It has been proposed that the Extraordinary Congress in May convene an Ordinary Congress to be held within the next two years to select the FSLN candidates, as well as to handle other matters. I think that in this democratic process any member will have the right to seek the nomination or to nominate someone else, even someone not in the party, if that person has the right qualities to meet the goals proposed. No one should be disturbed by that or reject those potential candidates or suggestions for candidates, much less sabotage the choice, for that is unworthy of the quality we Sandinists should have. [Irias] What should the FSLN do to be ready for 1996? [Arce] In 1996 we must first of all have become credible negotiators speaking for the interests of the workers and the poorest sectors of society, those who are now sunk in hopelessness because of the current economic policy. We even suggest giving priority attention to the campesinos. In addition, we need to serve as representatives and spokespersons for the nation's productive sectors, who see that their hard work is not paying off. In 1996 the FSLN needs to be positioned as the hope of Nicaraguan society to move the nation forward in a realistic manner. No one in Sandinism thinks that the party can again try do do what we did in the government in the same way that we did it before. [Irias] How should the state be run? [Arce] On government policy we state--and this is true for the present time when we are not in the government and also for when we are--that we are opposed to holding absolute power. We want to promote social self-management, the role of civil society's organizations as an active component with a role to play in shaping the nation's destiny. We also favor the decentralization of power through municipal governments. Putting the government in a balanced role as a guide for the economy. On relations with the United States, a decisive factor in our national situation, we seek a relationship of mutual respect, a relationship that is not only a matter of words, but one in harmony with the new international context, in which economic rationales prevail. [Irias] How do you conceive the new leadership body of the FSLN? [Arce] A new leadership organization needs to be created, and the National Directorate should disappear. That name creates a distorted image in the minds of some party members, who think about what it has meant during the past decade. I believe a leadership organization needs to be established with more people to bring together the experience of cadres who have already held those responsibilities with other cadres who have acquired both moral and political authority. It would be wise for this leadership organization to have an executive body with responsibility for handling different areas: organization, training, finances, propaganda, international relations, etc. The Congress only elected the General Secretary and the Treasurer. We do not have anyone who can be held accountable for the other jobs. I think the new election should distribute individual responsibilities so we can generate the collegial style of operation which has been weakened during the past two years. I support the idea that the responsibility of the Secretary General should be separate from the duties of the head of government, especially as it may well be that our candidate for president will not be from the Front. [Irias] Do you hope to be elected a member of that executive body? [Arce] Of an executive body, no, I definitely have no desire for that. I have already spent over 10 years doing that. On the subject of the leadership organization, what I can tell you is that I never tried to run or presented myself as a candidate for membership of the National Directorate. I came in to fight for "Patria Libre o Muerte" [Liberty or Death]. In 1977, after the death of Oscar Turcios and Ricardo Morales, Pedro Arauz told me that the members of the leadership of the GPP [Prolonged Popular War] faction to which I belonged had chosen me as a member of the leadership of that organization. In 1979 they informed me from abroad that I had been named a member of the Joint National Directorate. During the first Congress, the DN [National Directorate] decided not to stake out personal options, but instead to go "as a slate," to take collegial responsbility for the decisions we had made and the pledge to promote the transition from Sandinism toward greater democracy. I am not going to "toss my hat in the ring" or campaign, but if I am nominated and elected to a leadership post, I will handle my responsibilities in the same way that I did when I was a courier, a student leader, or an underground cadre. If not, I will do whatever I can as a grass-roots activist. [Irias] People say that some DN members are involved in managing FSLN assets. How are those assets managed? [Arce] The way in which the party's assets will be handled is going to be decided by the Congress. It is important to make it clear that for some time now these assets have not been managed by members of the National Directorate. Moreover, this is separate from the political leadership. That is a legal requirement, because the FSLN, as a party, is a nonprofit organization. By law, no party as such may have any business activities. Only through a business organization outside the party like any other business arrangement can we try to engage in business ventures to benefit the organization and earn a financial return. In the beginning, some members of the DN--Jaime Wheelock, Sergio Ramirez and myself--were asked to set up that organizational process that has now been completed. No specific member of the DN administers that business plan. The party treasurer controls these assets and it is the treasurer who will provide the appropriate report to the Congress. [Irias] There are complaints from FSLN members in the Atlantic Coast area about the lack of support they have received from the national organization. What is your opinion? [Arce] Actually, we did neglect the Coast from the central level, as a result of the 1990 defeat. The idea was that everyone would "cultivate his own garden," at least until the election campaign in the Coast. The Front was divided about getting involved in that campaign, because Sandinist groups formed and created independent slates of candidates in the RAAN [Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region]. What the PLC did was to join in alliance with Yatama de Fagoth, for their interest was not autonomy or the problems of the Coast, but rather to create a political impact...and that is just what happened.
