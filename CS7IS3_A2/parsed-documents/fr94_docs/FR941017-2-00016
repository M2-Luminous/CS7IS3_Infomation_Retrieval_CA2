FR941017-2-00016 FR941017-2-00007 Analysis of Program Elderly Employment Compensation Program The Swedish government provided a subsidy to certain companies within the textile and apparel industries through a special employment contribution for older workers. This program provided compensation to a company based upon the number of hours worked by employees over 50 years of age. A company participating in the program had to agree not to dismiss or release redundant employees of any age for any reason other than normal attrition. Payments were calculated on the basis of 28 Swedish kroner per hour for employees over age 50 who were involved in production. The payment could not exceed 15 percent of the company's total labor costs. In prior administrative reviews of this order, this program was determined to be countervailable because the program was available only to certain companies within the textile and apparel industry. ( See e.g., Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber From Sweden; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 6493; February 25, 1992) and Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber From Sweden; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 12912; April 14, 1992)). Svenska received its last payment under this program in July 1982. In January 1983, the Swedish government excluded the rayon fiber industry, including Svenska, from this program. We have calculated the benefit stream using the declining balance methodology. We allocated the benefits from the grant received in 1982 over the 10-year average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry, according to the ``Asset Guideline Classes'' of the Internal Revenue Service. As in prior reviews of the subject merchandise, we used Svenska's 1982 weighted cost of capital as the discount rate. We divided the benefit attributable to the review period by the value of Svenska's total revenue during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.26 percent ad valorem. Preliminary Results of Review As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.26 percent ad valorem for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent ad valorem is de minimis . If the final results of this review remain unchanged from these preliminary results, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all shipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1991 and on or before December 31, 1991. Further, upon completion of this review the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties of zero, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, on all shipments of this merchandise from Sweden entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this administrative review. Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of the calculation methodology. Interested parties may request a hearing not later than 10 days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs, limited to arguments raised in case briefs, may be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief. Any hearing, if requested, will be held seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 355.38(e). Representatives of parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of proprietary information under administrative protective order no later than 10 days after the representative's client or employer becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later than the date the case briefs, under 19 C.F.R. 355.38(c), are due. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22. Dated: October 7, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25633 Filed 10&hyph;14&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
