Clinton who is expected to lobby heavily for his health reform package this week, told a U.S. TV program this morning that health care doesn't have to be done tomorrow. It ought to be phased in over a period of just a few years. "But we ought not to walk away without a bill that provides health care to all Americans." The President's health care package is now under siege in U.S. Congress. U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose closely watched committee is considered crucial in shaping a final health reform plan, told a TV program Sunday [18 June] that there is no chance Congress will pass a bill with iron clad promises of health insurance for all Americans. But he held out the prospect of an abridged version in which health care would be available in about 10 years. Moynihan and Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking minority member of the Finance Committee, delivered that message to Clinton last week. The U.S. president said that he is aware that tens of millions of dollars "in special interest money" has been spent to convince people "that our plan is wrong." "We needed to make some changes in our plan," Clinton added. "But I also know that the right thing for America is to do what every other advanced country has done in guaranteeing middle-class working people health care that can't be taken away. All I want to do is to give the American people what the president and the Congress and the federal government employees have," he said.
