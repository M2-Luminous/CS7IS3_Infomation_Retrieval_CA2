Trade and economic ties between Vietnam and ASEAN countries have rapidly increased. In 1992, two-way trade between Vietnam and the Indonesia reached $220 million. It was $158 million with Thailand, $100 million with Malaysia, $1.2 billion with Singapore, and $50 million with the Philippines. By the end of 1993, about 100 projects for ASEAN countries with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were licensed in Vietnam. ASEAN investment in Vietnam has increased 10 times as against 1990, now accounting for 10 percent of the total foreign investment in Vietnam. More than 30 agreements on economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit, aviation, and navigation have been signed between ASEAN countries and Vietnam. In late July last year, the State Committee for Foreign Investment of Vietnam signed an agreement of cooperation with a prime company of Brunei which will see the latter invests in major projects in Vietnam. In late 1991 and early 1992, the Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN member countries. This helped the region to have a better understanding about the current reform in this country. In visiting Vietnam, all leaders of ASEAN member countries demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties Vietnam has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the Vietnamese in national development. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai of Thailand is committed to create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation between Vietnam and his country. President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines has assured Vietnamese National Assembly chairman Nong Duc Manh that the Philippines has always been Vietnam's friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of ASEAN member countries. Most recently, during his visit to Vietnam, the ASEAN secretary general, Mr. Ajit Singh, informed Vietnam of the decision by ASEAN Secretariat to allow Vietnam to participate and observe in various programs in science, technology, environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and development sources. Mr. Ajit Singh said the secretariat will send senior officials to Vietnam to exchange views on concrete issues of ASEAN's concern. These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries has been increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held in Singapore by ASEAN, ASEAN countries appreciated Vietnam's achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed Vietnam's participation in a forum on regional security. Relations between Vietnam and ASEAN has created a new atmosphere in Southeast Asia. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed once declared that he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and economic development in Indochina, with the confidence that Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia would be stable and developed. It would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
