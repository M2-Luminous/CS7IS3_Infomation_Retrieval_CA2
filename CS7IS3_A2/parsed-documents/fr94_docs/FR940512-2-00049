Description: The data collection instrument will be used by the Children's Bureau within the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to conduct the National Study of Protective, Preventive and Reunification of Services to Children and their Families. The purposes of the study are to: (1) Determine the number and percentage of children and families receiving protective, preventive, reunification/out-of-home services, and after-care services; and (2) obtain national data on the number, types, and dynamics of the services provided to children and their families.

Other benefits derived from the pilot study will provide standardized services definitions for protective, preventive, reunification services and for the target populations eligible to receive them. The study will identify services provided by child welfare agencies across the country and develop standardized service definitions across agencies. Annual Number of Respondents: 625.
