The Duma has already shown effectiveness by electing speaker, Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, said at a news conference on Friday. Travkin believes the Duma can have a stabilising effect on society. He said his party has not entered and is not going to enter any blocs, but members of the Democratic Party would be gratified if their interests coincide with those of other factions. Travkin said the Democratic Party objects to possible construction of a new parliament building, believing that this would only discredit the new legistative body. He added that a regular congress of the Democratic Party of Russia will be held on February 18-19. He said the purpose of the congress is to make the party less amorphous and impart to it a more rigid structure.
