FR940128-0-00008 FR940128-0-00002 For the reasons stated, 7 CFR chapter XVII, parts 1710 and 1717 are amended as follows: PART 1710_GENERAL AND PRE-LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES COMMON TO INSURED AND GUARANTEED ELECTRIC LOANS 1. The authority citation for part 1710 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950b; Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of Agriculture, 7 CFR 2.23; Delegation of Authority by the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development, 7 CFR 2.72, unless otherwise noted. 2. Subpart A of part 1710 is amended by adding the following section to read as follows: ยง1710.7 Exemptions of REA operational controls under section 306E of the RE Act. (a) General policy. (1) Section 306E of the RE Act directs the Administrator to issue interim final regulations to minimize approval rights, requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions imposed on the operations of electric borrowers whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA. The section also directs the Administrator, when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by such borrowers, to offer, without delay, to share the government's lien on the borrowers' systems or subordinate the government's lien on the property financed by the private lender. (2) In issuing the regulations, the Administrator is authorized to establish requirements, guided by the practices of private lenders with respect to similar credit risks, to ensure that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. If the regulations are not issued within 180 days of enactment of section 306E, the Administrator may not, until the regulations are issued, require prior approval of, or establish any requirement, restriction, or prohibition, with respect to the operations of any electric borrower that meets the 110 percent ratio. (3) Nothing in section 306E limits the authority of the Administrator to establish terms and conditions on the use of funds from loans made or guaranteed by REA, to establish loan feasibility criteria and other requirements for the approval of REA loans or loan guarantees, such as those set forth in this part, or to take any other action specifically authorized by law. (4) This section addresses the application of section 306E of the RE Act to REA operational controls and other requirements that apply in general to REA borrowers. The application of section 306E to lien accommodations and subordinations is set forth in 7 CFR 1717.860 and 1717.904. (5) The exemptions granted by this section, 7 CFR 1717.860, and 7 CFR 1717.904 apply only to REA controls and approval rights. They do not affect the controls and approval rights of other co-mortgagees under the REA mortgage. (b) Determination of ratio. The following principles and procedures will apply to the calculation of net worth as a ratio, expressed as a percent, to the outstanding balance of all loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA, hereinafter called the borrower's ``net worth to REA debt ratio'', or simply ``the ratio'': (1) For purposes of determining whether a borrower is exempt from approvals, requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions imposed by REA with respect to borrower operations, i.e., ``operational controls,'' the ratio normally will be based on data as of December 31. Net worth will be based on the year-end financial and statistical reports submitted by borrowers to REA, and outstanding loans made or guaranteed by REA will be based on REA's records. The financial and statistical reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers) are subject to REA review and revision, and they must comply with REA's system of accounts and accounting principles set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation; (2) Net worth will be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of REA Form 7 for distribution borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of REA Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined in 7 CFR part 1767; and (3) By no later than May 1 of each year, REA will notify each borrower in writing of its ratio as of December 31 of the preceding year. If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent based on the year-end data, the borrower will be exempt from the operational controls exempted under paragraph (c) of this section until subsequently notified in writing by REA that it is no longer exempt.
