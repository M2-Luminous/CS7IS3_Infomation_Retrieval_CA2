What are the circumstances of the birth of the Believers Resistance, what is its structure, what is its role in the issue of the Israeli pilot, and how has the kidnapping of al-Dirani affected it? AL-SAFIR posed these questions to Believers Resistance official 'Ali al-Husayni, 40 years old, who learned of the kidnapping of al-Dirani on Radio London on Saturday morning [21 May]. He was shocked by the news, particularly because he met with al-Dirani the day before and urged him to be more careful because there was information that he was being targeted. However, Abu-'Ali [al-Dirani], who was only taking precautionary measures while moving from one place to another, did not increase his guard, believing he would be safe in his home. The following is the text of the interview with al-Husayni: [Marmal] How will the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani affect the morale of the Believers Resistance and its role? [Al-Husayni] Whenever Israel deals a blow to us, the resistance becomes stronger. When Israel assassinated 'Abbas al-Musawi, the Islamic Resistance became stronger and established roots in the people's conscience. After the kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa, the Believers Resistance will become stronger. Israel will not be glad for long about this operation; it will suffer pain as we have suffered. [Marmal] If the authority is directly responsible for what happened, given that it is responsible for the people's security, what about the internal breach of security and has it been identified? [Al-Husayni] From the information we have gathered, it is clear that this act of piracy would not have succeeded without the help of some agents. We have gathered some information, which tally with the other information gathered by other parties and the Lebanese Army. We are following up on these leads to expose these agents and punish them. [Marmal] Can you elaborate further on this subject? [Al-Husayni] The terrain of the area does not permit the Zionist enemy to use it with the help of only pictures and maps. There must be some local people who are familiar with this terrain. We also had information that the enemy had made a miniature of the Qasr Naba village and the hills surrounding it. They may have used this miniature to rehearse for the operation. [Marmal] Why were precautionary measures not taken in the light of this information? [Al-Husayni] The humble nature of brother Abu-'Ali al-Dirani, the positive security situation in the area, and the absence of direct party activity there made us rely on the state's protection. A helicopter landing operation of this size would not have succeeded if there was a will by the authorities to confront it. [Marmal] Did you obtain clarifications or explanations from the military authorities on the way they dealt with the Israeli operation? [Al-Husayni] The security authorities, as they said, did not do anything because of their weak capabilities. We are not accusing the Lebanese Army, which we respect. We paid in our own blood to preserve its unity. Al-Hajj al-Dirani is one of those who paid a direct price for this. However, I accuse the political leadership, who gave the impression directly or indirectly that the aim of the operation was possibly to smuggle out of the country some of [Samir] Ja'ja's supporters who fled toward the mountains. The alert was stronger in the Jubayl area than in others. [Marmal] Was al-Dirani involved in the case of Israeli airman Ron Arad? [Al-Husayni] The Israeli airman was captured by the Amal Movement's Central Security Service, which was headed then by al-Hajj al-Dirani. I do not mean here that the prisoner is held by the movement. I have no idea who was in charge of the prisoner after Abu-'Ali. [Marmal] It is reported that he was handed over to certain quarters? [Al-Husayni] This is not true. Such reports are part of an intrigue. [Marmal] What are your predictions concerning the fate of Arad? [Al-Husayni] He could either be dead or alive. The entire issue has become a riddle, as [Hizballah Secretary General] Hasan Nasrallah said. Since the Israeli airman is not held by the Believers Resistance, the Islamic Resistance, the Amal Movement, Syria, or Iran he might have been killed during Lebanon's several wars: the war of liberation and the inter-Lebanese wars. At any rate, the Israeli airman was captured while bombarding Lebanese territory. Abu-'Ali was in his house when Arad was captured. You cannot equate al-Dirani with Arad. [Marmal] Therefore, you believe that al-Dirani will not give new information to the Israelis? [Al-Husayni] Certainly. He does not have any significant information. If we had information we would have used it to swap prisoners. We are people who treat prisoners well. [Marmal] Are there any contacts with the International Red Cross about al-Dirani's condition? [Al-Husayni] We have held contacts with official circles, which will contact the Red Cross. It is the primary duty of the Red Cross to visit the detainees. [Marmal] What about the political and organizational characteristics of the Believers Resistance? [Al-Husayni] The Believers Resistance is neither an organization nor a political party. It is rather a movement waging jihad. The members and cadres of this resistance were members of the Amal Movement. But as a result of an organizational dispute within the movement, those cadres became members of a Jihad resistance movement in 1988 in implementation of the movement's charter. The Believers Resistance has deep roots, which is evident in the number of its martyrs. We have nothing to do with political parties. We were an opposition movement in Amal but now we are not affiliated with it. We did not establish a new organization because we are not convinced. [Marmal] What is the nature of your relations with Hizballah, particularly since there is an impression that the Believers Resistance is part of it? [Al-Husayni] Our policies are parallel in terms of our Jihad and irrefutable enmity toward Israel. We agree with Hizballah because both of us represent links in the world Islamic movement. We also have the same Islamic authority. We also work together to safeguard Lebanon's unity, peace, and coexistence and to establish social justice by eliminating political sectarianism. In other words, we are part of the Hizballah nation, according to the Koranic interpretation. This is what we learned from Imam al-Sadr, because he represented the wise authority, which is a descendant of the prophet's household. My words should not be interpreted to indicate we are a Shiite movement. We are rather a Lebanese movement based on Islamic ideology. [Marmal] What about relations with Iran? [Al-Husayni] Iran is a state that champions justice. We appreciate Iran's moral and other kinds of assistance. The resistance, whether it is the faithful or Islamic, is willing to accept assistance from any state that is hostile to Israel.
