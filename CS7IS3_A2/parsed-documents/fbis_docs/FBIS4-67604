Heart disease and related conditions such as heart attack, stroke and kidney failure, have caused 60 to 63 percent of deaths over the last ten years, mortality figures show. The steady increase in their proportion is attributed to the aging of the Bulgarian population. Cancer, mostly of the lungs, skin, breasts and stomach, accounts for 13 to 14 percent of deaths and ranks second in death statistics. Up to 5 percent of deaths are caused by respiratory diseases, which have the highest incidence in this country and constitute 30 percent of all registered diseases every year, according to statistics. Nervous disorders such as neuroses, phobias and depressions are also widespread. They have accounted for about 16 percent of all registered diseases over the past ten years.
