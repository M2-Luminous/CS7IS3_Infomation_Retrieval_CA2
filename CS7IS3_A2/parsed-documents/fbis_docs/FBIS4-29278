The ministry reviewed wage negotiations at the 5,483 businesses with 100 or more employees across the nation and found that labor and management at 2,761 firms, about 50.4 percent, had agreed on pay hikes for this year. The rate compares with the 39.3 percent recorded for the same period last year. The negotiation settlement rate reached 50 percent on June 28 last year. The average wage increase at businesses which have settled negotiations was 6.5 percent, a bit higher than last year's 5.2 percent. The rise was attributed mainly to the relatively higher commodity prices earlier this year and the overall business recovery, according to ministry officials. Of the large business groups, Samsung showed the highest rate of settlement with 30 of its 35 subsidiaries, about 85.7 percent, having reached agreement, followed by Lucky-Goldstar with 66.7 percent of its businesses wrapping up pay negotiations. The ministry expected that wage negotiations will be concluded earlier this year than in 1993, although some automobile and shipbuilding firms have reported disputes to the ministry after failing to conclude a settlement.
