The second-strongest party would be the Civic Democratic Alliance, with 11 percent, and the Czech Social Democratic Party would come in third, with 10 percent. This is apparent from the results of a poll conducted at the beginning of March by the Institute for Public Opinion Research. The other parties would not attain the 5-percent limit. The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, with 4 percent each, and the Left Bloc and the Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia, with 3 percent each, would win the most votes of these parties. More than one-quarter of citizens (26 percent) have still not made up their minds which party they would vote for. Only 12 percent of respondents consider the newly established Democratic Union to be necessary. Of the ODS's current supporters, 21 percent are of the opinion that this party is necessary, and 8 percent of them would perhaps vote for it.
