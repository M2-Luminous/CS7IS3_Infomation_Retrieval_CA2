She will take over the most senior post in this consortium, which affiliates more than 40 companies, from current Director Jan Vlcek. The change in the company's management came about after Vlcek was criticized for the difficulties in communicating with the Defense Ministry, without which the RDP Group's arms plans will not succeed. "I am resigning so that cooperation with the Army can be improved," admitted Vlcek. At the same time, however, he added that he will carry on as a member of the RDP Group shareholding company's board. In 1992, Hradska was deputy chairwoman of the government's Committee for International Relations. She led the Liberal Democratic Party until March 1992. She then transferred with her wing of the party to the Civic Democratic Alliance. She was also recently a serious candidate for the post of ambassador to Hungary. According to representatives from the RDP Group, her qualification for the post of director is her ability to conduct negotiations.
