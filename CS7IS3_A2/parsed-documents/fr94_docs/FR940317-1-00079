FR940317-1-00079 FR940317-1-00013 This section provides an expeditious procedure for the investigation and payment of claims (regardless of the amount claimed) that may be without extensive investigation. If it appears that a claim should be denied or cannot be settled within the limits specified in this section, it will be fully investigated under normal procedures. The use of small claims procedures is not mandatory; however, these procedures should be used whenever considered appropriate in the judgment of the claims approval or settlement authority, as considerable processing time and expense is usually saved thereby. If a fully investigated claim is received by an approval or settlement authority, which in his or her opinion could properly have been processed under small claims procedures, the claim will be settled in accordance with normal procedures. Appropriate corrective action will be taken to ensure the use of small claims procedures in similar future cases. §536.39 Investigation. The investigation will be made so as to develop most expeditiously the facts necessary to determine whether the claim is meritorious and in what amount. The evidence required may be obtained by telephone, from incident reports, and other forms of hearsay evidence. Written statements of witnesses, written estimates of repairs, and the like are not required. The approving authority must be convinced and state on DA Form 1668 that_ (a) The United States is liable for the damage or injury incurred. (b) The claimant is a proper claimant. (c) The amount approved, as claimed or agreed upon, is reasonably substantiated. §536.40 Report of investigation. When it appears that a small claim may arise, the report of investigation will be prepared on DA Form 1668. The investigator will append a brief summary of the evidence developed. The summary may be used as a basis for completion of the investigation after a claim has been filed. This report is exempted from control in accordance with AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 7&hyph;2t. §536.41 Processing. (a) If the amount claimed under chapter 11 is not more than $1,000, or in the case of a tort claim is not more than $2500, and is considered meritorious in full, the claims JA/attorney will complete DD Form 1842 or DA Form 1668 and pay the claim. (b) A claim under subpart K is meritorious in an amount of $1,000 or less, or if a tort claim is meritorious in the amount of $2500 or less, the claim JA/attorney may settle the claim. (c) After coordination with the responsible approving or settlement authority, unit claims officers may be authorized to attempt to procure a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement is obtained, the claims officer will complete the small claims certificate for amount of recommended payment and transmit it, in triplicate, with the claim and settlement agreement, to the approval or settlement authority. (d) If a claimant refuses to accept a sum offered under this section or if it appears that a claim should be disapproved, the small claims procedures will not be employed; the claim will be fully investigated and processed. (e) Nonappropriated fund claims will be forwarded by the approval or settlement authority for payment as prescribed in subpart L. (f) Claims under chapter 11. DA Form 1668 will not be employed in the settlement of small claims under chapter 11. Such a claim will be submitted on DD Form 1842. Procedures in subpart K will be used. §536.42 Settlement agreement. When a claimant is available and agrees to accept a sum less than originally claimed, he or she will be requested to sign, in ink, a statement to that effect on any open space on each copy of the claim form (SF 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death)). If not readily available, the claimant will be requested to sign and return in triplicate a DA Form 1666 or Standard Form 1145, which will be attached to the claim form. §536.43 Payment. (a) If a small claim is payable under any chapter except subparts G and I, the approval or settlement authority will allow the procedures of either §536.35(a) and §536.35(a)(1). (b) [Reserved] (c) Except for claims cognizable under subpart K and personnel claims cognizable under subpart L an approval authority who has been appointed an agent officer under AR 37&hyph;103, chapter 15, may pay the claim, and will require the claimant to sign, in triplicate, a receipt in the following language: (Date) I hereby acknowledge receipt of XXXXXXXX in full satisfaction and final settlement of the within claim. (Signature) (Name printed) (d) This above receipt may be printed, stamped, typed, or written in ink in any available space on the front or back of the signed claim form. If not on the claim form, the receipt will be modified to identify and will be firmly affixed to the appropriate claim. Advance Payments §536.44 Authority. This section implements the act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C 2736) as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;521 (82 Stat. 874), Public Law 98&hyph;564, and Public Law 100&hyph;456. No new liability is created by 10 U.S.C 2736, which merely permits partial advance payments on meritorious claims as specified above. (See §536.178 for emergency partial payments in personnel claims, which are not governed by 10 U.S.C 2736.) §536.45 Conditions for advance payment. (a) An advance payment not in excess of $100,000 is authorized in the limited category of claims resulting in immediate hardship arising from incidents that are payable under subparts C, F or J. An advance payment is authorized only under the following circumstances:
