The literature in the name of the "Patriotic Soldiers Committee" said: The secret of the great might of the North which is undauntedly standing against the United States styling itself "the only superpower" lies in that General Kim Chong-il, the greatest general in the world, is wisely leading the Army and the people. General Kim Chong-il is the most outstanding genius of military affairs in the present era who is possessed of military resources of chuche, matchless courage and tested commanding art. Thanks to his military gift, the People's Army could grow up to be a-match-for-a-hundred invincible army, a genuine national army capable of repulsing any aggression of outside forces at one blow and defending the sovereignty of the nation. It is the great pride and honour of our nation to have such a genuine national army as the people's Army. If we are to be a true national army, we must be led by General Kim Chong-il, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. The "ROK" Army soldiers should know that to turn the guns at the U.S. aggressors and their stooges with a bold decision is a patriotic action to become a genuine national army defending the sovereignty of the nation and to live up to the intention of General Kim Chong-il, the outstanding genius of military affairs produced by our nation.
