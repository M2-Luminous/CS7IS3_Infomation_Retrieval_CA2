He asked Hata to resolutely implement deregulation after getting the fiscal 1994 budget bill passed by the Diet. In response, Hata showed a positive attitude toward promotion of deregulation, saying: "Unless deregulation and market opening are thoroughly carried out, yen's value will further appreciate." Toyoda, who took office at a Keidanren general meeting on 27 May, made a courtesy call on Hata. During the meeting, he explained his program of activities as the new chairman, saying: "Our slogans are bold concepts -- steady implementation, reform, creation, and trust. We act not for the major companies' interests but for those of the whole nation." Toyoda further told Hata: "We would like the government to carry out deregulation particularly. Likewise, we would like to request the improvement of Japan-U.S. relationship, strengthening ties with Asian countries, political reform, and especially, enactment of the redistricting bill for the electoral system." In response, Hata said, "Although we are a minority government, neither the political reform nor the administrative reform are issues the opposition parties can oppose. Concerning tax system reform, there is also the basic agreement between the ruling and the opposition parties." He thus showed his strong resolution to implement these policies.
