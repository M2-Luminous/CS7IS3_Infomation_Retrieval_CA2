The Crimean Supreme Soviet, he declared, will do its best to preserve the Crimean Interior Affairs Ministry and ensure its operations. This will be done, Tsekov continued, by raising taxes and introducing other unpopular measures, including lifting state subsidies for bread. I asked Militia Colonel Ivan (Leskiv), chief of the Main Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, to comment on the ITAR-TASS report. [Begin recording] [(Leskiv]) Let me remind you that on 18 May, by edict of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, the Crimean Interior Affairs Ministry was reorganized into the Crimean Main Interior Affairs Administration within the Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry. However, some Crimean politicians are bluntly ignoring this legislative act. The Main Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry is convinced that the above declaration will result only in further embroiling the militia in the political [word indistinct]. It is clear what a heavy burden those ill-considered decisions can prove for Crimean residents -- and not only for them. [words indistinct] because at present, the Crimea is virtually funded by the Ukrainian budget, consuming more than it produces. As for the newly created Main Administration, it has been financed by the Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry budget from the beginning. It receives the necessary equipment to ensure normal operation of all the Crimean Interior Affairs bodies and subunits. This is why high-ranking officials reacted with surprise to the declaration and, even more so, the speed with which the Russian media reported it. This by no means promote will promote unity and cohesion among the ranks of Interior Affairs Ministry employees or lower the already high crime rate in the Republic. Over the past five months, the crime rate rose more than 14 percent in the Crimea. Violence accounts for a considerable part of all crimes committed. This type of crime has risen by 326 percent, while arrests have decreased. Street and group crimes increased substantially. Every second robbery and every fourth assault or case of hooliganism were committed on the streets and in other public places. Almost half the crimes were committed by citizens under the influence of alcohol. With the militia distracted from performing its duties and the political interference in the operations of the Crimean Interior Affairs Administration, criminals are becoming even more arrogant. This causes concern and anxiety not only for the Crimean population, but also for the entire Ukraine. Hoping for success of the negotiations initiated in the Crimea, one would like to be confident that at this complicated and crucial time, the Crimean president and Supreme Soviet will display political wisdom and foresight in legally resolving the artificially created problems in regard to the Interior Ministry.
