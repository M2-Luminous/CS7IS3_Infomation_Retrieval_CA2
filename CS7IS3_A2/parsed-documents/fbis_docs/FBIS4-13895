The paper AL-THAWRAH, organ of the Arab Ba'th Socialist Party, said the imperialist West defends the Saudi regime which throws Saudi strugglers from planes or leaves them in the Sahara to face horrible death. The paper said that the Western political deception is an expression to the savageness of the colonialist mentality and disregard of human rights when the affair is not linked with its sphere of hegemony. The paper said that human rights standard should be one in the world and must conform with the International Declaration of Human Rights and the UN charters and its correct and not selective applications. The paper stressed that human rights in Saudi are abused while suspicious claims and lies are propagated by the American State Department against Sudan, Iraq and other countries.
