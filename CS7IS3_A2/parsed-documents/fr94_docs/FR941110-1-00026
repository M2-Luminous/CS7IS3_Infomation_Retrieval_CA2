FR941110-1-00026 FR941110-1-00006 Multi-State Coordination Section 187(e) of the Act establishes the requirements for ``multi-state carbon monoxide nonattainment areas,'' which are defined as single carbon monoxide nonattainment areas that cover more than one state. To satisfy this requirement, states must develop and submit to EPA a joint workplan to demonstrate early cooperation and integration. This workplan can be in the form of a letter co-signed by all states in the nonattainment area, or EPA has decided, it can consist of signed individual letters from each of the states. New Jersey submitted its letter, containing a detailed schedule of milestones and a commitment to coordinate with EPA and each of the states involved, on October 27, 1992. Therefore, EPA proposes to find that New Jersey has fulfilled this requirement and proposes approval of this SIP revision. Conformity Plan Section 176(c) of the Act requires states to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states must be consistent with federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)). The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to ยง51.396 of the transportation conformity rule, the State of New Jersey is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, New Jersey is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 30, 1994, pursuant to ยง51.851 of the general conformity rule. Those deadlines have not yet come due. The State of New Jersey has committed to develop and submit a SIP revision containing conformity procedures that are consistent with the final federal conformity rules. EPA will evaluate and take action at a later time on any such submittal. Until EPA approves a conformity SIP revision for New Jersey, EPA's general conformity and transportation conformity rules, along with the provisions of section 176(c), will govern conformity determinations. According to EPA's transportation conformity regulation, 40 CFR 93.128, the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP shall lapse 120 days following the date of final disapproval of the control strategy implementation plan revision, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. No new transportation plans, TIPs, or projects may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted and conformity is demonstrated according to transitional period criteria and procedures. Therefore, should EPA's proposed disapproval be finalized, the conformity status of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority's transportation plan and TIP will lapse 120 days later. New Source Review Regulation_Subchapter 18 Section 173 of the Act requires states to submit New Source Review (NSR) revisions that, among other things, incorporate new offset ratios and applicability limits in new source review permitting regulations by November 15, 1992. I. Background EPA is currently developing a proposed rule to implement all changes required by the 1990 Amendments in the new source review provisions in parts C and D of title I of the Act. EPA will refer to the proposed rule as the most authoritative guidance available regarding the approvability of the submittals. When final federal regulations are promulgated, EPA will review those NSR SIP submittals on which it may have taken final action to determine whether additional SIP revisions are necessary. In this proposed rulemaking on New Jersey's nonattainment NSR SIP, Subchapter 18 ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution from New and Altered Sources Affecting Ambient Air Quality,'' EPA is applying its current view of the Act's requirements. New Jersey addressed all pollutants in its revision to Subchapter 18 and therefore, EPA is taking action on the NSR program as it relates to all criteria pollutants. II. Evaluation of State Program The following summarizes EPA's evaluation of New Jersey's revised NSR rule and EPA's proposed action. The State of New Jersey held a public hearing on November 5, 1992 to entertain public comment on its revised NSR implementation plan. Subchapter 18 was adopted on February 19, 1993, and submitted to EPA on the same date as part its proposed revision to its ozone SIP. EPA found the submittal to be complete on April 29, 1993.
