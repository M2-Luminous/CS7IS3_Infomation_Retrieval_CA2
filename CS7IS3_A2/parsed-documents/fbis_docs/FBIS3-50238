The absolute prerogative was and undoubtedly is the willingness (or unwillingness) of the Alliance itself to make a strategic decision and intrinsically alter the geopolitical constellation in the zone between Germany and Russia. The recently approved Partnership for Peace plan, however, diverts attention, to a certain extent, to the "other end of the court" inasmuch as the possible admission of the individual aspirants for NATO membership is conditional upon the quality and speed of their domestic reforms and upon stable development in the economic, political, and military spheres. The first practical steps within the framework of the Partnership plan should be joint military exercises between the armed forces of the Visegrad Four countries and NATO, while the interested parties will have their own permanent representatives in the Alliance's Brussels headquarters. The coming months will indeed be a testing time for the "converging" Visegrad Four states,because the phase of noncommittal political declarations on their readiness "to share in the joint aims and values" will be replaced by practical experience, which will establish the potential for effective military cooperation. In this connection, it is impossible not to ask if our Army is ready for close cooperation with the NATO Command. It is no use disguising the fact that the current Czech Army is, for all sorts of reasons, the element of political authority least affected by the post-November changes and that even the various "screenings" have not done much to alter this sad fact. It comes as no surprise that it is a, so to speak, superhuman task for Defense Minister Baudys to find at least 30 young officers with the appropriate education and linguistic ability capable of acting as our representatives in the Alliance's Command and individual committees. The fact that, since 1989, some 170 Czech soldiers have undergone training in the West (at the state's expense, of course) and that many of them are now in better-paid positions in the private sector completes this paradoxical situation. The greatest shortcoming in the qualifications of the Czech Army's Command Corps is not so much their "technical" expertise but their absolute lack of world languages. This is despite the fact that two-thirds of the some 25,000 officers are university graduates. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell today how many soldiers studied in the former Soviet Union because the Defense Ministry's Personnel Department does not keep such records. It is certain that, for example, the current chief of the General Staff was a very diligent student; this is even borne out by his endeavor at two colleges in the very womb of the camp of peace and socialism. Jiri Nekvasil is obviously the right man for the job and is indeed a suitable partner for his "western" colleagues (a mixture of former West Point students). The Czech Army is currently going through a very demanding and painful structural reorganization process, and the number of men at arms should be reduced from 100,000 to 65,000 within two years. The fundamental transformation of the General Staff, the creation of new logistics (that is, principles for financing the troops), and the creation of completely new commands (for example, the Tactical Air Force) are all planned in this first phase. The concept also envisages the early formation of a fully professional Rapid Deployment Brigade of 3,500 men, whose equipment will be "compatible" with that of similar units in the NATO forces. According to Baudys, this brigade, along with the Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] unit, should form the basis for our participation in the Partnership for Peace plan and, at the same time, act as a kind of precursor of the future fully professional Army. It is certainly not news to our political officials that the equipment, structure of the forces, and, in view of its personnel makeup, the Command Corps are not "compatible" with the armed forces of NATO states. Compared with the other parties interested in a spot beneath the security umbrella, however, this handicap is, in essence, insignificant. After all, the Czech Republic's integration into the Euro-Atlantic security structures depends, first and foremost, on the political decision of the Alliance itself.
