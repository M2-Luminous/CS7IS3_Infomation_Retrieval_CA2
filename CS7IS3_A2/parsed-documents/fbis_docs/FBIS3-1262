Cyriaque Simbizi, minister of information and government spokesman, has denied the rumor which is creating tension in our country. He added that whoever is charged spreading this rumor will be severely punished. [Begin Simbizi recording] On behalf of the government, I would like to tell Burundi and the world that there has been no coup d'etat in recent days. These are rumors which we heard mainly here in Bujumbura. As I announced even yesterday, these are rumors circulating here in the town of Bujumbura. We were surprised to hear foreign radios adamantly asserting that there has been a coup d'etat. Foreign radios -- about two of them -- reported that nobody knew the whereabouts of the head of state and that ministers had fled the country. I can state that all these are lies. I would like journalists to explain to the citizens and the international community listening to us that this is a baseless lie. [passage omitted] [end recording]
