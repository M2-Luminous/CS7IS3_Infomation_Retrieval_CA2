According to Sudanese officials his visit was aimed at encouraging and equipping the rebels, who have recently suffered heavy defeats. The action, which was taken on the orders of American President Clinton, is an undisputed violation of Sudanese national sovereignty and ridicules the definite principles of international law. The American Government's intervention reveals the long standing support given by this country to the southern Sudanese cessationists and adds a page to the bulky record of state terrorism by Washington's leaders. In a similar action, in coordination with the British ambassador to Sudan, the Archbishop of Canterbury also travelled to southern Sudan some while ago, but this led to a firm response by the Sudanese Government and the expulsion of the British ambassador from the country. At the time the Sudanese Government also warned the U.S. ambassador regarding intervention in Sudan's internal affairs and support for terrorism, and called on him to be aware of the consequences of such actions. However, with no concern for the warnings, America, while leading the Western world, continued to increase pressure on Sudan in various ways from both inside and abroad. The propaganda horns were once again sounded to poison public opinion, while standard Western practices used to bring down independent countries refusing submission were put into effect -- countries which in the opinion of the West are enemies because they are not in the Western camp. Reports on violations of human rights and of Sudanese Government support for terrorism were transmitted constantly. Seminars and congresses by the Sudanese opposition in Western countries were given priority news coverage, and there were even reports about direct Western intervention to divide the country. Western crocodile tears were shed in sympathy with minorities in southern Sudan, while Western governments not only turn a blind eye to the rights of the majority in various parts of the world, including Bosnia and Algeria, but are active in denying these rights by cooperating with the violators. [passage omitted]. Obviously, in the final analysis the West will have to bear the negative consequences of these irresponsible actions and double-standard policies. Such actions will only increase instability in the international order and will lead the world toward new chaos and disorder.
