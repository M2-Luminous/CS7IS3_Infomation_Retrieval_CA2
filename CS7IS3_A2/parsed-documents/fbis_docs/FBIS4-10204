FBIS4-10204 "drlat068_b_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic Government Rejects U.S. Letter on Embargo Violation Government Rejects U.S. Letter on Embargo Violation PA0804141094 Paris AFP in Spanish 2238 GMT 7 Apr 94 PA0804141094 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Apr (AFP) -- This Thursday, Fabio Herrera, Dominican deputy secretary of state of foreign relations, described the letter by 48 U.S. legislators urging President Joaquin Balaguer to prevent the UN and OAS embargo against the Haitian military regime from being violated as a "verbal threat." The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Herrera "categorically" rejected the terms used in the letter and suggested that "Dominican political sectors" whom he did not identify could be behind the note. He did clarify, however, that the opposition candidates preparing to participate in the 10 May elections are not behind the letter. He indicated that the language used in the note "seems to be more political because these are not diplomats making the demand but pressure groups resorting to any language." The deputy foreign minister indicated that the letter's tone "is not that which is normally used in diplomatic relations between the Dominican Republic and the United States, which are generally conveyed through the U.S. Embassy." The letter said "it would be tragic if our productive and friendly relations were undermined by your government's lack of willingness or inability to fully implement the embargo against Haiti." The U.S. legislators stated contraband gasoline is moving from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, and they said that "fuel is being taken across the border by hand and in boats and trucks." The legislators' note also states that amount of fuel crossing the border has increased "despite the embargo." This Thursday in Caracas, Claudette Werleigh, foreign minister of deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, stated nearly 2,000 gallons of gasoline cross the Dominican-Haitian land border every day. The gasoline is later sold on the Haitian "black market" at prices ranging from $15 to $18 per liter. The Dominican press has consistently reported, even with photographs, this fuel operation shows coordinated activity between both countries' militaries. In one of the note's most aggressive passages, the U.S. legislators indicate that "this flagrant, massive violation of the embargo cannot be condoned." They stress to Balaguer that it is "imperative that your country end the Haitian embargo violation. These violations undermine international efforts to isolate the coupist regime and pressure it into reestablishing President Aristide's elected civilian government." The signatories are all members of President Bill Clinton's Democratic party. Heading the list is Joseph Kennedy II, a member of the famous U.S. dynasty.
