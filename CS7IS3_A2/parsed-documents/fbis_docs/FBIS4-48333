The hostages were released unharmed after South African National Defence Force [SANDF] intervention. Witwatersrand army command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said the three people were dragged into Hostels One, Two and Three after their minibus was hijacked at about 3.30PM on Sunday. Angry African National Congress supporters then marched on the hostels, demanding to accompany a search of the complexes, but this was rejected by hostel residents. Cordons were drawn around the hostels and SANDF reinforcements were deployed to stabilise the situation, which was described as "tense but under control". By 8PM on Sunday crowds that had gathered outside the hostels had dispersed and relative calm had returned to the area. The cordons were removed but SANDF patrols in the area were stepped up and the situation was being monitored closely, Maj Visser said. Early on Sunday morning a SANDF rifleman was shot dead near the hostel complex. A statement issued by Capt Sonja Nel from Group 41 said two SANDF members were on their way to the Tokoza railway station when they were confronted by four unknown men who demanded to know where they were going and why they were wearing ANC tracksuits. The SANDF members replied that they were on their way to the station and were wearing tracksuits belonging to the force. The two riflemen produced their SANDF drivers licences to prove their identities. The four men grabbed one of the rifleman, while the other soldier ran away to seek help. A patrol sent to search for the rifleman found him dead in front of the Tokoza Hostel. His name would be released once his next-of- kin had been informed. Meanwhile, the names of eight of the 12 people killed execution-style by unknown gunmen on Friday night were released by police spokeswoman Capt Janine Smith. They are Paulus Nhlapo, 13, Zakele Mvumu, 20, Raymond Kubeka, 20, Freddie Lehoko, 19, Siphiwe Ngema, 18, Tulani Mthumalo, over 18 years of age, Colin Nthumalo, 19 and Lucky Poole, 19. The names of the other four victims will be released once their next-of-kin have been informed. Friday night's massacre and Sunday's killing and abduction raised fears that violence -- which claimed 2,000 lives on the East Rand last year -- would increase. Until Friday, violence had abated in the East Rand townships of Tokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus since South Africa's first all-race election at the end of April. Leaders in the newly-appointed government of national unity have vowed to end the violence, which has claimed about 15,000 lives since political reform began in 1990.
