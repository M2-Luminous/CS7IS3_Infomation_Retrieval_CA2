As expected, the file on the interior minister will be sent to the relevant court, but without any requests of any kind and no inclusion on the list of investigatees. This was officially announced by Judge Ettore Torri: "The initial request to shelve the case has been accepted," the prosecuting attorney said at the end of a meeting yesterday afternoon, which was surprisingly not attended by the head of the capital's judicial authorities, Vittorio Mele. Both Mele, through his absence, and the others, by means of this measure -- which has already been challenged by the Attorney General's Office -- intended to make it clear that they plan to pass on this hot potato without even touching it. It is a way of washing their hands of it, but also an attempt to defer matters at least until the elections and averting the resignation of a minister. Their success in this is not altogether certain because the investigation is not yet complete, and indeed it seems to have been resumed at full speed, with implications that are being described as "very important." Yesterday Sabrina Broccoletti, daughter of the intelligence officer at the center of the scandal, was arrested by carabinieri. General Nunzella's carabinieri, who have been conducting the inquiry from the outset, presented a sequestration warrant signed by Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Michele Coiro for the seizure of the red-hot tapes recorded in the Sisde offices (apparently including crucial conversations between Broccoletti and the major protagonists of the case, from "tsarina" Martucci to Di Pasquale and Malpica himself) that the girl was about to hand over to the lawyer, Nino Marazzita, as reported by the press and television over the past few days. Broccoletti will discuss these tapes tomorrow, Wednesday, with the ordinary magistrates, since they are unlikely to be delivered in time for the interview already scheduled for this morning with the court of ministers. The magistrates responsible for politicians' crimes will ask him about the positions of former Interior Ministers Antonio Gava and Vincenzo Scotti, but obviously, although the Rome Attorney's Office wants to wash its hands of the affair, it will also ask the civilian secret service's former administrative chief to talk about present Interior Minister Mancino. The court of ministers and the Attorney General's Office officially protested the conduct of the ordinary magistrates on this point: In two almost simultaneous letters they informed the judges at Piazzale Clodio that the forwarding of the file in any case entails his inclusion on the register and an explicit request to shelve the case or for further inquiries to be conducted. "What can I tell you?" Judge Torri told us in this regard. "If the court of ministers considers our decision mistaken, it will send the file back to us...." "But was it so difficult for you to make a request?" we asked. "A request has already been made," the magistrate replied, "suggesting that the investigation into Mancino be shelved, but the court is entirely free to do whatever it wants, since it is the legitimate entity responsible for penal actions against ministers." Ettore Torri refused to add much more, despite the fact that it was he who fought on 12 November to include Mancino on the register of investigatees, against the wishes of his boss, Mele, and he now seems resigned to respecting the latest order. The same goes for Michele Coiro, the other assistant judge who challenged the extradition request and that seems to have been in charge of the investigation for some time. Coiro also took issue publicly with Mele on a couple of occasions, going as far as to describe his boss as "rather naive" about the business of including [former Police Chief] Vincenzo Parisi on the register of investigatees. This could explain Mele's absence from yesterday afternoon's meeting, which was attended by Attorneys Leonardo Frisani and Aurelio Galasso, as well as Coiro and Torri. It was at the end of this meeting that Torri announced the forwarding of the latest evidence in the Mancino case. On television channel 3 news he provided a very important explanation for those acquainted with the secrets of the Sisde case. Torri explained that the documents forwarded to the court of ministers include transcripts of the final interviews with former Sisde Director Riccardo Malpica; his successor, Alessandro Voci; and their former aides, Maurizio Broccoletti and Gerardo Di Pasquale. The importance of this announcement is connected with the fact that Gerardo Di Pasquale clearly also spoke about Nicola Mancino's role in the business of the illegal funds. It is not known what was said by the former head of Sisde's logistics department, though hitherto his line of defense is close to that of Broccoletti and company, with the sole exception of Michele Finocchi, the last of the people questioned in this case, who is less willing to incriminate his superiors and politicians. As for the interviews with Malpica and Voci, there have already been several disclosures, according to which their accounts coincide with regard to the role of former Police Chief Parisi, of the interior minister's former private secretary Lauro, and of Mancino himself in covering up intelligence officers involved in the scandal. Evidently the attorney general decided that these statements did not provide sufficient grounds for investigating a minister in office. But Malpica and Voci, two other witnesses, were at the very summit of the organization at the crucial time being examined by the investigation, and initially they differed sharply -- so much so that Voci reported Malpica for having made him supply a false statement to the magistrates concerning the destination of the billions of lire taken from Sisde and for having made him sign false transfer notes relating to the funds. Last, Torri also explained that no consideration was given to the possibility of questioning Police Chief Parisi, who was criticized harshly by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in Naples yesterday for his "undoubted political responsibilities" during his time as Sisde chief with regard to the Cirillo case, in a clear reference also to his role in the illegal funds affair.
