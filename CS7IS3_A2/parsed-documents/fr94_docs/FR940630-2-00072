ACTION: Notice; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to August 1, 1994, the comment period for interested persons on the petition filed by Teepak, Inc., (GRASP 3G0397) entitled ``GRAS Affirmation Petition for Collagen Fiber.'' FDA is taking this action in response to a request to allow additional time for public comment. DATES: Written comments by August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary E. LaVecchia, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;217), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9519. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63996), FDA published a notice of filing stating that Teepak, Inc., had filed a petition (GRASP 3G0397) proposing that collagen fiber be affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an ingredient in human food. Interested persons were given until February 1, 1994, to comment on this notice of filing. FDA received a request, dated January 24, 1994, to extend the comment period for public response. The comment stated that an extension was needed because there was a delay in receiving a copy of the petition through the Freedom of Information process. After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for interested persons to submit comments. However, because the initial comment period ended on February 1, 1994, the agency is reopening the comment period. The agency is now requesting all comments by August 1, 1994. Interested persons may, on or before August 1, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this petition. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: June 24, 1992. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
