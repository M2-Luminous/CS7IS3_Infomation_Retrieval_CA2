A provincial official in charge of rural education said that the province has 68 rural correspondence schools, which have enrolled more than 90,000 farmers since 1988. So far 80,000 of them have graduated from the schools and mastered at least one agro-technique. About one half of them have been awarded the title of agro- technician, and many have taken the lead in applying, spreading and developing scientific techniques of farming and animal breeding. One example is Zhao Zhengming, a farmer who graduated from a local correspondence school. By putting what he learned into practice, he earns more than 1,000 yuan every day by raising 300 pigs and more than 13,000 chickens. According to a statistical report provided by the Zhejiang Provincial Statistics Bureau, the average net income of rural residents in Zhejiang province averaged 1,746 yuan per capita last year, an increase of 28.5 percent over the previous year.
