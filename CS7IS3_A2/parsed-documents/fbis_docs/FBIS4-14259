Statistics show that the trade deficit during the first nine months of 1992-1993 was US $2.014 billion, which reduced to US $1.322 billion between July 1993 to March 1994. Financial managers consider this a significant reduction in the trade deficit, which registered a decrease of almost US $77 million per month during the first nine months of the current financial year. They hope that the deficit would further be reduced by adopting more balanced approach in exports and imports. Official sources say the foreign exchage reserves have been studied for the last two months at US $1.8 billion -- sufficient for almost nine weeks of imports. Between July 1993 to March 1994, the total export bill remained US $4.80 billion as compared to US $5.05 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, showing a decline of 3.4 percent in exports. During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the total import bill remained US $6.2 billion as compared to US $7.1 billion in the corresponding period of 1992-93, showing a decline of 12.2 percent in imports. Financial managers say the decline in exports occured due to the discontinuation of the yellow cab scheme, effect of devaluation and title monetary policy and the government's more stringent control on deficit.
