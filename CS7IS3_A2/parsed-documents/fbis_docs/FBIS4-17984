"The Belarusian press is on the brink of disaster," the letter reads. "Expenditures for publishing a large-circulation newspaper amount to 1 billion [not further specified] a week. Funds coming from subscription fees will be enough for the next few days. ...Neither advertisement nor other forms of commercial operations, with which editorial boards have been forced to deal, will ensure further existence of the press." Beginning 29 April, as the letter points out, publication of newspapers will be halted, except for the 1 and 9 May issues which will be devoted to Victory Day. "Although this is not a strike," the authors note, "there are grounds to hold one. ...The editorial boards are ready to resume publishing as soon as a solution to the current deadlock is found."
