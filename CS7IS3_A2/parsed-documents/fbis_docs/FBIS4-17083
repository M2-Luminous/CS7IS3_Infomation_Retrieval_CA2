He said that late last night Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton had a long telephone conversation, lasting some 40 minutes. Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that during the conversation the Russian Federation president said "Russia and the United States have a common path of democracy and partnership, there is no crack in the partnership, but a sober and pragmatic account of national interests does exist." The Russian Federation president again confirmed Russia's position with regard to NATO's bombing raids. "Russia is not a supporter of any party to the conflict, but it does have and will continue to have its own levers to influence the situation in the region," Kostikov said. He also said that during his telephone conversation with Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin yet again came out "categorically against bombing raids not previously agreed upon with Russia, and in response, got Clinton's assurance that the USA would refrain from sharp actions in this direction." Vyacheslav Kostikov thinks that in order to settle the Balkan crisis, it is necessary to find "a single plan and to set about implementing it." "The attempt by the parties involved to get individual dividends from the crisis is doomed to fail and is not constructive," the press secretary emphasized.
