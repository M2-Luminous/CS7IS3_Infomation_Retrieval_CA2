FBIS4-7028 "dreas080_c_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 North Korea Hwarang Exercise Seen as Readiness for Invasion Hwarang Exercise Seen as Readiness for Invasion SK2604075894 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 25 Apr 94 SK2604075894 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 25 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to Seoul's Christian Broadcasting System reports, on 25 April the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique launched the provocative Hwarang war exercise in Inchon and the areas of Kyonggi Province adjacent to the military demarcation line. The exercise in which some 1.3 million puppet military personnel, police officers, and reservists are taking part will be conducted for five days under the pretext of defending the homeland and facilities against someone's infiltration. The war exercise commotion perpetrated by the puppet clique is all the more adventurous since it is staged right after warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry left Seoul after hatching a war plot and, in particular, is timed to coincide with the deployment of the latest-type Patriot missiles. The prevailing situation once again exposes the fact that the Kim Yong-sam regime has completely thrown away its civilian mask, has clearly revealed its color as a warmonger, and is kicking up its preparations for a northward invasion.
