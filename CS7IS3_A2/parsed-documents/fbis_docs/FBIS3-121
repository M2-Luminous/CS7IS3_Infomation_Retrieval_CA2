W. de Klerk, says the government is determined to go ahead with the April election, irrespective of whether the Freedom Alliance participates. Mr. de Klerk was speaking during a joint session of the special parliamentary sitting that opened today. He said any attempts to disrupt the election would be strongly opposed. This week's special parliamentary sitting is aimed at removing the Freedom Alliance's objections to the constitution. Mr. de Klerk said the latest amendments removed any reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election. He said the government would use every possible means, including the security forces, against any party wanting to achieve its goals by unconstitutional methods. Mr. de Klerk said parties aiming at secession or the illegal takeover of state or municipal authority should not have any illusions about the consequences of their actions and the role of the security forces.
