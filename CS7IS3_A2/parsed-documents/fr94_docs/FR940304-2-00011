We have now completed that review and determine the net subsidy to be 0.30 percent ad valorem for all firms during the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent ad valorem is de minimis . EFFECTIVE DATE: March 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gayle Longest or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 68) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on cotton yarn from Brazil (42 FR 14089; March 15, 1977). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Brazilian yarn, carded but not combed, wholly of cotton. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 5205.11.10, 5205.11.20, 5205.12.10, 5205.12.20, 5205.13.10, 5205.13.20, 5205.14.10, 5205.14.20, 5205.15.10, 5205.15.20, 5205.31.00, 5205.32.00, 5205.33.00, 5205.34.00, and 5205.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992, eight companies and the following seven programs: (1) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings; (2) Reductions of Taxes and Import Duties through BEFIEX; (3) SUDENE Regional Tax Exemption; (4) CACEX (Carteira de Comercio Exterior) Working Capital Financing for Exports; (5) Preferential Export Financing under CIC-OPCRE of the Banco do Brasil; (6) Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises by the Banco do Brasil (FST and EGF loans); and (7) IPI (Tax on Industrialized Products) for Imports of Machinery or Equipment Under Decree Law 2324. Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble to 19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52325; December 27, 1988). First, we calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging the subsidy rates of the eight companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all countervailing programs benefitting exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Because the overall weighted-average country-wide rate was de minimis, as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we did not proceed any further in our analysis. Analysis of Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments. Final Results of Review As a result of our review, we determine the net subsidy to be 0.30 percent ad valorem for all firms during the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent ad valorem is de minimis . Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all shipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1992 and on or before December 31, 1992. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. Because the net subsidy is de minimis , however, the cash deposit on such shipments will be zero. These instructions shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22. Dated: February 25, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5037 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
