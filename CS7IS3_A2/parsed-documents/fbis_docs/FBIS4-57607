FBIS4-57607 "drlat099_b_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Netherlands Antilles Haiti Army on Maximum Alert; Communique Issued Army on Maximum Alert; Communique Issued PA2305044594 Paris AFP in Spanish 0338 GMT 23 May 94 PA2305044594 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- The Haitian Army has been on maximum alert since Friday, according to reliable sources in Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, acting President Emile Jonaissaint's government, which has no international recognition, threatened to enforce grave punishment against those who "contact the enemies of the homeland or one of their agents." Numerous groups of armed military, many of them in civilian garb, circulated through the streets of the capital on Sunday. Information, Culture, and Coordination Minister Jacques Saint-Louis recalled in a communique that "contacts to let the enemy enter the national territory" or seize military facilities will be sentenced to "hard labor for life." The same punishment may befall those who have "delivered blueprints" to the enemy, the communique adds, without specifying who the enemy is. The law will also be inflexible concerning those who try to "undermine the fidelity of officers, soldiers, and Navy members." The document states "any type of offense, insult, or threat against a public force officer will be punished by between one to six months in prison" and "between one to three years" if the perpetrator is a member of the legislative branch. If "the crime or felony of rebellion is confirmed in speeches or public documents, the perpetrator will be punished with a minimum of six days and a maximum of one year in prison, provided the rebellion did not occur," it adds. "Revoked civilian or military officials who continue to exercise their functions after their replacement will be punished with between six months and two years in prison," warned Saint-Louis, although the government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, who resigned, is the only one which received international recognition. The communique was issued 24 hours after the enforcement of what is practically a total embargo against Haiti to force the military to abandon power, while a small but influential minority continually pressures the White House to intervene militarily in the Caribbean country.
