"On the basis of political activity and the voting of approximately 60 polling stations we observed, we concur with the European observers' conclusion that this election was substantially free and fair," Mr Andrew Orkin, co-ordinator of the legal team, said in a statement. The lawyers said they had observed the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] investigation into, and settlement of, many complaints and nearly half of the 45 cases sent to trial or appeal. Although the voting and counting would invevitably lead to more complaints they were confident that all election complaints would also be dealt fairly and impartially, the statement said. The Canadian jurists' report on the electoral complaints system was co-signed by the legal observers affiliated with Oxfam Canada and the European Community observer unit.
