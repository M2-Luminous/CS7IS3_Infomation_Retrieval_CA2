We are working toward strengthening those relations, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said following a meeting with his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina. Abreu said relations between Havana and Montevideo center around trade, politics, and cooperation. In that sense, he confirmed his government's plans to expand trade relations with Cuba and to seek common political positions in international law, such as self-determination, nonintervention in the internal affairs of nations, and the peaceful solution of internal conflicts, principles that now exist in bilateral relations between Uruguay and Cuba. Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina gave Abreu a broad explanation on the steps Cuba has taken to find a viable national economic model. Both foreign ministers agreed that Havana's debt with Montevideo, estimated at $33 million, should be frozen. They also agreed that a climate of dialogue, initiatives, and prospects should be promoted that will permit, for example, the reactivation of the Uruguay-Cuba commercial commission and the visit to Cuba of a group of Uruguayan businessmen interested in commercial activities. The invitation was formally extended a few hours after Robaina met with members of the Uruguayan Industrial Chamber of Commerce. Today's agenda for the Cuban delegation included meetings with organizations for solidarity with Cuba and leaders of the main political parties. Uruguayan journalists have followed Robaina everywhere. Today, all the newscasts as well as the [words indistinct] radio stations and daily EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO ran exclusive interviews. The main news on Montevideo's channel four was Robaina strolling through the streets of the capital and being greeted by taxi drivers, students, or newsboys as they recognized him.
