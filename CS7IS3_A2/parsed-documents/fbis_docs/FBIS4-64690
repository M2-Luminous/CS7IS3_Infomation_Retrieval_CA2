The Council of State has granted a lower responsibility in the event of accidents with regard to the transportation of low-level uranium. The decision was made because of plans by a U.S. company to import diluted uranium extracted from nuclear arms to the United States to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. The uranium is transported by cargo ships, which can now visit Finnish harbors to collect cargo.
