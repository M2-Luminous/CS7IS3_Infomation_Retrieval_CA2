When the leader of a right-wing radical party says that he has been chosen by fate to save Germany, this is "fascist thinking par excellence," Stoiber said on Saturday [19 February] at an event organized by the Franken association of the Young Union in Herzogenaurach. Republikaner chief Franz Schoenhuber had made a statement to this effect at his party's Ash Wednesday rally. There was trouble in the CSU last week after it became known that former Minister President Max Streibl had met Schoenhuber in his private home last November. CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said subsequently that the meeting had been a purely personal conversation. In Stoiber's view, there is currently "an enormous challenge" posed by right-wing extremism, which is slightly more dangerous than left-wing extremism. The CSU must also be a party of the democratic right, but not exclusively so: "The CSU must not be small but noble."
