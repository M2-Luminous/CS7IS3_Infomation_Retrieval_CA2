"The process of peaceful settlement on the long-suffering land of Bosnia-Herzegovina is going through another period of hardships. Bloody events in the U.N.-proclaimed `safe area of Gorazde' cause deep sorrow and concern. It is necessary to act decisively in order to put an end to deaths and sufferings of innocent people, to violence, terror and any provocations, no matter who inspires them," the statement said. It stressed that the "safety of Gorazde is provided for by respective resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and they must be unswervingly fulfilled." The statement described as alarming the fact that the decision on bombing "was adopted without proper consultations corresponding to the seriousness of the moment with the leadership of the Russian Federation." "Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council cannot stay away from such responsible decisions and should not associate itself with coercive actions for which it did not give its consent," the document said. In a separate statement the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) denounced the air strikes in much stronger terms. "NATO bombs kill orthodox brethren and sisters," it said. The party also lashed out at U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, saying he has "forgotten the goals of his organisation and its charter." "Especially outrageous is that air raids are called a `U.N. Peace-keeping operation," the statement said.
