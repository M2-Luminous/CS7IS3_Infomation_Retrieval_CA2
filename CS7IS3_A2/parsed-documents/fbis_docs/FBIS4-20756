This is because aggression under all laws, legislation, and customs does not end or stop by resisting the actions with which aggression was perpetrated, but rather by resisting the perpetrator, by punishing him, and by preventing him from repeating the crimes he committed. Therefore, in order for the punishment to be effectual the criminal must be apprehended. Proponents of the strategy calling for Saddam's regime to stay in power say that this regime, having endured confrontation with storms, hurricanes, and earthquakes, while facing the blockade imposed on it for more than three years, has shown a unique ability to stand fast and to overcome difficulties. They say this calls for ending the boycott against him in order to resume economic and diplomatic relations with his regime. Advocates of this idea do not forget to bring up the subject of the danger of partitioning Iraq into a Kurdish state in the north, a Sunni state in the center, and a Shiite state in the south, that is in case the Baghdad regime were to cease to exist. This strategy has undoubtedly scored some undeniable success. At the Security Council, Saddam's regime entered a new stage favorable to him after the Security Council welcomed Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715. This resolution places all the civilian and military establishments and installations under UN observation and erects a system of constant monitoring and verification aimed at preventing the Iraqi regime from possessing prohibited weapons. Saddam Husayn has surprised the Security Council by accepting what he previously constantly rejected, speculating on the Security Council's reaction in order to see where this will lead. This speculation is based on the evaluation of the positions of the Security Council members, the undercurrent of disputes between members of the international alliance in the Gulf war, particularly within the framework of the terms for lifting the oil ban on Iraq, and the quest for dialogue and normalization with Washington, which the Iraqi president is so anxious to realize. If those who advocate keeping Saddam in power in Iraq, such as some Arab and European governments, oil companies, newspapers publishers, writers, and commentators, be they Arab or non-Arab, have achieved a measure of success--which is evident in bringing certain countries closer to accepting his [Saddam's] rehabilitation and reconciliation with him--those advocating his removal from power have also scored an undeniable measure of success in their strategy. The Alliance, which the Iraqi National Congress [INC] has set up, is comprised of various races, communities, religions, political currents in the Iraqi opposition, including Kurds, Islamists, nationalists, democrats, and Marxists. The Alliance has been able to build a geographic, physical, and human base inside Iraq. This was something that the opposition had always lacked before this achievement was realized. This Alliance, represented by the INC, has also been able to establish a solid political and organizational structure having its own jurisdictions, powers, and authority--a step, the first of its kind that the Iraqi opposition adopted. The Alliance has also been able to gain a solid international ground, by virtue of the international and regional recognition it gained. Those who question its reality are only those who do not understand its significance and dimensions or those who want to mislead the people by distorting facts and obliterating them. I do not understand why critics of the INC insist that one and all members of the opposition should join it so that unity can be achieved through it. It is known that in the principles of politics and law consensus that includes every individual is impossible, even in matters of jurisprudence, let alone in matters of politics. The proponents of the strategy that seeks to get rid of Saddam are aware how skillful he is in cheating and misleading. Clause 22 of Resolution 687, to which he adheres, essentially consists of two elements. One is technical, contained in the report by the committee charged with ensuring the removal of weapons of mass destruction that the regime possesses, and the second is political, relating to the Security Council's being satisfied with what has been accomplished so far with regard to the destruction of the banned weapons. It also concerns making sure that [Saddam] will not again be able to possess such weapons in the future. Therefore, it is not imperative that the two elements be implemented in succession, whereby if the first is implemented then it follows that the second should be implemented too. This gives the Security Council the option of lifting the embargo on Saddam's regime, even if the committee concerned announces Saddam's compliance with the terms of the aforementioned clause, as its chairman Rolf Ekeus declared. [sentence as published] It would have been far more equitable and right had the Security Council acted according to Chapter Seven, since it is empowered to do so by Resolutions 706 and 712, in order to force the Baghdad regime to pump its oil and sell it and allocate its revenues to meeting the people's basic needs for food and medicine under UN supervision, as provided for in the two resolutions in question. This would enable them to alleviate the crushing hardship the Iraqi people are suffering and, at the same time, prevent Saddam from once again utilizing the oil revenues, if restored to his control, for his evil purposes and reckless policy of subjugating the people and committing invasion and aggression. In light of the efforts of the strategy seeking to maintain Saddam in office, it must be admitted that the counter-strategy seeking to remove him has scored brilliant successes in the international arena. The Iraqi opposition, as is known, has been able to win international support for its struggle. This support sometimes has come from the United Nations and other times from influential international powers such as the United States and Britain. It is worth mentioning that UN support for the Iraqi people and Iraqi opposition in Resolution 688 issued by the Security Council recognizes the Iraqi people's brave stand in the face of Saddam's regime, respecting its rights, and setting out methods that would change the Iraqi regime into a democratic regime respecting human rights. The support and backing the influential international powers have given the Iraqi opposition in order to achieve its objectives of liberation and change has steadily increased since it has been able to organize its ranks and enhance them with cadres capable of undertaking serious work. This was realized at the Vienna meeting in late June 1992 under the INC banner. One of the expressions of strong support and backing that stand out is that of Vice President Al Gore who on 1 September l993 sent a message to the chairman of the INC Executive Council. (AL-HAYAH September 1993 issue no. 11161). In this context President Bill Clinton said in his message to the House of Representatives and the Senate in late November 1993 that the "only way for Iraq to return to the community of civilized nations is through the democratic process, respect for human rights, and adherence to the principles of international behavior." He added: "The Iraqi Government should represent all its people and abide by the integrity of its land and sovereignty." He expressed the belief that "the INC adheres to the objectives that would turn Iraq into a stabilizing force in the Gulf area." He noted that "setting up a no-fly zone in northern Iraq allows for monitoring of Iraq's compliance with Security Council Resolutions 687 and 688 and deters it from launching a major military assault in the area." One might wonder of what use are these pledges and commitments, with the United States having defaulted on many of them, as it did in the recent case of Somalia. In order to further clarify this point we would say that the INC leadership is fully aware that international pledges and promises alone are not enough. Therefore, they must be examined in order to see how compatible they are with the interests of the party making them, so that if there is an imbalance or lack of balance between commitment on one hand and interest on the other, implementation of such commitment will falter and sometimes even fall as has actually happened in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti. It must be recognized therefore that there is a great and serious difference between the consequences of what happened in Iraq and the area around it and of what is happening in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other parts of the world. When Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, the United States dispatched to the Gulf about 700,000 troops of allied forces with the latest equipment and technology and the deadliest weapons. The United States went ahead with fulfilling its commitments despite the very heavy burden they constituted. At the same time it has been unable or unwilling to send a few thousand troops to this or that trouble spot in the world. It must be admitted that the importance of strategic locations in the world vary greatly and that the international vital interests in those areas vary greatly too. Therefore, the consequences of Saddam's aggression against Kuwait and the Gulf region security should be dealt with with the same firmness and effectiveness. Perhaps the interview THE NEW YORK TIMES published on 19 January 1993 with the permanent U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, in which she spoke about what she called new terms that President Clinton's administration is trying to impose on Iraq before the ban on its oil exports is lifted, corroborates what we said. In the interview Albright said the new U.S. position calls for dealing with the question of sanctions in two stages. The first is that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the committee responsible for the Iraqi arms program, should testify that Baghdad has abandoned nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs in accordance with Resolution 687, and the second is that the committee should prove that it is capable of actual monitoring of the Iraqi industry in order to ensure that Iraq will not return to producing such weapons. Albright said: "We want a record proving compliance for a period of six to 12 months of continuous monitoring." In the preamble of its Resolution 687, the Security Council has expressed its distrust in Saddam Husayn's regime, and this is the resolution Saddam Husayn has been using as an excuse for reconciliation and for lifting the seige. [as published] He has shown that he is unable to respect any treaty, agreement, or covenant that Iraq has signed or joined that aims at deterring him from committing more of such actions. His peaceful intentions are in dire need of being tested. He is in a state of continuous blatant violation of Resolution 688. So far he has failed to stop persecuting his own people and complying with methods provided in the resolution for this purpose, the aim of which is to end the dictatorial character of the Iraqi regime and establish democracy in its place. It is true that the resolution in question was not issued in accordance with Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, as in the case of other UN resolutions issued about the invasion of Kuwait and its consequences, but this does not in any way mean that it lacks the force of law. The resolution that was issued in accordance with Chapter Six of the UN Charter becomes binding when it is implemented, as in the case of setting up a no-fly zone and the security zone in northern Iraq and the no-fly zone in the south. In light of the above, one can see how the attempts at reconciliation with the Saddam's regime have reached a dead end because this reconciliation calls for conditions and obligations that the present regime is unable to fulfill. First, it must be established that all weapons of mass destruction in his possession have been destroyed. Second, he should prove categorically that he will not again possess any such weapons now or in the future. Third, Saddam Husayn should finally and irrevocably respect Kuwait's sovereignty and regional security and accept the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders as provided in Security Council Resolution 832. Finally, Saddam should stop repressing the Iraqi people and should comply with the provisions of Resolution 688 that calls for the establishment of democracy and respecting human rights in the country.
