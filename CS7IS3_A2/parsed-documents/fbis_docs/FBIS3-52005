He pointed out that this office, which in the past was marked by its essentially repressive role, has been turned into an instrument through which cooperation is sought and promoted and which plays an important role in reaching viable solutions for the social conflicts which arise in the country. He indicated that in political terms Bolivia has made progress of great significance, which has been recognized by the international community as a whole. He stated that the development of the political and democratic process in the country during the past 10 years has definitively left behind it the ups and downs of the military coups d'etat which characterized Bolivia in the past. In the social field he emphasized that the Ministry of the Interior, initially, and the Ministry of Government, more recently, played a preponderant role in the solution of a series of social conflicts which came up in the country. This was done through negotiations and agreements reached with the Bolivian Labor Federation, as well as with organizations representing peasant farmers, particularly those which represented the producers of coca leaves. At the same time he said that effective results have been achieved in the difficult and continuing struggle being carried out against narcotics trafficking. He indicated that the most important achievements in this regard included breaking up gangs of drug traffickers. He mentioned the cases of Wilson Ferrufino, who had resources of more than $4.0 million in Cochabamba, and later on that of "Nando" Gutierrez, whose property in Santa Cruz was evaluated as being worth more than $3.0 million. Their principal subordinates are under arrest and face trial. In the institutional sense he pointed out that the Ministry of Government is involved in the changes taking place on the basis of the restructuring approved by the executive branch. These changes are fundamentally directed toward the reorganization of the judicial system, in accordance with the objectives set forth in the political agreements signed on 9 July 1992 during the previous administration. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly In the evaluation made by Minister Quiroga of his actions in the Ministry of Government since 6 August 1993 he underlined the following, significant aspects: The good was that he has undertaken an important process of institutional change in the Bolivian Police to turn it into a highly effective organization able to inspire confidence and to provide security in society as a whole. The bad was that he was not able to set out in concrete form the objectives proposed for 1993, particularly regarding the order issued by the Supreme Court of Justice for the capture of criminals against whom sentences have already been handed down. This is the situation regarding Luis Garcia Meza, the former dictator who continues to be a fugitive from justice. The ugly was that he has personally become involved in "the worst job" in the cabinet, holding a ministerial portfolio which is a "shock absorber" for all of the conflicts which come up in this country and is almost always the first to receive bad news.
