FR941221-0-00019 FR941221-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [TD 8575] RIN 1545&hyph;AT01 Allowances Received by Members of the Armed Forces in Connection With Moves to New Permanent Duty Stations AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains temporary regulations relating to the exclusion from gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) of certain allowances received by members of the Armed Forces in connection with a change of permanent duty station. The temporary regulations are required because of amendments to the law made by section 13213(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993), 107 Stat. 473 (1993), which redefined the term moving expenses under section 217(b) of the Code. Persons affected by the temporary regulations are members of the Armed Forces. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leonard H. Friedman, (202) 622&hyph;1585 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 61 and 217 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) that are required because of the amendment of section 217(b) by OBRA 1993. In Notice 94&hyph;59, 1994&hyph;1 C.B. 371, the IRS announced its intention to issue guidance to clarify that certain allowances received by members of the Armed Forces continue to be excludable from gross income notwithstanding the amendment of section 217(b). Explanation of Provisions Section 217(g) of the Code provides that a member of the Armed Forces on active duty who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station does not include in income reimbursements or allowances for moving or storage expenses, or the value of moving and storage services furnished in-kind. For purposes of section 217(g), moving expenses are defined in section 217(b). OBRA 1993 amended section 217(b) by narrowing the definition of deductible moving expenses. As a result of this amendment, questions have arisen concerning the federal tax treatment of certain allowances provided by the Department of Defense to members of the Armed Forces (and by the Department of Transportation to members of the Coast Guard) in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station. These allowances include: (1) A dislocation allowance, intended to partially reimburse expenses (e.g., lease forfeitures, temporary living charges in hotels, and breakage of household goods in transit) incurred in relocating a household; (2) A temporary lodging expense, intended to partially offset the added living expenses of temporary lodging (up to 10 days) within the United States; (3) A temporary lodging allowance, intended to help defray higher than normal living costs (for up to 60 days) outside the United States; and (4) A moving-in housing allowance, intended to defray costs (e.g., rental agent fees, home-security improvements, and supplemental heating equipment) associated with occupying leased quarters outside the United States. Section 1.61&hyph;2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides, in part, that subsistence and uniform allowances granted to members of the Armed Forces, Coast and Geodetic Survey (now known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), and Public Health Service, and amounts received by them as commutation of quarters, are to be excluded from gross income. Similarly, the value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded from gross income. These exclusions from gross income of quarters and subsistence allowances paid to members of the Armed Forces are ones of long-standing, dating back to 1925. See Jones v. United States, 60 Ct. Cl. 552 (1925).
