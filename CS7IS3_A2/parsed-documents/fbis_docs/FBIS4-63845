"I believe that this coincidence is beneficial for our work," he said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on his arrival in Beijing. "We shall prepare to a great extent the economic part of our premier's visit during the commission's work. "We shall actively join the work of the premier's delegation tomorrow, taking into account results achieved at the session." The first session of the joint commission was held in Moscow in 1992, while the next one was scheduled for last autumn. "Regrettably," Shokhin said, "we are late a bit with its holding due to political events in Russia. I mean the elections." Turning to the present state of bilateral trade and economic relations, he pointed to good results of the past two years: the volume of trade turnover achieved even during the best years of Soviet-Chinese cooperation, has been topped. At the same time, some drop has been registered of late. In the opinion of the vice-premier, this is explained by the fact that traditional forms of cooperation have been exhausted. "We plan to discuss new methods of cooperation with our Chinese colleagues. I have in mind such mechanisms as access of Russian exporters to the Chinese national currency and the right of importers to choose commodity suppliers as well as long-term investment cooperation. "I believe that, using this forms of cooperation, we shall be able to bring Russian-Chinese trade and economic relations to a new level of development," the vice-premier concluded.
