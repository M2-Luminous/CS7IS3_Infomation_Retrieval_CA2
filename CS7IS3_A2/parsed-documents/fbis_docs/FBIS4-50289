A proxy-signing ceremony for the business was held in Beijing today; the proxy was signed separately by Yao Zhenyan, State Development Bank president, and by Wang Qishan, president of the People's Construction Bank. The State Council recently gave a formal approval to the State Development Bank's establishment. The new bank's establishment is an important measure in the reform of China's investment system, as well as an important part of the reform of the banking system. The State Development Bank, as a policy-leading state banking facility, will strive to build an investment restraining mechanism and a bank loan risk responsibility mechanism. It will create a stable, long-term source of funds, raise funds from the society for the construction of key state construction projects, guide funds from the society into the construction of key state construction projects, and control the fund source to regulate the total amount and pattern of state investment and to enhance investment efficiency. After discontinuing its policy-leading banking business, the People's Construction Bank of China will become a state commercial bank with medium-term and long-term loans as its main business, and it will handle the payment of policy-leading loans extended by the State Development Bank. Yao Zhenyan said during the proxy-signing ceremony: It is important to find a proper proxy for handling the policy-leading loans and the task is very arduous; and I believe that the construction bank can do the job well because it is experienced in managing fixed assets investment. Wang Qishan said the construction bank and the development bank share the objectives of promoting reform, supporting key construction projects, improving macroeconomic regulation and control, and enhancing investment efficiency, and that the construction bank will do its best to provide good service and handle well the business entrusted to it by the State Development Bank. The two banks agreed to cooperate, support, and coordinate with each other, and to contribute to bringing about a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. After a consultation, the State Development Bank entrusted the Construction Bank to supervise the execution of loan contracts, handle loan and fund payment businesses, supervise the use of loans, and assist in recovering loans. The two banks reached an agreement on defining their responsibility, rights, and monetary business procedures. Present at the signing ceremony were leading comrades of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China.
