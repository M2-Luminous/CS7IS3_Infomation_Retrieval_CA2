The cause for this political demarche was the refusal by the Pressa publishers to print SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, whose chief editor Valeriy Chikin is himself a deputy. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY found out, yesterday's issue of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA did not see the light for economic, not political, reasons. Pressa Deputy Director Mikhail Trushin said that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA had loaned newsprint from the publishing house and now owes it for 345 tonnes. Furthermore, the paper is not paying for printing services: Since the beginning of the year its debt has approximated 84 million rubles. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA does not disclaim its debts and therefore, according to editor Vladimir Polyakov, is trying to obtain subsidies through the State Duma in order to continue the paper's publication.
