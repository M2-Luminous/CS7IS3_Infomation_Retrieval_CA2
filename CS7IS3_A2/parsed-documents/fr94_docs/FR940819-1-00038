FR940819-1-00038 FR940819-1-00011 FRA has initially determined that use of a public standard ( i.e. , National Institute of Standards and Technology XII Standard) electronic data interchange (EDI), whereby accident and incident data would be available to FRA in a short time period, is not only too expensive for the railroads to implement but also inefficient for the types of files that would be transferred to FRA. In order for FRA to effectively assess any modem-to-modem (computer-to-computer) private format EDI submission of accident and incident reports, many more railroads will need to submit their data on magnetic media. A decision on use of modem-to-modem submissions of accident/incident reports would be made once FRA gauges (a) the number of submissions by railroads willing to take part in this voluntary program and (b) the size (number of characters) of the submissions. In order to accomplish this, FRA will carefully monitor and assess all initial magnetic media submissions supplied by the railroads choosing the magnetic media option. Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Option (Proposed §225.37(a)) In particular, FRA proposes, in new §225.37(a), to allow the railroads, subject to various conditions, the option to submit magnetic media that contain: (a) initial accident/incident reports, (b) updates or amendments to all reports previously submitted in hard copy, and (c) updates or amendments to reports initially transmitted on magnetic media. Railroads would be allowed to provide FRA with magnetic media in the form of either a magnetic tape (EBCDIC) fixed format, an ASCII diskette-fixed format, a DBF diskette, or a delimited diskette. The magnetic media option also would allow railroads to continue to submit hard copy reports, as the current regulations require, but to update the data contained on the hard copy by way of magnetic media. Alternatively, railroads would have the option to utilize magnetic media exclusively for all initial reports and all updates and amendments to those reports. Further, all transmissions of updated or amended reports by means of magnetic media would be added to a year-to-date file created exclusively for each reporting railroad. This year-to-date file would include all updates and amendments on reported accidents and incidents and would be maintained by FRA. Retention of Records (Proposed §225.27(c)) Railroads that choose to submit their data via magnetic media would remain responsible for having on file hard copies of the reports identified in §225.21. Therefore, FRA proposes, in new §225.27(c), that each railroad must maintain on file, at a central location(s) designated by the railroad, a signed copy of both the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) and the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.57), as well as a copy of all other reports filed with FRA. This requirement is also meant to include a hard copy of any record submitted via magnetic media. Maintaining files at an identified central location would enable both federal and State inspectors, as well as authorized representatives, a means by which to verify whether the railroad reported a specific accident/incident or injury to FRA. Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Requirements (Proposed §225.37(b)) FRA proposes, in new §225.37(b), to require that when a railroad utilizes the magnetic media option, whether to submit an initial report, or an updated or amended report, it shall submit along with the magnetic media: (a) a sworn report, as required by 49 U.S.C. 20901 (formerly contained at §1 of the Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38), in the form of a notarized ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55), and (b) a signed ``Batch Control Form'' for magnetic media. The requirement to submit a notarized Form FRA F 6180.55 would ensure that railroad reporting officials attest to the validity of the information reported to FRA in the magnetic media and would provide FRA with evidence necessary to hold those officials accountable for false reporting. The ``Batch Control Form'' for magnetic media, also signed by the railroad's reporting officer, would describe the type of report, number of reports, persons injured, rail damage, lost workdays, etc., for each type of accident/incident reported on the magnetic media. By signing the ``Batch Control Form,'' the railroad reporting official would attest that the data contained in the magnetic media agrees with the data forwarded by the railroads in Forms FRA F 6180.54, 6180.55a, and 6180.57. FRA proposes to print the ``Batch Control Form'' on the back of the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (FRA Form F 6180.55). The format of the proposed ``Batch Control Form'' is set forth in Appendix 1 to this NPRM. Computer Magnetic Media Assimilation Period (Proposed §225.37(c)) Since the magnetic media option is a fairly new concept, FRA proposes, in new §225.37(c), to require the railroads that utilize this medium to initially include the hard copy of the particular accident/incident report with the magnetic media. During this assimilation period, FRA will compare the data on hard copy reports to the data contained in the magnetic media to determine if the information reported via magnetic media is consistent and reliable. This requirement would ensure quality control and would provide FRA a measure by which to gauge accurate reporting. After a three-month period of 100-percent accuracy verification, FRA will notify the railroad that the hard copy is no longer necessary. Of course, this process may take longer than three months if the hard copy reports do not agree with the magnetic media submission. If the data in the hard copy is inconsistent with the data in the magnetic media, FRA may require that particular railroad to continue to submit hard copies until both the hard copy and the magnetic media reflect the same information. Once the data on both the hard copies and magnetic media agree, FRA will notify the railroad reporting official to discontinue submitting hard copies. However, there would always remain the requirement that railroads submit a hard copy notarized Form FRA F 6180.55 as well as the signed hard copy ``Batch Control Form.'' FRA believes that providing the magnetic media transfer option for reporting accidents/incidents would ensure faster, more accurate reporting by railroads. The initial start-up cost to railroads is expected to be minimal. FRA would provide initial computer diskettes and technical advice to railroads that use the option. Moreover, railroads would be provided with the opportunity to correct or amend the hard copy reports or initial reports in magnetic media within the 30-day reporting period. C. Reporting Definitions and Forms FRA received a multitude of comments regarding the currently used reporting forms. In general, it was recommended that all forms be revised to reflect recent regulatory changes and new operating practices. As mentioned previously, FRA has had open informal meetings with the AAR Committee for Uniformity in Reporting. The American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) representing the small railroad industry as well as counsel for the Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) were in attendance at these open meetings. These meetings detailed changes in cause codes for train accidents and expansion of the illness codes. Suggestions were also made to restructure the ``FRA Guide for Reporting Accidents/Incidents'' (``FRA Guide''). It was suggested that FRA should develop easy-to-follow directions for any new reporting requirements. Most of the changes were studied by FRA and implemented in 1992. Below is a discussion of each reporting form followed by recommended changes to that form. 1. Form FRA F 6180.45_``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'': Elimination of This Form and Transfer of Certain Information Blocks to Other Forms Form FRA F 6180.45 has been used by the rail industry to report all deaths, injuries, and occupational illnesses of on-duty railroad employees that occurred during the calendar year. 49 CFR 225.21(f). FRA proposes to eliminate the requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA F 6180.45) for the reasons set forth below.
