As in past years, labor unions affiliated with the Japanese trade union confederation (Rengo) and anti-Rengo union forces held separate gatherings. At Yoyogi Park, near the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, about 250,000 people attended a rally sponsored by Rengo, Japan's largest labor group. Besides Rengo leader Akira Yamagishi, coalition government leaders and Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, whose party last week seceded from the government, were present at the gathering. Yamagishi called for more solidarity among the 8 million-strong Rengo workers to protect their organizations in dealing with complex political situations resulting from the first minority government since 1955. From the coalition government, Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency Koshiro Ishida, who is also Komeito [Clean Government Party] chairman, delivered May Day addresses at the rally. Rengo had planned to invite Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as the head of the new government launched on April 28 but gave up the plan because the SDP now became an opposition by leaving the regime. In Kameido Chuo Park in Tokyo, members of unions in the National Confederation of Trade Unions, which has close links with the Japanese Communist Party, held a separate rally.
