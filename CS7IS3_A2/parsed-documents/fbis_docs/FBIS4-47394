The basic approach consisted of activation of the carboxyl group with N-hydroxybenzotriazole and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide--1:3-4:3-4 molar ratio--in dioxane or THF. The activated intermediates were reacted with amino acid esters prepared in situ from the hydrochlorides in the presence of a tertiary base (eg., pyridine, triethylamine)--3.5-4:4-5--for 24 h at 0-5ï¿½C. The target products were obtained in pure yields of 79-95%. Tables 3; references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.
