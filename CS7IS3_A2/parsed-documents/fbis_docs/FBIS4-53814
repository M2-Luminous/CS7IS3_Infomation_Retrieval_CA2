He said if the other APEC member countries wanted the grouping to have a permanent secretariat and have their leaders meet every year, then Malaysia would have to allow itself to be dragged along. Dr. Mahathir was replying to a question during the question-and-answer session after delivering a keynote address at the 27th International General Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) here. He maintained, however, that APEC meetings should not be institutionalised. I feel, at this point of time, APEC should be a loose organisation so that we can get to know each other better and even if the leaders (of APEC countries) want to meet once a while, then I think it's o.k., he said. For the time being, the leaders should not meet so often (but should instead) leave it to the bureaucrats and the ministers to take care of the problems; Dr. Mahathir said when the idea of APEC was mooted, Malaysia was very concerned that the powerful member countries would impose their will on the weak members. APEC, the world's biggest regional grouping, links 18 Pacific rim countries including North America, Australia and New Zealand. Later, speaking to reporters, Dr. Mahathir said he will attend the APEC informal summit in Jakarta in November.
