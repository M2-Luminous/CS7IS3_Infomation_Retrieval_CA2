Victor Hugo Canelas, under secretary for controlled substances, noted that the program is still under study and will be implemented all year round in regions and zones of the country vulnerable to the illegal drug trade. Canelas noted that the program the government is determined to implement in the short term will be supported by the United Nations and by countries that are "major producers" of chemical substances. Canelas added that the program will consolidate logistical support for customs checkpoints in border areas having difficulties in carrying out their monitoring work. Canelas said: "The proposal envisions training personnel, a modernization of communications and liaison, and the establishment of permanent customs and police checkpoints." Canelas described remote areas located in the south (Yacuiba, Villazon), the west (Oruro, Charana, Desaguadero), and the Bolivian Amazon (Guayaramerin, Riberalta, and San Matias) as "vulnerable points" through which chemical products usually are introduced illegally into the country.
