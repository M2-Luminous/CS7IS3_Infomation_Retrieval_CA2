The initiative has come too late, according to the president's spokesman. Martineau reaffirmed that the Haitian military authorities are involved up to the hilt in drug trafficking. [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] A big drug dealer made a series of statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week ago. He stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant Colonel] Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is involved up to the hilt in drug trafficking. Obviously, it was not necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it. Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (?only) after this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end recording] This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude Martineau.
