Fiscal Policy Does Not Extend to Capital Investments"] [Text] Edicts. By an edict of President Boris Yeltsin new rates for taxing legal entities have been set for 1994. The heaviest one now, the profit tax (which accounts for almost half of the budget incomes), may amount to a maximum of 35 percent for enterprises. And within the framework of the policy proclaimed by the government for division of authority between the Center and the territories with increased independence for the regions, the profit tax has been divided into two independent "channels": 13 percent is to go into the federal budget, and the local authorities (depending on whether they want to support production or augment the local budget for social purposes) may decide to vary their rate within the range of from 0 to 25 percent. The commercial banks and insurance companies which, as distinct from the enterprises, paid income tax but not profit tax last year will now be "like everyone else": The tax has been set for them at the level of 30 percent. Naturally the regional authorities will need time to analyze the situation and determine the amount of the local profit tax. Therefore the edict will introduce a uniform tax rate of 22 percent for all of Russia until they make their decisions. In addition to the 20-percent value-added tax that existed last year, a special tax will be introduced in the amount of 3 percent for supporting the most important branches of the economy. This returns us to the stormy discussions of last year between the former Supreme Soviet and the government. The latter, trying somehow to cope with the populism of the people's deputies, who inflated the expenditure part of the budget, submitted to parliament an initiative for a 7-percent tax in addition to the value-added tax, of which 4 percent went for the support of the agro-industrial complex and 3 percent--the coal miners. Parliament cut down this proposal, which was backed by the unpopular Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov. It seems that there will be no opponents of the special tax this year. In line with its declaration of the shift of emphasis "from the monetary to the structural-investment policy," it is also necessary to consider the points of the edict concerning exemption from taxation of profit used for financing capital investments for production and nonproduction purposes and also repayment of bank credit used for these purposes. Small enterprises, if they are operating in the sphere of production and processing of agricultural products or the output of consumer goods or medical equipment, and also if they are building housing, will receive tax holidays as they did before: during the first two years of their creation they are exempted from profit tax. In exactly the same way, goods imported into Russia as contributions to the authorized capital of enterprises with foreign investments will for a year after it is registered again be exempted from the value-added tax. Analysis of the edict shows that the fiscal component of taxation has been increased in it. In addition to the aforementioned 3-percent tax for financing support of priority branches and the new 1-percent transportation tax collected from the wage fund of the enterprises, the overall amount of the profit tax has been increased to a maximum of 35 percent as compared to 32 percent last year. This can be explained by the considerable difficulties being experienced by the republic budget. While in 1992 incomes made up 29 percent of the GNP, in 1993 they dropped to 24 percent. This was a reflection not only of the reduction of the value-added tax from 28 to 20 percent, but also the deterioration of the situation with respect to tax collection.
