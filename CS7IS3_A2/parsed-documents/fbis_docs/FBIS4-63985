Such a decision has been taken by the regional administration, which, pending the completion of appropriate bilateral diplomatic activity, imposed new rules for navigation on the border rivers. From now on the Chinese side must inform a Russian border official about the number of ships, their names, and time of their passage one day in advance of sailing. However, vessels must keep clear of the shores, nor are they allowed to land people, accept them or cargoes on board, catch fish or engage in any research. The Russian Foreign Ministry has been asked to speed up the drafting of complete rules for sail by Chinese ships from the Ussuri river into the Amur river and back. As the commander of Naval Forces of the Russian Border Troops, Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov has told INTERFAX, the issue on navigation on the Amur and Ussuri rivers will be discussed during a visit to China by Russia's Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. Last year's bilateral talks on the issue ended inclusively [as received].
