The meeting comprehensively analyzed the new situation and new tasks of the region's agriculture and animal husbandry and the rural and pastoral work; fully affirmed the achievements in agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral work; set forth the 1994 basic tasks and fighting targets; arranged the agricultural, livestock, and rural and pastoral work; and urged the whole party and all people of the region to be mobilized and make concerted efforts to create new agricultural and livestock production levels. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee; and Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang Zhan, deputy secretaries of the regional party committee, made important instructions at the meeting. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, pointed out: The cadres and the people across the region should define the thinking of welcoming the key year and creating a new situation; unswervingly implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, and the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee; strengthen the extent of reform; work out and also implement perfect measures; and create a new situation in agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural and pastoral work. We should make the rural and pastoral work suit the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic system; take the market as an orientation and economic results as the key; and develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture and animal husbandry. We should bring into full play the might of "the primary productive forces" and create conditions for science professionals and technicians to build agriculture-science-education integrated bases in rural and pastoral areas. It is necessary to quicken the development of the secondary and tertiary industries and promote the pace of becoming fairly well-off. It is necessary to continuously implement the measures for reducing peasants and herdsmen's burden, safeguard their interests, and mobilize their enthusiasm. It is necessary to further support the poor. We should adopt special measures to support the peasants and herdsmen in the especially poverty-stricken areas and to help them eliminate their difficulties. The party committees and governments at various levels should strengthen the leadership over agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral work. All trades and professions and all departments should work out perfect measures to support the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. All levels should organize cadres and send them deep to the forefront of agricultural and livestock production, to grasp typical cases, and to conduct investigations and study. The leading cadres should adopt the forms of handling affairs on the spot to help the grass roots and the masses tide over difficulties. We should mobilize the forces of the whole party and the whole society and make concerted efforts to elevate agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural and pastoral work to a new high. In line with the principle of stabilizing agriculture and animal husbandry and increasing the income of the peasants and the herdsmen and the spirit of "trying every possible means to be fast and do more," the meeting defined the 1994 fighting targets as follows: We should ensure to turn out 20 billion jin of grain and strive to reach 23 billion jin, ensure to produce 56.6 million head of animals and strive to reach 57 million head, ensure to afforest on 5 million mu of land and strive to afforest on 5.5 million mu of land, and ensure that the output value of town and township enterprises should reach 28 billion yuan and strive to have their output value surpass 30 billion yuan. The per capita net income of the peasants and the herdsmen should increase 100 yuan over 1993. To ensure the realization of these targets, we should deepen reform, stabilize policies, and strengthen the construction of grass-roots organizations, and achieve success in strengthening the construction of the agricultural and livestock infrastructural facilities, readjusting the economic structures of rural and pastoral areas, quickening the development of town and township enterprises, and perfecting the socialized service system.
