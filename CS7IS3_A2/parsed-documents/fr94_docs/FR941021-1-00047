FR941021-1-00047 FR941021-1-00009 To ensure that the medical justification for the special issuance remains valid and the holder of the special issuance undergoes the same type of periodic reevaluation as the holder of any medical certificate does, it is proposed that the duration of an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization) will be limited, and a new request for that Authorization will be required upon expiration. In addition, when the FAA determines that an Authorization should be withdrawn, the medical certificate issued pursuant to that Authorization will also expire, in accordance with proposed §67.401(a). An Authorization is one of two types of special issuances and covers those medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease, where the disease is progressive in nature. A Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) is the second type of special issuance. If a medical condition, such as the accidental loss of a limb or deficient color vision is static and nonprogressive, the FAA issues a SODA to those applicants found able to perform airman duties without endangering public safety. This document remains valid indefinitely and permits a designated AME to issue a medical certificate of the specified class if the holder remains otherwise eligible. In the event of adverse change, certification is withheld and the person referred to the FAA for a new determination of eligibility. Current §67.19 (proposed §67.401) refers only to the special issuance of medical certificates. The FAA proposes to add specific reference to the two types of special issuance documents: An Authorization and a SODA. The first document codifies the special issuance letter currently used to grant and describe the provisions of a special issuance of medical certification, and the second codifies a document that has been in use for many years. The proposed change explicitly connects the duration of any medical certificate issued to the validity of the document upon which it is based and requires periodic requests for reissuance. The FAA also proposes to add language (proposed §67.401(f)) that explicitly provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw an Authorization or SODA when: There is adverse change in the holder's medical condition; the holder fails to comply with a statement of functional limitations or operational limitations issued as a condition of medical certification; the public safety would be endangered by the holder's exercise of airman privileges; the holder fails to provide medical information reasonably needed by the Federal Air Surgeon to determine continued eligibility for certification under the special issuance provisions; or the holder makes or causes to be made a fraudulent or false statement or an incorrect statement in support of his or her request or in any entry in any logbook, record, or report that is kept, made, or used, to show compliance with any requirement for an Authorization or SODA. Proposed §67.401(i) would allow a person to request a review of a decision to withdraw an Authorization or SODA. The holder of an Authorization or SODA that is withdrawn may request, within 60 days after the service or mailing of a letter of withdrawal, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for a review of the decision to withdraw. The review procedures would provide the holder an opportunity to submit supporting evidence in his or her behalf, and to otherwise respond to the decision to withdraw. The proposed procedures and timeframes in §67.401(i) are intended to provide an expeditious administrative review for the benefit of those persons affected by a decision to withdraw an Authorization or SODA. The public is invited to comment on the proposed procedures for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA. Proposed §67.401(j) implements the procedure by which the FAA will convert current special issuances to either Authorizations or SODA's. All Authorizations will have an expiration date. The date will coincide with the expiration date of the airman's medical certificate or a date as stipulated by the Federal Air Surgeon or his or her authorized representative that relates to any medical test, report, or examination required as a condition of the special issuance.
