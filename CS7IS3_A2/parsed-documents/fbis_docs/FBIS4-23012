Consequently, an attempt is made to construct special producer strains of FI- and T-antigen to the plague microbe using genetic engineering methods. To this end, pFra/Tox plasmid DNA are isolated from the monoplasmid version of the K-I vaccine strain of Y. pestis, and cloning is performed in the cells of strain 803 of Escherichia coli using the pBR328 vector and cos36 (rep R1162) cosmids and a restrictase and DNA ligase set. The experimental procedure is outlined. The protective action of the purified preparations of the FI-antigen produced from recombinant strain cultures is assessed using conventional techniques, and statistical data processing is carried out according to Ashmarin and Vorobyev. The mice toxin gene is cloned on the pBR328 vector in the HindIII-fragment (6.0 MD) of the pFra/Tox plasmid. An in vitro deletion mutagenesis analysis shows that the sequence encoding the mice toxin has two Bg1 II sites and one Eco RI site. Hybrid pKT328 plasmid is considerably more stable compared to the pBR328 vector. A restriction chart of the 30.3 kD long pFra/Tox genome area which houses the fra and tox genes is plotted, and it is established on the basis of the diffusion precipitation reaction in agar that the recombinant E. coli strain cells produce no more than two units of T-antigen (mice toxin). The area responsible for the incompatibility of the pFra/Tox plasmid and correct distribution of its copies among the daughter cells is identified. The results make it possible to state that by increasing the gene dose and expression level of the cloned gene, FI- and T-antigen producing strains which are distinguished by a stably high synthesis level and the absence of a number of contaminating antigens have been constructed. The recombinant strain cells produced from Y. pestis EV (3P[.sup]-[/]) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis PI produce four-to-eight times more FI-antigen than the cells of the NIIEG line, while purified FI-antigen preparations produced from the recombinant strains' cultured liquid (KZh) have at least as high a protective ability as the preparation isolated from NIEEG strains.
