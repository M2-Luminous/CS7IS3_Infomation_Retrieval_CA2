At the beginning of three-day consultations of Yugoslav economists in the Adriatic resort of Budva, Kontic said that the lifting of the international blockade against Yugoslavia was the utmost priority because it deeply affected the country's overall economy and plans. The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive and binding sanctions against Yugoslavia because of its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Participating in a debate at the meeting, headlined "Programme of Reconstruction and Recovery of Yugoslav Economy," Kontic pointed out significant results in the budget policy, which have been achieved since the launching of the economic programme in late January. The government is currently examining possibilities for reducing budget spending and solving the problem of budget deficit, which should be eliminated in the second six-month period. With regard to the fact that budget deficit was originally planned to be as much as 15 percent of the national product in 1994, the subsequent decision on a balanced budget in the second half of the year will be a significant additional factor of stabilization of economic trends. The fiscal policy is the most vulnarable area, said Kontic and added that the state had to make some resolute and positive steps concerning the entirety of the tax and tariff system and policy, he said. Plans have been made for improving the collection of taxes and customs dues without waiting for a deeper systematic adjustment, he said. Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia Bozidar Gazivoda said that the primary task of the Central Bank was stable national currency. The maintaining of stable dinar and prices as well as the economic growth entail that the Central Bank be free from various influences, he said. Nebojsa Savic, a member of the team which had created the programme of economic recovery, believes that the greatest achievement of the programme is the restoration of the country's sovereignty through the new dinar and stable prices. The success of the programme depends on abandoning in July the practice of financing budget deficit, on stable prices and wages, most of which are free (with the exception of monopolistic and public enterprises), and on re-activation of social programme, said Savic. He proposed an early start of the project of new economic system, the development of new market institutions, privatization and financial rehabilitation of banks. Belgrade university professor Ljubomir Madzar said that the programme had been improved since the beginning of its implementation and that, for example, public spending had been reduced from 52 to 42 percent. Participants agreed on the first day of consultations that there should be more critical views of the prospects of the programme and that restoration of economic ties with the world was of vital importance for safe and final surmounting of the crisis.
