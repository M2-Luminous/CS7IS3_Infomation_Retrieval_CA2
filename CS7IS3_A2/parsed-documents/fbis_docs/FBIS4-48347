It is the most difficult phase, though, because it has to do with governing the country. Government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] negotiators today began discussing national reconciliation. There are already differences about UNITA's participation at the various levels of government and the reinstatement of state administration to every corner of Angola. UNITA also wants to rule in Benguela and Huambo Provinces. It also wants the Ministry of Public Works and the portfolios of deputy ministers of interior and finance. The government has already rejected this. UNITA has raised obstacles regarding the reinstatement of territorial administration. The two delegations agreed to deal with the issue tomorrow. Also being discussedf is the return of buildings owned by the two sides. The government and UNITA have agreed to return each other's buildings. The future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] is also being discussed, namely when will it stop being partisan. The government says Vorgan cannot continue broadcasting on short wave because it is against the law. UNITA says it is necessary that Vorgan continues on the air, but it says it will look into the matter.
