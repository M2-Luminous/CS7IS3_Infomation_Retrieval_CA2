[passage omitted] In regard to this incident, the Lebanese defense minister said that this was not an act only against the Phalangist Party but against Lebanon's security and tranquility as well. Almost all the parties, groups, and personalities who condemned the explosion agreed that this incident has threatened peace in Lebanon and could lead to a fresh round of clashes from which Lebanon had been free for some time. In 1975 after the Phalangists' attack on a bus carrying Palestinians in 'Ayn al-Rummanah region in Beirut, Lebanon became the scene of a civil war that lasted for 15 years. This war, which put the Phalangists on one side and Palestinian, national, and Islamic groups on the other, paved the way for Syrian and Israeli interventions in Lebanon, so much so that Israel attacked Lebanon several times and ultimately occupied part of southern Lebanon, which continues to be occupied by Israel and its allies. The Syrian forces which came to Lebanon as peacekeeping forces now control the pulse of the country's affairs, and the Lebanese Government is unable to make any decisions without their being confirmed and approved in Damascus. [passage omitted] The explosion at the Phalangist Party headquarters has given rise to the fear that the situation will once again change and that clashes will once again resume precisely at a time when all efforts are being aimed at preventing such clashes, since none of the parties or groups want to see the situation return to what it was before.
