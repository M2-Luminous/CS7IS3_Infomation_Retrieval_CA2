FBIS4-53102 "dreas095_i_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Cambodia Khmer Rouge on U.S. Ability To Save SRV `Puppets' Khmer Rouge on U.S. Ability To Save SRV `Puppets' BK1705053294 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia in Cambodian 2330 GMT 16 May 94 BK1705053294 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia Cambodian BFN [Text] It is reported that the United States has ordered Sar Kheng, the cheap lackey puppet of the communist Vietnamese, to go urgently to America. What is the purpose of the U.S. order? It is widely known that Sar Kheng is the arch traitor of the nation, the cheap lackey of the communist Vietnamese, and the most cruel and fascist agent of the communist Vietnamese. He is also part of the most corrupt and stinking clique. Sar Kheng is also a member of the communist party, a puppet of the communist Vietnamese, the head of the security forces, and a murderer who suppressed, arrested, and killed scores of Cambodian people for 15 years from 1979 to the present time. His crimes are extremely serious. As the communist Vietnamese's lackey, puppet, and instrument, he destroyed the Cambodian nation and people to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom, thereby eliminating the Cambodian race. How many Cambodian people have already been killed by the communist Vietnamese puppets Sar Kheng, Chea Sim, and Hun Sen and the communist Vietnamese? To what extent have those puppets allowed the communist Vietnamese to swallow Cambodia's terrestrial and maritime territory and islands? How many million ethnic Vietnamese have they allowed to flow into Cambodia? How far have they turned our Cambodian society upside down? How bad have the four or five million Vietnamese oppressed the Cambodian society and people? And how destructive have they plundered Cambodia's land, lakes, small and big rivers, fish, and forests? The entire Cambodian nation and people reject and condemn the communist Vietnamese lackeys because of their actions, which betray the nation, sell out the nation, and destroy the nation and people. Now they have fallen into the abyss of death. They are agonizing; their days are numbered. How far can the communist Vietnamese puppets survive with U.S. aid and arms supply? How can the puppets be saved when the U.S. ringleader and its alliance have not been able to rescue their own son [Ranariddh's party]? How can they save the rotten one-eyed (?puppet) of the communist Vietnamese when they are so rotten and stinking and have been opposed and condemned by the people? The communist Vietnamese have striven to cure the rotten puppets for 14 or 15 years, but in vain. They still remain decomposed and remain at death's door. The only effective treatment is to achieve national reconciliation, national unity, and genuine peace.
