German, Captain V. Velenteyenko, chief of a routine TECh [technical-maintenance unit] operations group of an air regiment, and Candidate of Technical Sciences Colonel (Reserve) A. Kaulis under the rubric "For IAS Specialists": "BUR in the Service of Diagnostics"] [Text] The design of modern aircraft engines (AD) is improved every year, and the amount of work to service them and the testing and check-out gear (KPA) employed grow more complex as well. But the number of specialists taking part in performing that work, as in the IAS [aviation engineering service] as a whole, is decreasing. How can the efficiency of monitoring the reliability of aircraft engines be increased under those conditions? A group of staff members at the ERAT NII [Scientific-Research Institute] of the Air Forces took up the solution of the problem. It is well known that improvements in operational monitoring of the parameters of aircraft engines occur in competition between two directions in their development--the creation of on-board (BASK) and ground (NASK) automated systems. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of BASK include high mobility, autonomous operation and promptness in application. Being located on the aircraft, however, these systems are limited in the amount of information they can monitor (both in the range of parameters and in the frequency of checking them) and have a quite rigid operating program that does not, as a rule keep pace with changes in the equipment of constantly upgraded aircraft. NASK are by and large devoid of these shortcomings, but appreciably reduce the mobility of the maintenance equipment and its autonomy, as well as requiring more--and more highly skilled--servicing personnel. Moreover, by duplicating a number of on-board systems they markedly increase the cost of the aviation system. Taking this into account, the attention of specialists turned to the well-known "black box"--an on-board recording device (BUR) that is used in contemporary aircraft and helicopters to record the parameters of the flight and the principal aircraft systems (including the engines). It is highly reliable, and has the ability to preserve information on several hours of aircraft systems operation that is acceptable for diagnostics through the measurement of deviations in the parameters. This information is used even today in the interests of determining the operability of the aircraft engines when preparing it for a repeat sortie. The use of BURs as a means of ground monitoring of the ADs, however, is hindered for two reasons. The first is that a BUR, as a consequence of its principal purpose, has a strictly limited range of engine parameters it monitors--the engines get from 7 to 15 percent of the information recording volume. The second reason is caused by its discrete nature; the values of each parameter are recorded at strictly defined time intervals that are typified by the frequency of polling, that is, the quantity of values recorded per unit time (per second, for example). The polling frequency of aircraft engine parameters used in series-produced BURs does not make it possible to obtain reliable information on the most diagnostically informative modes of its operation--transitional modes (for instance, the pickup or shedding of RPM) that last for only a few seconds in all. The efforts of the NII specialists V. Dolgopolov, K. Suponko, A. Poluektov, V. Semenin and L. Yevlakhov were aimed at solving just these problems. The key here was the fact that during the process of ground check-out of the engine parameters, most of the remaining aircraft systems--information on which is fed to the BUR--are not being monitored and, consequently, the recording channels for their parameters are temporarily not in use. This in fact determined the later actions of the innovators--to create a relatively simple and small piece of ground equipment that would make it possible to switch over the "idle" channels to the engine. The amount of information received from it increased by 10--12 times, thanks to the increased polling frequency of the standard parameters and the opportunity to monitor other parameters of the ADs through the installation of additional sensors on board the aircraft. The gear, in interaction with the BUR units and the AL-31F aircraft engine electrical regulator, constitutes the system of ground monitoring of aircraft and engine parameters (SNK-SD). A diagram is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Diagram of the SNK-SD ground monitoring system The on-board part of the system consists of a unit for formulating and coding the information of the BUR (1), the BUR information storage (2) and the AD electronic regulator (3). It is intended for the receipt of primary information on the parameters that are usually recorded by the on-board equipment and the parameters--new in relation to them--of the electronic engine regulator, electrical feed of the SNK-SD from on-board sources, conversion of analog information to digital and storage of all of the data obtained with the aid of the SNK-SD in the BUR storage unit. The ground portion of the system includes a switching unit (4), a control panel (5), and an arm with additional sensors (6) intended for the formation of high-polling (frequency of 12--16 Hz) channels for the recording of parameters, varying their selection and monitoring their progression to the BUR storage unit in real time and the receipt of primary information on the engine parameters being measured by the additional sensors. The locations for connecting the SNK-SD on the aircraft are: the BUR--the input of the standard monitored parameters to the unit for the formulation and coding of the information (pos. A); the electronic AD regulator--the control plugs of the regulator used in servicing to hook up the KPA (pos. B); and, the control points for the measurement of additional parameters of the engine via the installation of sensors at them from the SNK-SD kit (pos. C). The information from the on-board sensors, electronic engine regulator and the sensors from the SNK-SD kit goes to the switching unit, where it is distributed in accordance with the settings of the switches on the control panel among the channels with a high polling frequency and transmitted to the input of the BUR formulation and coding unit, where the analog signals are converted to digital. The information is copied from the storage unit to standard media (BK-2 magnetic-tape cassettes) after the engine is disconnected, for subsequent processing in Luch or Mayak type ground processing devices (NUO) using specially developed control programs. An external view of the ground units of the system and the places to connect them to the aircraft is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Composition of the SNK-SD system The SNK-SD combines the advantages of both directions in the development of engine monitoring equipment, and makes it possible to avoid the appearance of cumbersome and expensive KPA in servicing that requires an increase in the number of organic service personnel and increases labor expenditures for operation. It has a high degree of standardization, since one and the same ground unit of this system, differing only in the soldering of the electrical connections, is needed to monitor different aircraft that have the same type of BUR. The SNK-SD, utilizing standard ground processing devices, also provides for a uniform ideology for monitoring the status of the aircraft hardware. Since the final information in the BUR buffer is in digital form, the use of personal computers to process it in real time is possible in the future, thereby eliminating the principal inconvenience of the "black box"--the lack of results at the time of monitoring, and the need for subsequent processing of the data. Experimental check-out of the SNK-SD in several air units showed that this system increases the efficiency of monitoring, both when it is used in the squadron in the process of making flights or in the performance of technical maintenance operations requiring the testing of the AD, as well as in TECh units in routine maintenance or repair operations. The following variations for its utilization were the most expedient: --operational monitoring, when performing flights, to look for failures that arose in a prior sortie, as well as to evaluate the technical state of the engines under the conditions of an air squadron without activating the standard KPA. Only the switching unit and control panel are used from the ground portion of the SNK-SD therein. The additional sensors are installed only if necessary and, as a rule, no more than two. The time to install and connect the SNK-SD is less than ten minutes; --the deeper monitoring of the technical state of the engines in the process of performing routine maintenance operations, as well as operations to prolong the service life of the engines and find and eliminate failures. The sensors from the SNK-SD kit are installed during the ground testing. The time expenditures to install the SNK-SD on board the aircraft are compensated for by the substantial increase in the extent of the monitoring and, in a case of finding and eliminating failures in the ADs, by the determination of the causes for the disruption in operability with precision down to the replaceable part, unit or assembly. The operational check-out of the developed system revealed yet another important merit--documentation of the results of the monitoring, which none of the ground engine monitoring panels traditionally employed as KPA possesses. Here is an example of the use of the SNK-SD. The afterburner mode of operation of one of the engines did not come on in advanced aerobatic maneuvers by an Su-27 aircraft, as a result of which the pilot was forced to curtail the performance of the assignment. Check-outs performed on the ground of the stability of these modes using the standard KPA brought no clarity--the afterburner chamber ignited in all of the ground tests, which gave grounds to doubt the reliability of the primary information on the failure of the afterburner in flight. Then the SNK-SD system was connected to the aircraft in the variation of deeper monitoring of the technical state of the engine, with five additional sensors installed on board to check the fuel pressure in the automatic engine control system (in the area pertaining to the feed of fuel to the afterburner chamber). The specialists were convinced, after a ten-minute testing of the engine with the afterburners turned on four times and decoding of the results obtained on a LUCh type NUO, that the fuel pressure in one of the assemblies of the afterburner loop that supported the ignition of the afterburner chamber was below the stipulated limit. This did not lead to engine failure when the afterburners were turned on under ground conditions, but under the conditions of the evolution of the aircraft when performing advanced aerobatic maneuvers it was the reason for the failure of the afterburner to come on. The "heart" of the Su-27 operated reliably in flight after the replacement of the assembly. The experience in the use of the system shows convincingly that the SNK-SD makes it possible, during one period of engine testing, to establish the cause of a disruption in its operability and make decisions regarding ways of eliminating the failure and its further operation. The preparation and production of a series-produced lot of these systems for conducting tests in the field is currently underway. Techniques are being developed to utilize the SNK-SD in order to support the servicing of aircraft engines according to their technical state. One would like to believe that all of this will help the specialists of the IAS make a worthy contribution to increasing the safety of flights and maintaining a high level of combat readiness of the aircraft hardware.
