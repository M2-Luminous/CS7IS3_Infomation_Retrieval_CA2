These leaflets contain instructions and calls to the Iraqi people and Army to rebel against tyrant Saddam's regime and to cut off the road before the cliques of terrorism and crime that want to destroy Iraq and humiliate its people through starvation and oppression. This was revealed by our sources in south Iraq in a report in which they said that groups of Islamic Resistance men distributed revolutionary leaflets in the city of al-Basrah and the district of al-Qurnah. The sources added that the biggest drop took place at the end of last week. It included the district of al-Majarr al-Kabir, Qal'at Salih, al-Maymunah, the city of al-'Amarah, and the subdistricts of al-Salam and Nahr 'Udayl, which belong to the governorate of al-'Amarah. The antiregime leaflets were also distributed in the districts of (al-Mudaynah), al-Qurnah, and al-Dayr, the subdistricts of al-'Uzayr, (Salhah), and al-Huwayr, and the city of al-Basrah, all of which belong to al-Basrah Governorate. Our sources affirmed that the distribution has caused a big uproar among the regime's circles. It has forced it to place its forces on alert and carry out large-scale search operations in these areas and arrest citizens.
