The most widespread narcotics in Lithuania are drugs made of poppy. Last year, the police confiscated 963 kilograms of ground poppy heads but only 4.5 grams of marijuana and 1.7 grams of hashish. These figures do not reflect the actual situation in Lithuania either, experts say. Drug smugglers are detained by Lithuanian border officials on extremely rare occasions. The police catches drug peddlers only during special operations. 41 citizens of Russia, 10 Azerbaijanians, 6 Ukrainians, 4 Georgians and 4 Uzbeks were caught attempting to sell drugs in Lithuania last year. The RESPUBLIKA newspaper said citizens of Great Britain and Denmark were detained for attempting to smuggle drugs. Opium has become a quite frequent narcotic in Lithuania lately. Police officials suppose that pure opium started coming in quite recently. As a rule, opium is delivered from Uzbekistan through Belarusian territory. Lithuanian authorities confiscated 633 grams of pure opium last year and already a kilogram this year. According to police reports, at least 10 criminal gangs produced and distributed drugs in Lithuania until recently. Part of these gangs were eliminated with the application of the law on preventive detention.
