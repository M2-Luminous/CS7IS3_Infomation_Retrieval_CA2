Sato, Casio Computer Devices Main Operations Division, LCD Development Department] [Text] Practical Application of Multi-Color Images By Utilizing Double Refraction New reflective-type color liquid crystal panels have been developed by utilizing the double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates. (The anisotropy of the refraction index is known as double refractivity. For example, when the refraction index in direction of the apse line of liquid crystal molecules is large, the refraction index perpendicular to that axis is small. The double refraction index is the difference between both refraction indices.) These panels will be manufactured in the spring of 1994. A bright image can be obtained with the reflective type even on portions without a color filter. The panels are broadly divided into two types, the TN (twisted nematic) liquid crystal type and the STN (super twisted nematic) liquid crystal type. The colors in the TN liquid crystal type are fixed, as either background or image colors. In the STN liquid crystal type, the red, green, blue and gray within one dot can be arbitrarily changed. At the present time a 1/160 duty matrix image is possible. More than 20 years have passed since liquid crystal panels, which are thin, lightweight, and energy efficient, have been put to practical use. Now, these panels are building a solid position as key devices for electronic products. The field of applications is beginning to spread in a number of directions, and the capabilities required of liquid crystal panels is varied as well. However, the color liquid crystal panels currently in use, which have internal backlighting, are not always energy efficient. Demands for reduced power consumption are increasing, especially in the fields of OA (office automation), AV (audio-visual), and communications; if this demand can be met, market share would increase dramatically. The plans for the reflective-type color liquid crystal panels that were recently developed lead us to believe that this is the most likely technology to meet that demand. Utilizing Double Refraction of Both Liquid Crystal and Phase-Contrast Plate Double refractivity of both liquid crystal molecules and phase-contrast plates are utilized for colorizing. Phase-contrast plates, which until now were used with "color off" for optical coloration, are instead used with "color on." The coloration methods for liquid crystal panels can be broadly divided into methods utilizing spectral properties and methods utilizing double refractivity (Figure 1). <graphic> <capt> Figure 1. Liquid Crystal Panel Coloration Methods. Now, the double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates are utilized. Color filters are a general method, but because the transmissivity of light is reduced 40 percent, it must be a transmitting method that uses a backlight.</graphic> Methods utilizing spectral properties use color filters, color polarizing plates, and guest-host type liquid crystals. The general color filter method most often used at the present time is a transmission method with an internal backlight. However, the transmissivity of the color filter is reduced 40 percent, and the image darkens by half because the light path is doubled by the reflection method. Ways that ensure brightness even with the reflection method are color polarizing plates in which the polarizing plates are colored, and guest-host liquid crystals, but then the image colors must be fixed as a single color when plans are drawn up. Methods utilizing double refractivity include using the double refractivity of only the liquid crystals, and using the double refractivity of both liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates at the same time. It is possible to colorize only by using the double refractivity of the liquid crystals,[.sup]1[/] but the image hue relies heavily on temperature and cell thickness. (Colors can be divided into three attributes; the color divisions red, green and blue are known as hue. In addition, color brightness (y value) is known as the color value, while vividness is known as chroma. Furthermore, color is expressed in terms of hue and chroma as two-dimensional coordinates.) If used together with the double refraction index of phase-contrast plates, this reliance is cut by half. From now on this combined method will be employed. Changing Colors With the Phase Value of Phase-Contrast Plates The phenomenon of colorizing by using the double refractivity of light can be explained by polarization of light and light's phase difference.[.sup]2[/] Light is polarized in a straight line when it passes through a polarizing plate, and as the double refraction index increases perpendicular to the polarized axis due to the double refraction effect in the phase-contrast plate, it is polarized in an ellipse. The double refraction effect is greatest when the delayed phase axis of the phase-contrast plate is inclined 45� toward the direction of polarization (Figure 2). (Footnote 3. Phase-contrast plates and liquid crystals have similar anisotropy of the refraction indices. When the refraction index of phase contrast plates during processing is large in the direction of elongation, the surface refraction index perpendicular to that direction is small. The axis in the direction where the refraction index is large is known as the delayed phase axis.) <graphic> <capt> Figure 2. Two Ways to Consider the Relationship Between the Phase-Contrast Plate and the Polarizing Plate. In ordinary TN liquid crystals, "on" approximates a parallel configuration (a) on the polarizing plate, and "off" approximates a perpendicular configuration.</graphic> In response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast plate, the degree of polarization differs depending on the wavelength of the light, and the polarized light that constitutes the transmission axis emerges as a result. Colors can be selected; for example, blue when the phase difference nears 650 nm, and orange when it nears 880 nm (Figure 3). <graphic> <capt> Figure 3. Phase Differences and Light Intensity Depending On Differences in Wavelength. Each color can be selected by changing the phase difference of the phase-contrast plate. In response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast plate, the degree of polarization differs depending on the wavelength of the light, and as a result, the polarized light that constitutes the transmission axis emerges.</graphic> The light intensity I[.sub]par[/] that returns to its origin when two polarizing plates are parallel is proportional to the square of the value of the elliptic polarized light amplitude projected on the transmission axis. [`par' is parallel; `per' is perpendicular] I[.sub]par[/] = 1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*cos[.sup]2[/](�R[.sub]e[/]/_l_) (1) Here, I[.sub]0[/] is the intensity of the incident light, R[.sub]e[/] is the phase difference of the phase-contrast plate, and _l_ is the light wavelength. In contrast, the phase of I[.sub]per[/] in which the two polarizing plates are perpendicular, shifts 90� relative to I[.sub]par[/]. /m/m/mI[.sub]per[/] = 1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*sin[.sup]2[/](�R[.sub]e[/]/_l_) (2) From these equations, I[.sub]0[/][.sup]2[/] = I[.sub]per[/][.sup]2[/]+I[.sub]par[/][.sup]2[/] can be derived, and because I[.sub]0[/] is specified as the white light intensity, the colors expressed by I[.sub]par[/] and I[.sub]per[/] are complementary. For example, when "on" and "off" have this kind of complementary color relationship when colorized using liquid crystals, the color combinations are immutably determined. Liquid crystal panels are now colorized by utilizing the double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates together. The transmission axis of two polarizing plates are set parallel, and the delayed phase axis of the phase-contrast plate is configured to be at a 45� angle to the transmission axis of the polarizing plates[.sup]3[/] (Figure 4). <graphic> <capt> Figure 4. Configuration of the Recently Developed Reflecting-Type TN Color Panel. Various colors can be shown by changing factors such as liquid crystal cell thickness and liquid crystal double refraction.</graphic> In this case, light intensity I is the value that optically combines the effects due to the double refraction index of both the liquid crystals and the phase-contrast plate. I = 1/2I[.sub]0[/][1/(1+u[.sup]2[/])*sin[.sup]2[/] (�(1+u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2)/ *(cos(�R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_) + u*sin(�R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_}[.sup]2[/] +cos[.sup]2[/](�(1=u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2 *sin[.sup]2[/](�R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_] (3) Here, u = 2_D_n*d/_l_, with _D_n representing the double refractivity of the liquid crystal and d representing the liquid crystal cell thickness. The usual TN liquid crystal mode is a specific solution to the above equation. That is, rotary polarization in which the incident light is twisted 90� occurs under conditions in which u = 0 when on or u = 3[.sup]0.5[/] or 15[.sup]0.5[/] when off. As a result, contrast and brightness with a black-and-white image are best with one phase-contrast plate. With these conditions, a mutually complementary color relationship comes about when the voltage given to the liquid crystal is on and off. Therefore, even when color is added using the phase-contrast plates, the background color and display color are determined and unchangeable. More color schemes are possible by selecting cell thickness and double refractivity of the liquid crystal materials and changing u. If u is moved by using a particular phase-contrast plate, a locus is drawn while the chromaticity of the color displayed changes as a result of double refraction. If we let two points on the locus be the liquid crystal's on and off conditions, then it is possible to arbitrarily select background and display colors. Furthermore, there is only one phase-contrast plate now being used, but it is larger than two plates with different phase values; by staggering the delayed phase axes, the number of color schemes increases and a brighter display can be obtained. This is because a solution is obtained that brings the polarized light axis for each color nearer to the transmission axis as the change in double refraction becomes larger. This tendency increases as the phase-contrast plates increase in number, but because this is balanced by a reduction in transmissivity, two or three plates are appropriate. Therefore the value of y becomes four to six, which is considered sufficient for practical use. Ultimately, the goal is to realize 10 ordinary STN monochrome liquid crystals; a breakthrough is needed. Controlling Voltage of Color Using STN Liquid Crystals A wide range of colors can be displayed by substituting STN liquid crystals, which have large double refraction effects. Therefore, differences in color can be controlled by means of the voltage value applied to the liquid crystals. The arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules changes depending on the voltage value, and the light intensity distribution for the colors differs depending on the differences of the respective indices of double refraction (Figures 5 and 6). <graphic> <capt> Figure 5. Changes in Liquid Crystal Molecular Motion and Polarized Light Conditions Depending on Size of Voltage of Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panels. Voltage increases towards the right. The arrangement of liquid crystal molecules increases as the value of the voltage increases (a). Consequently, the double refraction effect decreases, and the intensity of light differs depending on wavelength. Light intensity is proportional to the square of the length of the polarized light ellipse projected on the transmission axis.</graphic> <graphic> <capt> Figure 6. Voltage Magnitude and Intensity for the Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. Light intensity of each color differs depending on the magnitude of the voltage applied to the liquid crystals. When voltage is lowered, the order is blue, green and red.</graphic> In other words, changes in gradation with ordinary STN monochrome liquid crystals are manifested as color changes. Consequently, a multicolor display comes about because each respective color cannot be further divided into gradations and displayed. Blue, green, and red can be displayed with the liquid crystal panels. These correspond to 0 grade, 3 grade, and 7 grade respectively with ordinary monochrome liquid crystals (Figure 7). <graphic> <capt> Figure 7. Color Display Characteristics of the Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. By using pulse width modulation, ordinary differences in gradation become different colors. Blue corresponds to 0 grade, green to 3 grade, and red to 7 grade. The value of y which indicates brightness ranges from 2.1 to 3.5.</graphic> The magnitude of the voltage is changed by means of a multiplexing drive using a pulse width modulation formula. The value of y which indicates brightness ranges from 2 to 3. In principle, the power consumed is identical to that of the STN monochrome liquid crystal currently in use, and the cost is also the same. In addition, an active matrix drive that combines TFT (thin-film transistor) elements for high speed is theoretically possible, and development is currently underway. To complete the product line, preparations are being made for six types of reflective-type color panels in spring 1994, up to 1/160 duty dot matrix displays (Table 1). Issues related to higher duties exceeding 1/160 include improving the angle of twist, and reducing _D_ _e_/_e_[.sub]per[/] and K[.sub]33[/]/K[.sub]11[/] for the liquid crystals. And recently, liquid crystal panels using thin, lightweight plastic substrates are attracting attention. If the functions of the phase-contrast plates can be maintained with these materials, reflecting-type plastic color liquid crystal panels could be a reality. Table 1.
