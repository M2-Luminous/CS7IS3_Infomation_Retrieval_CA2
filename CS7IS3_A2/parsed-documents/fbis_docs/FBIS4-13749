It has not learned from the lessons of the past despite their hardness and it does not want to learn from the lessons of today despite their facts that cannot be bypassed. Following this regime's failure in its feverish attempts to break its isolation in the world and to affect the convictions of the international community, which are strengthened by past evidence and current practices; and now that this regime's procrastination -- designed to evade full compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy -- has been exposed, this regime is trying, through its tools and lackeys, to undermine Kuwaiti national unity by jumping over facts and claiming that it wants to discuss "all unresolved matters" with the Kuwaiti National Assembly. We firmly believe the attempt made by the speaker of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly does not deviate from Iraq's deception and lies. This attempt shows Iraqi arrogance and insistence on disavowing Kuwaiti legitimacy, separating the state from its constitutional institutions, and bypassing the legitimate government representing people's sovereignty over their land. It is a stupid and mean booby trap aimed at blackmailing national feelings regarding the issue of prisoners. Proceeding from its ignorance and failure to understand the lessons of the past, the Iraqi regime believes it can drive a wedge in national ranks pained by the ordeal of the prisoners in Baghdad jails. The Iraqi regime has forgotten, or pretended to forget, that Kuwaiti national unity was the rock that shattered the evil ambitions of aggression. Had the Iraqi regime an iota of awareness or sense it would have opted for the one clear road in order to emerge from the swamp of humiliation, siege, and isolation. It is the road of international legitimacy's resolutions, full, and frank recognition of the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait over its territory, straightforward recognition of the international borders demarcated by a neutral international committee, immediate release of prisoners, and readiness to pay compensation to all those who were harmed by the criminal aggression. This is the only way.
