Mr. Mbeki was speaking at the swearing-in of the 20 members of the council in Pretoria this morning. Addressing the members at the Old Raadsaal at Church Square, he said a volkstaat and self-determination should be given attention under the guidelines of a democratic South Africa. He commended the leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, for drawing right-wing Afrikaners towards the constitutional process. General Viljoen said the changes that had taken place in South Africa were only the first step. He said it was in the interests of the country that the needs of the Afrikaner were rapidly identified. General Viljoen said Afrikaners would have to realize that they would not be able to live totally separate from the country because South Africa had an integrated economy. Mr. Johann Wingaard was elected chairman of the Volkstaat Council.
