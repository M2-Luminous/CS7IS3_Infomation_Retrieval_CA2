FR940622-1-00023 FR940622-1-00009 4. NOAA has suggested that where multiple factors may have contributed to the injury, the injury be viewed as ``resulting from'' the discharge or incident if the discharge, or incident was a factor contributing to the injury. Should this view of the ``contributing factor'' test be included in either ``acceptance criteria'' or a definition of ``injury'' or some other appropriate place in the regulations? Compensation Formulas The proposed rule is designed to provide a new simple and cost-effective damage assessment procedure for small discharges_compensation formulas for both estuarine/marine and inland waters. The proposed compensation formulas would be applicable to the vast majority of oil discharges and for a wide range of the most commonly discharged oil products. An analysis of reported coastal discharges of oil shows that 99.8% of the discharges were less than 50,000 gallons and 99% were less than 10,000 gallons. Compensation formulas would be used for most of these relatively small discharges. These formulas provide an estimate of damages per gallon taking into account average restoration costs, plus average lost direct use values pending restoration. For various reasons, passive use values are not included in these formulas at this time. The damages calculated with the formulas vary with the amount and type of oil discharged and region and habitat type in which the discharge occurs. This approach allows both national consistency and regional specificity. By comparing the habitat of the actual discharge with the geographical province and specific habitat used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario. The simplified damage assessment procedures produce calculations based on statistical averages and are designed to reasonably reflect the damages of the actual injury in a timely and economical manner. However, any time a simplified assessment is used, it is unlikely that the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will be represented. Although the damage calculation is designed to be correct on average, in some cases, the formula will over-state or under-state the damages. In cases where the circumstances of an actual discharge are determined to be well beyond the parameters of the compensation formula, the trustee should consider the use of another assessment procedure. Summary of Comment There was a wide range of comment on NOAA's proposed use of the compensation formulas for spills of less than 50,000 gallons. The comments ranged from NOAA's lack of statutory authority to use such formulas to the notion that the compensation formulas are a ``black box used to club the RP'' into settlement. Other participants focused on the predictability the compensation formulas will bring to the process of assessing smaller spills and the cost effectiveness of using the formulas for locations where access is difficult. One participant noted that it was unreasonable for NOAA to rely on formulaic averages when the state of science is insufficient to develop predictive models. Several suggestions were made at the workshops. It was recommended that NOAA provide guidance or criteria for proceeding from pre-assessment to the assessment phase, as well as guidance for the use of the compensation formulas. In particular, it was suggested that NOAA provide guidance on when the formula should be used and when the Type A model should be used, as sometimes the Type A model resulted in lower damages than the formulas. It was also suggested that NOAA develop a set of appropriate, ``off-the-shelf'' studies for the trustees to use in small spills to confirm actual injury. One commenter stated that the formulas resulted in extraordinarily high per gallon damage figures for certain hypothetical spills. It was suggested that these worst case scenarios were damaging NOAA's credibility and would affect industry's view of the simplified procedures generally. To address this problem, the commenter recommended NOAA develop a ceiling or cap for dollars per gallon spilled. Questions were received as to how the various state formulas and NOAA's proposed formulas would compare or work together, and what to do when a complex assessment results in lower damages than the formulas or the Type A model. Lastly, some comments and questions were posed as to when and how the compensation formulas could be attacked in litigation. Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 1. The proposed compensation formulas are based upon various representative province/habitat combinations. Since the compensation formulas are based upon averages, it is impossible to include all known coastal habitats and every combination of discharges. By comparing the habitat of the actual discharge with the province and specific habitat used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario. However, any time a simplified assessment is used, the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will only be approximated. Although there is no direct statutory language calling for this form of assessment procedure, NOAA recognized the need for such a procedure. NOAA emphasizes that the primary advantages of a compensation formula are simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Are the values of simplicity and cost-effectiveness in the compensation formulas outweighed by their inherent technical limitations? 2. The compensation formulas were developed after extensive review of the scientific and economic literature, with particular emphasis on restoration of various habitat types. This information was then compiled to be used with both the current Type A model for Coastal and Marine Environments and a draft version of the Type A model under development for the Great Lakes Environments, which provide the basis for the compensation formulas. Was this procedure for developing the formulas appropriate and reasonable?
