FR940817-2-00280 FR940817-2-00114 Preface Pursuant to the authority contained in section 708 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158) (Section 708), the Administrator, after consultation with representatives of ocean carriers providing intermodal shipping services/systems and with representatives of companies which lease containers, chassis and other intermodal equipment, has developed this standby agreement for voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems needed to meet national defense requirements. USTRANSCOM procures commercial shipping capacity to meet normal peacetime requirements for ships and intermodal shipping services/systems through arrangements with common carriers (including services contracts), with contract carriers and by charter. DOD, through USTRANSCOM, maintains and operates a fleet of ships owned by or under charter to the Federal government, in sufficient numbers to meet those logistic needs of the military services which cannot be met by commercial service. Ships of the RRF may be selectively activated for peacetime military tests and exercises, and to satisfy military surge operational requirements which cannot be met by commercial shipping in time of war, national emergency, or military contingency. Foreign-flag shipping may be used if no U.S.-flag ships can meet the operational requirement. Through advance arrangements in joint planning described in IX. of this Agreement, it is intended that Participants will provide capacity to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo and intermodal equipment emergencies. In time of war or national emergency, ships may be requisitioned under authority of section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242) (Section 902). In some military contingency operations, more shipping capacity and related services may be required than are available under peacetime arrangements, but general mobilization of shipping by requisition may not be appropriate. This Agreement provides for the voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems in such a way as to distribute the burden of such contributions in proportion to the capacity owned and controlled by each Participant. This Agreement will provide DOD with access to privately-owned intermodal shipping services/systems, will provide door-to-door intermodal capacity, will create a pool of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment needed in support of national defense activities and will provide Participants a defense to civil and criminal action for violation of antitrust laws in carrying out this Agreement. This Agreement establishes the terms, conditions and general procedures under which each Participant agrees voluntarily to make intermodal shipping services/systems available at the request of the Administrator. This Agreement is designed to create close working relationships among the Administrator, USTRANSCOM and Participants through which military needs and the needs of the civil economy can be met by cooperative action. Participants are allowed maximum flexibility to adjust commercial operations by cooperation, rationalization of services and pooling of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment, Provided, such measures are approved, in advance, by the Administrator. The shipping capacity made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by ships requisitioned, under Section 902, from non-Participants in this Agreement and from Participants. The containers and chassis made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by services and equipment accessed by the Administrator through the provisions of 46 CFR Part 340. The SecDef will be asked to concur in this Agreement at the appropriate stage. SecDef will be asked to approve this Agreement as a sealift readiness program for the purpose of section 909 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1248) (Section 909). Withdrawal from or termination of participation in this Agreement does not excuse a Participant from Section 909 or any other provision of law if said withdrawn or terminated Participant is otherwise subject thereto. The Director, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman, has concurred in this Agreement. Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement I. Purpose This Agreement establishes procedures for the contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems to satisfy DOD needs. This Agreement will change from standby to active status upon a joint determination by the Secretary and SecDef that a dry cargo shipping capacity emergency or an intermodal equipment emergency affecting the national defense exists; that the defense requirement cannot be met by voluntary arrangements other than this Agreement; and that the requirement can be met more efficiently by activating this Agreement than by requisitioning ships under Section 902. This Agreement includes all intermodal shipping services/systems and all intermodal ship types, including container, partial container, container/bulk, container/roll-on/roll-off, roll-on/roll-off and barge carrier (LASH, SeaBee, etc.). Breakbulk ships may be enrolled in this Agreement at the discretion of the Administrator. When consideration is being given to diverting intermodal shipping services/systems from commercial to defense use, an ocean carrier's entire contribution will be considered. The object of this Agreement is to promote and facilitate the use of entire intermodal transportation systems and to maximize DOD's use of commercial transportation resources while at the same time attempting to minimize disruption to commercial operations. The Agreement does, however, provide for the utilization of components of such systems (e.g., particular ship types) as necessary. Through advanced arrangements developed during peacetime joint planning described in section IX of this Agreement, it is intended that Participants will provide capability to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo intermodal equipment emergencies.
