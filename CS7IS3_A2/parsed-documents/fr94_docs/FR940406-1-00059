FR940406-1-00059 FR940406-1-00016 48 CFR Parts 28 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;14] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Insurance_Liability to Third Persons AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to delete the prescriptive language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), particularly at ``Solicitation provision and contract clause on liability insurance under cost-reimbursement contracts''. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;14 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Edward Loeb at (202) 501&hyph;4547 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;14. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The FAR language proposed for deletion at 28.311&hyph;1 applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research and development awarded to state agencies or charitable institutions that claim partial or total immunity from tort liability. For these entities, Alternates I and II of 52.228&hyph;7, Insurance_Liability to Third Persons, limit the contract's insurance requirements and the Government's obligation to indemnify for third party liability. The Councils believe that the current language is obsolete. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the language proposed for deletion applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research and development that are awarded to entities which, by virtue of their status as either an agency of the state or as a charitable institution, claim partial or total immunity from tort liability under such contracts. These entities are believed to be few in number. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;14), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
