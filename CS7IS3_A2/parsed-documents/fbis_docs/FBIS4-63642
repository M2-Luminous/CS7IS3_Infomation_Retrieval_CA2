Republic of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev took part in its work. After opening the meeting, Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the republic, reported that discussion of the drafts of the Laws of the Azerbaijan Republic "On the Commodity Exchange" and "On Veterinary Science," and also the question of the 1994 budget of the Republic of Azerbaijan had been envisioned. However, taking into account various rumors and conjectures that were being circulated in the republic after the signing of the Bishkek Protocol, and also the appeal of a group of deputies, the head of parliament asked the members of the National Assembly to express their opinion on the advisability of including this question on the meeting agenda. According to the speaker, some circles, inciting passions regarding the Bishkek Protocol, are pursuing specific objectives and attempting to exploit this as a means of attaining power. Rasul Guliyev repeated once again that the protocol was in the nature of a recommendation. The opinions of the deputies were divided concerning the need to include the issue of the Bishkek Protocol on the agenda and to discuss it at length. Afiyaddin Dzhallilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic, who spoke at the meeting and headed the Azerbaijani delegation at the Bishkek meeting, presented information on the work that had been accomplished in the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Jurists Murtuz Aleskerov and Safa Mirzoyev expressed their views on the Bishkek Protocol. On the suggestion of Rasul Guliyev, members of the National Assembly expressed their position on placing the issue of the Bishkek Protocol on the agenda. Nineteen deputies voted "for," 19 -- "against," and two abstained. Thus, this issue was not placed on the agenda of the parliament meeting. After a recess, some of the members of the National Assembly once again raised the issue, which aroused a heated discussion. Shadman Guseynov read out a statement on behalf of members of the National Assembly who came out with a proposal to include this issue on the agenda. After this, 13 members of the National Assembly walked out of the meeting hall. It was proposed to continue the meeting and to express a position with respect to the actions of the people's deputies who had walked out of the hall. After a short recess, the National Assembly adopted a reply statement in which it condemned the actions of the people's deputies who had walked out of the meeting hall. With this, the regular meeting of the National Assembly concluded its work.
