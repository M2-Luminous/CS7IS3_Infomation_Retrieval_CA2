A responsible source told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the coming phase will witness further measures to bolster the value of the Iraqi dinar in the market and ensure that the speculators and parasites who have caused the rise in the dollar exchange rates are wiped out. The source said that citizens are allowed to own dollars provided the buying and selling of dollars is confined to money changing offices and the al-Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks in order to facilitate the process of money changing and protect the citizens against speculators. He noted that the State has allowed citizens to bring in any amount of foreign currency and that it has given them the opportunity to buy it from, or sell it to, designated parties, or, alternatively, it has given them the chance to invest it in the country. The banking source said that the dollar exchange rate has nothing to do with Western media lies and rumors, which are circulated by the mean speculators in the local markets. Yesterday, the dollar exchange rate was fixed at companies authorized to sell or buy currencies and at the branches of the al- Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks. Al-Rashid Bank has designated six branches in Baghdad and the governorates to buy and sell foreign currency in accordance with the exchange rate and as of 5 February. These branches are: al-Shurjah, Jamilah, al-Sa'dun, and al-Mansur central market, as well as in the Ninawa and al-Basrah Governorates. The Central Bank has also authorized al-Rafidayn Bank branches in al-Harithiyah, Karradat Mariyam, and al-Kifah, and its main branch, as well as the Bank's branches in al-Basrah and Ninawa to begin the buying and selling operation as of 5 February.
