Kelbadzhar is still being controlled by Armenians in spite of their heavy losses in recent combat operations. The ministry experts associate the desperate attempts of the Armenian troops to keep control over Kelbadzhar with the existence of gold mines in the region. According to the source, "in the past few days the enemy has brought into action even badly trained recruits" in a bid to hold the positions. The Azeri military say that as a result of their latest military success, the Armenian troops near the town of Agderi were cut off from supplies from Armenia. On Monday Azeri troops surrounded and completely destroyed a group of 240 Armenian servicemen who tried to penetrate the combat zone from Armenia, the source added.
