Ruckauf said that "the report's contents are not worse than other countries and above average for Latin America" since the document "describes the progress attained from pre-existing situations." Ruckauf's cautious tone contrasted that of Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who told CLARIN that the report "is totally unjustified." The different tones used by Ruckauf and Di Tella on the same subject are due to their different cabinet functions. While Di Tella is concerned over the possible influence the report might have in our relations with the United States, Ruckauf is the official who has had to look after the cases described in the document, like the attacks against journalists Marcelo Bonelli and Hernan Lopez Echague. Besides, he deals directly with the police in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Cordoba Provinces, which are directly questioned by the Clinton administration. Thus Ruckauf maintained that there is a tendency "since the years of the dictatorships for the security organizations to overlook the legal norms," but he added: "This has diminished since the return of democracy and there increasingly is more freedom and democracy year by year." [passage omitted] Although the U.S. report emphasizes the government's respect for human rights, Minister Ruckauf preferred to speak about Argentine society. He said: "In any society there are problems with the institutions' functioning, especially in a society like ours that has 10 years of democratic life and where there still are many authoritarian components." Ruckauf said: "I am 49 and I cannot remember living in times of freedom like the present. I do not think there is any kind of action that has worsened any of the situations linked to security in the country." Meanwhile, in Tunis, an hour after meeting with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, Di Tella said via telephone that "this does not affect in the least" relations between Argentina and the United States, nor Argentina's image with the First World, which seems to be an obsession for the Argentine Government. What is your opinion of the U.S. document, CLARIN asked Di Tella. "It is totally unjustified. For example, freedom of the press is totally respected; it is incredibly respected, I would say. Just read the newspapers every day and see the criticisms we must bear." Don't you think the report mentions some known subjects like the government's alleged influence in the Judicial Branch, CLARIN asked. "I think the institutions are working more than well. Of course nothing is perfect and everything can be improved," Di Tella said. Di Tella added that these kinds of reports are "routine declarations by the U.S. Executive Branch every year. This is not the general U.S. opinion, according to the high-level meetings I have held. For example, last week I met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and he did not tell me anything about this." For Di Tella, "those who prepare this kind of report are second-rank officials who base themselves on extreme situations and adopt absolute positions."
