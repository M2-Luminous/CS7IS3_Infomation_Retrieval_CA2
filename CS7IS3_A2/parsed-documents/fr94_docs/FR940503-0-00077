FR940503-0-00077 FR940503-0-00022 Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the interim rule is directed to owners of multifamily housing projects, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the order. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being within the meaning of the order. This interim rule implements the system of preferences authorized by subtitle D of title VI of the 1992 HCD Act, which provides that owners of certain section 8 covered projects that were originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., families whose heads, spouses or sole members are 62 years or older) may elect to give preference in occupancy to vacant units in the project to elderly families. Although subtitle D provides for preferences for elderly families in projects meeting the conditions established by subtitle D, subtitle D also requires that owners of such projects must reserve no less than a minimum number of units in these projects for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. The minimum number is determined in accordance with the formula established by statute. Since the subtitle D preference system provides a primary preference for elderly families, and a secondary preference for disabled families who are near-elderly, there is the possibility that this statutory system of preferences would limit the availability of certain section 8 housing for: (1) Disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly (if an owner gives preference to elderly families for units), and (2) such families with children, and thus adversely impact the maintenance and well-being of these families. (Although owners can apply the same preferences and reservation of units to families with children as to families without children, owners cannot restrict admission to any units solely because of familial status as long as the family qualifies for the unit on the basis of the relevant age or disability criterion for admission.) The Department believes that the number of projects that would be eligible for the preferences provided by subtitle D is limited, and thus, the impact on family maintenance and well being would not be significant within the meaning of the order. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This interim rule reflects a system of occupancy preferences authorized by statute which applies to section 8 newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing without regard to the size of entities involved. Regulatory Agenda This interim rule was listed as sequence no. 1580 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20446) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
