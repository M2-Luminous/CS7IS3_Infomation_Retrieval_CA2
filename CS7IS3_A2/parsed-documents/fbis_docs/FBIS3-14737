The Armenian side in the talks, which were held between the Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in Moscow, asked for time to withdraw the Armenian forces from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan. Reliable sources have said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamed-Rafi Mamedov held talks with Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargisyan in the presence of Pavel Grachev. The two sides agreed on the conclusion of a cease-fire agreement. The Azerbaijani side stressed that the withdrawal of Armenians from the territories they have occupied is essential for the success of the agreement. The Armenian side responded by asking for 10 days for the withdrawal of their troops. However, the Azerbaijani side agreed to a period of two days. Russia proposed to dispatch observers to Karabakh on the last day of the talks. However, Azerbaijan rejected that proposal. Apparently, the Armenians, who have been quickly retreating in the face of recent Azerbaijan National Army attacks, have decided to call for a cease-fire in order to gain time. That is why they have asked for 10 days. Several reliable sources have said that the Armenians are trying to gain time though dilatory tactics in order to receive aid from Russia and other countries and reorganize their military forces.
