The plan, besides a ceasefire, calls for the resignations of both President Rabbani and his rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and the transfer of power to an interim council until general elections can be held, said the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP). The formula was presented to Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali Monday [24 Jan] by a representative delegation of the Afghan Coordination Council which comprises factions opposed to the year-old Rabbani government. It groups Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], Uzbek general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e Melli or National Movement, the National Liberation Front of former president Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and a Shiite faction of Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party]. During the meeting which lasted 90 minutes, the council "responded positively" to a Pakistani proposal for a regional conference on Afghanistan to resolve the crisis. Pakistan wants Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan to attend a regional conference. In a nationwide broadcast Sunday [23 Jan] Rabbani thanked Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia for their efforts to end the three-week-old bloodshed in Kabul but said his forces would fight on against Dostam's militia until they surrendered. Rabbani said he was ready to give the Afghan people the right to choose a new leadership through elections or by convening a traditional assembly of Afghan elders.
