Dozens of mortally dangerous diseases hide in its folds. The first victims are generally overpopulated cities. Knowing this, Moscow's public health physicians have sounded the alarm. Several days ago under pressure from them, the capital's mayoralty allocated an emergency 37 million rubles to the city center of the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. Can the risk of mass epidemics be bought up for this price? Little Boy Nicknamed Louse-Ridden I am well acquainted with a family that has been in a state of panic for a week now. The papa and mama are from families of physicians; flies are not allowed to fly in their home. They recently experienced what they perceived as a family scandal if not tragedy: The school nurse discovered lice in their 9-year-old son. The little boy was immediately nicknamed Louse-ridden, and suffering from the ridicule of his classmates, he flatly refused to attend his classes. His clothing, bed linen, toys -- in a word everything that could become a breeding ground for lice -- were ``burned'' in a disinfection chamber. But what should be done with the expensive soft furniture, the parents agonized. Put it in the disinfection chamber? It was too large. The alternative was similar -- burn it. ``There is the suspicion that our son picked up the lice when we were returning by train from our summer vacation,'' said the child's father. ``Moreover, the body louse is a carrier of typhus. Thank god, everything turned out all right.'' During the summer migration, up to 3 million persons pass through Moscow train stations daily. Public health physicians acknowledge that from there, dangerous diseases are spread throughout the city. Train Station or Vagrant's Apartment? The Kursk train station is, tentatively speaking, divided into about two equal halves: the cashier's room and the waiting rooms. Chaos now reigns in the former, where straight rows of plastic chairs were recently placed. Bundles of travelers' belongings now tower. After laying down newspapers, they sleep alongside the newly arrived. Hardly any distance away, under the stairwell, one vagrant treats another to cologne. In their own way, they are both reminiscent of exhumed corpses. The sharp odor of long-unwashed bodies mixed with the aroma of cheap perfume makes the air 5 meters around them thick like a wet rag. From time to time, the sweepers chase the people from their seats with prods and verbal abuse in order to clean the food scraps and various paper trash from the concrete floor. Those who were fortunate enough to buy tickets gain access to the chairs located in the waiting rooms. Their guard, consisting of train station workers, is unyielding in front of the ``unticketed''; however, the vagrants find gaps nevertheless. I noticed several ragamuffin people covered with scabs staggering like apparitions between the rows. On the platform, I approached the crew leader of the train that just arrived. ``Do passengers complain about the dirt in the cars often?'' ``It happens. Everybody rides.''`` But where do you disinfect your bed linen? At the train station's bathing and delousing centers?'' ``What bathing and delousing centers! I don't remember when they were operating at train stations...'' At the Kazan train station, security guards from the firm Pravoporyadok [Law and Order] checking tickets at the entrance to the train station's buildings are no obstacle for vagrants because a hole of impressive size was made long ago in the grating separating the cashier's room from the waiting room. Only at the Savelovsk train station were there almost no vagrants. At the entrance of the Pavelets train station, however, I stumbled upon a whole line of people who had lost their human appearance. As later became clear, the train station's administration had given specialists from the international association Physicians Without Borders one of its rooms. The associates of this nongovernmental organization had voluntarily taken it upon themselves to provide all medical, legal, and psychological aid within their power to Moscow's homeless. What Physicians Without Borders Can Do The experience of Physicians Without Borders may be termed unique. Working in accordance with its own program The Homeless since November 1992, they have become the only individuals in the country with the slightest bit of scientific information about those people that fate has cast to the very bottom of life. According to the association's estimates, the number of homeless persons in Moscow may exceed 150,000 (according to official data, they numbered 30,000 as of January 1992). These people who are unable to observe elementary hygiene rules (often through no fault of their own) are becoming potential carriers of diptheria, cholera, typhus, tuberculosis, and other extremely dangerous diseases. Social pariahs despised by everyone, they prefer to not seek help at state medical institutions. And the services of private physicians are, as is well known, beyond the means of even citizens with residence permits. After having worked at the Kursk and Pavelets train stations for several months, the association specialists accumulated statistical data about the most characteristic ailments for vagrants. Half of them suffer from wounds and trophic ulcers, and a third (all in all) suffer from tuberculosis and pneumonia. One hundred percent are infested with lice! A total of 2,500 homeless persons were examined. `` `Ambulance' physicians generally refuse to come for vagrants because the subsequent disinfection of their ambulance takes several hours,'' says Aleksey Golikov, associate of the association. ``We therefore take the most seriously ill to hospitals in our own two minibuses.'' By agreements reached with six hospitals, Physicians Without Borders send those under their care there for treatment. In exchange for the inconveniences, they supply medical personnel with scarce drugs. After having been treated, the vagrants are returned to the train stations -- where else? There they live for years; they collect empty bottles, panhandle, and engage in petty theft. Some even raise something similar to a family. A family consisting of a husband, wife, two children, and the wife's mother have already been living at one train station for a long time. After having returned home, the homeless quickly acquire their previous bouquet of illnesses. To put it briefly, the circle is completed. ``Moscow's government acknowledges that the homeless problem exists, but its first reaction is to try to drive then from the train station,'' believe the association specialists. ``But cutting off vagrants' access to the train stations during the cold part of the year is sentencing them to certain death.'' Like now, before the onset of the winter cold spells, the mayoralty is making fitful attempts to keep the risk of an epidemic to a minimum in a manner contrary to humanitarian principles. And for this, they have allocated 27 million rubles that will be used to repair two delousing stations -- on Red Guard Boulevard and Bauman Street. Purgatory for Outcasts Moscow now has a single delousing station equipped with a powerful disinfection chamber. As a rule, vagrants are sent here. The shabby building of the disinfection station is located at the city's edge. One must travel far to reach it -- first by subway and then by overcrowded bus. The disinfection procedure costs money -- about 1,500 rubles. But vagrants sent by Physicians Without Borders have their insects removed at the expense of the organization. They are sent twice weekly -- on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It must be said that only half of those receiving a referral use it -- an average of 20 persons each week. Can the bathing and delousing center really not handle this influx of patients? ``The point,'' says Grigoriy Ostanin, the center's chief physician, ``is that in the event an emergency situation develops in Moscow it is impossible to conduct mass disinfection of the population. Let us say an outbreak of cholera puts us in a hopeless situation because medical standards call for a separate bathing and delousing center for this disease.'' Public health physicians have also been deprived of reserves such as as municipal baths. Previously, they were equipped with disinfection chambers and divided into what were called ``dirty'' and ``clean'' halves. In recent years, nearly all of the capital's baths have been transformed into commercial saunas. Disinfection chambers and railroadmen have been managed similarly. Not one is operating at any of Moscow's train stations even though in April the municipal commission on emergency situations demanded that the Moscow railroad administration renovate them. ``For this and other reasons,'' states Ostanin, ``the situation regarding Moscow's sanitary condition may become critical at any moment in time.'' According to data from the analytical department of the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the number of diptheria patients in the capital more than doubled during the past year, the number of persons with scabies and syphilis doubled, and the number of persons with tuberculosis increased by one third. And the most frightening thing is that these diseases are more lethal among children than among adults. But I nevertheless remain doubtful: Why reconstruct the bathing and delousing centers if potential disease carriers prefer to bypass them on account of 7 versts? (Several dozen vagrants arriving for sanitary treatment weekly is a meager number compared with the tens of thousands that stubbornly ignore the procedure). Perhaps all this is being done in the event of mass epidemics of diptheria, cholera, and typhus? Then it would seem that this would be directly acknowledged. And it would become clear that the homeless remain the problem of 12 associates of Physicians Without Borders and the Ministry of Railways security guards who drive vagrants from the train station. In the meantime, typhus, tuberculosis, and cholera are classified as what are termed ``socially significant infections,'' and vaccinations against them will not save you. And then there are the many others who, as doctors confirm, have weakened immunity because of a decrease in their standard of living. The unbelievable congestion in public transportation, at stores, and at train stations and the poor sanitary condition of the streets increase the likelihood of outbreaks of epidemics. And in such a situation, vagrants become one of the main risk factors. The vagrant problem must obviously become an object of the most careful attention. A special integrated government program is needed. But as is well known, the government has more important concerns.
