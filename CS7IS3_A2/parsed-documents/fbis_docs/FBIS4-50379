Bandaranaike was unanimously named party presidential candidate few months ago but the 78-year old leader who was twice premier in the island country is under increasing pressure to step down in favor of her 47-year old daughter Chandrika who is now the chief minister of Western Province. But no one in the decision making Central Committee of the party will openly ask Mrs. Bandaranake to withdraw from the candidacy, and it is very much at her discretion to continue as party presidential candidate or to step down in favor of her daughter, a party insider told XINHUA. Chandrika's chances as potential leader of the main opposition freedom party received a new boost when she led her party into a sweeping win at the March 23 southern provincial election, the SLFP's only formidable election success against the ruling United National Party (UNP) for last seventeen years. Her chances in the party to succeed the mother also increased greatly since brother Anura Bandaranaike, her only challenger crossed over to the government after much infighting, and accepted higher education portfolio few months ago. A national level meeting of SLFP's different organizational bodies and elected members to be convened next week is expected to discuss party strategy for next presidential election due before December this year, and Mrs. Bandaranaike is likely to make an important speech there, the sources said.
