Grachev told journalists on Thursday that the base would be situated in two cities - Gyumri and Yerevan and would represent a potent group of troops, including not only infantry but also air defense units, all types of air forces, except for the distant ones, and supply units. The group of troops is expected to be so that it could be brought to any of threatened directions and to conduct military actions for a certain period of time until the main forces come, Grachev said. Grachev emphasized that the final decision on establishment of the Russian military base would be made by the Russian and Armenian presidents. Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev also discussed creation of a single air defense system for the two countries. Grachev said that additional air defense units would be brought to Armenia in order to "cover some directions where he can carry out no surveillance over the air space." These would be surface-to-air missile forces and a squadron of interceptor jets. Grachev pointed out that all these issues were expected to be resolved in June or July so that the establishment of the Russian military base in Armenia be completed in August. In accordance with the achieved agreement, the Armenian party will take active part in the financing of the Russian military base. Grachev stressed that Russian would pay no rent for this base. He added that establishment of Russian military bases on Armenian and Georgian territory would be carried out according to the will of the leadership of these republics. Reliable sources told Interfax that the Russian party had proposed that it lease the newly established base during 25 years with further extension of this term on the basis of an agreement between Moscow and Yerevan. Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan believes that the Armenian parliament will ratify the Russian-Armenian inter- governmental agreement on the status of Russian troops in the republic. IF Note: This agreement was signed in 19992 and ratified by the former Russian parliament in February, 1993. Sarkisyan said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that the Armenian leadership did not demand Russia to pay for leasing the base and for public utilities. He added that Yerevan, in its turn, wanted Armenian citizens to receive education in Russian military colleges for free. Some Armenian servicemen may serve on the Russian military bases which are expected to be created in Armenia.
