The Movement has to choose between confrontation, understanding, or a truce. What option have the Movement's bodies adopted? [Ghawshah] This issue is complex and wide-ranging. I will try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First, let us say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas will adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage. The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a mighty force behind this process, represented by the United States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a national and religious duty by which all should abide. The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political stand and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced that the members of this police force will not open fire on the children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators. [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few months ago, Hamas used to call the Palestinian police force as a Lahd army. Now you speak positively about it and somewhat praise it. Is this a retraction or is there something new? [Ghawshah] Hamas never described the Palestinian police force as a Lahd army. We said that this force supposedly should be part of the Palestinian people. We also said that if the cadres which head this police force make it stand against its people, protect the settlements and bestows legitimacy on the Zionist occupation, then this police force will become like the Lahd army. That's why Hamas will act on the basis of deeds and not words. The Palestinian people welcomed this police force because it means they no longer have to deal with the occupation. They emotionally welcomed this police force bearing in mind too its previous militant background. There is a secret struggle between good elements and the other elements within this police force. An example of this is the officer who prevented the Zionist commander of the southern front from entering the Palestinian area. Unfortunately, this officer was arrested and will be tried. Other Palestinian opposition members were also arrested. The question of weapons will be the test that will show what are the real intentions of the command of the Palestinian police force. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media purposes? [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement knows Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf well. He is a member of the Fatah Central Committee. He took part in previous dialogues between Fatah and Hamas. He signed the Khartoum agreement on 4 January 1993. It is our hope that the police command and Maj. Gen. Nasr will uphold the ideas he set forth during these closed meetings, the ideas regarding his support for the Palestinian people, as well as his respect for and willingness to protect all Palestinian mujahidin. The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake. The most important of these are the weapons used by the mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. This is because it should be unacceptable to disarm the Palestinian people as long as there are occupation troops, settlements, and settlers on our territory. How can the Palestinian policemen disarm the Palestinian people, and allow settlers to move freely with their weapons in the autonomous areas? The Palestinian people were disarmed in 1948 and 1967, and the results were catastrophic. That is why Hamas contended that disarming people is a red line that should not be crossed. [Al-Ma'ayitah] What about the Hamas Movement's military activities since the start of efforts to implement the autonomy agreement? [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement has explained that it will uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will continue as long as the occupation of our territories is maintained. The questions posed in this regard are the following: Have the autonomous areas been fully liberated? Has there been complete withdrawal? The answer is that there has been no complete withdrawal from the autonomous areas, particularly the Gaza Strip. For the Zionists are occupying more than 20 percent of the area of the Gaza Strip, particularly the Gush Qatif area, in which there are 16 settlements and 5,000 settlers. The selection of Zionist targets for attacks is made at the operations room of the al-Qassam Battalions in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Has Hamas thought of launching an opposition political party? Has it considered the idea of cooperating with some forces and figures to launch such a party so that it may deal politically with the self-rule authority? [Ghawshah] Various reports and rumors have circulated regarding the formation of some parties. It seems that Fatah will launch some parties in cooperation with several independent figures so that it may impose its political hegemony in the autonomous areas. The question posed in this regard is: Will Fatah allow elbow room for other political forces? As regards the Hamas Movement, this issue is under consideration, particularly since it was dictated by the developments of the current phase. However, the launching of parties has its pros and cons; and the cons might outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that implicitly approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be facilitated. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Hamas has declared its rejection of an offer made by 'Arafat to take part in the self-rule authority. 'Arafat is well aware of the principled Hamas stand in this regard. How then do you explain this offer by 'Arafat? [Ghawshah] The offer to involve us in this authority was communicated to us by 'Abbas Zaki. The Hamas Movement examined the offer immediately. Hamas decided to refuse to take part in the self-rule authority in line with its rejection of the Cairo agreement. Zaki offered us a number of seats on the self-rule authority council equal to the number to be allocated for Fatah. This is reminiscent of the tactics the Fatah Movement and 'Arafat used when the issue of Hamas' joining the Palestine National Council and the PLO Central Council was debated. Our explanation of this offer, and all other offers by 'Arafat, for that matter, is that they are always made within the context of the carrot and stick policy he pursues. Threats always accompany his offers. He always warns of his ability to penetrate the factions with which he negotiates. There are attempts to involve several independent Islamists in the Palestinian self-rule authority council to insinuate that some Islamists accept self-rule. Using threats, he is laying the grounds for penetration; and this is something we are capable of handling. Any surprises or deception tactics citing the dispute over the number of seats on the self-rule authority council will be exposed. [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few days ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau noted the existence of differences and trends within Hamas, and that thanks to certain PLO figures some Hamas figures are taking a positive approach to the agreement. There had been further such talk before that. What is the true state of affairs? [Ghawshah] I heard these statements on Radio Monte Carlo last Friday. Pelletreau was said to be thrilled with the news of a split within Hamas, brought on thanks to the efforts of some PLO figures. As a spokesman for Hamas, let me tell you the reports are groundless. Hamas is a monolith. Throughout its jihad history, the movement has been shown to be solidly united. The movement was founded on Islam and an adherence to the constants of the Palestinian people. I am told that 'Arafat was heard by a Fatah Central Committee member saying saying that he was baffled by Hamas. All the efforts made to entice the movement into joining hands with the PLO so as to share the responsibility for the Madrid, Oslo, and Cairo agreements, and the Washington talks came to nothing. I am positive the Tunis leadership will fail to attract or infiltrate any Hamas leaders or rank and file. The Tunis leadership has managed to cause splits in other factions, but these lack the moral fiber and organization that sets Hamas apart. All rumors of splits within Hamas have proved unfounded. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Palestinian factions have long been bedeviled by the complexities of the link between their interior and foreign-based cadres, with those inside the occupied territories receiving instructions from the leadership in exile. What has Hamas done to get around such complications? [Ghawshah] As for 'Arafat's Fatah, the strings are pulled by leaders based outside the homeland. 'Arafat has personalized Fatah. Hamas, on the other hand, was founded on Islamic principles and a clear vision, thus affording it the required resilience and flexibility to withstand intense pressure and tackle heavy blows received both inside and outside the homeland. The Tunis leadership has sought to capitalize on the crises and ordeals that Hamas has been through in the inside to penetrate the movement. Fatah attempted to get through to Ahmad Yasin in prison and fabricated news and scenarios to put our movement and its credibility in a bad light. [Al-Ma'ayitah] It is now three years since the opposition was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and, more recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was formed. Don't you think that this is as far as these factions will go -- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges? [Ghawshah] You may recall that in late 1993, following the signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a provisional Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably, however, a number of the Palestinian factions had their sights set too low. We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to get off the ground that we went along with a formula based on political tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a majority consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was not exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be developed. Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field, particularly regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they demanded that a combined nationalist-Islamic command be instituted inside the homeland, we demanded confidence-building initiatives on their part. For example, having refused to consider an alliance with Islamic forces in the elections for the Dentists Association in Gaza so that we may beat the capitulationist candidates, the democratic forces should not go on to call for a unified command. How can can there be a unified command if these other factions are not active in terms of jihad and the intifadah. This and other obstacles have stood in the way of refining the APF's formula. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Some people accuse you of arrogance and attempting to dominate, and hold you responsible for the failure of developing the APF formula. [Ghawshah] Yes, we are accused. Some factions have inherited such attitudes from 'Arafat's Fatah and are trying to repeat them in their dealing with Hamas, although facts on the ground indicate that Hamas has made more sacrifices than others and is less prejudiced than other factions. Therefore, it agreed to participate in the APF to preserve the unity of the opposition. Regrettably, whenever Hamas finds itself in a crisis as a result of the Zionist-U.S. onslaught inside and outside [the occupied territories], these factions fish in murky water and direct their arrows at the movement. We admit that some factions trust Hamas and give it every support. The APF formula needs reformulation in light of new factors. It may be better to establish a wide opposition front during the next stage--a front which has a definite concept and in which every one in the occupied territories takes part with all his might--and to activate the Palestinian diaspora. The Palestinian people in the diaspora, however, are the big losers. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas' decision to continue the intifadah still valid or is it under study and reconsideration? [Ghawshah] There is no doubt that the new era, as well as epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will continue against the occupation everywhere. [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas satisfied by the interaction of Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah and Hamas' role? [Ghawshah] We are in constant touch with Arab and Islamic peoples. Most of these people strongly support the intifadah and jihad in Palestine, and we know well that large sectors of these peoples sympathize with Hamas. Regarding Arab and Islamic parties and movements, we feel that they are short of supporting the intifadah and jihad of the Palestinian people, including the Hamas Movement. What is really painful is that many Islamic movements are so preoccupied with their own concerns and issues that they cannot pay enough attention to the Palestine question, while everybody knows that the Zionist enemy exploits every loophole. It jumps to Indonesia, Qatar, and Oman and takes root in Egypt. The Palestine question should be listed at the top of the agenda of the Islamic movements because the Zionist danger threatens every one. Some movements, which try to court the West and the United States, are despised and humiliated by the West. Some movements have not defined their stand on the Gaza-Jericho accord and some others support it to win U.S. approval. We are with political flexibility that does not encroach on principles. The Islamic movements in the cordon states have a basic role to play in supporting jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside Palestine. These movements's political, popular, and militant performance has not reached the level required in the Islamic and political arenas.
