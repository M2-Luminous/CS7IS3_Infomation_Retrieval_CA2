[Al-'Attas] The dismissal decision was unconstitutional and illegitimate. It was actually a suspension not a dismissal because only the House of Representatives has the right to withdraw confidence from the cabinet. Withdrawal of confidence would mean formation of a new cabinet but, to avoid that dilemma, they played tricks to circumvent legitimacy and the Constitution. I say that the suspension decision means nothing at all. [Al-Badri] How do you assess the chances of settling the crisis, bearing in mind current developments, the Arab mediation attempts, and the ideas proposed by some Yemeni figures for ending the fighting and starting a dialogue? [Al-'Attas] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has always supported dialogue as the ideal way of tackling the problems facing Yemen's unity since its birth. We made great efforts over the past years. That resulted in the national dialogue and we all agreed that obstinacy only weakens Yemen. I support any initiatives calling for a cease-fire. [Al-Badri] You personally and the YSP stand accused of seeking secession and receiving foreign aid to help you achieve secession. [Al-'Attas] That [sounds like] the same old broken record. These accusations are a kind of ideological terrorism which is meaningless. The YSP advocates true unity with the exercise of democracy and under which the tribe-state link would end and the militarization of the regime would end. [passage omitted] [Al-Badri] Do you believe that the southern and northern leaderships can afford the military confrontation, considering their difficult economic conditions at present? [Al-'Attas] Yemen needs every penny for development but this war was imposed on us by the military clique in Sanaa. [Al-Badri] So you agree on the question of accepting foreign aid? [Al-'Attas] Not at all. I am not discussing that now. Some states are providing material and human aid for the regime in Sanaa, such as Sudan which came into the picture when some Sudanese were arrested during the crisis, and Iraq which has also come into the picture. [Al-Badri] Do you believe it is possible to work in accordance with the Pledge and Accord document? [Al-'Attas] The Pledge and Accord Document was the only way out of Yemen's crisis. It provided a launching pad for a realistic way of tackling current problems and for an approach to the future with the aim of building a modern Yemeni state and a decentralized system, but Sanaa's rejection of that document has been perfectly clear from the first day. [passage omitted] [Al-Badri] The United States is still cautious about the current situation in Yemen. What is the truth about your contacts with the State Department and especially with Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau? [Al-'Attas] Pelletreau contacted me from Washington when the attack on the 3d Brigade began and he expressed U.S. resentment of the action of the government in Sanaa. Regrettably, that attack on the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April was a result of a speech on the same day by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in which he declared war, and the situation erupted despite the YSP's self-restraint. Yes, my contacts with the U.S. State Department are continuing. The U.S. position is clear. They are against the war and they are trying, along with all the Arab brothers, to put pressure on Sanaa to stop the war and to resort to political dialogue. [Al-Badri] Who is responsible for opening a new front in Bab el Mandeb? [Al-'Attas] Aden did not open a front in Bab el Mandeb. Sanaa did. [Al-Badri] Do you still hope for the success of diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting? [Al-'Attas] I am very optimistic that the efforts of Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, and the Arab League states and also U.S. efforts will produce results toward stopping the fighting so that the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa will return to its senses and make the brave decision of ending the war and returning to dialogue, because war means more Yemeni fragmentation. [Al-Badri] [House of Representatives Speaker] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar has accused 'Ali Salim al-Bid of mutiny. Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani says that he sees nothing wrong with fighting. Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has stated that they will put down the mutiny in a matter of hours. What is your comment? [Al-'Attas] It is ridiculous that those three should come together and reach conclusions denoting ignorance of the facts about Yemen. The YSP is a part of the regime and it is an effective and essential partner, but it seems that the mentality of those people reflects a policy of annexation. As regards al-Iryani's statement, it is, like his previous statements, self-contradictory. [Al-Badri] How do you interpret the conflicting statements of the Yemen capital? [Al-'Attas] It has declared an unjust war and is trying to conceal its real objectives. We are clear and they are lying. The proof is the arrest campaign against all Yemeni patriotic figures who reject the war, which reflects Sanaa's military mentality. [Al-Badri] The appointment of a new defense minister has been announced and it has been said that Sanaa's aim was to weaken the southern side. [Al-'Attas] That too, regrettably, is another one of their stupid mistakes. They just do not understand Yemen's situation and circumstances. [Al-Badri] Have you obtained American assurances or promises to settle the crisis, even militarily if necessary? [Al-'Attas] The Americans are for an end to the war. I will be holding contacts with them in the next few days with the aim of reactivating the U.S. position in the direction of stopping the war, in cooperation with the Arab brothers. [Al-Badri] Is it just a coincidence that you are outside Yemen now and were outside Yemen when the January 1986 incidents broke out? [Al-'Attas] The circumstances are different. In January 1986 I was on an official visit abroad. Now the reason is that I have had a health problem. I contributed to the work of the National Dialogue Committee despite the fact that I was in severe pain. The treatment for pain in the spine was started in Sanaa at the hands of Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Khalidi. I forced myself to take part in the cabinet meetings but then the deterioration in my condition compelled me to take the doctors' advice. I had to go abroad for treatment. I left Aden on 12 April, 15 days before the president's ill-omened speech. [Al-Badri] So how do you envisage your return to Yemen, and when? [Al-'Attas] I will return to Yemen as soon as my treatment is completed. I am now recovering and, God willing, I will return soon to participate with the brothers in solving the problems facing Yemen.
