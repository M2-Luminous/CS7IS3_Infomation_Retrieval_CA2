The Airbus A320 charter plane was on its way from Athens to Gatwick Airport when the man warned he had a bomb. A spokesman for the airline, Excalibur -- an independent charter company based at East Midlands Airport -- said the details of how the man made his threat known were unclear. "There is no longer a threat -- there was no bomb," the Excalibur spokesman said. "The passengers are leaving the plane."
