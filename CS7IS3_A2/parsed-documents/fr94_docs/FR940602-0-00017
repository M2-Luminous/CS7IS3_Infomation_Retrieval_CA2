Valuation should be reduced if a company's performance and potential have significantly deteriorated. If the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be restored. 3. The anticipated pricing of a Small Concern's future equity financing should be considered as a basis for recognizing Unrealized Depreciation, but not for Unrealized Appreciation. If it appears likely that equity will be sold in the foreseeable future at a price below the Licensee's current valuation, then that prospective offering price should be weighed in the valuation process. 4. Valuation should be adjusted to a subsequent significant equity financing that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. A subsequent significant equity financing that includes substantially the same group of investors as the prior financing should generally not be the basis for an adjustment in valuation. A financing at a lower price by a sophisticated new investor should cause a reduction in value of prior securities. 5. If substantially all of a significant equity financing is invested by an investor whose objectives are in large part strategic, or if the financing is led by such an investor, it is generally presumed that no more than 50% of the increase in investment price compared to the prior significant equity financing is attributable to an increased valuation of the company. 6. Where a company has been self-financing and has had positive cash flow from operations for at least the past two fiscal years, Asset Value may be increased based on a very conservative financial measure regarding P/E ratios or cash flow multiples, or other appropriate financial measures of similar publicly-traded companies, discounted for illiquidity. Should the chosen valuation cease to be meaningful, the valuation may be restored to a cost basis, or in the event of significant deterioration in performance or potential, to a valuation below cost to reflect impairment. a. Under these conditions, valuation factors that may be considered include: (1) The utilization of a multiple of earnings, cash flow, or revenues, which are commensurate with the multiples which the market currently accords to comparable companies in similar businesses and industries, with an appropriate discount for conditions such as illiquidity or a minority position. Care should be taken to use only comparable companies, including not only business similarities but also similarities as to size, financial condition, and earnings outlook. However, in order for comparative market prices to be meaningful, data for a representative sample of similar companies must be available. (2) Among the more important factors to be considered in a particular case are (i) the nature of the business, (ii) the risk involved, and (iii) the growth, stability or irregularity of earnings and cash flows. A company with a positive earnings trend and a favorable outlook may command a capitalization factor (multiplier) in the marketplace that will result in a stock valuation well above book value. When the gross value of a small concern is computed by applying a capitalization rate to pre-interest, pre-tax earnings, the value of equity securities is derived by subtracting the outstanding debt of the concern from the gross value. While capitalization rates do vary, an appropriate rate can be determined by analyzing rates for comparable companies in the same industry. Investigating similar companies in the same industry or geographic area can be done directly or through published material from sources such as the Value Line, Standard and Poor's, Robert Morris and Associates, or any other of the numerous sources available for comparative industry data. (3) Another method discounts the present value of estimated future proceeds to a Licensee, including dividend income and sales of securities, using a discount rate that reflects the degree of risk of the equity interest. (4) One may also utilize the recent sale prices of comparable blocks of the issuer's securities in arm's length transactions. b. Equity interests or limited partnership interests without the benefit of stock certificates and which generally define a certain percentage of the profits to be allocated to each of the investors based on its relative contributions should be valued in a manner similar to the valuation methods described in this section. 7. With respect to portfolio companies that are likely to face bankruptcy or discontinue operations for some other reason, liquidating value may be employed. This value may be determined by estimating the realizable value (often through professional appraisals or firm offers to purchase) of all assets and then subtracting all liabilities and all associated liquidation costs.
