CONTENTS: 1. Lawyers Continue Protests Over Colleague's Death 2. President Sued Over Satellite Dishes 3. Gaza-Jericho Agreement Denounced 4. Islamic Group Denies Killing Copts 5. Clergymen To Testify Over Mufti's Rulings 6. Islamic Group Members To Be Arrested 7. Government Weekly Accused of Stirring Sedition 8. Liquidation of Islamic Society Denounced LAWYERS CONTINUE PROTESTS OVER COLLEAGUE'S DEATH Pages one-three of the 17 May AL-SHA'B are devoted to reports and articles protesting the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, allegedly by torture, while in police custody on 26 April. The collective headline reads: "Lawyers' Uprising: The Strike is Successful and a Peaceful March to 'Abidin Palace Is Planned Today." Under the headline, the main story notes that the Lawyers Association is to organize a "peaceful march" on 17 May from the association building in Cairo to the Presidential Palace in 'Abidin to protest Madani's death by torture at the State Security Intelligence Department in al-Jizah. The report adds that demonstrators will carry banners denouncing torture and demanding the trial of police officers involved in torturing Madani. Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in an approximately 800-word article on page one entitled "The People's Wrath Is the Fire That Will Burn the Hands of Despotism," refers to the forthcoming march and adds that Madani's "assassination" is a crime that "must not pass." He explains that if this crime were to be allowed to pass unnoticed and its culprits left unpunished, more people would be murdered by torture every day. Referring to an unspecified State Security Intelligence statement, Husayn argues that the statement contains fresh incriminating evidence. He explains: "At first they claimed Madani died of low blood pressure. Then they announced that he died of asthma; this is the first time we have heard of someone dying of asthma. Their latest statement was tantamount to justifying the murder. And why not, since he was the link between the Islamic groups at home and abroad?" Claiming that such contradictions smack of a cover-up, Husayn asks why these charges were not announced from the start and why the forensic report was, as he, states, hidden. Majdi concludes by saying that confronting terrorism with torture will only result in more terrorism and that using torture to extract information easily will provide fertile ground for armed resistance of the authorities. An approximately 1,200-word unattributed report by Ashraf Khalil on page one describes the contacts among the Lawyers Association members and political and judicial officials over Madani's death. Khalil notes that the "political leadership has summoned" the association's chief, Ahmad al-Khawajah, to listen to his argument over the case. Al-Khawajah explained that his association strongly suspects that Madani died of torture and submitted several demands to contain the situation and the lawyers' anger. He demanded that the lawyers see the forensic report on Madani's death, that the officers responsible for his death be named, and that 35 detained lawyers be released. The writer explains that the political and security leaders promised to meet the demands but to release only 15 of the detained lawyers. In return, the security leaders called on the lawyers to be calm and refrain from staging demonstrations. But the deal collapsed following the Interior Ministry's statement charging Madani in a state security case. An approximately 600-word unattributed report on pages one and seven refers to a statement by Amnesty International expressing concern over the death of Madani. The statement notes that a representative of the organization met Madani briefly on 24 April and set an appointment to meet him again the same week. But Madani did not show up on time. The organization later learned that he was arrested at his office on 26 April and reportedly tortured to death. The statement adds that Madani is said to have been whipped and beaten and to have received electric shocks in custody. Amnesty International urged the Egyptian authorities to clear up the issue before the public, name the people responsible for his murder, if proven, and put them on trial. Reports on the general strike observed by lawyers throughout Egypt on 15 May to protest Madani's murder are detailed on pages two and three. According to the reports, the strike was observed unanimously in every governorate and judges sympathized with the lawyers by postponing cases scheduled for that day. On the same pages, correspondents Ashraf Khalil and Mu'tazz al-Hadidi describe a news conference in Cairo at the Lawyers Association building in which several association members spoke. Mukhtar Nuh, secretary general of the association, revealed that the Interior Ministry falsely accused Madani of practicing terrorism. He added: "The interior minister, in a bid to cover up the murder of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, named an organization discovered a few days earlier and accused the martyr of being a member of that organization." The names of 34 lawyers still held in custody are listed on page three. A statement by the Freedoms Committee in the Lawyers Association above the list of names promises that it will no longer tolerate the detention, torture, or murder of any lawyers and promises to remain in open session unless all the detainees are released unconditionally. Muslim Brotherhood member and columnist Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus, in an approximately 700-word on page 12, salutes the association members for their courageous stance in protest of Madani's death. He contends that the Interior Ministry's statement on Madani's death shows "shortsightedness" in picking on asthma as the alleged cause of death instead of a "heart attack" or a "brain stroke," which lead to immediate death in almost every case. After explaining that the "ruling regime" is notorious worldwide for its violation of human rights, he notes that Madani's murder has exposed the faults of a regime in which the "head of state enjoys almost absolute powers." PRESIDENT SUED OVER SATELLITE DISHES An approximately 1,500-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page four notes that Muhammad Mahmud 'Ali Hamid, a lawyer from Upper Egypt, has taken the president, prime minister, information minister, and interior minister to court for being "in one way or another" responsible for allowing the operation in Egypt of satellite dishes, which he says take "obscene films" into Egyptian homes. Hamid believes that the decisions permitting the import of antennas are invalid, since they run contrary to Article 2 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Islam is the state's religion and that Islamic shari'ah is the primary source of legislation, and to Article 12, which obliges society to "observe and protect ethics," the people's "national and moral values," and "public ethics." He says that "Arab countries, the United States, and the Jews operate television channels to broadcast purely sexual and homosexual movies to undermine the heavenly religions in general and Islam in particular." Concluding his lawsuit, Hamid explains: "It is a matter of time before these antennas deal a poisonous blow to society's creed, ethics, and traditions." He urges the court to suspend the decisions allowing the operation and circulation of these dishes and to oblige the president, prime minister, and information and interior ministers to withdraw those dishes already operating from Egyptian homes. The writer explains that Hamid approached the mufti's office for a fatwa, or religious ruling, on the dish, only to be turned down by officials there on grounds that the issues is beyond their jurisdiction. GAZA-JERICHO AGREEMENT DENOUNCED Muslim Brotherhood writer Ahmad al-Malat, in an approximately 2,000-word article on page five, expresses the Muslim Brotherhood's opinion on the "fiasco" at the ceremony in which the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Agreement was signed in Cairo on 4 May. Al-Malat suggests that by signing the "deed of submission" at the ceremony, 'Arafat thought he was giving a hand to the "tough delivery" of the hoped-for Palestinian state, but the truth is that the deal will produce nothing but a "self-rule locality" housing those left of the inhabitants of the usurped Palestine in an area not exceeding 2 percent of the lost land of Palestine. Addressing 'Arafat, he says: "The statelet you imagine is about to see light will be nothing but a meek lamb in a forest guarded by Zionist wolves, who audaciously declare that the people left in that area are nothing but cockroaches to be squashed underfoot." After reviewing the Palestinian story from the establishment of Israel in 1948 up to the 1967 defeat of the Arabs by Israel, al-Malat claims that 'Arafat, that day, "committed a fatal error and a major sin by recognizing Israel as a sovereign state that has a right to exist on the remains of slaughtered Palestine." He believes 'Arafat's behavior is the result of one of two things: "idiocy or treason." Al-Malat adds that 'Arafat has forgotten that "Palestine, including the al-Aqsa Mosque and holy Jerusalem, represents a trust in the hands of Muslims worldwide, not an item left to the care of the PLO to dispose of as it pleases." He adds: "Honesty dictates that if the PLO cannot protect this trust, it must return it to its owners, not hand it over to the enemy of yesterday, today, and tomorrow." He concludes by suggesting that since there is no room in Palestine for both Palestinians and Jews, then either the land is given back to the people evicted from it or things remain as they are. He adds: "Thus there is no choice but to carry arms against the aggressor and to try to restore right, even if this takes centuries. The jihad is an inalienable obligation binding each Muslim until right is restored and the invaders are expelled from this dear part of the land of Islam." ISLAMIC GROUP DENIES KILLING COPTS An approximately 120-word on page 7 refers to a statement issued by the Islamic Group denying the killing of Copts in Egypt. CLERGYMEN TO TESTIFY OVER MUFTI'S RULINGS An approximately 400-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman on page seven notes that the Cairo Court of Misdemeanors has decided to summon al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, other clergymen, and Islamic economic experts to testify on Mufti Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi's fatwas on banking transactions, the import of alcoholic drinks for non-Muslims, and the opening of casinos for tourists. The court's decision has come at the request of a team of lawyers defending Dr. 'Ali al-Salusi, professor of economy at Qatar University; Dr. Sha'ban Muhammad Isma'il, head of the Shari'ah Department at al-Azhar University; and 'Ali Faruq, chief editor of the newspaper AL-NUR, who have been taken to court by Mufti Tantawi on libel charges for challenging his fatwas and calling for his dismissal from office for passing rulings that run contrary to the Koran and the prophet's tradition. Another court earlier sentenced the defendants to a six-month prison term and a fine of 600 Egyptian pounds but the defendants appealed the court decision. ISLAMIC GROUP MEMBERS TO BE ARRESTED 'Ala' al-Bahhar, in 240 words on page 7, writes that the security agencies plan a campaign of arrests among active members of extremist groups in the coming two weeks. GOVERNMENT WEEKLY ACCUSED OF STIRRING SEDITION An approximately 350-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on the same page notes that Major General Ahmad Sadiq, chief of police in the Upper Egyptian Governorate of al-Minya, has accused a governmental weekly magazine of inciting sedition by publishing what he says are lies and groundless reports on the Islamic groups in his governorate. In a statement to AL-SHA'B, Maj. Gen. Sadiq denied reports published in the magazine about the Islamic Group's control of al-Husayni Street in al-Minya. The security official pointed out: "Some people belonging to the Islamic Group rented shops next to the National Democratic Party headquarters after obtaining legal licenses from the City Council." Their activity has been scrutinized and found to be legal, he added. Maj. Gen. Sadiq issued a challenge to prove reports in the same magazine, said to be notorious for publishing "lies" about the Islamic Group, that the Islamic Group orders people in Mallawi, a town in al-Minya Governorate, to pay extortion money to the group. He also denied reports that members of the group do not permit women and men to ride on the same public transport vehicles. LIQUIDATION OF ISLAMIC SOCIETY DENOUNCED An approximately 400-word unattributed report on page 7 notes that the Labor Party Committee in Alexandria has issued a statement on "tragic events" in the al-Wardiyan District. The events followed the Alexandria governor's decision to dissolve the "Al-I'tisam Bi Habl Illah" religious society, which is based at the Abu-'Umar Mosque in Alexandria and supervised by several local council members from the Labor Party. The statement notes that contrary to the people's desires, the mosque was taken over by the Ministry of Social Affairs and a progovernment board of directors was appointed to run the society. This, the report adds, has angered the people in the neighborhood, who clashed with the policemen brought to the area to expel the society's legitimate board of directors. The statement called for the immediate release of all local council members and citizens who were arrested on charges of "rioting."
