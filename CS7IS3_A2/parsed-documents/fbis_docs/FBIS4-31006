"It is for the first time that I confirm it publicly," the president said. "I was encouraged to fight again, especially by the postcommunists and all those attacking me," he said in an exclusive interview for PAP. Speaking about his possible electoral platform, Walesa referred to the programme he had promoted in the last presidential elections and said: "We must review the programme we have had until now and draw up a new one, using the experience of the past four years." Walesa said he hoped his electorate would include all people of honest work. "I do have many achievements to my credit and although some have been forgotten I am convinced that not one of the figures on the political scene can match my record," Walesa claimed. He said he planned to draw up a complete list of his accomplishments and have it published. Asked about his political base in the elections, Walesa did not exclude this role would be played by the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR), an organization created on his initiative shortly before the September, 1993 parliamentary elections. He left open the possibility that a new presidential political party would be created. The president said he was glad there were already politicians in the political arena planning to contest the presidential election, but added he was not afraid of rivals. "I will prove I still have many fresh ideas that no politician can beat," Walesa assured. He announced he would not support any grouping in the forthcoming local government elections. The president reiterated his position that the chief of the Polish army general staff should report to the president, not the minister of defense. He also once again declared he would not sign into law the amendments to the law on abortion now debated by the Sejm. Walesa gave good marks to the cabinet of Waldemar Pawlak, but remarked that the bulk of really tough decisions had been made by the previous four cabinets. "The present government is in a convenient situation and this accounts for its successes so far," said Walesa. "However, we shall only see what the future will bring..." Walesa categorically denied information concerning his sons carried by the latest issue of the POLITYKA weekly and putting in doubt his conduct as a father. "I will say bluntly: those who cannot fight me through other means are now trying to do it via my family life," the president declared.
