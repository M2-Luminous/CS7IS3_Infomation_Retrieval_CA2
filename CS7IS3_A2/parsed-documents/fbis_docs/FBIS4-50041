This article mainly explains the difference between the new Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation and the old one, following its transformation. What are its responsibilities and rights in its relations with the higher authorities? How will it affect its subordinate enterprises as the "boss" of state assets? How have they changed their relationship from one between "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law" to one between "mother and son?" "The separation of asset management from government administration is an important condition for the separation of enterprise management from government administration. The universal significance of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform finds expression in the creation of state asset representatives in enterprises themselves. They can ensure and increase the value of state assets and operate state assets according to market economic demands." -- Written by a person in the State Structural Reform Commission who is familiar with the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform. At its 19th Standing Committee meeting on 13 August 1993, the Beijing Municipal Government decided to authorize the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation to manage state assets. Subsequently, in accordance with the decision by the municipal government and under the specific guidance of the Beijing Municipal State Asset Administration, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation completed the verification and appraisal of the corporation's state assets after three months of busy work. On 7 December of the same year, it registered the following: Legal person's name: The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. Registered capital: 1.288 billion yuan. First item in its business scope: State asset management. In Beijing, this was the first enterprise granted the right to manage state assets. After an enterprise is authorized to manage state assets, is it an operator or the owner's representative? If it is the former case, reform is stagnant; if it is the latter case, a breakthrough is made in reform. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has transformed itself from an "employee" into the "boss" representative. What does it mean to authorize an enterprise to manage state assets? On this question, this reporter [Mo Xinyuan] interviewed Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. [Cui] There are still different opinions on this question. Some people are still of the opinion that what has been granted to the enterprise is only an operationing right; the state is still the owner and the enterprise is only an operator. We do not agree with this view. In our opinion, this authorization has made us a representative of the owner who possesses that part of state assets. We represent the state in exercising ownership, therefore we are the owner. [Mo] What is the difference between being an operator and being the owner? [Cui] According to these people's opinion, the state is the owner and we are only the operator. In this case, our reform is stagnant. For a long time, the relation between management and ownership in state enterprises has been unclear. It has been unclear who will represent the owner of state assets. Under the planned-economy structure, the entire country was a great factory and all enterprises were its workshops. This no longer suits the market economy. Only when an enterprise becomes a competitive body of "four self's" [self-accumulation of funds, self-construction, self-management, and self-assumption of responsibility for profits and losses], can it enter the market. This is an essential demand of the market economy. If the enterprise is an operator and the state is the owner, problems will arise in two aspects. The first is that if the state is the owner, it is "false" because either everyone or no one can represent it--a case resulting in the falsification of the asset ownership body and a large-scale loss of state assets. The second aspect is that if the owner is represented by a government department, this will cause the mixing of enterprise management and government administration, and the enterprise will become the subsidiary of a government department. Moreover, if a government department is the owner, it will find it difficult to enter the production factors market or to engage in the trading of proprietary rights; thus it is also impossible to display the basic role of the market in optimizing resource distribution. In its reform, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation faced not only low economic results, but a number of problems as well, such as upgrading its production, adjusting its arrangements and structure, and optimizing its resource distribution. To resolve these problems, it will not do to rely on enterprise reform alone; there is a need to create a new type of state asset representative that can perform ownership over the part of state assets within the framework of authorization and also can operate this part of state assets in the market as an enterprise. [Mo] With this authorization, the enterprise has ownership. Does this mean carving out state ownership over state assets? [Cui] This is not carving out state ownership, but grading it. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee formed the concept about the proprietary right of an enterprise's legal person. This is a major breakthrough in China's enterprise reform theory, and points out the orientation for clearly defining the relationship between management and ownership. The state has final ownership, whereas the enterprise has the legal person's proprietary right. This is graded ownership. Without this graded ownership, the separation of enterprise management from state administration will forever remain empty talk. Through our own reform, we have understood that the asset dispenser's ownership can be derived from between these two tiers of ownership. This asset dispenser's ownership will be undertaken by the state asset representative authorized by the state so as to ensure state asset value and increments in this value. The essence of authorized operation is the separation of government administration from asset management. The enterprise will operate this part of state assets and also can make investments. Therefore, the grading of state asset ownership does not change the nature of state ownership over state assets; it confirms the rational existence form, task, and responsibility of state asset ownership at different levels of economic operations according to market economic demands so as to promote state-owned economic development. Obviously, this falls into the category of system formation. With this authorization, we have formulated regulations that provide, among other things, for the following: "This corporation is a state asset representative with legal registration and is a wholly state-invested corporation with limited liabilities." "As the asset owner, this corporation represents the state in operating and managing the part of state assets within the framework of government authorization." With this new status, we can possess the "key" to practicing the optimal distribution and rational circulation of the state assets in the former light industrial departments affiliated with the corporation. It does not matter whether one's power is great or small, but the most fearful thing is undefined responsibility. With a clearly defined relationship between management and ownership, enterprises can perform their different duties and functions. The relationship between the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation and its affiliated enterprises has changed from one between "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law" to one between "mother and son." The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has 122 enterprises and institutions. These include enterprises manufacturing brand-name products, like the Xinghai Piano Factory, the Hongxing Brand Liquor Distillery, and a wristwatch factory. There are enterprise groups comprising dozens of enterprises, such as the glass group company, the paper manufacturing group company, and the Liyuan company. There are also 85 joint-venture factories, centers, and projects. What changes has the establishment of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a state asset owner brought about in these enterprises? What impact has it had? Let us listen to Assistant General Manager Yang Zhide's explanations: [Yang] After clearly defining the corporation's reform ideas, we held several discussions with enterprise leaders. Early this year, we held a work meeting for leaders of enterprises and institutions affiliated with the corporation, during which our reform program was submitted for discussion. This reform program was unanimously supported by the participants. The most important change was the establishment of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as the "boss," which can influence its subordinates with its power. It has the right and power to benefit from the assets, to make major decisions, and to select managerial personnel, but it does not interfere in the daily production and operations of its affiliated enterprises. The assets of its affiliated enterprises are formed with the corporation's investments, and these enterprises are responsible for ensuring the value of these assets and also their increments. Thus the relationship between the corporation and its affiliated enterprises has changed from one between "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," which is of an administrative subordination nature, to one between "mother and son," which is characterized by the relationship between management and ownership. [Mo] Does this change make enterprise leaders feel they have been "downgraded"? [Yang] The separation of the owner from the operator is the demand of social productive forces' development. The positions of the owner and the operator must not be mistaken, as this could lead to confusion. Some of our enterprise leaders think they are the owner's representatives. This is a misunderstanding resulting from a confused idea about the relationship between management and ownership. As a matter of fact, a clear definition of enterprise roles, responsibilities, and rights will be more favorable for them in the performance of their duties and functions. In the past, when a government department formed a company, it abolished the legal person's position of the enterprise affiliated with it. We do not do this. The mother company and the branch company are independent legal persons enjoying an equal position in civil rights. The branch company possesses the right to the legal person's assets formed with the investments of the asset dispenser, including the state. It carries out independent operations, assumes sole responsibility for its profits and losses, pays taxes according to regulations, and enjoys all the rights provided by Enterprise Law, the Regulations on the Transformation of State Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms, and Beijing's methods for implementing these regulations. Therefore many enterprises are of the opinion that we are not withdrawing powers from them, but are delegating powers to them. Comrades in these enterprises said jokingly: Evidently, "mother is more intimate to son" than "mother-in-law to daughter-in-law." [Mo] How does the mother company manage the assets? [Yang] First, it practices a new leadership system, which is the general manager responsibility system under the leadership of the board of directors. Second, it has established rules and regulations, such as the company's regulations, methods to operate and manage state assets, and methods to award or punish operators. Principal enterprise leaders will be awarded or punished according to the letter of responsibility for state asset operation and the contract of responsibility for target fulfillment, by referring to the increment rate, profit rate, and net turnover of state assets, as well as the fulfillment of other targets. In short, the previous practice of exercising management over enterprises to the neglect of state assets has been changed to the current practice of exercising management over state assets while relaxing control over enterprises. In the next step, we will introduce graded authorization. Large group companies will be granted asset operational rights in light of their specific conditions so that they will be entitled to an asset dispenser's status, which will be favorable to asset invigoration in the group companies themselves. "Through a thorough transformation, we can free ourselves from miscellaneous administrative affairs and concentrate on this entirely new field: Making an overall plan for further development of assets, optimization of resource distribtuion, and adjustment of the structure," Cui Zhian said excitedly. "The power of models is limitless. Now many enterprises and staff members in cities who cannot see their development prospects have asked us to `optimize their resource distribution' as soon as possible so they can learn from the match factory in revitalizing itself. ("The new role" has come up to the stage. How does it actually perform? Where is its ignition point? Please read part three of these serial reports--"The Hongyun Company Builds a Bridge.")
