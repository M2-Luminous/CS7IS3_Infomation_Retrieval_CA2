The statement refers to the first decree that will lead to the "ruination of trade which, for some reason, is being permanently called black marketing." Tremendous powers vested by this decree in state bodies, including the fire inspectorate, and the right to determine "the expediency of accommodating trade facilities" will inevitably lead to the further development of corruption and trade's transition to the "shadow [as received]." "The ruination of trade was not the last of the factors which resulted in an end to the all-Ukrainian market ceased, and the volume of production has decreased as a result of this," says the statement. "Abuses in state trade can be done away with only with large-scale privatization and demonopolization of state trade and an end to price regulation," believe the Constitutional Democrats. The decree on the return of currency valuables will have opposite consequences: Currency will forever remain in the West. In the opinion of the Constitutional Democratic Party, both decrees are purely populist. They show Leonid Kravchuk as a person who is ready to harm country's economy for the sake of winning the election.
