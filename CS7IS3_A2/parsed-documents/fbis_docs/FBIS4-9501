Now we are in Versoix, Switzerland, the place of your residence in exile, if I may say so. I would first like you to talk about the award granted last year by the Yad Vashem organization to your mother, Queen Mother Elena. [Mihai I] It was a great pleasure for me that they did that, and I interpreted this move as a reparation of a big injustice; namely that not one single word was said about the Jewish people in Romania and those deported in Dniester, and now, luckily, in the past three years, all kinds of research has been done and memoirs and documents have been consulted to reestablish the truth. Finally, this year, this organization accepted the fact that my mother's righteousness should be recognized. On her behalf, I received a medal and a document, in which everything she did for the Jews in Romania was recognized. [passage omitted] [Valenas] Sire, how would you characterize the current Romanian Army? [Mihai I] In the past three years, I have realized that the Army has regained its so-called independence from the political vicissitude of the past years. The army is at the disposal of the country and is ready to commit itself for the security of the country. All attempts to take away its fundamental role could only provoke a crisis within the army. The Army is there to serve the Romanian people and our homeland, not the policies of others. All officers and soldiers know what the Army means and what our traditions are. However, just like other armies throughout the world, attempts are made to politicize an army, remove it from its own duty toward the country, and provoke qualms. [Valenas] How do you explain that there are still sympathetic feelings toward you among the Romanian officers? [Mihai I] Whether I completed my military training in Romania or whether I was an officer in the Romanian Army still plays a role in this respect, and I do not know why because so many years have elapsed. I have often said there is a soft spot in my heart for the Romanian Army. Considering that I went went through military training in our country, I feel very close to our Army and, as a matter of fact, I believe the Army should return to its old traditions. [Valenas] Do you believe it is appropriate that at the helm of our Army there should be a civilian who used to work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, about whom, as a matter of fact, the Romanian press published conclusive data that he used to be an employee with the rank of colonel in the former Foreign Information Directorate of the Securitate? [Mihai I] Again, here is a case in which all kind of things are said, but in our country the minister of war [as published] has always been a military person. To what extent his name is appreciated in Europe or in the West, or whether he is a civilian or an army person, is their business. Our business is to preserve our tradition as it has always been. I do not think that such a thing would have been easily accepted in our army. [passage omitted] [Valenas] Sire, how would you assess the current situation in Romania from a social, political, and maybe even moral point of view? [Mihai I] As far as I know, there are two moral issues: the people's morale is very low, as is morality. The finances are still state-owned, the economy is destroyed, and people do not have any money. It is a very difficult situation. I cannot tell you much more than that. I can only say that the situation is very difficult. [passage omitted] [Valenas] Sire, at the end of our interview, what would you recommend to the Romanian people? [Mihai I] For the immediate future, I hope the people will not lose their courage and look a little forward, and not just to everyday difficulties, which are very big indeed. However, people should not lose their belief in God and their hope in the future.
