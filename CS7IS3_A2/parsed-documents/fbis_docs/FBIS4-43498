In the long run, economic growth and new growth markets can only be created on the basis of new technologies. Now the right course has to be set for it. On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Group, Research Policy Spokesman Josef Vosen stated that, with the understanding for research and technology policies expressed in the FRG research report, economic, social, and ecological challenges cannot be met. "The formerly flourishing research landscape in Germany is drying up" Vosen said, and referred to the research budget's share of the federal budget, which decreased from 2.7 percent in the mid-eighties to 1.9 percent now. Vosen again criticized the above-average cuts in the 1994 research budget of 250 million German marks. On behalf of the SPD, Vosen called for the reintroduction of a tax incentive for research and the examination of all legal norms, to discover whether and how many obstacles to research and development activities are contained therein. A massive increase in the research budget is necessary. On behalf of the CDU Group, Research Policy Spokesman Christian Lenzer stressed that the recession has shown where structural and organizational problems are burdening research in Germany and where entrenchment and lack of communication have made research heavy-handed. This should be understood as a "positive lesson" and the proper conclusions should be drawn. Proposals for an improvement by the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group were already submitted a long time ago. Now speedy action, not regret, is required, he said. On behalf of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], Deputy Juergen Timm stated that the situation is becoming dangerous for the FDP because the CDU/CSU and the SPD have basically the same research policy ideas. Politicians and officials in ministries overestimate their capacities if they pretend to know which fields of research are promising, which enterprises are competitive, or which markets exist for which products. The FDP neither believes in the functioning of an industrial policy, whatever it may be like, nor in the special advantages of direct research incentives, as compared to large-scale indirect incentive measures.
