FR940617-1-00057 FR940617-1-00012 The data included several studies on the absorption of the iodine complex, blood levels of iodine, and the systemic toxicity of the iodine complex. Protein-bound iodine (PBI) and iodine blood levels in rabbits were determined following two studies of acute dermal applications. In the first study, either 2 or 5 mL/kilogram (kg) of the test iodine complex was applied to the shaved backs of rabbits in one experiment. The method of occlusion, if any, was not stated, but the test material was washed off after 24 hours. In another experiment, 2 mL/kg of the test iodine complex was compared with a povidone-iodine complex and both were applied as in the first experiment. PBI and total iodine in blood were determined at 0, 24, and 48 hours in both experiments. In all treated animals, the level of PBI was extremely high at certain times, primarily at 24 hours. Animals receiving the higher dose of iodine complex in the first experiment seemed to return to normal sooner than those receiving the lower dose. All animals returned to normal by 14 days. For purposes of comparison, the second experiment showed that serum total iodine increased from 1.4 to 30.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) in the test iodine complex group compared to from 1.23 to 37.9 mg/dL in the povidone-iodine group in the 24 hours that the application remained on. In the second study, 5 mL/kg of the test iodine complex was applied to the shaved backs of two groups of five rabbits each. In one group the shaved backs were occluded for 24 hours and in the other group, the shaved backs were scrubbed for 10 minutes followed by rinsing and occlusion. An additional group served as an untreated control group. Blood samples for iodine determinations were taken at 0, 24, and 48 hours and at 14 days. All five animals in the group in which the iodine complex remained occluded on intact skin for 24 hours had markedly elevated levels of PBI and iodine at both 24 and 48 hours, but were only slightly above normal at 14 days. For the 10-minute scrub animals, the PBI levels were increased in two of five animals at 24 hours, slightly in all five animals at 48 hours, and were normal at 14 days. A study to determine the effect on blood PBI levels of a routine scrubbing procedure in which exposure to the iodine complex exceeded normal use showed no alteration in PBI levels in four humans who scrubbed twice daily (each scrub consisting of two 5 minute hand washes with 5 mL) for 26 consecutive days. Also, no irritation was observed. In a similar study in which the subjects wore gloves for 2 hours after each scrub, PBI levels were not increased, but total iodine was slightly increased. In two subjects, this increase was greater in the middle of the study, but the total iodine blood levels were near normal by the end of the study. A dermal absorption study in which the shaved backs of four monkeys were rubbed with 0.17 mL/kg of radioactive iodine complex for 10 minutes, rinsed, wrapped for 2 hours, and the animals sacrificed after 24 hours, revealed that less than 0.1 percent of the application was recovered in the thyroid, the target organ for iodine. A 90-day sub-acute dermal toxicity study was conducted in three groups of monkeys divided into one control group and two test groups. One test group was scrubbed once for 10 minutes daily with 0.17 mL/kg of the iodine surgical scrub detergent product and the second group was scrubbed three times with 0.34 mL/kg (once for 10 minutes and twice for 3 minutes each day). To simulate the wearing of surgical gloves, the treated area of each animal, which consisted of a shaved area of the back equivalent to about 10 percent of the body area, was wrapped with a rubber dam for 30 to 90 minutes. The study lasted 13 weeks during which the animals were monitored. Neither test group showed any effects of iodophor treatment except elevated PBI levels in the high dose group, which peaked at one month. Also, there was no significant effect on the thyroid in the treated groups. The agency believes this iodine complex is safe for humans based on the data from human, rabbit, and monkey studies. Test data showed very little iodine absorption when the product was used as a scrub, negligible uptake (following acute dermal application of radioactive iodine complex) by the thyroid in monkeys, and an unchanged thyroid weight in test groups of monkeys following 90 days of sub-acute applications of the iodine complex. The comment submitted data from one clinical study for evaluating effectiveness as a surgical hand scrub but did not provide the testing protocol used. Five subjects scrubbed three times daily for 5 days with the iodophor formulation (containing 1.1 percent iodine). Four subjects completed the study. Surgical gloves were worn for 2 hours after the first wash of the day. Subjects' hands were sampled once each day at the end of the 2-hour gloved period using a single-basin Cade method. The initial sampling was used to establish a baseline microbial count for each subject. Study results were reported as the number of organisms per mL of basin water and the percent reduction in the number of organisms recovered. The reduction in the bacterial population ranged from 89 to 98 percent on the first day. By the fifth day, the reduction ranged from 99 to 100 percent. Similar results were obtained in a comparative study on six subjects using povidone-iodine. Although it is clear that the test used was not the glove juice test which is described in the antimicrobial tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242), alternative methods may be acceptable. However, because of the small number of subjects included in the study, the data are not sufficient to support the Category I classification of this ingredient for use as a surgical hand scrub. Additional studies, of the type described in ยง333.470(b)(1) of this amended tentative final monograph, are necessary to support the effectiveness of this surfactant iodine complex for this use.
