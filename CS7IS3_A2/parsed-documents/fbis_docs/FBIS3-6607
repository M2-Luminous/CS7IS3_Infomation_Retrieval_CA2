Director General Kubota indicated that she was thinking in a forward-looking manner about the study on including macroeconomic plans, telling reporters, "We are now at a stage where we must come up with all possible alternatives." Kubota did not speak plainly about the contents of the possible macroeconomic plans, but she noted, "the need for tax cuts and the expansion of domestic demand have been pointed out; of course, then there is the problem of the current-accounts surplus." Adding "I think we should discuss these things in a little more orderly manner," she indicated the likelihood that these issues will be considered as the plans.
