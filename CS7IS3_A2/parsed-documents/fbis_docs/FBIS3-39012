After the United States increased interests, the dollar abruptly jumped up three pfennigs. Since then, however, it has remained at 1.76 German marks [DM]. Once more, rumors are spreading that the Bundesbank intervened in the market to slow down the rise of the dollar. There was no indication of it in the past few days but even the possibility seems to somewhat restrain the market. Further Upswing for Dollar Likely The Bundesbank is probably happy with this reaction. The protectors of our mark want to force short-term interests further down, and a major devaluation of the German mark vis-a-vis the most important currency in the world would not fit into this concept. Nevertheless, the Central Bank Council will probably have to put up with another revaluation of the dollar. The U.S. economy is simply growing too vigorously at the moment. Moreover, the chance for higher U.S. interests will lure money from Germany across the Atlantic. Dollar rates of DM1.80-1.85 this year have become more likely. A strong dollar does not prevent a further loosening of monetary policy in Germany, and thus in most countries in West Europe. Yet it is certainly an obstacle. For the Bundesbank it will become more difficult to find the right moment for the next small step. The decisive factor will be how quickly the dollar is now revalued. A rapid increase in leaps would be dangerous, as this process might easily get out of hand. If, however, the markets are prepared and the dollar moves within narrow margins, then the next interest cut might be less dramatic. Thus, it was a wise decision for the Bundesbank to advertise the next securities repurchase agreement, again at a fixed interest of 6 percent. This calms down the market, gives the German mark some respite, and once more proves the Bundesbank's commitment to stability. Since 2 December, the rate for money market transactions has been constant, and the discount rate has been stable since 21 October. Since last Thursday there has been no news regarding the third key rate; individual participants in the market speculated with an interest tender. This procedure would have given banks the chance to force down the pension rate through their tender behavior. Yet, the Bundesbank obviously did not want to give a signal for lower prime rates shortly after interests went up in the United States. The other side of this policy is that the longer the Central Bank Council waits, the more pressure on it will increase -- at home, in case the domestic economy does not rebound, and in terms of foreign policy through the partner countries that want to get out of the recession with cheap money. France, Belgium, and Denmark in particular, tied their prime rates so quickly again to the German level that they cannot do anything without the Bundesbank. Solo actions like those of spring 1993 are not possible this time. The members of the European Monetary System [EMS] learned their lesson from last July's crisis, that the markets punish a lack of stability awareness through devaluation. Although the dilemma of the Bundesbank is understood, hope in neighboring countries for further interest cuts remains almost undisturbed. The reason for it is invariably seen by market participants in the poor economy and high unemployment in almost all European Union [EU] countries. Evidence that the change in U.S. interests is not applicable to Europe was supplied by two EU members earlier this week. On Monday, Belgium defied the turbulences on the financial markets and cut its monetary market interests, albeit only by narrow margin. EMS Members Are Waiting for Action in Frankfurt On Tuesday [8 February] the Bank of England followed with a slight reduction of its basic lending rate. Politicians are waiting, and the markets speculate with further steps by the central banks -- in Britain as well as almost everywhere else in West Europe. In the EMS, Italy, Spain, and Portugal may still have some room to maneuver for an independent policy. Everybody else must hope for action in Frankfurt.
