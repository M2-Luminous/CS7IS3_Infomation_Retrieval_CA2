FR941028-0-00030 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (a)(2) of §773.24 provides, in language similar to that contained in paragraph (a)(1) of the regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation is not available to any person who ``is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation.'' Paragraph (a)(3) of §773.24 provides that any applicant or person shown in AVS to be linked by ownership or control to a person cited in a State violation notice may challenge the status of the violation before the State that issued the violation notice. The challenge must be made in accordance with the State's program equivalents to paragraphs (b) through (d) of §773.24 and §773.25. Again, the challenge may not involve the existence of the violation at the time it was cited, and is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination with respect to status of the violation. Paragraph (b) of §773.24 requires that any applicant or other person seeking to challenge ownership or control links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations must submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The information must be submitted to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC. Paragraph (c) of §773.24 provides that, in response to a challenge made under paragraph (b) of that section, OSM must make a written decision with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. Paragraph (d)(1) of §773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the ownership or control link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, OSM is required to provide notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. If an application is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending. Further, OSM is required to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which has been made. Paragraph (d)(2) of §773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the challenged ownership or control link has not been shown to be erroneous and has not been rebutted, and that the violation remains outstanding, OSM must provide notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. If an application is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending. Further, OSM is required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of §773.24 provides that OSM must serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other challenger by certified mail, or by any other means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The regulation provides that service is complete upon tender of the notice or of the mail and is not deemed incomplete by virtue of a challenger's refusal to accept the notice or mail. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of §773.24 provides that the applicant or other challenger can appeal OSM's decision to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days of such decision in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 et seq. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) further provides that OSM's decision remains in effect unless temporary relief was granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. The filing of an appeal will not automatically suspend the use of the information in AVS during the pendency of such appeal. The challenger must explicitly seek such relief in appeal proceeding before OHA. Section 773.25 is a new section which establishes standards for challenges to ownership or control links and for challenges to the status of violations. The section allocates responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory authorities for resolving issues related to ownership and control and provides the standards for evidence to resolve such issues. Paragraph (a) of §773.25 provides that provisions of §773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning an ownership or control link to any person or the status of any violation covered by a violation notice when such challenge is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); §§773.23 (the regulatory authority's review of ownership or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS); or 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions). Paragraph (b) of §773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations. Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of §773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the application. Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of §773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a permit has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permit. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of §773.25 provides that the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the violation.
