After the success scored in the 1992 local elections, the Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party, which had won then 15 percent of the votes, had no similar performance in the parliamentary elections held the same year, currently holding representation only in the Senate. Victor Surdu says: "We are looking for a new programme, based on the doctrine called modern agrarianism, of neoliberal concept, which sets property beyond everything. Starting from Romania's ties, we consider that we must gather all our efforts to solve the issues confronting Romania's agriculture such as involving a major number of extremely active people in the agriculture. If we start this important economic sector, job opportunities will show for almost 60 percent of the population, for which we could provide social protection and the dignity to have a job." On the previous contacts with the ruling party and as regards the Agrarian Party's position as to the Vacaroiu cabinet, the Agrarian president said: "The dialogue with the Party of Social Democracy has led us to the conclusion that, if we cannot come into power, we are situated in the opposition which however supports the Vacaroiu government, but only under the provisions that government legislative decisions and initiatives would not run counter our programme." "After the dialogue with all parliamentary parties, the ruling Party of Social Democracy should assume full responsibility for everything that happens in Romania at present," Victor Surdu was quoted as saying.
