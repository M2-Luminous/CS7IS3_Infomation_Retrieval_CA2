FR940603-0-00145 FR940603-0-00029 If an occupational or associational group within a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This is an event which requires a change to the credit union's field of membership if the credit union is to continue to provide service. NCUA will permit a credit union to add to its field of membership a sold or spun off group to which it has been providing service, without regard to location, if the group requests continued service, documented by a letter from an official representative, on the group's letterhead where possible. II.A.3.c_Distress Situations If a major group within the field of membership of any federal credit union_whether occupational, associational, community or multiple group_suffers a severe economic reversal_e.g., a plant or base closing_one option for the credit union may be to diversify its field of membership by adding groups desiring to be served. If economically advisable, NCUA may facilitate the credit union's diversification efforts, to the extent and only until the credit union's viability is assured, by allowing the credit union to add occupational and associational groups without regard to location. To obtain this authorization, the credit union must submit a request for designation as a distressed credit union to its regional director. The decision will be based on the totality of the circumstances, including the severity of the economic problem, whether offsetting gains from the expansion of other groups currently in its field of membership are reasonably foreseeable, the availability of other groups able to be served, the likely cost the credit union will incur in reorienting itself to serve those groups, the competitive environment it is operating in, the effect on other credit unions, and the availability of alternatives such as merger. Prior to making a determination on this issue, NCUA may request such additional information, including a business plan, as may be appropriate. II.B_Interests of the Group to be Added Of primary concern to NCUA is that quality credit union service be provided to all groups served by a federal credit union. Therefore, with respect to each field of membership addition, NCUA requires documentation from each group to be added stating that it desires service from the applying credit union. II.C_Economic Advisability Prior to granting a field of membership addition, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely effect on the credit union's operations and financial condition and its likely effect on other credit unions. Most of the information needed for analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will already be available to NCUA through the examination and call reports; generally, nothing more will be needed. However, in particular cases, a regional director may ask for additional information prior to making a decision. With respect to a proposed addition's effect on other credit unions, the requirements on overlapping fields of membership set forth in Section IV.A.2 of Chapter 1 apply here as well. II.D_Documentation Required The documentation needed for community charter additions will vary substantially depending on the circumstances, and has been described in general terms above. For common bond and select group additions, which constitute the bulk of amendment requests, the procedures are more standardized. A federal credit union requesting such a change must submit a formal written request, using the Application for Field of Membership Amendment form shown in Appendix D, or its equivalent, to the appropriate NCUA regional director. The request must be signed by an authorized credit union representative. The Application for Field of Membership Amendment form must be accompanied by the following: •A letter signed by an official representative of the group to be added. Wherever possible, this letter must be submitted on the group's letterhead stationery_regional directors may, at their discretion, however, accept such other documentation or certification as they deem appropriate. This letter must indicate: •that the group wants to be added to the applicant federal credit union's field of membership; •whether the group presently has any credit union service available; •the number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations; and •in the case of a select group addition, the group's proximity to one of the credit union's service facilities to which the group has access. •If the group is eligible for membership in any other credit union, documentation must be provided to support inclusion of the group under the standards set forth in Section IV.B of Chapter 1. •If the group to be included is an associational group, the credit union must, where required as established in Chapter 1, also provide a copy of the group's charter and bylaws defining the group's purpose, membership classes, and geographical area. III_Additions Through Consolidation With Another Credit Union NCUA supports credit unions desiring to remain a separate entity. However, there are three other ways a federal credit union can expand its field of membership, two of which result in a credit union's ceasing to exist_by taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger or a purchase and assumption (P&A), or by taking a portion of a continuing credit union's field of membership through a spin-off. Spin-offs are discussed in Section VI of this Chapter. III.A_Mergers Generally, the standards applicable to field of membership amendments apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a federal charter. In particular, where the merging credit union is state chartered, the field of membership rules applicable to a credit union converting to a federal charter apply. However, there are some differences:
