FR940606-2-00018 FR940606-2-00012 [Project No. 11264] Turbine Industries, Inc.; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment May 31, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for minor license for the proposed Coolemee Hydroelectric Project located on the South Yadkin River in the Town of Coolemee, Davie County, North Carolina, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (FEA) for the proposed project. In the FEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project and has concluded that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigative measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
