The prime minister had invited the leader of the opposition to tea to discuss the current economic situation in the country. It was proposed by the PM that the government would take the opposition into confidence regarding the steps to be taken in the forthcoming budget. Nawaz Sharif turning down Bhutto's offer has proposed to send two of his colleagues instead to attend the pre-budget briefing. The leader of the opposition in his letter has also proposed to discuss vital issues of national importance like Kashmir, nuclear programme and price hike on the floor of the House. Following is the text of Nawaz Sharifs letter: "Dear Prime Minister, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 29, 1994, inviting me for tea on June 5 for a discussion on the current economic situation. While thanking you for your invitation, I will be unable to attend personally, but will be happy to send one or two of my colleagues to attend the proposed pre-budget briefing. In the context of your invitation to the leader of the opposition for a discussion on economic issues. I do wish to express some views on the relations between the government and the opposition. First, I find a wide gap, which is sadly increasing between your pronouncements and your practices. For instance, I am being invited for tea at a time where your government's vilification and victimisation of the opposition has reached new heights. Our government in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] was destabilised through illegal means in a bid to capture total power in the country. The leaders and workers of PML [Pakistan Muslim League] and its allied parties are being victimised and subjected to the worst form of vilification at the hands of the PPP [Pakistan People's Party]-controlled official and electronic media. Second, as I stated in your presence in my speech of the National Assembly on October 19, 1993, my role and that of my party remains one of an issue-oriented opposition engaged in constructive criticism of official policies in the larger national interest. I hope you would agree with me that the current security and economic situation in the country is too grave to leave much room for scoring political points which seems to be your government's primary endeavour vis-a-vis the opposition. I am ready to discuss issues of vital national interest like Kashmir, the nuclear question and the price hike in the National Assembly, since, it is most suitable and representative forum for such discussions". Sincerely, (Signed) Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.
