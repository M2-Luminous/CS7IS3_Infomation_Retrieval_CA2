FR941110-1-00018 FR941110-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [Region II Docket No. 131, NJ 15&hyph;1&hyph;6341; FRL&hyph;5104&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plan Revision, State of New Jersey AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve portions of a request from New Jersey to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) related to the control of carbon monoxide and disapprove remaining portions. EPA is proposing approval of New Jersey's vehicle miles travelled forecast, carbon monoxide emission inventory, oxygenated fuels rule, and multi-state coordination. EPA is also proposing approval of the employee commute option and transportation control measures as contingency measures. In addition, EPA is proposing a limited approval and a limited disapproval of New Jersey's new source review regulation which covers all nonattainment pollutants. EPA proposes to disapprove New Jersey's November 15, 1993, proposal for an enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In addition, the attainment demonstration is also being disapproved since it relies on the enhanced inspection and maintenance program as a control measure. These revisions have been submitted in response to requirements established in the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: William J. Muszynski, P.E., Deputy Regional Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278 Attention: William S. Baker. Copies of the State submittal are available at the following addresses for inspection during normal business hours: Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, Library, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 402, New York, New York 10278. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Energy, Bureau of Air Quality Planning, 401 East State Street, CN027, Trenton, New Jersey 08625. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William S. Baker, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 26 Federal Plaza, room 1034A, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;2517. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, sets forth a number of requirements that states designated as moderate nonattainment for carbon monoxide had to submit as revisions to their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by November 15, 1992. These requirements are: an attainment demonstration, an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, an oxygenated fuels rule, a vehicle miles travelled forecast, contingency measures, a carbon monoxide emission inventory, a revised New Source Review program, and multi-state coordination. In addition, a conformity plan is required to be submitted by November 25, 1994. On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to its carbon monoxide SIP that addressed each of the above requirements for its two moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment areas. In addition, in a submittal dated October 4, 1993, New Jersey submitted to EPA information on TCMs which New Jersey will use as a contingency measure. The New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is classified as a moderate 2 area (an area that has a design value of 12.8&hyph;16.4 ppm.), while the other area, Camden County, is classified as a moderate 1 area (an area with a design value of 9.1&hyph;12.7 ppm). The New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is part of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and includes the Counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, and parts of Passaic. The nonattainment area in Passaic County includes the Cities of Clifton, Paterson, and Passaic. The remainder of the State is either in attainment or is not classified. EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how it intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted in order to meet title I requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the title I requirements and what EPA views as necessary to adequately comply with title I provisions. The following summarizes EPA's evaluation of New Jersey's SIP submittals and EPA's proposed actions. The details of EPA's review of New Jersey's submittals are contained in the Technical Support Document available at EPA's Region II office. Attainment Demonstration Section 187(a)(7) of the Act requires each state that contains all or part of a moderate 2 area to submit to the Administrator an attainment demonstration by November 15, 1992. This attainment demonstration should document how the State will attain the 8-hour carbon monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 9 ppm by December 31, 1995.
