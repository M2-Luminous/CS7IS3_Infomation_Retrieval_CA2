[Hornak] At the opening of his news conference, Roman Kovac confirmed that at 0900 today he handed his resignation letter to President Michal Kovac. He repeated the reasons for his resignation. The main reason he gave was that he did not wish to be the cause of increased tension in our society. Neither did he want to see yet another wave of confrontation between the Cabinet and the president. Answering a question as to what in his view is the future of the Alternative of Political Realism, Roman Kovac said that the Alternative was formed within the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. It has proposed a certain solution to the political crisis and has called for a return to democratic principles. At present, those deputies who have subscribed to the ideas of the Alternative are not changing their view. Speaking about his future political line, Roman Kovac said that Slovakia needs a consensus and that, at present, on the basis of that consensus, he has held talks with the representatives of the National-Democratic Club [of the Slovak National Party], the Alliance of Democrats, and some nonparliamentary parties. This is all for the time being from the presidium of the government.
