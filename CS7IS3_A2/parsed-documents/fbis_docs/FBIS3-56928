According to RID sources, the People's Movement of Belarus [NDB] has reaffirmed its intentions to participate in early elections. It has also claimed that it has better chances than its opponents expect. Moreover, in the course of preparation for its congress, due in February, NDB will select candidates for the Shadow Government of National Salvation. A recently released statement confirms NDB aspirations to play an important role on the political Olympus: "No `coalition' or `alternative' government will be approved without NDB's acceptance. Any new government is doomed to failure without our approval."
