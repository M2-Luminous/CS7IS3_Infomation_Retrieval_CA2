In my opinion, it unequivocally talks about certain ways to handle economic enterprises. Sometimes we turn our backs on the truth and opt for dreams or mirages. Pozo discusses in his characteristic and direct language the issue of the profits that the tourism sector earns for the country. He says there is talk of $700 million in gross revenues in 1993, when the important thing is to know the net figure actually earned and to ascertain that it at least approaches the median that indicates efficient and effective work. I quote my colleague: There are examples of countries which earn many dollars a year in this regard, yet they have spent many more to earn them. Pozzo adds: This is nothing but a red herring, so it is not a matter of concentrating on the big figure. The important thing is to analyze it and learn if the actual benefits, the clean and absolute benefits, of that overall amount truly represent proof that all the necessary and adequate things are being done in each case. Pozo insists that if our tourism sector spends more than 60 cents seeking external resources for each $1 it earns, we cannot talk about an efficient enterprise. An optimum benefit means most of the products and services demanded by the sector should be local. In addition, it would be necessary to analyze how many employees we have per room in our hotels and how much money we collect from renting the facilities. It is not the same to attain $20,000 per room every year than to collect $40,000 per unit, as it happens in other nations. The author indicates that the change in structure which resulted in the National Tourism Institute's disappearance strives to abolish inefficiency. Alberto Pozo adds: A 40-percent occupancy rate cannot be considered efficient, much less when capitalists believe a 40-percent occupancy rate means the hotel is bankrupt. In fact, they close the hotel when it reaches a 65-percent occupancy rate. In other words, many issues must be considered when dealing with an economic evaluation. If we only review one issue, we may see what truly does not exist. This is something we progressively assume, if we bear in mind that figures, number, costs, and profits were not a cardinal concern for many people until recently, when the belt was tightened to the limit. Then it was time to begin counting cents to see what could exactly be done with them. If economic officials have to be precise and careful on these issues, I cannot but warn that the media must inform the people about these problems with the same care so the people's perception is as exact as possible. I believe Alberto Pozo, the dean of journalism, is giving us all a clear example of what must be done and how it should be done.
