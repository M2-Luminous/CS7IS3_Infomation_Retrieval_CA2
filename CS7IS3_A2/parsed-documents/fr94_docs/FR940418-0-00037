FR940418-0-00037 FR940418-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC44 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Emergency Rule To List the Saint Francis' Satyr as Endangered AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Emergency rule. SUMMARY: The Service exercises its emergency authority to determine the Saint Francis' satyr ( Neonympha mitchellii francisci ) to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This butterfly is known from a single locality in North Carolina. Recent heavy collecting pressure has resulted in a reduction of the only known population and is believed to pose an imminent threat to the butterfly's existence. Protection from collecting is needed during the species' 1994 flight season while the Service proceeds with adopting permanent protection in accordance with the Act's requirements. This emergency rule will implement Federal protection for 240 days. A proposed rule to list the Saint Francis' satyr as endangered is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The proposed rule provides for public comment and a hearing (if requested). EFFECTIVE DATE: This emergency determination is effective on April 18, 1994 and expires on December 14, 1994. Due to the need for protecting the St. Francis' satyr from the effects of collecting, the Service finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective upon publication, as provided by 50 CFR 424.18(b)(1) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Asheville Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville, North Carolina 28806. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Nora Murdock at the above address (704/665&hyph;1195, Ext. 231). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Neonympha mitchellii francisci is a subspecies of one of two North American species of Neonympha. One of the rarest butterflies in eastern North America, it was described by Parshall and Kral in 1989 from material collected in North Carolina. These authors estimated that the single known population probably produced less than 100 adults per year. Shortly thereafter, Saint Francis' satyr was reported to have been collected to extinction (Refsnider 1991, Schweitzer 1989). The subspecies was rediscovered at the type locality in 1992 during the course of a Service-funded status survey. The Act defines ``species'' to include ``any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife␣*␣*␣*.'' Therefore, although N. m. francisci is recognized taxonomically as a subspecies, it will be referred to as a ``species'' throughout the remainder of this emergency rule. Saint Francis' satyr is a fairly small, dark brown butterfly and is a typical member of the Satyrinae, a subfamily of the Nymphalidae family, which includes many species commonly called satyrs and wood nymphs. The wingspan for the species ranges from 34 to 44 mm (Opler and Malikul 1992). Saint Francis' satyr and Mitchell's satyr, the northern subspecies ( N. m. mitchellii ), which was classified as endangered on May 20, 1992 (57 FR 21569), are nearly identical in size and show only a slight degree of sexual size dimorphism (Hall 1993, Parshall and Kral 1989). Like most species in the wood nymph group, Saint Francis' satyr has conspicuous ``eyespots'' on the lower surfaces of the wings. These eyespots are dark maroon brown in the center, reflecting a silver cast in certain lights. The border of these dark eyespots is straw yellow in color, with an outermost border of dark brown. The eyespots are usually round to slightly oval and are well-developed on the fore wing as well as on the hind wing. The spots are accented by two bright orange bands along the posterior wing edges and two darker brown bands across the central portion of each wing. Saint Francis' satyr, like the nominate subspecies, can be distinguished from its North American congener, N. areolata, by the latter's well-marked eyespots on the upper wing surfaces and brighter orange bands on the hind wing, as well by its lighter coloration and stronger flight (Refsnider 1991, McAlpine et al. 1960, Wilsman and Schweitzer 1991, Hall 1993).
