In the light of this, speculation about the "collapse of the Russian plan to settle the Karabakh problem" is emerging. The warring sides accuse each other of escalating hostilities and of armed provocation aimed at sabotaging agreements on a cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops to previously agreed positions. So what next? Have all possibilities for a peaceful solution to the conflict been exhausted? Here is what Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, has to say about the situation which has emerged: "Agreement on a 1 March cease-fire was reached and honored. But in respect of the troop withdrawal, there have been definite problems here. Mutual recriminations will continue until such times as the rival armies are separated. Acting as a mediator in this instance, I cannot because of this believe either side at the moment. To back up his words Georgiy Kondratyev produced two telegrams sent to the Russian Defense Ministry by the chairmen of the Azerbaijani and Armenian military departments concerning the status of hostilities on the morning of 3 March. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces chief of General Staff reports that the Armenian side continues to attack Azeri positions from the populated areas of Ashagi, Seydakhmeldy, and Kargan. The Armenian defense minister also reports that hostilities took place in this region, but makes no mention of the Azerbaijani Army's offensive reported by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's military department. "So who is to be believed?" Colonel General Kondratyev continues. "Until a 15- to 20-km security zone is set up, units and subunits from both sides are withdrawn from this zone, and posts erected with the participation of Russian observers, I, as a neutral party, cannot accuse either side of violating the agreements. In other words, until I have my own 'eyes' there, I cannot say precisely who began the offensive. As we know, on 2 March the Russian Defense Ministry delivered a list of the latest proposals for the cessation of hostilities in the conflict region. In particular, the first point proposes that all sides take the necessary measures to continue honoring the cease-fire regime. In the second and third points it is proposed that the sides withdraw combat hardware and armaments to the agreed areas in the period 2 through 4 March. It is also proposed that in the period 3 through 5 March the parties implement the mutual separation of the sides' troops in two sectors, Mardakert and Fizuli, with the subsequent erection there of mixed observation posts. The Armenian Defense Ministry wholly agreed to honor all its commitments -- but only if representatives of the Azerbaijani Army and the army of Nagorno-Karabakh do the same. In its turn, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry categorically refused to carry out points two and three and demanded the liberation of territories seized by Armenian armed formations. While the army of Nagorno-Karabakh, laying down no conditions, expressed a readiness to take all measures to continue upholding the cease-fire regime, and by the evening of 2 March it had begun the partial withdrawal of armored equipment from the front line.... Obviously, the situation is extremely complex. And without a more detailed study, Russia cannot honor its commitments enshrined in the talks protocol ratified by all four sides. Here, Russia is assigned the right, in the event of a violation of the accords reached on the cessation of hostilities in the security zones and monitored areas, to apply all necessary measures of influence, up to and including military measures, against formations which have flouted the terms of the current protocol. This protocol provision cannot work, as the actual security zone does not exist today; it is marked only on the maps of the Russian Defense Ministry representatives. "Even if our proposals are ignored, we will not, nevertheless, sit back with arms folded," Georgiy Kondratyev says. "I have already met with Azerbaijan's ambassador in Moscow and proposed that a plenipotentiary representative of the highest rank be appointed for negotiations. We will fly with him to Armenia and resume talks. As for the Russian soldiers, they will not be seen in the conflict region, according to a statement by Colonel General Kondratyev, until the gunfire abates and the hostile sides are disengaged.
