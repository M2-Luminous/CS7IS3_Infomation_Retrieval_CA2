That attitude has allowed 70 percent of workers to be directly involved in the production of goods and for the rest to be employed in technical, administrative, and management positions. Noel Lopez, a Minag delegate in Matanzas, stated that with the creation of 41 Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], work relations have improved even more. He stated that even though UBPC's have not been created in the pork, fish, and citrus branches, organizational measures have increased the number of workers who directly participate in production. He stated that in Matanzas' citrus sector, 83 percent of the more than 600 excess workers from various sectors are now directly employed in agricultural tasks.
