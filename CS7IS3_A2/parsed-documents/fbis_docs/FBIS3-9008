At a session of KK it was stressed, among other things, that the protests are not sufficiently coordinated and that they started at the wrong time. However, the trade union does not intend to abandon the action, because it can see that the strikes "are softening" the government. If the talks with Prime Minister Pawlak, scheduled to be held on Friday [18 March], end up in failure, "S" might stage a one-day general strike. The greater part of the KK session was closed to the press. To Be There Before Spychalska "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski said that it would be enough if the talk with the prime minister lasted the scheduled one hour, or even 15 minutes, if Pawlak says that he will implement the "S" demands. If not, there is too little time. An hour after the meeting with Krzaklewski, the prime minister has an appointment to meet with Ewa Spychalska, chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Union's Agreement. It can be expected that the "S" chairman will want to avoid a troublesome meeting. The heads of all the regions and branches are supposed to wait in Warsaw for the results of the meeting with the prime minister. Should the negotiations end up in failure, "S" will organize a mass protest, declares Krzaklewski. Asked whether lignite mines will also participate in the action, he said that he did not know that yet, but he was just leaving for a meeting with the Strike Committee. The Lignite Section (its plants supply 50 percent of the country's energy) does not exclude the possibility of strikes if the government accepts the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] bill. The union decided to start the sixth collective bargaining session with the government. This time the problem is the fact that the "Pact on Enterprise" is not being implemented. "S" Pickets in Front of the Sejm At 0830 today, "S" will start picketing the Sejm building, protesting the new popiwek bill. According to preliminary estimates of "S," participating in the protest throughout Thursday will be approximately 3,000 people, not counting the inhabitants of Warsaw. "S" announces that the picket will end only after the bill is either adopted or rejected. Union members warned the picket participants to keep special calm, because on Thursday afternoon they would have to meet in front of the parliament building with the demonstration of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, protesting the metropolitan Warsaw bill. Between 0800 and 1200, as part of the "S" action, gas stations will not be selling gasoline in Bialystok Voivodship. Gasoline will only be sold to ambulances, fire brigade vehicles, and so on. On strike will also be the Rzeszow and Radom Regions -- the 2,000-person work force of the "Radoskor" is supposed to stop working for two hours. Yesterday, local transportation workers in Katowice and several dozen plants in the Bydgoszcz region were on strike. KK adopted the budget for the first six months. The union's receipts in that period (17.5 billion zlotys) will equal outlays. The greatest amount of money comes from dues -- 13 billion zlotys; it spends the greatest amount on salaries for KK members -- 5 billion. The union has also earmarked some money for the organization of the congress -- 1 billion zlotys, and for the work of the Constitutional Committee ("S" plus extra-parliamentary center-rightist groupings) -- 140 million zlotys. The budget was criticized, among other people, by Mazowsze Region Head Maciej Jankowski, because too little money was allocated for the organization of demonstrations and training. "S" is indignant at the violation of human rights in China and will forward a letter to that government, in which it will demand that political prisoners be released. Signatures of "S" members will be collected on the letter. The union also criticized the behavior of the Polish delegation to the United Nations during voting on the resolution condemning human rights violations in China. The next congress of the union will be held in Mielec.
