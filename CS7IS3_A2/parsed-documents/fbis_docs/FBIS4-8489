FBIS4-8489 "dreeu072_y_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Government To Require Visas for UN Personnel Government To Require Visas for UN Personnel LD1304172494 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 1646 GMT 13 Apr 94 LD1304172494 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- At this evening's session, presided over by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the federal government considered current questions of cooperation with the UN peacekeeping forces and decided that prior permission of the Yugoslav Government is necessary for the entry and movement of UN Protection Forces' [UNPROFOR] vehicles on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Visas from the competent Yugoslav authorities will also be necessary, from 20 April, for the entry and residence of every member of the "Blue Helmets" in the FRY, the Federal Information Ministry has announced. The federal government assessed that the UN peacekeeping forces, with their invitation to NATO to bomb Serb positions around Gorazde, have completely sided with the Muslim side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and ignored the vital fact that it was precisely the Muslim forces, exploiting the safe zone, which attacked Serb positions first. The federal government stated these facts with regret and once again condemned in the sharpest terms this behavior by UNPROFOR and the armed action of NATO. In the assessment of the federal government, these acts directly threaten the peace process and could lead to the escalation of the conflict, not only in this area but in a broader region. In its cooperation with UNPROFOR hitherto, the Yugoslav Govenment was guided by its interest in the cessation of combat operations as soon as possible and in the reaching of a just solution through negotiations. It worked to the best of its ability and within its limited capabilities, to make it easier for UNPROFOR to perform its functions. The federal government did this, it was concluded, with huge sacrifices and efforts under the conditions of the unjustly imposed UN Security Council sanctions against the FRY, which contravene the UN Charter. The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked with informing the UNPROFOR main headquarters about the conclusions of the federal government, a statement by the Federal Ministry of Information says in conclusion.
