The president told the press that after he announced his intention to submit to the National Congress a bill to remove forced recruitment from the Constitution, General Luis Alonso Discua, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed Forces, telephoned him to congratulate him. He described as "part of the democratic give and take" the statements made Thursday by other top military leaders, reiterating their disagreement with the measure, which relieves young men between 18 and 30 years old from compulsory military service. Reina's bill proposes instead the creation of "a voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service." In addition, the deputies of the opposition National Party of Honduras said today they will have to review the bill with the military before it reaches the plenum of the legislative chamber. Constitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds of the 128 deputies and must be ratified by the legislature the following year to enter into force. Meanwhile, Gladys Lanza, one of 10 people who went on a hunger strike 10 days ago to pressure the government to repeal compulsory military service, told reporters she will not stop her fast until there is a final decision on the matter. President Reina acknowledged today in remarks to the press that compulsory military service "has been terribly unjust," because it has only been imposed on the poor, and military chiefs themselves have admitted that young men in the batallions have been mistreated.
