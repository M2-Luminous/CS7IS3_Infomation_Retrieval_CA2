FR940324-2-00067 FR940324-2-00042 This subsection applies to services demonstration project applicants only. Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372): Applications for services demonstration projects, submitted in response to this announcement are subject to the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of applications for Federal financial assistance. Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application(s) and to receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit. The SPOC should send any state process recommendations to the following address: Director, Office of Evaluation, Extramural Policy, and Review, Center for Mental Health Services, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 18C&hyph;07, Rockville, MD 20857, Attn: Spoc. The due date for State process recommendations is no later than 60 days after the deadline date for the receipt of applications. The CMHS does not guarantee to accommodate or explain SPOC comments that are received after the 60-day cut-off. This subsection applies to the services demonstration project applicants only. Role of Federal Staff in Cooperative Agreements: The Cooperative Agreement mechanism includes substantial post-award Federal programmatic participation in the conduct of the project. It is anticipated that CMHS staff participation in this program will be substantial. In addition to the general project officer function of monitoring the conduct and progress of the services demonstration projects and making recommendations about continuance of the project, CMHS staff will be active participants in planning and implementing the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program through participation on the steering committee, promoting exchange of relevant information among the services demonstration projects, and participating in and/or providing support services for training, evaluation, and data collection. CMHS staff will also monitor the function and activities of the coordinating center, assuring that progress is satisfactory, and required reporting is timely. A program representative from CMHS, BHRD and NIMH will participate on the steering committee, each with a single vote. Application Procedures: All applicants must use application form PHS 5161&hyph;1 (Rev. 7/92), which contains Standard Form 424 (face page). The following information should be typed in Item Number 10 on the face page of the application form: RFA # SM&hyph;94&hyph;02: HIV/AIDS Services Demonstration (for services demonstration projects).
