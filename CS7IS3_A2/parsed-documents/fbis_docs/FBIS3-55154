But the unexpected success in the parliamentary elections of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party, voicing ultraradical views of restoring the USSR and of the new Russia's foreign policy "added fuel" to the smoldering fire. First in Vilnius the Baltic Council of the three former Soviet republics asked for guarantees from the West, then the nerve of politicians in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary failed. "Poland will press for the countries of East Europe to be admitted to NATO most speedily," Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said. "Acceding to NATO could be a means for Hungary and other countries in the region to reliably join Europe and provide weighty guarantees of security and stability," Hungary's new prime minister, Peter Boross, stressed at a 22 December press conference. Europe calmed down somewhat after Boris Yeltsin's statement regarding the immutability of Russia's foreign policy and the announcement of the Federal Assembly election results: The rumor of the overwhelming victory won by the Liberal Democratic Party and the national-patriots proved somewhat exaggerated. But the question of NATO's possible eastward progress has not been withdrawn once and for all. What is more, Russian diplomacy is confronted with new tasks. First, organizing reliable contacts with Federal Assembly deputies, who are already seen to be not at all inclined to toe the executive line. Second, proposing a clear program for cooperation with all-European structures. A base for this is in place: During his recent visit to Brussels Boris Yeltsin signed an all-embracing political declaration on cooperation with the European Union -- a declaration that has made it possible to view with hope the prospects for Russia's economic relations with the EU. But there is no such treaty with the Council of Europe, the Western European Union, or NATO. Dialogue with the NACC opens up extensive opportunities in this connection. Set up three years ago, it is in our view fully justifying its existence during the transition from confrontation to East-West partnership. "The NACC is unique in that it operates at the meeting point of the interests of West, Central, and East Europe," Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, rightly pointed out at the Council session in Brussels. For NATO countries it provides an opportunity to transform the North Atlantic alliance with consideration for the radically changing nature of the threats to European and international peace. It provides Russia and other countries in the former USSR with a practical mechanism for partnership with their former adversaries in the most sensitive sphere of security. For the countries of Central and East Europe it means an opportunity to eliminate the sense of a certain "security vacuum" without expanding NATO. What is more, there is an interest common to all -- that of jointly countering new challenges to peace and stability on our continent.
