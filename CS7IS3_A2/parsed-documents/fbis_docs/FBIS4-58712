A spokesman for the ALF Central Committee has stated that the ALF condemns this agreement, announces that it rejects it, and that it will not comply with all that results from it. This is because this agreement is the result of successive concessions that began at Madrid and continued until the Gaza-Jericho agreement was reached. The statement [as heard] said: We are confident that such agreements cannot cancel our historic right to our entire homeland or prevent our people from continuing their struggle as part of a comprehensive Arab confrontation that will undoubtedly come under the banner of the immortal Mother of Battles led by the nation's knight and hero and the Arab mujahid leader, Saddam Husayn.
