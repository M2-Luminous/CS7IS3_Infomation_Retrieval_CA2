The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word article by Pak Tu-sik on the true intention behind North Korea replacing the fuel rods. The article begins: The ROK, the United States, the IAEA, and Western countries agree that if "North Korea replaces the fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA," it will lead to a "catastrophe." Citing that such a decision by North Korea is a "reckless plot" to further their own interest, the article stresses that "no decision can be made" until the IAEA inspection team makes a "report" on the result of its inspection. After noting that North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods is a way to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the article points out the replacement work may only be in its preparatory stage and that the actual replacement of the fuel rods has not begun. The article concludes that the judgment of the IAEA inspection team will determine if North Korea has actually started replacing the fuel rods at its atomic reactor. The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 3 publishes a 900-word article by Nam Chan-sun in Washington on the true intention of North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods of its atomic reactor without the presence of the IAEA inspection team. The article gives four reasons for such a decision: First, North Korea publicized its decision to replace the fuel rods in order to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date. Second, there is a high possibility that North Korea is using the fact that the IAEA inspection team, which will leave for North Korea on 15 May, will inspect the five megawatt-class atomic reactor anyway. Third, the decision is aimed at obtaining publicity from home and abroad of its position by rejecting the claims by the United States and the IAEA that the replacement of the fuel rods must not be carried out without the presence of the IAEA. Fourth, there is a possibility that it was necessary to replace the fuel rods to maintain the safety of North Korea's facilities and meet technological demands, as North Korea claims. The article concludes by reporting that no decision can be made until the IAEA inspection team concludes its inspection. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 800-word editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Bringing About UN Sanctions." The editorial notes that it seems that the United States and the ROK have been "dragged along by North Korea's nuclear strategy." Noting that North Korea has a habit of unilaterally severing and then resuming negotiations at the last moment, its decision to replace the fuel rods is intended to "drive a wedge" in holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Citing that North Korea is trying to settle for a package deal of "improving relations with the United States, obtain support for its light-water reactor, achieve economic cooperation, and conclude a peace agreement on the Korean peninsula," the editorial notes that since North Korea's true intention has now become clear, "the United States must take a more resolute measure" regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. The editorial reports that if North Korea does not stop the replacement of the fuel rods and does not receive IAEA inspections, this will only lead to sanctions by the UN Security Council. The editorial repeatedly urges that as a responsible member of the international society, North Korea must work to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully. KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 1,200-word article by Yi Chong-yon in Washington on North Korea's unilateral notification that it has started the replacement of the fuel rods at its atomic reactor. The article reports that diplomatic sources in Washington analyze that North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods is a "strategic card to realize the DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date." The article reports that diplomatic sources feel it is very unlikely that North Korea replaced the fuel rods, but has only started safety inspections for replacement. The article continues that the United States will decide what to do after obtaining results by the IAEA inspection team. The article concludes that it will be decided to present the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council after the IAEA carries out its inspection next week. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim Cha-su entitled "The Government's Reaction to the Replacement of Fuel Rods by North Korea." Referring to the government's embarrassment regarding North Korea's 14 May announcement that it has independently begun changing fuel rods at its five megawatt-class nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, the article writes: "This is because the government has so far adhered to the strong position that it will resume the discussions on sanctions against North Korea if it begins changing fuel rods at the nuclear reactor without IAEA supervision." Noting the government's analysis of North Korea's public announcement that it has begun changing fuel rods, the article reports that the government will formulate concrete plans to deal with North Korea after IAEA inspectors complete their inspection activities in North Korea. The article reports: "The government stresses that it has no other choice but discuss sanctions against North Korea with other countries concerned if the IAEA declares the continuity of the nuclear safeguards has been suspended, and that it has decided to convey such a position to North Korea through various channels," referring to the government's attention to North Korea's remarks to the IAEA that the issue of selecting and preserving fuel rods can be resolved at the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. The article continues that the government is ready to deal with North Korea, believing that this week it will be determined if the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved peacefully. The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word article by Washington-based reporter Chong Hae-yong entitled: "Washington's Position on North Korea's Replacement of Fuel Rods." Referring to the contents of North Korea's message sent to the IAEA on 12 May and analysis by Washington-based sources of the background of North Korea's replacement of the fuel rods, the article reports that North Korea's announcement to change fuel rods is intended to hold negotiations with the IAEA, as well as to discuss economic cooperation and establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States. CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 700-word article by reporter U Tae-chun entitled: "The Present Conditions of an Experimental Nuclear Reactor in Yongbyon." The article reports that "North Korea has operated an experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon since 1986." The article concludes: "Western experts believe that the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon will turn out to be a nuclear reprocessing plant after noting its size based on data provided by North Korea to the IAEA and the basic reason for the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear reactor and the method of extracting plutonium from the spent nuclear fuel."
