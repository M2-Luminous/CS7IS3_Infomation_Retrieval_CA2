The reason, as the FITUR statement said, is that "lately the American AFL-CIO representation in Russia has been increasingly intensifying its fight against the independent trade unions of Russia with the purpose of destroying those trade unions that take a position of independence and defend both the interests of the workers and the national interests of the country." In the process, in the opinion of federation members, the American trade unions' representation is "searching" for those among the Russian trade union leaders who "can be bought for dollars," artificially creating "shell" trade union organizations that could feed on the difficulties of the stage of formation of the independent trade union movement. In the opinion of the statement's authors, "the role of the so-called Association of Independent Trade Unions of Russia"--recently created within the framework of the Russian-American Foundation for Trade Union Research and Education and financed by the U.S. Congress--"is precisely this--to imitate such `trade union' activities whereby the workers, instead of fighting for their rights, would blindly follow the American policy course in our country." In this connection the leadership of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia asserted that the actions of the American AFL-CIO representation in Moscow "are aimed at undermining the national interests of Russia." As Aleksandr Alekseyev, FITUR chairman, told the SEGODNYA correspondent, the central coordinating council of his federation currently has information regarding "several Russian trade union leaders already having been bought by Americans." This, in turn, in Aleksandr Alekseyev's opinion, will lead in the near future to a situation whereby the activities of a number of Russian trade union organizations may end up "under U.S. control." In this situation, FITUR--one of the major trade union associations which includes representatives of metallurgical, oil, and machine-building industries, pilots and military servicemen, among others--intends to take response measures. Among them is creating on the basis of their trade unions the National Labor Party, which was registered several days ago with the Ministry of Justice. "We have one goal--to strive for the maximum participation of workers in the political life of the country for the purpose of building a `socially-oriented state,'" said Mr. Alekseyev. According to him, members of the party will act on the assumption that the basis of any state is labor; labor is the primary source of human rights and defines an individual's social freedom. Thus, in Mr. Alekseyev's opinion, labor for the good of the nation should become a social obligation of any citizen and the only criterion for determining social utility both of an individual and of various social groups.
