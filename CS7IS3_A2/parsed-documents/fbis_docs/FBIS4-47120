Sanctioned re-export shall be understood to mean the re-export of commodities with properly documented written permission issued by an authorized department of the country of origin of the commodities.

As one of the conditions the country of origin of the commodities may demand from the economic agent that is re-exporting a commitment to return to it a part but no more than half of the difference between the price of the transaction for re-exporting commodities and the price of the transaction for shipping the commodities out of the country of origin through transferring this difference in the currency of the transaction for re-export of the commodities into an account indicated by the authorized department of the country of origin of the commodities.

Article 5 The Parties have agreed that the issuance of permission for re-exportation may be refused if: information on the transaction that is known to be inaccurate is reported; there is use of dumping prices and other elements of an unconscientious trading practice which causes harm to the economic interests of the country of origin of the commodities; there are restrictions on the part of third countries against bringing the corresponding commodities onto their customs territory.

Article 7 The Parties have agreed that in the event that the volume of unsanctioned re-export of commodities causes economic harm to the country of origin of the commodities, the losing side can halt the delivery of these commodities to the state whose economic entities have allowed unsanctioned re-export or apply other sanctions envisioned by norms of international law. The burden of proof of the fact of unsanctioned re-export shall lie with the authorized department of the country of origin of the commodities.
