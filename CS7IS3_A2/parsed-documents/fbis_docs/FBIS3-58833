With his white paper on more growth, competitiveness, and employment, which he submitted at the EU summit in mid-December, he intends to fuel the European economy. In fact, the white paper Delors presented contains some correct principles. - The Commission is aware that the EU employment crisis must be overcome by creating internationally competitive new jobs and technological progress; employment programs of the old type are not suggested in the white paper. - The white paper recommends more flexibility in business and industry and a decrease in ancillary wage costs, without intending to lower the well-tested EU social standards. - Great importance is attached to the development of the infrastructure, not least in view of the Maastricht Treaty and the planned adjustment of the economic potential. The white paper, therefore, suggests measures for the development of European transport, energy, and telecommunications systems. There is just one snag to the white paper, however: If the Commission had its will, EU debts would increase further. At the same time, the European Union would be authorized to incur debts. The Commission suggests that the European Union should borrow an additional ECU8 billion -- less than 16 billion German marks [DM] -- annually, in addition to the existing programs. Following some resistance at the summit, the EU Council has ordered a study to analyze the matter. Right To Incur Debts at European Level The European Commission intends to use the program presented in the white paper in order to give the European Union a special right to incur debts. Such a right to indebtedness at the European level, however, is neither necessary nor desirable. It is not necessary because there are already enough instruments in the framework of the EU budget, some of which are exclusively envisaged for the financing of trans-European systems -- the cohesion fund, the structural fund, and the medium-term research framework program. In addition, the European Investment Bank can grant credits; the credit volume in 1993 was approximately ECU19 billion. Moreover, a European investment fund will be created in 1994 that will primarily deal with the financing of trans-European systems. Through this fund, approximately ECU30 billion can be mobilized. There is no indication that these funds will not be sufficient. The EU Budget Must Not Be Financed by Way of Credit A special right to indebtedness of the Commission is not desirable, because in this way, another debt vehicle would be opened that would develop its own dynamism. It would provide a loophole for member states to incur a debt that is not possible nationally. The European Treaty, therefore, says for good reason that the EU budget is not to be financed by way of credit, but solely from the member states' own funds. In addition, the Maastricht Treaty defines stability criteria for the future European monetary union. The upper ceiling of indebtedness in the member states should not exceed 60 percent, and new borrowing should not be higher than 3 percent of the GDP. The necessary efforts to observe the convergency criteria at the national level would lose much of their value, if borrowing were shifted to the European level. It is unacceptable that individual member states should try to fulfill the stability criteria, whereas the European Union could incur an excessively high debt. If this were possible, then this debt would have to be allowed for proportionately regarding the indebtedness of the member states, which, after all, have to pay for interest and amortization. In all member states, public debt has become a real obstacle to growth and employment. Any further debt increase in the European Union would complicate the necessary interest rate cuts and would thus hinder investment in new jobs. Investors and consumers are concerned about continuously increasing public debt. Everyone knows that sooner or later, the state must apply the emergency brake and initiate consolidation measures. The more indebted the countries are, the more painful the spending cuts, and the greater the need for tax increases. However, this is extremely harmful for the cycle and the employment market. What is more, the debt incurred by the Commission must also be serviced. For the necessary interest payments, the Commission must go to the member states to finance financing. This means that the member states' payments to the European Union would increase because of interest peyments. The wind that is currently blowing into the European Union's face is rather becoming stronger, as a result of such proposals and analyses. It is not necessary to create new debt vehicles, credit programs, and special debt options of the European Union. What is necessary, however, is to reduce debt at all levels and take the convergency criteria of the Maastricht Treaty seriously. If the available funds were not to be sufficient, readjustments must be made in the EU budget in favor of the measures mentioned in the white paper. In Europe, too, the debt mentality must be broken. The united Europe must not become a debt community. The disastrous impact of further debts will threaten growth, competitiveness, and thus the very goals that are to be implemented with the help of the white paper -- the decrease of unemployment and the improvement of competitiveness in Europe. I, therefore, call upon the Federal Government to reject clearly the Brussels debt plans.
