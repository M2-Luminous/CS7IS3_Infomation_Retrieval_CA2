A responsible source in the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry denied that the first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, had indicated during a press conference in Cairo yesterday that the subject of some GCC states' relations with the Iraqi regime would be discussed by the council. In a statement to Kuna, the source said "that Shaykh Sabah had explained in reply to a question in this regard during the above-mentioned press conference that diplomatic relations between these states and Iraq had not been severed at all so that they could be restored" and that this was exactly what Sabah had said. On the other hand, the source expressed his regret at Sudan's continued failure to condemn the Iraqi regime's aggression against Kuwait and its failure to demand that Iraq should abide by the legitimate UN resolutions related to that aggression. The source said that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's meeting in Cairo yesterday with Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu Salih was confined to a discussion of the item on the agenda of the Arab League meeting which was concerned with the southern Sudan. Here the source was commenting on what Radio Monte Carlo had broadcast quoting a Sudanese diplomat in Cairo who said that the meeting had dealt with the subject of what he claimed to be one hundred thousand Sudanese who had been working in Kuwait.
