For municipal representatives (councilmen), the Brazilian soap opera constitutes the first trial by fire during these warm nights. The number of voters who will decide to skip the soap opera will be larger in those places where there is more confidence in their performances. These meetings to "account for one's actions" represent an initial aspect of the Cuban "sui generis" democratic system, designed to facilitate people's participation in domestic affairs without interfering with the constitutional foundation of the single-party system. According to prevalent belief, the existence of a single party is justified by the need to have unity to preserve sovereignty in view of the pressure exerted by the Unites States, including an economic, commercial, and financial blockade and hundreds of hours of anti-government radio messages coming from that country on a daily basis. Although this concept -- applied to the party founded to organize last century's fight for independence -- has broad support, a stated government concern is to facilitate people's participation in elections where candidates are chosen by the neighbors themselves rather than by groups. The chosen ones are responsible for holding meetings with their constituencies at least twice a year to account for their actions. In addition, voters have the chance of dismissing the councilman who fails to accomplish his mission or who no longer meets the requirements to represent them. Theoretically, this system has countless advantages if compared with a representative democracy, whereby candidates are chosen by their own parties rather than by the population, and once they are chosen, their voters can no longer contact, criticize, or evaluate them. In practice, however, this system has some shortcomings that have conspired against it. This is something that high-ranking Cuban officials have recognized, although they believe overall results are positive, especially at times of crises when the population's full support is vital. One such problem is the elimination of formalism, once delegates (councilmen) fall under the influence of the bureaucratic plague. During the processes to account for one's actions prior to the summer (the other processes take place during the last months of the year) and with the help of democratic representatives, the aim is to give an identity to the search for solutions to the problems inherent in each community to meet the people's demands. Ernesto Suarez, National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) secretary, told a group of local journalists that we can see that this change of identity cannot be accomplished instantly, not even before the conclusion of the meetings held by the 13,685 councilmen. In some cases, these democratic representatives fail to attend the neighborhood meetings held to find solutions to water, hygiene, transportation, and food distribution problems, which the loss of Cuba's main trade partners, triggered by the fall of the European socialist world, exacerbated. In other cases, the tendency of these representatives is "to report" on their works and to gather new concerns in order to address them six months later. This system not only fails to involve the population in the process to solve problems, but also distorts the meaning these meetings have as a basic element of the democratic system. Suarez believes it is important to encourage people to exert their authority. Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon believes the trend indicates we are moving toward the creation of a true democratic system, although the country finds itself amid large raw materials shortages. Alarcon, who admits there are flaws, maintains that this mechanism to control the chosen ones, along with the power to dismiss them, places the Cuban system above other systems due to an irrefutable reason: the people's participation in the decisionmaking process. The Cuban parliament president points out one way to make progress in the creation of a real democracy is to prevent the processes to account for one's actions from becoming a ritual every six months. Most people, however, seem to be slightly concerned about the comparisons between the degrees of democracy in other countries and are more interested in reporting those elements that obstruct the good development of the community to their neighborhood representative. The search for solutions to deficiencies in the water supply and food distribution systems exceed any political arguments, which are stronger abroad than on the island. Cuban authorities are determined to prove the potential of a single-party democracy. Neither media reports on the progress of the processes to account for one's actions nor street rumors indicate there are enough arguments against the island's political system, although there are some criticisms of the shortcomings of the administrative system in many places. Although hardly reported abroad, these meetings between the chosen ones and their constituencies theoretically represent a revival of the original democracy, whereby ancient Greeks and their representatives would meet without the meddling of political parties. Despite this reasonable thesis, the Cuban system is facing obstacles larger that its nightly competition against "Felicidad;" it is attempting to overcome its own mistakes and weaknesses to show the world there can be a single-party democracy, although the predominant trend dictates just the opposite.
