FBIS4-56270 "drlat084_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Peru U.S. Charge Summoned, Receives `Strong Protest' U.S. Charge Summoned, Receives `Strong Protest' PY2904221194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2052 GMT 29 Apr 94 PY2904221194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 29 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Peru rejected a U.S. State Department statement on the alleged slaughter of civilians in the Peruvian jungle, and described the U.S. report as "unfriendly, inaccurate, and inappropriate." The Peruvian Foreign Ministry has announced that, in the absence of U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams, it had summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires Charles Brayshaw to personally convey the Peruvian Government's "strong protest" over this issue to him. On 28 April, State Department spokesperson Christine Shelly told reporters that the U.S. Government is concerned about "recent reports of the murder of civilians by Peruvian military forces in Huanuco Department, in the central Peruvian region." Shelly added that U.S. Government officials have asked Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori "to allow Red Cross personnel into the area where the massacre allegedly took place to determine the number of civilians murdered." The Peruvian Foreign Ministry states in its communique that Brayshaw was informed that "relations and agreements between Peru and the International Red Cross Committee exclusively concern the two parties. Thus, Peru will not accept any interference from third parties in these matters." After stating that Peru respects the independence of the Red Cross, the communique notes that it is "inappropriate" for the United States "to attempt to mediate in this case without having received any mandate from the Red Cross," and notes that "this kind of action may undermine the degree of autonomy the organization should have." The communique finally states that Peru considers it important to maintain a good level of relations with all friendly countries, "but it cannot accept that the struggle the Peruvian people are waging against terrorism be treated lightly, let alone be the subject of unsubstantiated prejudgments." The Peruvian Foreign Ministry was thus referring to the sources from which the State Department obtained its information, namely the National Human Rights Coordinating Board and a sector of the press, which have charged the military with having bombed some townships during "Operation Aries," which began on 5 April. The National Human Rights Coordinating Board retracted its charges later and admitted that no bombings had taken place, but it insisted on charging that urban areas had been hit by mortar fire and that some people were murdered by soldiers. Later, the Congressional Human Rights Committee and media organizations reported that there are no townships in the area of conflict, which is located on the left bank of the Huallaga River, but rather it is a stronghold of Shining Path terrorists. The congressional committee found the remains of several humans and asked the attorney general to investigate the death of those people. This task has been entrusted to a special prosecutor in the Tingo Maria Province, which has jurisdiction over the Huallaga zone.
