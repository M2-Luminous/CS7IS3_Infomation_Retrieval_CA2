Fighting crime, promoting reemployment, and reforming the country's welfare and health care system were the major initiatives included in Clinton's State of the Union Address Tuesday [25 January]. President Clinton is determined to tackle key domestic problems this year. This is obvious from his spirited one-hour speech before the House. He stated these goals will bring on renewal for the United States. Clinton asked the Congress to set aside partisan differences and pass the top crime bill. Clinton demanded increased funding for drug treatment, top penalties for those who choose violence, and more stringent measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The United States has seen a rush of street violence, something the President calls an American problem. To boost crime fighting, Clinton is asking for a new contingent of 100,000 community police officers. They will patrol the streets and allow the veterans to perform more sensitive work. If Congress approves this plan, it could contribute to the President's second goal -- increasing employment. Clinton said unemployment should be solved along with improving welfare and health care. Earlier, he indicated welfare reforms would have to wait for the much publicized health care package; but he seems to have reserved his stand, stressing that the two must be dealt with at once. He explained that better welfare is impossible without health care. President Clinton repeated a promise that his government would focus on workers' training. He wants to transform America's outdated unemployment system into what he called a reemployment system. Clinton put forward his health care reform plan last September. It features an employer-based system and guarantees health insurance for every citizen by 1996. This is something former President Richard Nixon promised more than 20 years go but never delivered. This time, President Clinton has asked Congress to pass the legislation on health care reform. Clinton's State of the Union Address also stresses the administration's deficit reduction plan. It supports cutting the federal budget deficit by half a trillion dollars in five years. Analysts say Clinton's approval rating has been on the rise, encouraging him to put forward both new reforms. However, Congress is sure to see a raging debate this year on the controversial health care package, along with other issues. Some congressmen and industrialists claim the new system will be unfair. The President is pleading for bipartisan support from Congress. The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has set a precedent for this, and Clinton could very well get the green light he is asking for.
