Just like Clinton, Scharping is also convinced that only he who stands on firm feet in domestic policy can act strongly and make himself heard in terms of foreign policy. The creation of jobs, the promotion of growth and securing social justice are, thus, the most important tasks in terms of foreign policy for both of them. Scharping has also taken up the cause of fighting crime. Just like Clinton before him, the chancellor candidate speaks of the necessity "to renew and modernize Germany." The demand to "reinvent the government and to trim bureaucracy" and to increase the efficiency of state services are to be found here and there. Clinton's call for public welfare reform contrasts with Scharping's reform of the welfare state. For both it is clear that the modernization of the economy can only be achieved through close cooperation between the state and the private economy. The state does not only have the task to provide a reliable framework for the economy but it also must participate in training and retraining employees, promotion of high technology, and speeding up the innovation process. Scharping does not forget either to support the call for "information highways," and, by trying to emerge somewhat from Clinton's shadow, he adds as a personal suggestion that the information highways should be extended across the Atlantic. Scharping emphasizes his similarity to Clinton also when responding to questions regarding his tax reform that just like Clinton he wanted to take some burden off investments and ask more money from high-income earners. Nobody from among his U.S. audience cared to ask whom Scharping counts among the high-income earners and where he would draw the line. The question how Scharping wanted to create jobs and maintain the high German wage level at the same time, is not being asked either. The lines along which Scharping is thinking become, however, obvious when he speaks of the nonsense of spending more than 100 billion German marks a year on unemployment benefits. He says that it is cheaper to keep unemployed on state job-creation schemes. Differences to Clinton do appear when the SPD chancellor candidate speaks about restoring social justice. He speaks convincingly about the industrial nation's duty to take care of "sustained global development" to preserve the environment. He remains vague in describing his social agenda; it also remained unclear what he has in mind when he speaks of the reform of the welfare state. His statement that "in Germany there are no excesses in the social system, but quite the contrary," met with lack of understanding. In a country in which such a social network does not even exist and in which "welfare as we know it" should be abolished and be replaced by the obligation to work, there is little understanding for the German social system.
