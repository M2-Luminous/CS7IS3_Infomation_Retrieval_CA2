He suggested in an interview with Interfax today that the Federation Council must recognize the legitimate character of the presidency of Johar Dudayev and send a delegation for talks on all issues concerning Russian-Chechen relations. As the Head of the Russian parliamentary delegation Fateyev visited the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the Chechen Republic and met Chechen President Johar Dudayev on his own initiative. Fateyev examined the present situation in Chechnya. "What doubts could there be about the legitimacy of Dudayev's presidency after the three years of his being in power?" Fateyev wondered. He believes that recognition of Chechen President Johar Dudayev by Moscow would be a move towards normalization of the situation which will bring significant positive results. "The attempts by the Russian leadership to negotiate with the Chechen opposition and to make signing of the bilateral treaty conditional on early parliamentary and presidential elections will be of no use to Russia," Fateyev emphasized. He considered this to be a syndrome of imperial policy. Fateyev suggested that for the time-being the Russian leadership had no definite position on the Chechen issue but certain politicians were trying to use it in their own political interests. "This is manifested in the fact that very few people are concerned over diametrically opposite statements which a politician may make on this issue," Fateyev remarked. He said these people were mostly concerned over their image. Speaking on his impressions from the meetings with President Dudayev, Fateyev defined him as a complex and strong person with a strong will. "It is important for Russia that this will be used in its interests," Fateyev stressed. "The economic situation is the main factor of the state leadership's capacities. The economic situation in Chechnya is manageable and under control. Certainly, it goes through a crisis. Certainly, there is a decline but not a catastrophic one, Fateyev concluded.
