Figures for the 1993 fiscal year have prompted Henri Pascaud, who just succeeded Gerard Bauvin as the head of the company, to explain the year's stagnating sales (the company posted turnover of 3.81 billion French francs [Fr], up 0.4 percent over 1992 for the same sales territory.) Pascaud attributes the plateau to flagging demand from state-owned companies and a still weak market for Sligos's facilities management services. The group's share of net earnings totaled Fr160.6 million, down 7.1 percent from 1992. Finally, although Credit Lyonnais, Sligos's primary shareholder through its holding company Clio, is reorganizing its industrial portfolio, current Clio president Gerard Bauvin stressed that the bank had confirmed its continued strategic interest in computer services. However, Bauvin also conceded that Credit Lyonnais's financial imperatives suggested a possible desire to share the financial burden of its computer holdings with other partners.
