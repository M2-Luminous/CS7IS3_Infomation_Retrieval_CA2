The following are excerpts of an interview with Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, on a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) nations slated for Sunday in Washington. Q: Is substantial agreement possible when the G-7 nations are starting to place emphasis on domestic policy? A: It was rather easy to take cooperative steps when interest rates were on the decline in all nations. But now that the United States has already turned to tightening its credit policy to prevent inflation, disarray is starting to surface in monetary policy. Such cracks will spread further, and I think it will be hard to reach a meaningful agreement. Q: Do you expect stronger pressure on Japan? A: The U.S. and European nations brushed aside the government's market-opening package launched in late March, and Japan is far behind schedule to adopt concrete measures to expand domestic demand. Moreover, resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks is not yet in sight, and what else can you expect when even Finance Minister (Hirohisa) Fujii may not be able to attend? It's like asking, "please criticize." Q: What should the incoming new cabinet do to dodge such criticism? A: Japan must rush to detail measures to boost domestic demand and open markets. If I were the prime minister, I would take the responsibility to implement such measures as continuation and expansion of income tax cuts and building up social infrastructure investment while holding separate discussions on funding. No country will be satisfied with Japan just repeating, "We can't accept any numerical targets and we are not thinking of any alternatives." Q: What are your expectations of rising U.S. long-term rates? A: If the U.S. economy continues to recover, we definitely cannot expect U.S. rates to decline. Higher rates will probably send stock and bond prices lower, and may also drag down the economies of Japan and Europe. Along with Japan's facing pressure to cut its huge trade surplus, the U.S. is also likely to come under pressure from the other G-7 countries to curb interest rates. Q: What about labor issues? A: Structural problems, primarily faced by European nations, should rather be discussed from a long-term perspective. As for the G-7 talks, the main point is on limiting increases in unemployment rates by ensuring economic recovery through financial policy coordination. Q: Do you expect much discussion on exchange rates? A: Against Japan's expectations, I believe currency rates will hardly be discussed at all. The U.S. dollar is not necessarily falling against European currencies, and the yen seems to be staging a lonely appreciation. The usual mention may be included in the joint statement, but substantial talks on exchange rates are unlikely to take place.
