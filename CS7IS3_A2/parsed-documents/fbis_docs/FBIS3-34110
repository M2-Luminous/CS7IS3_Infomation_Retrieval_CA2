In statements published by the Yemeni newspaper 26 SIBTIMBAR, the Yemeni president said the vice president, the prime minister, and other ministers from the Yemeni Socialist Party should return to Sanaa and resume their duties after signing the document. He noted that no party can implement the document without the other parties of the government coalition. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih noted that he will not object to Arab and foreign envoys attending the signing ceremony in Amman, stressing that the Yemeni parties cannot impose anyone on the host country. Regarding the role played by the Kuwaiti regime and the Saudi authorities in agitating the current Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni president accused a Kuwaiti paper of calling for spending the last $1 billion in Kuwaiti coffers to partition Yemen. He said such an idea provokes all Yemenis. President Salih revealed that the Saudi regime has paid large amounts of money, estimated at millions of Saudi riyals, to agitate the Yemeni crisis. He said: The fact that Saudi Arabia has paid such huge amounts of money arouses suspicions about the Saudi role in the Yemeni crisis. President Salih said this Saudi conduct is considered interference in Yemeni domestic affairs, particularly under the current circumstances. He noted that Yemen opposes all forms of terrorism and stressed that the recent explosions and assassinations in Yemen were carried out by hired elements that oppose Yemeni unity and have been opposed to Yemeni unity ever since it was established.
