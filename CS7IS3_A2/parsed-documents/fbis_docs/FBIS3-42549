A. Nymmik; UDC 543.42:522.124] [Abstract] The high-energy charged-particle fluxes that accompany solar flares are a focus of study because of their effect on biological objects and hardware during spaceflight. The danger associated with such events depends on the frequency of the events, the magnitude of the flux, and particle energy spectrum. Based on acquired experimental data, solar cosmic ray events are classified here by magnitude of total proton fluence. At proton energies of more than 30 MeV, power-law functions of particle rigidity serve well to describe the averaged energy spectra of peak proton fluxes and proton fluences that characterize solar cosmic ray events of varying magnitude. Average energy events become steadily more rigid as event fluence magnitude grows, and average magnitudes of peak flux remain proportional to fluence across the entire range of fluence variation. The averaged energy spectra of anomalously large and very large events do not contain anomalies in terms of probability of occurrence or type of energy spectrum. The average energy spectra of solar cosmic ray events differ from those of CREME in that they establish the presence of rather large, high-energy particle fluxes in the solar cosmic events. Such particle penetrate spacecraft shields, or, after passing through the Earth's magnetic field, they penetrate to lower geomagnetic latitudes in the Earth's atmosphere and to the near-Earth orbits of satellites with small inclinations.
