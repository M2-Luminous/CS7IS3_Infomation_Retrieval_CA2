FR940802-0-00050 FR940802-0-00008 In addition to impacts on toxics compliance, any shifts in oxygenate use resulting from today's program will also cause changes in the concentrations of other fuel parameters in the final gasoline blend, since different oxygenates require different volumes to meet the same oxygen content requirement. Changes in these other fuel parameters (referred to as the dilution effect) can affect VOC, NO X , and air toxics performance. However, the RFG performance standards remain unchanged by today's rule, and the Complex Model will account for the VOC, NO X , and toxics emission effects of any dilution-related changes in the level of aromatics, olefins, sulfur, E200, E300, or benzene. As a result, EPA has concluded that today's rule will not alter the VOC, NO X , and toxics emission benefits of the RFG program. As discussed in section VI.C of this notice, however, refiners may experience positive or negative economic impacts in maintaining the required emission performance of their reformulated gasoline as a result of today's rule. Two other effects of today's rule are not reflected in the Complex Model and may affect summer nonexhaust VOC and toxics emissions, however. First, commingling-related emissions during the VOC control season would be reduced to the extent that ETBE replaces ethanol in summer RFG. Second, increased summer ETBE use (and reduced summer ethanol use) would improve the front-end distillation characteristics of summer RFG, thereby potentially reducing summer nonexhaust VOC and toxics emissions to some degree. These effects, however, are contingent upon changes in the amounts of ETBE and ethanol that are blended into RFG during the summer months as a result of this rulemaking. Since it is uncertain how much ETBE and ethanol would have been used during the summer months absent today's rulemaking, and is still uncertain how much of each oxygenate will be used as a result of today's rulemaking, it is not possible to quantify these benefits. Furthermore, even if the volumes of oxygenate use were known, the effect of front-end distillation changes (other than RVP) on nonexhaust VOC emissions is not yet quantifiable with a sufficient degree of certainty. Limited data and scientific theory suggest it is a real effect, as discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the RFG final rule, but reliable quantification is not yet possible. Carbon monoxide emissions are not regulated directly by either the RFG program or today's rule. However, carbon monoxide emissions can be affected by gasoline properties. Higher oxygen levels are known to result in large reductions in carbon monoxide emissions, and lower RVP levels are known to result in small reductions in carbon monoxide at temperatures above 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Both of these effects are currently incorporated in EPA's MOBILE5a in-use emission model. Since the oxygen content requirements of the RFG program are not altered by today's rule and since summer RVP levels are controlled by the RFG performance standards, no change in CO emission levels is anticipated during the summer months. Furthermore, based on EPA's MOBILE5.a emission factor model, there would be no effect on CO emissions of an increase in RVP levels during the winter months (when RVP is not constrained by the RFG program) due to increased ethanol use on the colder days when most carbon monoxide exceedances occur, since the model does not show an effect of RVP on CO emissions below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The only effect of today's rule on CO emissions would be a potential small increase due to increased RVP levels resulting from increased ethanol use on those winter days with temperatures above 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Other fuel parameters may also affect carbon monoxide emissions. However, a model for CO incorporating other fuel parameters is not yet available. Any such effects would be limited by the constraints placed on these fuel parameters by the VOC, NO X , and air toxics RFG emission performance standards.
