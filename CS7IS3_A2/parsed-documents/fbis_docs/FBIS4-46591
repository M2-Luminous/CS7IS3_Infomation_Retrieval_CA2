For dozens of years, since the very origin of nuclear missile weapons, the world constantly has been in the sights of the nuclear button, so to speak. The missiles of countries possessing these weapons were aimed not only at each other, but also, it must be assumed, at important strategic and industrial targets, lines of communication... in short, at you and me. Then, in accordance with understandings recorded in the Moscow Declaration of Presidents of the Russian Federation and United States of 14 January 1994 and in the Joint Declaration of the President of the Russian Federation and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 15 February 1994, the heads of the three countries made the decision to issue necessary instructions about nontargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective command. Implementation of this understanding by the Russian Federation signifies that day to day control of nuclear forces now is exercised based on the fact that the United States and Great Britain are not enemies of the Russian Federation and not one of our more than one thousand missiles in silos, on submarines and on mobile missile systems is aimed any longer against any targets on the territory of the United States and Great Britain. It is hardly necessary to mention how much this step strengthens mutual and international security and follows the channel of fundamentally new relations of strategic partnership among our countries and of their practical cooperation in the military-political sphere. The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs Statement which was disseminated states that this important step will open the path to further steps on a bilateral and multilateral basis in the interests of strengthening trust, stability and predictability in strategic nuclear arms. The document expresses the hope that the other nuclear powers also will take this path. But what does implementation of a regime of nontargeting of missiles signify in practice? And is it necessary to be on constant alert status in that case? Will not the combat readiness of missile units suffer from this? These simple questions cannot help but occur to people who are not too familiar with the specifics of strategic nuclear forces. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA repeatedly has touched on these subjects, but today of course there is a need to return to this once more and cite the opinion of people who are informed, as they say... Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov, chief of the Main Staff of Strategic Missile Troops, says the following concerning the regime of zeroizing the missiles' missions: "The problem of zeroizing depends on the missile systems' design features and will be resolved by us and by the American side for each type of missile in our own way. But common to all is an unequivocal reduction of the threshold of a surprise strike, since each side will have to perform a number of operational and technical operations to reestablish combat plans. This will take time, which politicians can use additionally for peaceful resolution of problems, should they arise." One can add to what was said by the chief of the Main Staff that inasmuch as battle management systems of U.S. ICBM's and our ICBM's differ somewhat, their missiles will be targeted against uninhabited areas of the earth, while ours will have no specific targets. With respect to combat readiness, specialists believe that zeroizing the missiles will not lower the combat potential of missile units. Special measures have been worked out and implemented to support the day to day activity and life of troops with nontargeted missiles. Hundreds of specialists worked to ensure that the retargeting of missiles, which lowers nuclear danger in the world, was carried out within the time period set by the understandings--no later than 30 May 1994. Nevertheless, this act of good will and mutual trust does not relieve strategic nuclear forces of the responsibility of providing protection for the homeland and preserving stability on the planet. Therefore today, as always over the last 35 years, more than 20,000 missilemen are at duty stations around the clock.
