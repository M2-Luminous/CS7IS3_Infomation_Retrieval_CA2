FR940913-2-00085 FR940913-2-00063 15. Defendant did not notify the Indian Employment Service or the Turning Point Program of these 10 openings and did not request that these sources supply applicants for any of these positions, as agreed upon their conciliation agreement. 16. Defendant's first personnel activity report was not timely submitted. 17. Defendant did not specifically request qualified female and minority applicants when it listed job openings with Job Service. 18. Defendant did not, during the period May 1, through October 31, 1992 make every good effort to recruit and employ women. 19. By letter dated February 4, 1993, OFCCP notified Defendant that its untimely filing of the first personnel activity report, its failure to specifically request affirmative action job orders when it contacted the Job Service, and its failure to make every good faith effort to recruit and employ women during the period from May 1, through October 31, 1992, violated the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement. 20. Defendant's second personnel activity report was due on May 10, 1993, and was to cover the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993. 21. On May 7, 1993, Defendant filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact with linkage or recruitment sources during the period covered by the second report. 22. OFCCP contacted and visited KRT during June and July 1993 in an effort to confirm Defendant's representation that there had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter. 23. The letter submitted by Defendant to OFCCP on May 7, 1993, misstated defendant's hiring activity during the preceding six months. 24. During the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993, Defendant failed to maintain personnel records including hire dates, termination dates and applicant information as required by the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement. 25. Defendant hired a number of individuals during the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993. 26. Defendant did not contact the linkage organizations agencies regarding vacancies filled during the period from November 1, 1992, through March 30, 1993, and did not request those sources to supply applicants for any of these positions. 27. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP. 28. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 23 through 26, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP. 29. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18 and 23 through 26, above, violate Executive Order 11246, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and therefore violate KRT Drywall/Acoustical's contractual obligations to the Federal Government. 30. Plaintiff notified Defendant of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement. Defendant has not demonstrated that it did abide by the terms of the Conciliation Agreement and so, pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.34(a), enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately. 31. KRT failed to contact the linkage organizations referenced in the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement; consequently, Defendant may have failed to consider for employment qualified individuals registered with these organizations. 32. Unless retrained by an Administrative Order, KRT Drywall/Acoustical will continue to violate the obligations imposed upon it by the Executive Order and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. Wherefore, plaintiff prays for a decision and order pursuant to Section 209 of the Executive Order, 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.26 and 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;30, permanently enjoining Defendant, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors, divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it from violating the Executive Order. Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order debarring Defendant and its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors, divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it, from entering into future Government contracts, subcontractors or federally assisted construction contracts until such time as Defendant satisfies the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance and that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order and the regulations promulgated thereunder, but in no event less than 210 days. Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order canceling any contracts Defendant may hold by the time a final order is issued. Plaintiff further prays for such other relief as justice may require. ␣␣␣Respectfully submitted, Thomas S. Williamson, Jr., Solicitor of Labor. James D. Henry, Associate Solicitor. Debra A. Millenson, Senior Trial Attorney. L. Denise Galambos, Attorney.
