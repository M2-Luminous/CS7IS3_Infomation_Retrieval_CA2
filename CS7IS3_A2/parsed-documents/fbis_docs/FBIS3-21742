The police and National Assembly commission that prepared the draft bill on narcotics, psychotropic substances and so forth still disagree on certain controversial issues such as whether the DEA should participate in Nicaraguan drug-trafficking investigations. Tijerino says the antidrug law should be educational instead of repressive. [Begin Tijerino recording] Excessive pressure has been exerted on the commission to make the law repressive. My concern is it may repress our youths, a point that is obvious from the disregard that has been shown for the need to allow the Nicaraguan Youth Council to work with the National Council. [end recording] Commander Leonel Espinoza, of the National Police Narcotics Department, has said the following: [Begin Espinoza recording] Every law contains repressive elements, but this law also calls for a national council that will design a plan that will also address general preventive issues such as education, children, and youths; in other words, the law contemplates the preventive side of the struggle against drug related crimes, not only the coercive side of it. [end recording] Deputy Tijerino says the U.S. Embassy did not want the plenum to pass the law. [Begin recording] Unidentified reporter: Who has come under pressure and what type? Tijerino: I have met with David Noble, and I was informed that before the draft bill was sent to the plenum for discussion it was delivered to the U.S. Embassy so that the embassy could say whether it adhered to international agreements. Mr. Noble asked me, diplomatically, of course, if I would agree to a withdrawal of the law from debate. This means U.S. Embassy officials oppose the law, because it does not guarantee unrestricted activities by organizations such as the DEA, which promotes police operations against drug trafficking. [end recording] Meanwhile, Commander Espinosa has said the following: [Begin Espinosa recording] I have said openly we will cooperate with every police force in the world. We believe certain police organizations have more experience in the struggle against drug trafficking and more vested interests as well, but such cooperation is totally fair and normal. [end recording] The antidrug law had been stored away for over two years, and during the second session of debates progress was made only on Article Five, which was discussed today for more than three hours. The law will continue to be discussed at the National Assembly, and its approval is expected within several weeks.
