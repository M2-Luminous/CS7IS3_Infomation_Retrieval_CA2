The invitation to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to the G-7 summit in London in 1991 marked the diplomatic end to the Cold War structure, said Matsuura, former deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, in a recent interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. "But the G-7 nations have yet to form a consensus on what role their summits, marking their 20th anniversary at this year's Naples gathering, should play in the post-Cold War era," he said. The East-West confrontation of the 1970s and the first oil crisis in 1973 were prime movers in launching the summits, Matsuura said. "But now there is nothing that binds them together so firmly," he claimed. "They are now in a transitional stage." Matsuura served as a sherpa, or personal representative of the prime minister, at the 1992 Munich summit and the 1993 Tokyo summit. He said the G-7 countries are having difficulty dealing with Russia, which has stumbled in implementing reform programs despite full- fledged aid commitment by the G-7 at last year's Tokyo summit. "How to define Russia's role in the summit framework will probably be taken up at the Naples summit," he said. "But G-7 leaders are unlikely to reach an accord on the matter and the topic will be carried into next year's summit in Canada." He said Russia appears to want to use its participation at the summit to give the world the impression it is an economic power. Matsuura said the G-7 nations have effectively tackled trade and currency issues throughout the past 19 summit meetings, which began at Rambouillet, France, in 1975. He said a floating exchange rate system has come to function well, while new global trade rules are expected to take effect at the beginning of next year under the World Trade Organization (WTO) following the recent conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks. But macroeconomic issues, which Matsuura claims are "far more difficult" to cope with than currency and trade problems, are still pending, necessitating further policy coordination among the G-7. Matsuura said the Naples summit will give priority to how to achieve growth and employment simultaneously, an issue also discussed at the Tokyo summit under the "global growth strategy." The economy is recovering smoothly in the United States while signs of a pickup are appearing in Japan, but this does not mean that global unemployment will be easily solved, he said. Global joblessness can be partly traced to structural problems that often require political solutions, he added. Directly or indirectly, Japan will probably be asked to boost its domestic demand during the Naples summit as part of efforts to reduce global unemployment. But it is unlikely there will be any magic prescription for dealing with structural problems on the jobless issue, he said. On the political front, Bosnia will top the Naples agenda in view of its geographical proximity to most summit member countries. The suspected nuclear arms program by North Korea could also be taken up if the situation becomes more serious, Matsuura said.
