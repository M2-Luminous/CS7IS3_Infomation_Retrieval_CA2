Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his visiting counterpart Han Sung-chu during a working breakfast that "we are not in favour of UN Security Council involvement in this issue." "We do not agree on sanctions, for sanctions would only serve to push the parties concerned into confrontation with one another and result in a situation that no one would like to see," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quoted Qian as saying. Asked if Beijing believed Pyongyang would actually follow through with its threats of war if faced with sanctions, Shen simply said, "it is hard to predict how the DPRK would react to sanctions, but at the very least sanctions are not a good choice." Qian's remarks came shortly before the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) governors were due to meet in Vienna to discuss the recent escalation in the Korean crisis, sparked by fears that Pyongyang was diverting plutonium from its Yongbon reactor to make nuclear weapons. Han arrived here Wednesday from the United States for a lightning stopover in a bid to persuade China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and Stalinist North Korea's only major ally, to endorse economic sanctions against Pyongyang. He left for Seoul later Thursday. Shen quoted Qian as telling Han that "although there are some difficulties now, the parties concerned should still remain calm and concentrate on exercising restraint instead of closing the door to negotiations." In the past, negotiations had achieved some progress, he said, but added that more recently the parties concerned -- namely the United States, the two Koreas and the IAEA -- "failed to reach consensus concerning technical issues leading to a dramatic change in the situation." He was referring to North Korea's failure to allow IAEA inspectors to monitor properly the discharging of fuel rods from the five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor. The inspectors said in a recent report they could no longer guarantee that plutonium had not been diverted during the operation. Asked to elaborate on South Korean reports that Qian pledged to Han that China would make its "best efforts" to resolve the crisis, Shen said the foreign minister was referring to Beijing's willingness to play "a bigger role" to try to bring the parties back to the negotiating table. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Wednesday it was now too late for Washington, which is pushing for sanctions, to resume direct talks with Pyongyang. Shen warned that if any parties sought to resolve the crisis outside the framework of negotiations, "it will possibly lead to a downturn in the situation and lead the situation to a critical point." "It is only through such negotiations that the situation can be accorded a settlement," he said.
