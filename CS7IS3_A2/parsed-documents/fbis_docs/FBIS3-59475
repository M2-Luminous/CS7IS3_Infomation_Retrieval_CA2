There is talk about the arguments for and against, but least frequently of all about whether and how it is possible to accomplish it legally. That is why we talked about this with Aleksandar Simic, a member of the Republic Electoral Commission (in its expanded form). He believes that a state of emergency will not be declared because he thinks that there is a sufficient amount of reason and also that a state of emergency is not the way out. That would be tragic as the finale of the effort to pursue the Serbian nationality question at the global international level, he explains, adding that the principal political figures in Serbia have displayed a great deal of arbitrariness in decisionmaking, so that even this possibility must be reckoned with; in his opinion, it would be done through the federal state. Simic also explains all the obstacles to instituting a state of emergency because the federal and republic constitutions are not in harmony. The model for the 1990 Serbian Constitution was the Constitution of the Fifth Republic in France, which was tailored to suit De Gaulle and afford strong presidential power. That was also what was desired here after the crisis in Kosovo. The president's greatest two powers are contained in Article 83: to proclaim an immediate danger of war and to declare a state of war and state of emergency. The first two possibilities are an option if the Assembly does not meet, but the president of the republic may declare a state of emergency without the Assembly, but on the recommendation of the government. Under the Constitution, a state of emergency may be instituted for only a portion of the territory, and when it is declared, the president may also issue the relevant enactments. Simic emphasizes that the state of emergency is always associated with a portion of the territory. Jurisdictional Conflicts The state of emergency should actually be regulated by the federal Constitution, which requires that the highest legal enactment of the republic be brought into conformity with it. However, the federal Constitution was adopted in April 1992 and was modeled on Germany's Constitution, with strong powers for the government. Article 99 provides that when the Federal Assembly is unable to meet, the federal government, after it has heard the opinion of the president of the republic and the presidents of the chambers of the Assembly, proclaims the immediate danger of war, a state of war, or a state of emergency. "That is the situation at the moment," Simic says, "because since the Serbian Assembly was dissolved, there is no Chamber of Republics in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Assembly. The greatest paradox is that the federal Constitution allows the mandate of deputies in the Chamber of Republics to be regulated not by the federal Constitution and law, but rather leaves this to the member republics of the federation." Simic goes on to say that the federal Law on Defense was passed in both chambers of the Assembly, but in different versions. The Chamber of Republics accepted the amendments of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, whereby the opinion of the member republic is obtained for institution of a state of emergency, and if the Assembly is unable to meet, the opinion of the republic government is obtained. The day before the Citizens Chamber was to decide on that law, the federal government rejected those amendments. Pavle Bulatovic, defense minister, presented the reasons for that rejection, and Ratko Markovic said that if the Federal Assembly consulted the republic assemblies or governments about proclamation of an immediate danger of war, state of war, or state of emergency, that would amount to instilling a confederal element in federal law. Because the law was not passed in the same version in the two chambers, a commission was formed to reconcile the versions, and it did not complete its work before 22 October because the Serbian Assembly was dissolved. Under the federal Constitution, the decision in the Citizens Chamber is then applied, which means that there are no consultations with republic assemblies, according to the interpretation of our informant. Differing Approaches Article 4 of the law spells it out: When it finds that a danger exists or the sovereignty, territory, independence, constitutional order, or security of the country are threatened, depending on the volume and degree of the danger that is imminent or has presented itself, the Federal Assembly shall proclaim an immediate danger of war, a state of war, or state of emergency. It elaborates even further concerning the state of emergency: Should there be internal unrest of sizable proportions, so that the country's constitutional order is threatened with violence, or when natural or other disasters occur and threaten the lives of citizens, their property and material goods on a large scale, a state of emergency may be instituted. Simic believes that on the basis of that article the federal government could institute a state of emergency, also citing Article 135 of the republic Constitution, which states that Serbia will not respect the SFRY Constitution if it violates Serbia's equality or threatens its interests in any other way. Because the constitutions have not been brought into conformity, this provision might also apply to the present federal Constitution.
