Provocations Against Russian Servicemen by Latvian Home Defense Guard Continue"] [Text] In the chronicle of actions by the Home Defense Guard against Russian troops temporarily stationed on Latvian territory, a UAZ-469 automobile was stopped by home defense guards 27 November 1993 at around 1200. Under threat of the use of weapons, the driver and the automobile were taken to the Home Defense Guard 12th Battalion headquarters, where a R-838 radio transmitter set was removed from the automobile. In the area of Plavinas 14 December 1993 at 1200 a GAZ-66 automobile belonging to the courier-mail communications service, which was transporting correspondence from Riga to Jekabpils, was shot at with a small-bore weapon by unknown individuals following behind in an automobile. As a result of the shooting, a wheel was pierced. The camouflage uniform of the people doing the shooting, as well as the color of the vehicle, provide grounds for believing that they belonged to the Home Defense Guard. An officer from the Northwestern Group of Forces press center asked Mr. Juris Dalbinsh [name as transliterated], deputy chief of staff of the Home Defense Guard, to comment on these and other similar actions in respect of Russian servicemen. "The incident involving the removal of the portable radio transmitter was an annoying misunderstanding," Mr. Dalbinsh explained. "The reason for it was that the home defense guards had not made themselves familiar with the intergovernmental agreements on the use of postal and electric communications and Russian Federation Armed Forces radio frequencies. In this case the home guards acted unlawfully, and therefore a court investigation will be conducted and we will inform you of the results in writing. The culprits will be disciplined. As for the shooting at the Russian military vehicle 14 December, we have no information about this. I specially got in touch with the battalion on whose territory this incident supposedly took place, and I found out that they were not given any tasks that day, and were not even on patrol." [Groznetskiy] "Mr. Dalbinsh, would you not admit the possibility of the unsanctioned use of weapons by your subordinates?" [Dalbinsh] "No, that is out of the question. In broad daylight, in a vehicle with `Home Defense Guard' symbols on it -- that's going too far. We recently had a very serious discussion with Latvian Republic President G. Ulmanis (the president is the commander in chief of the Home Defense Guard -- O.G.) during which it was pointed out that it is impermissible to use weapons without grounds for doing so. The Home Defense Guard command drew the relevant conclusions: The requirements concerning who can be issued with weapons have been made tougher. However, people are human. Not everyone can bear the burden of authority provided by weapons in a normal way; but we will conduct the relevant work..." Following the conversation with Mr. Juris Dalbinsh, another report came in. As Major V. Turovskiy's household effects were being transported along the Riga-Nizhniy Novgorod route on 23 December of last year in the area of Jekabpils, the KamAZ truck was shot at with a small-bore pistol. The attackers were in a light-gray Riga Bus Plant automobile bearing Home Defense Guard emblems on its doors....
