FR940405-2-00109 FR940405-2-00043 53. Regulation: 24 CFR 811.114(d), 811.115(b), 811.117. Project/Activity: Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee HEFB refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Hickory Forest Apartments. Nature of Requirement: The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity. Granted By: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner. Date Granted: September 29, 1993. Reasons Waived: The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms of refunding transactions under section 103 of the Tax Code. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on September 10, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.59%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $2,470,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 9.5%&hyph;10.9% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.59%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.06% to 5.08%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. Note to Reader: The person to be contacted for additional information about the waiver-grant items in this listing is: John Comerford, Director, Financial Management Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, Phone: (202) 708&hyph;1872, TTD: (202) 708&hyph;0850 (These are not toll-free numbers). 54. Regulation: 24 CFR 882.103(b) and 887.201(b)(3). Project/Activity: Deny Owner Participation in the section 8 Rental Assistance Programs if the Owner's Property Taxes are Delinquent, Detroit Housing Department (DHD). Nature of Requirement: 24 CFR 882.103(b) and 887.201(b)(3) prohibit a public housing agency (HA) from directly or indirectly reducing, either in the provision of assistance to any family in finding a unit or by any other action, any family's opportunity to choose among the available units in the housing market. Granted By: Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. Date Granted: April 21, 1993. Reason Waived: The Department is aware of an HA's need to weigh the unsuitability of certain landlords against the family's ability to take advantage of a wide range of housing choices. The supporting documentation submitted by DHD reported that from October 1990 through May 1992, there were only two cases where units selected by families had owners with unpaid property taxes, and that in both cases the owners agreed to make payment arrangements and the units were processed for the program. The waiver was determined to be in the public interest of the city of Detroit, and does not appear to result in any significant reduction to the housing choices available to families.
