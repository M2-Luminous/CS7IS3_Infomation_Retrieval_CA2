[Knazko] I found out after the fact that Mr. Lexa had gone to Yugoslavia with the blessing of the prime minister. I never found out anything about the purpose of this visit and no report was ever written about it. Thus, the government resolution according to which every government member--anyone who was in any way involved in Slovak foreign policy--is obliged within 14 days of returning from a visit to submit a report on it was infringed. [Pankovcinova] However, Mr. Lexa was not a government member, neither a minister nor a state secretary, at that time. Did this resolution apply to him? [Knazko] He was head of the Slovak Government Office at that time and this resolution applied to him if he went there with the blessing of the prime minister. Without his blessing, of course, he could not have gone there. [Pankovcinova] Why did you not say anything about this before? [Knazko] I did. I wrote a letter to the prime minister, but I did not receive a reply. This was not the only instance. Later, I also informed the press about visits that were not discussed in advance with the Foreign Ministry--for example, when the prime minister was in Germany or Austria without the knowledge of the deputy prime minister and foreign minister. We never received a report at the Foreign Ministry on these visits by the prime minister. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 January on page 2, under the headline "A Question for Ivan Lexa," carries the following 100-word "(SD)"-signed question and Lexa's response: "In a speech delivered to the National Council of the Slovak Republic, M. Knazko indirectly described you as the person the prime minister sent to the former Yugoslavia in the fall of 1992 without the knowledge of the Foreign Ministry. Do you have anything to say to this? "Lexa: No comment."]
