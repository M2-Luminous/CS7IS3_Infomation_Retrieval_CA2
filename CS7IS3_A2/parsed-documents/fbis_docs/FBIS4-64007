She interviews Kozyrev in the lobby of the conference hall in Paris. Stating that the visit took place at the time of acute complications in Russia's relations with Ukraine, the Kuznetsova points out that Kozyrev did not try to intrigue against Ukraine in Paris but, on the contrary, reiterated that Russia respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine. She adds that Kozyrev was the only foreign minister to be received by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur after the conference today. She then asks Kozyrev why he was given such preferential treatment. Kozyrev replies: "I think one of the reasons is the intensity of the Russo-French dialogue and, in fact, our conversation was a direct sequel, as it were, to the conversation that took place between President Yeltsin and French Foreign Minister Juppe in the Kremlin a short while ago. In actual fact, the prime minister asked me the same questions and requested that we discuss our present position with regard to the points agreed during the conversation with the president. So this is not really my own achievement but a continuation of the dialogue begun by the president in the Kremlin." Asked to explain what "points" he mentioned, Kozyrev said: "First and foremost, the agreement between Russia and the European Union. It is high time we reached the home straight, as the saying goes. I should say that after the meeting between the president and Mr. Juppe and our negotiations today, we are very close to finalizing this agreement; we are literally inches away from it, so we acknowledged our great progress on this matter. "The second point is Balladur's plan itself, which we are discussing at the conference here. We have certain concerns about the border issues, among other things. In his speech. M. Balladur interpreted the question of borders in such a way -- and this is also how this is stated in the text of the document -- that the point under discussion is how to improve the climate on the borders by creating transparent borders, facilitating trade, simplifying travel regulations etc. Of course, there can be no doubt that we are very interested in these things. But some politicians in the Baltic countries -- I am just back from Estonia -- have a different approach to the question of borders." Kuznetsova then asks Kozyrev if by this statement he means that Russia recognizes the territorial integrity of Ukraine with the Crimea as its part and that the Crimean issue should not reemerge in the future. Kozyrev answers: "We recognize Ukraine's integrity because it is a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, and the CIS, and because it has been recognized within its present borders. And of course we support the principle of inviolability of borders which means that countries should not lay territorial claims upon each other and should not resolve such issues by force. At the same time, this principle leaves to the population of certain regions the right to determine their will -- naturally, by peaceful and not military means -- so that subsequently the border can be changed through talks. Thus, the will of the population of the region in question is needed together with a peaceful negotiating process. That is, this principle does not mean that borders can never be redrawn but it creates certain civilized procedures for this." The interviewer reminds Kozyrev that he described the format of the Paris conference as "12 plus 9" and asks what status Russia had at this meeting. Kozyrev replies: "The format of the conference is as follows: There are the 12 states of the European Community and 9 candidates who have agreed to discuss with these members of the European Union questions relating to ethnic minorities etc, so that the Union should not admit as members those states that could explode. As a European state and as a member state of the CSCE, we are ready to participate in the discussion of these questions because we are all one family and we are not indifferent to the way in which these questions will be tackled." Kuznetsova then says it is almost settled that Russia should join the European Union, the G7 and the NATO's Partnership for Peace shortly, and asks Kozyrev whether he considers Russia's claim to a special role in the partnership justified. Kozyrev replies: "Yes, certainly. It would simply be unnatural if we forgot about the special role we have thanks to our being a nuclear power if for nothing else. No other participant in this partnership is a nuclear power. This may be a mere trifle, but a pleasant one, I should say."
