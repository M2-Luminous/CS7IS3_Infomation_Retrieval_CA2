FR940217-1-00024 FR940217-1-00005 The Commission would carefully use these new reporting requirements to minimize the extent of extraneous information gathered through the system. The combination of the reporting requirements for execution times and sequence numbers would enable the Commission to generate accurate reconstructions of all large trader activity. Although these new provisions may slow down the completion of trading reconstructions, the Commission believes that the resulting analyses of trading reconstructions will be superior to any previous efforts in terms of accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. The SIA expressed its concurrence with this solution to the execution time reporting requirement concerns. 68 68 See Memorandum to SEC File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91 from the Division of Market Regulation dated June 11, 1992 indicating the SIA's concurrence. The Commission believes that the reporting requirements contained in the reproposed rule incorporate all existing information or systems and would minimize associated burdens. Further, the Commission believes that these requirements would strike a fair and reasonable balance between the costs of such reporting and the Commission's need to obtain execution times. Finally, the Commission believes that the reproposed reporting requirements would establish an efficient means for analyzing multi-layered accounts. E. Supervisory Safe Harbor Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act provides a mechanism for supervision of the large trader reporting system by authorizing the Commission to establish rules for recordkeeping and reporting of transactions effected by persons a broker-dealer ``knows or has reason to know'' is a large trader, based on transactions effected directly or indirectly by or through such broker-dealer. 69 As proposed, the duty to supervise would apply to compliance with the identification requirements and would be imposed on all broker-dealers and other large traders that effect transactions through, or maintain omnibus accounts with, broker-dealers. 70 69 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(2) (1990). 70 See Proposing Release 56 FR 42554, at text accompanying nn. 44&hyph;46, 53&hyph;54, and 108. A number of comments on this aspect of the proposed rule were received from broker-dealers and banks. These comments revolved around the scope of this duty and sought clarification concerning the steps to be taken to avoid liability for their customers' intentional or unintentional failure to comply with the identification requirements of the proposed rule. 71 Many of the commenters focused on the lack of automated systems for cross-referencing or aggregating accounts that may be commonly owned or controlled. The commenters extrapolated from this premise that the development of automated systems for this purpose would be extremely expensive and unduly burdensome. The commenters also suggested that the principal compliance burden should be placed on large traders and that an objective standard or ``safe harbor'' should be created. 71 See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42554, at n. 46, for the administrative remedies that the Commission may impose for a failure to supervise. The Commission also notes that it may institute proceedings and impose any other remedies that it may deem appropriate. The Commission emphasizes that the reproposed rule places the principal burden of compliance with the identification requirements on large traders. The Commission, however, also believes that some form of supervisory requirements and systems, which are consistent with the self-regulatory framework of the Exchange Act, are necessary to assure that the objectives of the Market Reform Act are fulfilled. Paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule would clarify and minimize the burden of the duty to supervise imposed by the ``reason to know'' provisions of Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act. This duty to supervise would apply to registered introducing or correspondent broker-dealers that clear their transactions on an omnibus basis through a self-clearing broker-dealer. Absent other indications, self-clearing broker-dealers would not normally be expected to supervise compliance by such broker-dealers or their customers for whom transactions are effected through omnibus accounts. The Commission acknowledges that this duty to supervise would impose additional burdens on broker-dealers. Accordingly, paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule would establish a ``safe harbor'' for the supervisory duty. This new paragraph would initially provide that registered broker-dealers would not be deemed to know or have reason to know that a person is a large trader if it does not have actual knowledge that a person is a large trader and has established policies and procedures reasonably designed to assure compliance with the identification requirements of the reproposed rule. Paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of the reproposed rule provide the specific elements that would be required for the supervisory safe harbor. Paragraph (f)(1) of the reproposed rule requires the establishment of systems ``reasonably designed to detect and identify'' persons who have not complied with the identification requirements. This paragraph incorporates the ``reason to know'' standard and clarifies that, with respect to groups of accounts that may be identified as large traders (i.e., commonly owned or controlled accounts), policies and procedures would be within the safe harbor if they are reasonably designed to detect and identify such groups of accounts based on account name, tax identification number, or other readily available information. The Commission would deem ``other readily available information'' to include, for example, those instances where a single customer effects the requisite transactions through a single registered representative, trading desk, or branch office in his or her personal accounts, accounts of family members, or accounts of others, pursuant to written trading authorizations. Similarly, customer authorization to transfer funds or securities among accounts in order to receive approval for trading activities, meet margin requirements, or to settle transactions, may be deemed other readily available information.
