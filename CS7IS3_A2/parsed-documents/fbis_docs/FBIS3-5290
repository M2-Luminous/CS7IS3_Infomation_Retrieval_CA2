Kono, speaking at the start of a three-day interpellation session at the Diet, said the Hosokawa Cabinet has piled up policy errors. The leader of the main opposition party criticized Hosokawa for carrying over compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to this year, revoking a "national welfare tax" plan, failing to reach agreement in trade framework talks with the United States and giving up a cabinet reshaping plan. "The Hosokawa Cabinet has now finished its mission," he said. Kono accused Hosokawa of failing to maintain a consistent basic political stance following changes in the balance of power in the seven-party coalition. Kono said the Japanese people are concerned that the country's future may go in an unfavorable direction under threats from a behind-the-scenes strongman. He did not identify the man but was apparently alluding to chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa. The breakdown in the February summit between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton led to the reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade provision that gives the U.S. Government broad powers to impose sanctions, he said. Representatives of political parties are scheduled to speak Monday through Wednesday in response to Friday's policy speeches by Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers. Komeito's Nobuaki Futami and the LDP's Koji Kakizawa will speak after Kono at Monday's plenary session of the House of Representatives.
