Hata was speaking to reporters after a morning cabinet meeting in the wake of a senior U.S. official's remarks Wednesday that North Korea has agreed to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The foreign minister said he nevertheless hopes that the U.S.-North Korean talks will result in Pyongyang's staying in the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting inspections. Asked if progress on that score would lead to a resumption of talks between Japan and North Korea on normalization of diplomatic relations, Hata said he hopes that will be the case. U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told reporters in Washington on Wednesday of the agreement with North Korea. Davis said the IAEA will be holding talks shortly with North Korea to work out procedures to carry out inspections of the seven declared nuclear sites. The announcement capped seven months of secret negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang over the nuclear inspection issue.
