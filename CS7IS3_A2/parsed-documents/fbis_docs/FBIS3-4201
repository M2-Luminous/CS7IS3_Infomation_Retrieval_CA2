"This is an indispensable part of the treasure-house of China's history, and it is urgent to rescue and protect this precious heritage," said Li Dongsheng of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission (SNAC). China has always attached great importance to protecting minority culture. As far back as 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai suggested collecting and publishing ancient books of ethnic minorities. But due to the ensuing political chaos, the work did not start until the 1980s. In August 1984, upon State Council approval, the Nationalities Affairs Commission started to prepare for the collection and research of ancient books of minorities published before the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Offices, research centres and publishing houses were set up in 24 provinces and autonomous regions, with money coming from regional revenue. Generally, ancient books refer to those written before the Qing. Since some minorities have a short history, books written in their language before 1949 are also included, according to Li. These books cover a wide range of fields: philosophy, literature, history, astronomy, medicine, architecture, music and painting. Research found that the Yi nationality boasts 10,000 volumes of ancient publications. A book on medicine, included more than 370 prescriptions. Investigations show it was finished 17 years earlier than the Compendium of Materia Medica, a world-famous book on medicine written by Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Mongolia and Man nationalities, founders of the Yuan 11271-1368) and Qing dynasties, left large numbers of official documents in addition to folk tales. These documents have far-reaching significance in historical studies of the two dynasties. The collection and publication of these books help minority nationalities better know their own history. It also signifies the equality of all nationalities. "The work, however, is tough and urgent," said Li Dongsheng. Few people are expert at all minority languages. Naxi nationality, scattered in the Lijiang area of South China's Yunnan Province, created a hieroglyph called the Dongba character. It got its name from its use to record religious rites by Naxi celebrants, called Dongba in the local language. Only a few old Dongba can read these pictographic characters. In 1981, an institute was established in Lijiang to rescue the precious cultural relics of Naxi nationality. The institute invited several old Dongba as instructors and provided 10 university graduates for them. With it the pronunciation and content of more than 1,000 Dongba books have been recovered and more than 300 books have been translated into Mandarin Chinese. The books also disclosed eight Dongba rituals. Some minority nationalities, on the other hand, do not have written languages. Their history is passed down orally. In the past decade or so, the Snac has invested money and manpower to recover their history, legend and folk tales. From 1986 to 1990, more than 1,000 books about 30 nationalities were published, their academic value attracting world attention. Research institutes of Chinese minorities have also been established in Japan, the United States, India, Canada and Germany. During the past 10 years, more than 1,000 foreigners have visited the Dongba culture research institute in Lijiang. Two foreign students are studying in the institute for their doctor's degree. A national conference on the collation of ancient nationality books will be held this year, according to Li. At the conference, relevant rules and regulations will be worked out to provide long-term guidelines for the work. Li said the collection and collation work needs to be further improved. In the past decade, both the central and local governments have provided financial help to the collection and collation of these books, Li said. In the future, more money is expected to be allocated to meet the increasing need. On the other hand, local research institutes should actively tap resources on their own to collect funds, Li suggested. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region set a prime example in this regard. In recent years, it has cooperated with the People's Republic of Mongolia and Australia on minority nationality cultural studies. Many books in the Mongolian language were jointly published by them. There is a lack of professional personnel in the collection and collation work. Until now, no university has set up this major. Only short-term training classes have been opened at the Central University for Nationalities, according to Li.
