The president said: "It is not that there are alleged ties. There actually are ties. Therefore, the Military Court Supreme Council has punished many of the elements involved." Concerning the case involving drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera [alias "Vaticano"], the president indicated that the courts of law have opened proceedings to investigate the existence of any ties the drug trade might have with police and the military. Celebrating the opening of another proceeding in the military courts, the president noted that, had this proceeding not been opened, the drug trafficker called "Vaticano" suddenly might have been released. After his activities in Atalaya-Ucayali, Fujimori emphasized: "We will be drastic and inexorable. To this end, however, it is necessary for the courts of law and the military courts to work in coordination to guarantee that serious crimes like these will not remain unpunished." Fujimori was accompanied by Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shozo Azuma [name as published] and other Japanese Government officials who delivered a number of donations to families afflicted by natural disasters throughout our country. Moving on, Fujimori noted that the circulation of an Army document stating that the media are engaged in a campaign to discredit the Army is part of the freedom in our country. Fujimori stressed: "Everyone in our country, without exception, has a right to voice his or her opinion. Since there is freedom of the press, there is also freedom of expression for the people and the institutions." In Fujimori's opinion: "This freedom of expression would not be allowed in any other country." He mentioned some examples of impersonation, involving people or institutions, that would warrant lawsuits in other countries. Fujimori noted: "These cases do not happen here because there is full freedom of the press and freedom of expression." Within this context, Fujimori was asked about the habeas data right [by which a citizen can ask a government to supply all personal data it has on him or her] included in the Constitution, a right that has been described by various segments as a threat to freedom of the press. Fujimori stressed: "I agree with championing freedom of the press and freedom of expression. The way this habeas data right will be regulated, I am sure it will guarantee these freedoms. Therefore, those remarks about the existence of threats to these freedoms are groundless." Moving on, President Fujimori announced that the draft of a letter of intent scheduled for signature with the IMF one and one-half months ago did not deserve his or the Council of Ministers' approval because it changed some of the government's goals that had been duly established. These goals include investments in the social field involving infrastructure improvements in education, health, highways, and so on. Fujimori noted: "I am sure the IMF will understand our goals. The economic stabilization and pacification goals are maintained. Nevertheless, a social program is required. We already have explained this social program to (IMF managing director) Michel Camdessus, who supports it, but we want it mentioned in the letter of intent." Another issue discussed by the president involved the reorganization of the National Police, especially Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate], and the recent terrorist actions that elicited criticism in the sense that the government had lowered its guard, which was ruled out by the president. Fujimori said: "This government actually has an effective antiterrorist strategy. The attacks do not represent a Shining Path revival or an ability to recover. Rather, they represent a weakness that we will use to our advantage within the same strategy." Fujimori admitted that the police are experiencing an adjustment process, but explained that it represents an adjustment to a new situation in order to enhance effectiveness. Fujimori stressed: "In this field, we will not lower our guard an inch. The change of commands has been criticized, but the National Police have been strengthened and organized to such an extent that they fulfill their duties under any command." The presidential entourage landed at Atalaya airport, changing their initial course to a location in the Andean mountain range because of weather problems. In Atalaya, Fujimori visited some hamlets and then went by helicopter to the San Jose de Cutivireni base where about 1,400 Ashaninkas, rescued by a religious mission from the Shining Path, have been living since 1991. Of the 1,400 Ashaninkas, of whom 350 are children, 465 presented themselves voluntarily and 200 recently sought shelter under the Repentance Law.
