In his address, 'Ali Kafi dealt with the current situation in the country and the national conference scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday [25, 26 January]. Over to you, Mahfud. [Mahfud] 'Ali Kafi said that the national conference was nothing but the result of great efforts that have been made since 1992 and thus the HCE had the duty to open the doors for a meeting with all the parties in the dialogue in order to consult in depth about the crisis, so that strong foundations can be laid for the Algerian state. 'Ali Kafi added that the HCE was keen to preserve the dialogue and its aims were to sum up the views of the parties in the dialogue within a draft formula for the national platform, which permits the achievement of a national consensus, i.e. the evolving national proposal. The HCE chairman and secretary general of the National Organization of War Veterans did not hide the fact that some parties engaged in one-upmanship and maneuvering during the increasing events experienced by the country. He also wondered: At the expense of whom is this behavior taking place? He said that history would not have mercy on wavering people and those who maneuver and sometimes conspire against the Algerian nation. In this context, 'Ali Kafi called on parties to go to the conference and on everyone to work to make it successful by giving new hope to the Algerian people through a serious dialogue and concessions by all parties and to stand as one against whoever wants to destroy Algeria. He said in particular: [Begin Kafi recording] We say to all parties on the eve of this conference: Enough messing about, let us all go to the conference with everyone working to make it successful, to give new hope to the people who are looking at us and suffering. We must make this conference successful and we must give hope in order to restore the trust between the citizen and his party, and the citizen and his state, so that the political and social life of this country can return to normal.
