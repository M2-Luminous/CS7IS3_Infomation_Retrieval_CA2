FR941122-0-00003 FR941122-0-00001 Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020 (e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) For program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Background Current regulations at 7 CFR part 278 contain requirements that firms authorized by the Food and Consumer Service to accept food stamps may redeem them only at financial institutions which are insured by the FDIC or the FSLIC; or at financial institutions which are insured under the Federal Credit Union Act and which have retail food stores or wholesale food concerns in their field of membership (7 CFR 278.5). On August 9, 1989, the FSLIC, along with its parent organization, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, ceased to exist. These institutions have been consolidated into the SAIF pursuant to sections 211(6) and 401 of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;73, 103 Stat. 183). The SAIF is administered by the FDIC. This rule amends the Food Stamp Program regulations to delete FSLIC wherever that reference appears. The Department is also amending the regulations to be consistent with the Federal Reserve requirements that financial institutions submit only balanced deposits to the Federal Reserve and use Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) to encode on the Food Stamp Redemption Certificate the verified amount of coupons received from authorized firms. The redemption certificate is the deposit document that authorized firms use to deposit coupons with financial institutions for credit. Deposit Balancing Requirements In an effort to improve the accountability in the food coupon redemption process and reduce the likelihood of fraud, the Department enlisted the cooperation of the Federal Reserve to modify its depositing requirements for food coupons to facilitate reconciliation of coupons deposited with deposit documents and redemption certificates. Financial institutions are now required by the Federal Reserve to submit balanced deposits, which means that the face value of coupons deposited must match both the amount of coupons entered on the financial institution's deposit document and the total amount of coupons entered by authorized firms on the redemption certificates accompanying the deposit. MICR-Encoding Requirement Requiring financial institutions, or retailers with MICR-encoding capability, to MICR-encode the verified coupon amount on redemption certificates allows redemption data to be electronically captured at the Federal Reserve Banks and transmitted directly to the Department's computer processing center. It also allows the Federal Reserve Banks and the Department to achieve greater accuracy and accountability in the coupon deposit reconciliation system while using standard banking technology. A proposed rule dealing with these requirements was published at 56 FR 13,601 on April 3, 1991 and provided the public with a 60-day period to submit comments on the proposed provisions. The Department received no public comments on the proposed rule and this rule is being finalized without change.
