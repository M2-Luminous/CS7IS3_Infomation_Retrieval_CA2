Would you agree with that? I think as foreign minister you might have to, but possibly you could.... [Kingibe] No, no, I'm not agreeing, just being the foreign minister. There is a national consensus about the imperative for democracy in Nigeria. There has always been. We have been consolidating independence, consolidating democratization over time, but there are events which make us return to military rule periodically, and we are under military government at this point in time, but under a military government committed to democratization. Indeed, it has already unfolded a plan of a speedy return to democracy in Nigeria. As you quite rightly quoted, our head of state said this commitment is not only a commitment of the government, but it is a commitment of the people. Our transition program has been unfolded, and come 2 January 1995 there will be full political activity with the formation of political parties, to be followed soon by the restoration of full democratic government.
