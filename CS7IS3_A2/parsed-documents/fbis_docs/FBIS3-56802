In particular, it indicates that the "positive developments on the European and Asian continents are accompanied by the rise of new challenges and dangers. Among these is the aggravation of inter-ethnic conflicts, creation of `vacuum security' zones, attempts to destabilize new independent states from outside and establish `spheres of influence'." The document points out that the idea of "Partnership for Peace" approved by the heads of the NATO member-states has a great positive potential. Its implementation will allow the expansion expand the framework of stability, peace, and trust among states. "We have no right to turn a blind eye to the fact that of late, the forces which call for the reanimation of the totalitarian regime have stepped up their activity," says the declaration. "Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which have voluntarily chosen the path toward a non-nuclear status, cannot but feel anxiety for their security. We call on all the interested states and governments to double their efforts geared to building a safer and a more stable world." Also signed were a "Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between Ukraine and the Republic of Kazakhstan" and eight agreements which regulate mutual indebtedness, establish further cooperation in the space, military and industrial spheres. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev held a news conference for journalists at which they expressed their points of view concerning the priorities of the present-day policy, the prospects for the CIS, the security guarantees for the states which acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other issues. In particular, Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his wish to introduce a single monetary unit called "altyn" on the territory of the former Union and also travel cards which would ensure the freedom of movement on the territory of the CIS states. The presidents expressed their negative attitudes towards the institution of dual citizenship and promised to spare no effort to develop bilateral relations. On 21 January the Kazakhstan delegation leaves for Dnepropetrovsk, where it will visit the "PivdenMash" [southern machine] plant, and for Dneprodzerzhinsk where the future mining engineer, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was on a practical attachment during the years of his studentship.
