At the meeting, the prime minister gave an explanation. Following the explanation, I did my best to make it clear that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree [to what the prime minister said]. The prime minister insisted that the SDPJ should cooperate. The budget formulation is the responsibility of the cabinet, and the prime minister is in charge of it. As such, I told him clearly that while I am not referring to the budget formulation per se, I cannot agree to the substance of his explanation. Based on that stand, I am now announcing a statement by the party. Prime Minister Hosokawa today announced the government's basic policy on a tax system reform which will become the basis for formulating the 1994 budget. The policy proposes instituting, in lieu of the consumption tax, a 7-percent public welfare tax in 1997 as a measure to follow 6 trillion yen in tax cuts -- including 5.3 trillion yen to be cut from the income tax and residential tax. Our party is unable to agree to this. While the tax hike plan is proposed as being the introduction of a public welfare tax, there is virtually no difference between it and the consumption tax. Now that the government is being urged to cut taxes as an immediate measure to stimulate the economy, it is wrong to attach a much bigger tax increase, even if it is imposed three years later. The unpopular effects of the consumption tax would not be corrected by the public welfare tax. Our party has proposed that a specific tax whose revenues would be earmarked for welfare be instituted and further discussions be carried out on the tax rate and on when it should take effect, but our proposal has not been accepted. It is truly regrettable that Prime Minister Hosokawa persisted with the Finance Ministry-led tax reform proposal. Our party believes that a tax system reform must be premised on the assumption that the people agree to it, and it must be one that takes a balance of income, assets, and consumption into account and that is appropriate for the era of the aged population and internationalization. As far as the consumption tax is concerned, in view of the history of how the system came to be adopted in the first place and of its defects, we have pointed out the need to carry out another review of it -- including the possibility of abolishing it altogether -- concerning a reform. As for its bearing on the income tax cut, the proposal to raise the rate is not a wise alternative even when considering the existing poor level of consumption. The policy on a tax system reform announced by Prime Minister Hosokawa does not accept this stand of our party, which is a member of the ruling coalition. The process of reaching an agreement on it has been very inadequate as well. If Prime Minister Hosokawa incorporates the tax hike plan in the budget plan to be introduced at the cabinet meeting, SDPJ cabinet members will not support it. Moreover, it would become extremely difficult for our party to cooperate with the government as a coalition member.
