A family member said Wang Dan left at 9 a.m. with two friends. He was said to have left in a rush to southern China, for probably a week. Wang has been detained by police several times over the past few weeks. It is believed he was warned by the authorities to leave Beijing during Christopher's visit. The dissident's home is still being guarded by security police, who tried to stop our camera crew from taking pictures outside. [Video shows medium-distance shot of a six-story housing block, followed by a closeup of the sign hanging beside the entrance; it reads: "Guest House of the Museum of Chinese Revolution; no security police can be seen, nor is any intervention in the filming shown.] Another well-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, also left the Chinese capital last week. The reason given by his secretary was that he was not feeling well. The Chinese justice minister declined to say whether the dissidents will be allowed to meet with Christopher. [passage omitted]
