CDU Minister Friedrich Bohl, chief of the federal chancellery, said he was optimistic that the liberals would also approve the proposal on which a consensus has now been achieved and that the reservations still being voiced by Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania would be dispelled. The detailed provisions of the proposal are as follows: -- Former owners who were expropriated in the years 1945 to 1949 as well as present leaseholders of agricultural and forestry land can purchase land from the land holdings being administered by the Trust Agency at a favorable rate corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current market value; -- About 73 percent of the land being administered by the Trust Agency has been reserved for eastern German leaseholders under the settlement program. An arbitration agency will be established for settling possible disputes between parties having interests in the land. -- The possibilities envisaged by the draft law enabling former owners to repurchase land will be strengthened and take the form of a provision stating explicitly that such an option is available. There will be no claims to specific tracts of land. -- As in the case of all others who are entitled to compensation, the level of compensation to be provided to former owners who wish to repurchase land will be verified and former owners will then receive bonds that can be redeemed until 2004. -- Former owners who wish to repurchase land must apply for the purchase of land within six months of receiving a bond. -- Valuations connected with the purchase of land will be conducted in accordance with criteria that are the same as those to be used for establishing the base rate for compensation. This means that the value of agricultural and forestry land in 1935 will be multiplied by a factor of three. -- However, the compensation provided in connection with repurchasing will be lowered, before the previous receipt of compensation for losses is considered, to take account of the possible loss of interest resulting from the early redemption of a bond and the general degressive reductions in compensation envisaged by the compensation law. In concrete terms, this means that a former owner who lost 50 hectares of land can use compensation worth 57,000 German marks [DM] to repurchase 19 hectares of land. In the case of 100 hectares, the compensation will amount to DM87,000, and the area of land to be repurchased will total 29 hectares. In the case of 500 hectares, the corresponding amounts are DM252,000 and 84 hectares, and DM402,000 hectares and 134 hectares in the case of 1,000 hectares. -- To partially finance the repurchase of land on preferential terms, the 10-percent investment bonus (which amounts to DM1 billion) for the reinvestment of compensation in the new laender will be abolished. Where the additional expenditure of DM1.5 billion is to come from still requires final clarification.
