In a debate last month, the Prime Minister staked much of his credibility on defending the compromise negotiated by Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, saying it would protect British interests. But yesterday, M Delors told the European Parliament that, given his "constant concern to strengthen the decisionmaking of the Union and its capacity for action" and the fact that he had opposed the compromise, he had "embarked on a damage-limitation exercise." He declared that the compromise agreement "is political declaration, not legal text" and that the Commission retained the power to declare that the "reasonable period" for delaying decisions had been exhausted. To force a vote to go through, with the blocking minority at 27, would require the support of only half the EC members. In the circumstances, that would be an easy proposition. He also stressed that the British concession will only last until voting procedures are reviewed in 1996. M Delors fears any attempt by Britain to slowdown EC decisionmaking. Britain lost its battle to freeze the number of votes required to block EC decisions at 23 when the EC is enlarged with the addition of four new members next year. The "blocking minority" will rise to 27, thus making it harder for Britain to block EC decisions. But, as a sop to the British, the EC agreed that, in cases where 23 votes are mustered against a proposal but not the full 27, there will be a "reasonable delay" while consensus is sought. Even this minimal concession has annoyed federalist-minded Euro-MPs, many of whom may vote against the treaty admitting Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway to the EC because of it. For them, any widening of the EC must be accompanied by "deepening" -- further integration -- to prevent the wheels of the Community from seizing up. Enough of these MEPs [Member of the European Parliament] may oppose the enlargement treaty, or abstain, to prevent it from going through, and the EC is embarked on an attempt to persuade them to vote positively on May 4.
