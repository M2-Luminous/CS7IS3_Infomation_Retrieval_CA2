Background Sometimes, a mortgagor must confront the twin realities of not being able to meet his or her mortgage obligation and static or declining property values. Such a situation makes it virtually impossible for a financially distressed mortgagor to sell the home and, using the proceeds, to fully discharge the mortgage debt. Foreclosure of the mortgage is often the method of resolving these difficulties.
