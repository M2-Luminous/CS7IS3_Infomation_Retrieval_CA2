FR940817-1-00027 FR940817-1-00010 By this notice EPA hereby proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary administrative stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including the applicable compliance dates, promulgated as final federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofitting of equipment containing ozone-depleting refrigerants (58 FR 28660, May 14, 1993). Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set forth in section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby requests comment on such a proposed stay. EPA is proposing this temporary administrative stay of the rules and associated compliance dates in order to complete reconsideration of these rules, EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rules and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action. If the reconsideration results in repair and retrofit requirements for industrial process refrigeration equipment that are stricter than the existing and rules, EPA intends to propose an appropriate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration. EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). The regulatory requirements that are affected by today's proposal were raised in the context of a settlement agreement between EPA and the Chemical Manufacturers Association. 1 A 113(g) notice of the settlement agreement was published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584).
