The leaders of these political entities said that the signing of the coalition agreement is the first decision of this kind taken on the Slovak political scene and that it is the first step toward shaping the Slovak political scene in line with a normal West European model. Democratic Left [PDL] Party Chairman Peter Weiss answered questions concerning the future of the bloc of left-wing parties put to him by editor Ivan Samel: [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, are you not afraid that this bloc might encounter a fate similar to that encountered by the Democratic Party when the rightwing parties tried to merge? [Words indistinct] [Weiss] We are neither merging nor uniting. What we want is cooperation. Our considerations are based on the fact that today's signing of the coalition agreement between these four political parties is an important event on the Slovak political scene which is still lacking its final shape and the evolution of which is still in the making. [passage omitted] We are optimists. We intend to turn this coalition into an instrument of election victory. [Samel] Do you contemplate a possibility of a further enlargement of the campaign bloc? [Weiss] All the four partners proposed that the Association of Workers of Slovakia should join an open coalition. Although the proposal was not accepted, our offer on post-election cooperation is still on the table. It is up to the Association of Workers of Slovakia to decide. [Samel] On more than one occasion you have expressed a willingness to cooperate with the present coalition partners in the government even after the elections. After concluding the coalition, do you regard that option as being still open or topical? [Weiss] It is a likely option, but one naturally cannot jump the result of the elections. We would like to emerge from the elections in a situation which would allow us to say who will be our coalition partners. Of course, much will depend on how the present government coalition performs. So far, we have been able to overcome all natural differences of views that exist among the left, the center, and the rightwing coalition partners, by holding rational and civilized discussions.
