He added he is willing to investigate within the executive branch should the situation demand it. The president will carefully review the final budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] report and submit it to the civilian cabinet to verify if it is necessary to investigate the Executive Branch. After stating that the executive branch cooperated with the CPI investigations by providing information requested by its members, the president said: "If the situation requires it, we will continue the investigation through the Special Investigating Commission." Established by the president to investigate irregularities in the Executive Branch, the Special Investigating Commission will be installed either on the 25 or 26 January. It will be headed by Federal Administration Secretary (SAF) Romildo Cahim. It comprises, among others, members of the Ethics in Politics Movement. Itamar Franco is satisfied with the CPI works that have concluded but he believes the issuance of the CPI final report will mark the beginning of an investigation into the mishandling of the public budget. He said: "Congress did what had to be done," adding: "Of course, this is only one stage. It will continue through the Senate and Chamber of Deputies justice commissions and joint sessions of Congress." On his way back from Leticia, a town on the Brazilian-Colombian border where he attended the installation of the Brazilian-Colombian Neighborhood Commission, the president said the Executive Branch will continue to submit all requested information to help clarify the mishandling of the budget. "Our cooperation can be confirmed by any CPI member" he said between sips of mineral water. He did not want to comment on whether the Judicial Branch will follow the example of the Legislative Branch and investigate its own activities. "The Judicial Branch is a different government entity," he said. During the interview with JORNAL DO BRASIL, the president said he will meet with Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], the government leader in the Senate; and Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, to discuss the appointment of the new mines and energy minister. Itamar Franco will chose the successor to Deputy Paulino Cicero (PSDB-MG) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Mato Grosso], who left his post to run in the elections. He declined to comment on whether former Civilian Cabinet Minister Henrique Hargreaves will be appointed.
