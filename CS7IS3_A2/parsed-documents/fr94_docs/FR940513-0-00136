FR940513-0-00136 FR940513-0-00034 A few comments recommended that required labeling for compact fluorescent lamps include additional information, such as the lamp's incandescent wattage equivalency, color and temperature ratings, noise and interference factors, and whether the lumen output of the lamp is substantially different in a base-up or base-down installation. 51 The Commission discusses these issues in Part IV.C.4, below. 51 See, e.g. , NW REAL, GG&hyph;12, 1; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 2&hyph;7, 7&hyph;8; ORSU, GG&hyph;14, 2&hyph;3; LRC, GG&hyph;15, 1&hyph;2; MA AG (Supp.), GG&hyph;24, 2; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 1; ACEEE (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 3. See also note 136, below. 1. Basic Disclosures a. Voltage. Voltage refers to the electromotive force of electricity. 52 In the residential market, the voltage provided by electric utilities in this country for lighting purposes is primarily 120 volts, 53 but may range from approximately 115 to 125 volts. 54 Voltage is not a characteristic of a lamp product, but the operation of a lamp is affected by the voltage at which it operates. For a given lamp, the higher the voltage, the higher the light output in lumens, the higher the wattage, and the shorter the life. 55 In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring that manufacturers disclose voltage on packaging only if the product's ``design voltage,'' i.e., the voltage at which the lamp was designed to operate, is other than 120 volts. 52 The term ``volt'' (a unit of potential difference and of electromotive force) is defined as the difference of electric potential between two points of a conducting wire carrying a constant current of one ampere, when the power dissipated between those points is equal to one watt. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, ``The International System of Units (SI),'' NIST Special Publication 330 (1991 edition), August 1991 (hereinafter cited as ``NIST Publication 330''), at 19. 53 NEPS (Tr.), 37 (for residential consumers, voltage provided by utilities for lighting is predominately 120 volts); ACEEE (Tr.), 38 (120 volts is normal for vast majority of homes); IES (Tr.), 62 (same). Utility companies in some parts of the country, however, such as the Northwest, provide other voltages such as 125 volts, and manufacturers ship lamps with those design voltages to those areas. Osram (Tr.), 51&hyph;52 (ships 125-volt lamps to Northwest, which has slightly higher line voltage); GE (Tr.), 60 (Northwest/TVA is 125 volts); Osram (Tr.), 64 (ships 125-volt lamps to Seattle and TVA). In recognition of the predominant demand for lamps that operate at 120 volts, manufacturers design most incandescent lamps for operation at that voltage. GE (Tr.), 37&hyph;38 (90% or more). See also Osram (Tr.), 64&hyph;65 (no more than 10% of its incandescent lamps have 125 design voltage). 54 Even within a given locality, the voltage may vary by plus or minus five percent. NEPS (Tr.), 37. 55 See, e.g., GE (Tr.), 35. During the proceeding, commentors explained that lamps produced for use in this country fall into three basic categories, based on their design voltage. The vast majority of lamps have a design voltage of ( i.e. , are manufactured to operate at) 120 volts. 56 A minority of lamps are produced with a different design voltage because they are intended for use in limited areas of the country, such as the Northwest, in which the line voltage is 125. 57 The last category includes lamps with a design voltage of 130. These lamps typically are produced with a heavier filament and have longer lives when used at 120 volts (though providing less light) than competing lamps with design voltages of 120 volts. They are generally sold as ``long-life'' products 58 and are marketed throughout the country, regardless of the line voltage in the particular area. 59 56 See note 53, above. 57 Id. 58 See GE (Tr.), 35&hyph;36; Supreme (Tr.), 39. 59 See, e.g., ACEEE (Tr.), 202.
