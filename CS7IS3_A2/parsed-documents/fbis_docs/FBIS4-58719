All evidence indicates that the few issues left for the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships will be resolved, allowing for the agreement to be signed tomorrow as scheduled. With the signing of the agreement, heavy responsibilities and burdens will be placed on the shoulders of the Palestinians. These are epitomized by the powers and authorities that will be transferred to the Palestinians in the Palestinian transitional rule area and by the management of their own affairs in various spheres. This is an extremely difficult task, requiring a great deal of awareness and maturity, in addition to scientific, management, and technical expertise and skills. The Palestinians definitely do not suffer from a shortage of capabilities and expertise to run their own affairs and manage various aspects of their lives. Now that they are facing the first challenges of assuming certain security and management powers and authorities in the self-rule area, in addition to other powers that will be handed over to them in the West Bank, they realize well the heavy responsibilities and duties placed on their shoulders and are aware of the dangers and repercussions that might stem from their performance during the stage they are about to enter. No one can doubt the ability of the Palestinian people to pass the next test and overcome the coming crucial challenges. The process of a full century of struggle to obtain national rights and the ensuing experience and sacrifices have taught the Palestinians the meaning of affiliation to society. Undoubtedly, the apprehension and anticipation dominating the feelings of the Palestinians at this time will disappear with the beginning of serious work to construct the expected entity. This construction must take place within the framework of sincere national affiliation and of placing the supreme interest above any other consideration, as well as of dialogue and mutual respect of opinions, the supremacy of objective and rational concepts, and the proper democratic spirit. In brief, with their wisdom and efforts and by being open to the world around them, the Palestinians are able to silence the skeptical voices that are rising now, especially from the Israeli side, and which are betting in advance on the Palestinians' inability to cope with the task that will be handed over to them. Certainly, the task is not easy, but the issue concerns the Palestinian people's continuing march, which must move forward regardless of the cost, effort, and sacrifices.
