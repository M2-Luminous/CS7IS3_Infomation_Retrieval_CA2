Members of ID said there is clear evidence that the goal was to approve an extension of the deputies' term and their immediate reelection. [Begin ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo recording] We want to reiterate, on behalf of the ID bloc, that we reject the approval of constitutional reforms and the way the issue was handled. It was obvious yesterday that deputies still have plans to extend their term even though they did not get the necessary 52 votes -- for the third time -- to establish clearly that there will be no extension of terms or immediate reelection [sentence as heard]. It is obvious that they intend to prevent the approval of the temporary provision that would implement constitutional reforms effective 1996. That is another reason why we insisted on the need to close the Congress sessions. It cannot continue to function to approve reforms under these circumstances and with an electoral process under way. [end recording] ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo said he endorses the closure of the special congress period, because then the reforms will fail and they will be discussed on another occasion, free from political considerations.
