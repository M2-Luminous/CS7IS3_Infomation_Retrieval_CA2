FBIS4-37259 "drnes118_j_94030" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Sanaa Denies Firing Katyushas on Aden Sanaa Denies Firing Katyushas on Aden JN1806053394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 18 Jun 94 JN1806053394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source has said that Cairo radio quoted a so-called responsible source in Aden as saying that a military vehicle affiliated with the forces of unity and legitimacy carrying katyusha rockets apparently infiltrated the ranks of the rebellious and illegitimate forces and fired rockets on the Port of Aden. The radio said some shells fell on residential districts in the al-Tawwadi area in Aden. At a time when we stress our categorical denial of the infiltration of any vehicle affiliated with our Armed Forces, and the impossibility of such an infiltration from the military point of view, we would like to say that this news report proves with categorical evidence that residential districts in Aden are being shelled from the military positions controlled by the forces of rebellion and secession inside Aden. This is with the aim of fastening the charge on the forces of unity and legitimacy and showing pictures of the victims of this criminal aggression, which is being carried out by the criminal secessionist gang against innocent civilians in valiant Aden. This is part of a failed attempt to draw world public sympathy. The source stressed that the criminal, secessionist gang has not hesitated to commit the ugliest crimes against the homeland and the people. Through its repressive agencies and its militiamen, that gang is now exercising all types of pressure and torture against citizens in Aden. They take children, women, and elderly out of their homes by force, compel them to carry weapons, and push them into the combat lines and the crematorium of death.
