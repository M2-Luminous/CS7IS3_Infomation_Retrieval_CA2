FBIS3-53733 "drnes012_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-012 Document Type:Daily Report 19 Jan 1994 SYRIA Israeli Summit Reaction, Referendum Talk Decried JN1901123894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 19 Jan 94 JN1901123894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] A commentary by the newspaper TISHRIN addresses reactions to the Geneva summit, saying: Politicians, observers, and political analysts were unanimous that Syria has clearly and favorably responded to all peace requirements, and that the Geneva talks have opened all the doors for a true, just, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The appeal President al-Asad has made, urging Israeli rulers to accept the peace of the brave, and to make efforts to achieve comprehensive and just peace in the region puts Israel to the test, particularly since U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared his support for this appeal by President al-Asad. Similarly, the U.S. president has clearly committed himself to work to achieve just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. TISHRIN adds: The Geneva summit has paved the way for a durable peace in the Middle East. However, the materialization of such a peace is contingent upon a positive position on Israel's part. But, Israeli rulers have chosen to cast doubts, voice reservations, and float the idea of holding a referendum on the future of the Golan, as if it were not occupied Syrian territory. TISHRIN goes on to say: The game of referendum on the Golan, which is ostensibly backed by Rabin, is opposed by many. This game is designed to circumvent the summit outcome and the categorical Syrian-U.S. reaffirmation of efforts to achieve just peace in the Middle East. It is a declaration of intent meant to evade the requirements of the peace desired by the international community. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: President al-Asad has repeatedly affirmed, as he did during the Geneva summit, that there can be no bargaining over the Golan, and that Syria will not cede a single inch of its territory. For peace must terminate occupation. Otherwise, it will not have any chance of success. Moreover, Syria cannot abandon its territories or rights, nor can it bargain over them. As far as the Israeli rulers are concerned, peace is close at hand. They could help achieve it if they only have the necessary courage, as President al-Asad has, indeed, said during the Geneva summit. For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Washington bilateral talks will be resumed as a result of the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Israel has again returned to the method of maneuvering to thwart the efforts to achieve the objective of the peace process, namely, the attainment of just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant international legitimacy resolutions. Israel's return to the methods of maneuvering, procrastination, and word play is nothing new. It attempted to belittle the importance of the Geneva summit prior to its convocation through a deceptive media campaign. Right now, it is attempting to launch a similar campaign to dilute its outcome. The paper adds: Israel's initial reaction to the summit outcome concerned the Golan. Israel has begun to promote the so-called referendum on the Golan under the guise of making concessions for peace. The paper wonders: About which concessions is Israel talking? For only property owners have the right to make concessions. Does Israel own anything on the Golan? Since the answer is in the negative, Israel does not have the right to claim that it would be making any concessions for peace. Does the decision to annex the Golan, which was deemed null and void by UN resolutions, give Israel the right to make any such claims? Concluding its commentary, the paper says: It is clear that Israel, which has found itself facing an impasse in the aftermath of the Geneva summit, still clings to intransigent positions on peace. Hence, the bilateral talks, due to resume soon, will test Rabin's true intentions. The international consensus on peace, which has been manifested in the reactions to the Geneva summit, is in line with the need to see stability in the region. It is believed that this consensus will not give Israel ample room for maneuvering. In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The Geneva summit between His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton is an extremely important event. It is a turning point in the region's history. Many convictions, misconceptions, and fallacies have been removed when faced with the glow of hard facts. AL-THAWRAH adds: With an open heart and mind, al-Asad's Syria, backed by the entire nation, was in Geneva. Thanks to its weight, its special pioneering and historical role, and its constant determination to accomplish difficult pan-Arab missions, President al-Asad, the man of the hard missions who is always willing to make firm and tough decisions, has managed to entrench the constant Arab rights, and to make it clear that the achievement of a solution is contingent upon the restoration of such rights. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The peace of the brave leader al-Asad has promoted at the Geneva summit is the height of loyalty to the sacrifices made by convoys of martyrs. It reflects Syria's desire for a just and honorable peace, as well as Syria's commitment to work to achieve peace. The appeal President al-Asad has made in this regard is a fresh challenge to Israeli politicians and rulers, who profess to be advocates of peace. Al-Asad has challenged them to adopt credible positions. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If there is a sincere effort to achieve such a peace, there would be no room for differing interpretations. Any solution that falls short of ensuring the restoration of all occupied Arab territories cannot bring peace.
