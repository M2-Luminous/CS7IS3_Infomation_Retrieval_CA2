China is a high-priority country in Russia's foreign policy, declared Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Aleksandr Panov in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday. The deputy minister said the relationship between the two countries should be stripped of all "sensationalism, and should just be normal relations between normal neighbors, two superpowers" who are cooperating in the interests of each other, their region, and the whole world. According to Panov, the fact that the new year is beginning with visits by United States President Bill Clinton to Moscow and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to China is symbolic. Although the delegations are in "different weight categories", they reinforce the balance which Russia is maintaining in its foreign policy, which is directed towards the east as much as it is towards the west. Panov said that Kozyrev's official visit, which is scheduled to begin on January 26, will include discussion of preparations for a return visit to Moscow by Chinese Premier Jiang Zeming. The potential for Russian-Chinese partnership is great, said Panov. In particular, Russia has not paid enough attention to China's experience in gradual economic reforms, especially in the formation of "special" free economic zones. Talks on the two countries' border are currently being held. Panov called "groundless" the allegations sometimes made by indvidual Russian statesmen (especially in the Far East), to the effect that Russia is making one-sided, unjustifiable compromises under Chinese pressure. Whenever the two sides make concessions, they are reciprocal, "mutual" concessions. As far as the military sphere is concerned, Russia and China are negotiating on the withdrawal of some armed forces from the border areas. But these withdrawals would not be of a "sharp or sensational nature, since it is more and more obvious that no military preparations are being made along the border, which is becoming a border of friendship", Panov explained. The deputy foreign minister declared that Russian-Chinese trade is mutually profitable and does not infringe upon Russia's economic interests. This trade will be continually expanded, he said. Panov appealed for more complete information on the two countries' relations to be made available to society. Kozyrev's january visit to Beijing is destined to play an important role in fulfilling this goal.
