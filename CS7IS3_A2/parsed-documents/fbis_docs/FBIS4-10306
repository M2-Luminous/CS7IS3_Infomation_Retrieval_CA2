The only consensus within the economic team is the feasibility of putting the real into circulation on 1 June, despite the fact that the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] prefers 1 July. Finance Ministry advisers observe that the acceptance of the URV [Real Value Unit] is widespread. Several price indexes have already adopted the URV as the new unit of reference. The PSDB believes that the creation of the new currency on 1 July will help the candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. According to PSDB projections, inflation should be below 5 percent by October. One of the main controversial subjects among the economic team members is the exchange system that will be adopted following the creation of the real; that is, the dollar quotation in the new currency. Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, BC International Affairs Director Gustavo Franco, and special adviser Jose Milton Dallari do not favor a fixed exchange rate (that is, a fixed dollar price in reals). However, Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch and special adviser Edmar Bacha defend a fixed exchange rate during the first stage of the real so as to curb inflation more quickly. Another point of disagreement is the manner by which inflation will be eliminated at the moment of transition from one currency to the other. This means not taking into account the price variations of the periods before and after the creation of the real. The objective is not to transmit the price variations of the old currency (cruzeiro real) to the new currency. As for prefixed contracts [credit card payments or purchases in installments] other economic plans had adopted a conversion scale with daily conversion indexes. Given that these are short-term contracts (an average 30 days), part of the economic team believes that the anticipated announcement of the date of creation of the new currency does not make the adoption of a conversion scale necessary. The economic team has not yet agreed on mechanisms for eliminating the monetary correction during the month that the real will go into effect, and the following month. Gustavo Franco, who used to push for the issuance of a decree that would establish rules to eliminate the inflationary residues, now has begun to say that the subject is "very complicated." The rules for the adoption of the URV in the financial system also cause contradictions. In the past two weeks Franco and Dallari envisaged creating as soon as possible CDB's [Bank Deposit Certificates] in URV's. Malan and BC Norms Director Claudio Mauch believe that the immediate adoption of such a measure would be precipitate. Another controversial point is the conversion of public utility rates into URV's. Dallari believes that a daily correction of fuel and electricity prices would further bolster inflation. The creation of a special BC directorate with the sole objective of looking after the issuance of the real implies further problems. The subject is being discussed behind closed doors because the creation of such a directorate requires congressional approval. The measures that divide the economic team are: The Date for Placing the Real into Circulation The most probable date is 1 June, as most of the team wants, while Cardoso and the PSDB favor 1 July with an eye on the elections calendar. Backing for the New Currency This is the mechanism to guarantee the real, to turn it into a strong currency. It is not yet known what portion of the exchange reserves will be used to guarantee the real, or whether the government will take any actions in this regard. Dollar Exchange Rate Part of the economic team wants a fixed exchange rate; that is, that the dollar price in real should always remain the same. The BC defends a fluctuating exchange rate. Financial System The Finance Ministry wants a faster adoption of the URV in the financial system, while the BC favors a more cautious approach. Public Utility Rates While some members of the economic team defend the immediate conversion of public utility rates into URV, others consider that such a measure would fuel inflation as the utility rates could increase daily. Special BC Directorate The BC would create a special directorate only to look after the issuance of the real. Finance Minister Ricupero has not yet given the green light for this project, and the economic team has not yet defined how the measure will be sent to Congress. Inflation It has not yet been decided how to eliminate inflation in real cruzeiros at the moment of the creation of the real. Other economic plans adopted a conversion scale to discount the inflationary expectations embedded in prefixed contracts.
