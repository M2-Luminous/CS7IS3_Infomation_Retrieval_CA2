This was stated today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at a news conference in Sevastopol when the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet ended. According to the Russian minister, besides 126 ships and vessels of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has seized 38 moorings with a total length of 3,457 meters, which is 10 percent of the entire mooring front of the Black Sea Fleet. Besides this, Ukraine's military department has seized 2,245 buildings and structures belonging to the Black Sea Fleet. All this, stated Pavel Grachev, should be taken into account during the forthcoming dividing up of not only the vessels, but also the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet.
