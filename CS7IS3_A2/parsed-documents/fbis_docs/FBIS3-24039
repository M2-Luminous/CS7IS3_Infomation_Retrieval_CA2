Let us summarize the results of the last year in your department. First the pleasing ones, and leave the unhappy ones for later. [Antoci] Permit me to give a somewhat untraditional answer to your tradition question about "pleasing results." Needless to say, there is nothing simpler that to select the very figures that would satisfy you out of the enormous mass of statistical data and offer them to the public. But I would like to draw attention to those details which define the essence of the criminogenic situation and are fundamental. The reader should not be intimidated by the significant number of statistical layouts that we resort to; you can judge the results of our work by them, and so we cannot get along without them. In 1991 the level of crime per 10,000 population was 102.1. In 1992 it was 90.1. Last year it was 85.1. So we can say with full certainty that the trend is positive, there is some decline in the crime rate. All this contradicts the common opinion that crime is constantly growing in the republic. One more important aspect is the situation and trend in the crimes that are classified as serious. In comparison the 1992 this indicator dropped by 1.4 percent. This might appear to be a very insignificant reduction, but if you consider that serious crimes in the republic as a whole have shown a consistent tendency to grow in recent years, the positive changes and the effectiveness of the measures we are taking in this area must be recognized. The activism and labor productivity of our employees has risen in an absolute majority of the city and rayon police divisions. The percentage of crimes solved is properly considered the main criterion for evaluating the activity of internal affairs organs. Last year this indicator (I will add, a very important one) rose from 35.3 to 46.6 percent. But it still does not satisfy us. [Interviewer] And us, the inhabitants of Moldova, even less. Numbers are well and good, but the social terror is more real than statistics. It results above all from the sharp growth in crime, especially among young people. Drug addiction, prostitution. How are police organs fighting this social evil? [Antoci] In 1993 our police recorded 1,972 crimes committed by adolescents. Unfortunately, growth of crimes among young people in recent years is raising its own "goals." It is especially bad in this sense in Belts, Bender, and Ryshkan. And in Ungen the increase was some 350 percent!? Unfortunately, the number of serious crimes committed by adolescents has also increased. There were 125 percent more homicides, 40 percent more cases of serious bodily injury, and 19 percent more rapes. The figures are very alarming. The socioeconomic condition of the republic, the sharp reduction in jobs, and the closing of numerous educational institutions are significant factors in all this. As for drug addiction, the main efforts of the republic's internal affairs organs have been directed to prevention and quickly solving crimes committed by addicts. But meanwhile drug addiction and illegal trade in psychotropic substances in the republic are growing in scale. It is becoming a serious social evil. In 1993 police organs recorded 265 crimes related to illegal trade in narcotics (248 of them or 93.6 percent were solved). But in 1992 there were just 120 such crimes. Such a rate of growth puts you very much on guard. Ten of "our" Moldovan citizens were arrested for trade in narcotics in Romania, and two in Ukraine. On the other hand, we have plenty of "visitors" from other regions. For example, in September of last year our people arrested a certain P. Portnov from Samara, a shipping agent of the Samaramebel Joint-Stock Society, in the Oknitsa hotel, and found that he had 8 kilograms of poppy heads. A more recent example occurred on 12 January when S. Grishin, a Russian citizen, was arrested in Oknitsa in possession of 8.7 kilograms of this toxic substance. Another problem is also alarming--the decline in morals, especially among young people. This has led to the formation of a specialized division, the morals police within the Ministry of Internal Affairs system, by Decision of the Presidium of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. The division engages in preventing and stopping propaganda for pornography, sadism, and the cult of violence and fights the spread of AIDS and venereal diseases, prostitution, and other offenses against public morality. [Interviewer] A new generation has joined police organs recently. Police work is complex. They deal with people. Crudeness, lack of tact, and insensitivity are intolerable here. Probably many moral qualities of the future guardians of order and legality must be taken into account in recruiting them. In general, how is personnel selection organized in your organization, and how do you fight for the honor of the uniform? This question also ties in with the fact that, alas, among the police there have been extortionists, thieves, and many other violators of the law. Our journalists sometimes write about them. [Antoci] It should be clear to everyone that with the transition to market relations, unrestrained inflation, and unemployment, which have separated people into prosperous and needy, police work has become much more complicated. Based on this the 1 December 1992 Decree of the Government of the Republic of Moldova reorganized the structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and police subdivisions fundamentally. The number of municipal, criminal, economic, and highway police and investigators was brought into line with present-day requirements. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is working seriously on selection of new, qualified employees to fill vacant positions. The moral and work characteristics of the candidates are necessarily considered in selection. They undergo psycho-physiological testing at the military medical commission. In 1993 more than 2,500 people were admitted to the service. Among them were 756 in leadership positions. Unfortunately, only 191 of the persons admitted into the service had specialized legal education (at present the capacities of the specialized educational institutions are very limited). It should also be acknowledged here, unfortunately, that accidental people, violators of discipline, and even people who have taken up the path of crime do get into our ranks. In 1993 668 persons were discharged from internal affairs organs for committing actions that discredited the title of police officer and 95 were discharged for service unsuitability. People also leave our ranks for other reasons. The level of pay is inadequate, and domestic conditions are hard. It is a big mistake to think that police have an easy life. We have many purely domestic concerns. [Interviewer] If it is not a secret, how many members are there in the Moldovan police and what does the rank-and-rile police employee earn? Ordinary people are jealous of them and believe they get fantastic amounts. But in talking with police employees you also hear complaints. Arbitrary leveling occurs, they say. Detectives receive about the same as police employees sitting in warm, comfortable offices. The one is constantly on the brink of danger and may get a bullet or a--excuse the term--"pen" [criminal slang for "knife"] in the stomach, while the other takes no risks. [Antoci] Overall the number of police employees relative to the population of Moldova is no higher than in the republics of the CIS or other countries and it has not changed in the last 3 years. Military servicemen of the carbine troops are also used to patrol and guard certain sites to fight crime in many cities and populated points. As for pay, it depends of the employee's years of service in the police and ranges from 40 to 150 lei. You must agree that that is not so much. At some enterprises and companies, for example, people receive much more just for services in guarding a site. You should not forget about the extreme conditions in which most of our police personnel work. About "leveling." Indeed, the pay system that exists today does not, unfortunately, permit a differentiated approach to defining the labor of each individual employee. But the Ministry of Internal Affairs is preparing appropriate proposals on this. It is true that at present employees of the operational services, investigation, and other subdivisions with especially difficult working conditions receive pay supplements (from 15 to 50 percent of their salaries) depending on results achieved, and preferences in acquiring the next rank have been established in the operational services to retain our primary core group of professionals. [Interviewer] Is your system experiencing what is called the "brain drain"? There was a time when outstanding specialists were forced to look for work outside the republic or in profit-making structures here. [Antoci] I have already answered that question in part when I spoke of the very difficult period in which we are all living. The sharp decline in the economy could not help but be reflected in what you call the "brain drain." Unfortunately, outstanding specialists, top-quality professionals, are abandoning our ranks today too, even before reaching the desired pension age. But only a few find work outside the republic. Most of them, dissatisfied with the pay and working conditions, leave and find work in profit-making structures within the republic. This continues to be a sore spot for us. [Interviewer] There is an economic police force. In addition the Moldovan Ministry of Finance formed a financial guard. Isn't there duplication of work here, unnecessary activity and waste of money? [Antoci] That is a timely question. In fact, in the initial stage of transition of the economy to the free market with its companies, concerns, commercial banks and so on, other control organs were formed in the republic in addition to the economic police, among them the financial guard. But experience confirmed your fears and ours: duplication started and dispersion of funds, and it became necessary to review the staff of the control organs. Substantiated proposals on this matter have already been submitted to the Government of the Republic of Moldova. The essential point of them is that for purposes of more effective crime fighting it would be advisable in this sphere to form a single professional control organ on the basis of the economic police and the financial guard. [Interviewer] Our last question, with hopes for an optimistic answer. Will the mighty detachment of Moldovan police be able to significantly reduce the level of crime in the coming year? Will we be able, suppose, to go for peaceful family walks in the evening in any remote part of the city, places where today--why hide it--you will not find any police patrols? [Antoci] I think that we have grounds for cautious optimism. Let me repeat, cautious. The time of mindless "deadlines" for eliminating crime and posing the challenge of "sharply reducing it" has passed. Everything is much more complex than that. The criminal world reacts quickly to the various changes in society. It is extremely dangerous today. It is well organized, corrupt, very well armed, and unrestrained in its choice of means. General success in the struggle to root out the criminal world will come only with a general normalization of the moral climate of society. But the police must oppose the criminal world and they can do it. Yes, it is the duty of the policy to guard order and the lawful interests of our people, but the people themselves can actively help the police. [Interviewer] Thank you, mister minister, for your answers.
