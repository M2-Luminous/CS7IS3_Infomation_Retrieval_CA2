The specific changes the Commission adopts are: Page 102_Corporate Control Over Respondent Some format modifications are made for electronic reporting purposes to better report vertical control of respondent from the immediate parent to ultimate controlling parent company. Page 103_Companies Controlled by Respondent This is a new schedule added as new page 103, similar to the schedules currently in Form Nos. 1 and 2, to report all subsidiaries directly controlled by a respondent. Page 105_Directors This schedule is modified to delete the instructions at the top of the page and information required at lines 21 through 23. The deleted material is replaced with similar instructions at the top of the schedule and ``Title'' is inserted in addition to ``Name of Director'' in column (a). This will make the format the same as Form Nos. 1 and 2. Pages 106 and 107_Voting Powers of Security Holders This schedule is deleted because it is not needed for Commission regulatory purposes.
