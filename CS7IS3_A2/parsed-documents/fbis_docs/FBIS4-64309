According to Saab Military Aircraft, the testing of a future version of the steering system has not given the results they expected. The tests have been carried out on a simulator. No flights with the test aircraft will be made until it has been ensured that deviations in the steering system do not affect flight safety. Those JAS aircraft which have been series-built and which will be delivered to the air force have another version of the steering system.
