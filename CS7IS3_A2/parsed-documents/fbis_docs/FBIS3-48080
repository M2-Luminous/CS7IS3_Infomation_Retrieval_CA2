The commentary titled "water pollution under corrupt politics" notes that more than ten million people in Pusan and North and South Kyongsang Provinces of South Korea are suffering from a shortage of drinking water because the Naktong River is seriously contaminated with ammonia nitrogen and carcinogenic benzene, toluene and other toxic substances. The news analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam clique, much upset, is resorting to petty tricks to lull the resentment of the people, sending "a fact-finding team" to the spot and publishing "a message of apology to the people" in the name of the puppet prime minister. On the other hand, it is working hard to shirk the blame for the drinking water problem. Such hide-and-seek of the puppets, however, can work on nobody at all. [sentence as received] The South Korean people know only too well it is the Kim Yong-sam clique that has received thick bundles of banknotes from pollution-causing comprador businesses and connived at their dumping of toxic waste water into the Naktong River. Under corrupt politics, nature and society become sick and degenerated. With nothing can the Kim Yong-sam clique conceal its treacherous acts in turning South Korea into "the worst hell of pollution in the world" and imposing sufferings and misfortunes on the people.
