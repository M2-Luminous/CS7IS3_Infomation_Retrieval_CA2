The agrarians made a series of revealing statements and showed the audience (made up primarily of their own faction's deputies, who obligingly ensured a quorum at an event organized by their bosses) presidential draft edicts "On the Reorganization of Agricultural Enterprises..." and "On the Procedure for Reorganizing and Downsizing Agricultural Enterprises and Privatizing Land and Other Property," and also an analytical memo signed by Petr Filippov "On the Urgent Need To Split Joint-Stock Companies and Collective Farms into Small Collective Peasants' Farms Before Spring Seeding Time." "The Agrarian Party opposes any forcible actions against the peasants by the state," APR leader Mikhail Lapshin said, warning that "carrying out reform by old, administrative methods from above, reform that leads to the fragmentation of collective farms into small farms, is particularly dangerous precisely on the eve of seeding time," because "it will keep collective farm workers under strain" and distract them "from applying fertilizers to cereals." In the view of the faction leaders, this coercion was spearheaded by the presidential administration and its chief, Sergey Filatov, in person. Complaining against him also as the mastermind behind the compilation of a "blacklist" of former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet deputies who were reported to be sympathizing with anti- presidential forces, Mr. Lapshin wondered aloud, "Why is it that one and the same building sends appeals for civil accord alongside with documents that may literally blow up society." Mikhail Lapshin acknowledged that under the circumstances he "does not see a place for the peasantry's signature" under the Kremlin-proposed accord on civil peace. Moreover, in his opinion, "it cannot be ruled out that in mid- or late June the Russian peasantry may rise with the sole demand that this government should go."
