They were offered for consideration to several Western countries which expressed a desire to give aid to Ukraine in this sphere. The main attention was given to projects concerning the conversion of munitions factories, their reorientation on the output of civil products, solution of social problems, construction of housing for retiring servicemen and their retraining to learn civil professions and trades. Asked by journalists to comment on this important event, Shmarov said: ``It is very pleasant that many states as well as influential international organisations responded to our problems of liquidating nuclear weapons. This is a great political support for us. As for real economic aid, we hope for receiving what they can give.''
