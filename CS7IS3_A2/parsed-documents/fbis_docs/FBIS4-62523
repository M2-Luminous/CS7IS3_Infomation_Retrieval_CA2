In an interview with the Yerevan newspaper AZG, he said he does not think Azerbaijan is ready today for a cease-fire and that the leaders of that republic are unable to abandon the illusion that the Karabakh problem can be settled using force. The Azerbaijani authorities, A. Gukasyan said, hope that military victories will create political conditions, which will act in their favor during subsequent talks. But Azerbaijan's leadership will very soon have to acknowledge the real situation that has taken shape and sit at the talks table with the leaders of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister believes. "I do not rule out that it will be a new Azerbaijani leadership [that sits at the table]," the Karabakh representative said. The issue is whether they in Azerbaijan can find the strength in themselves to renounce force as a means of settling the conflict, A.Gukasyan said, and since Geydar Aliyev cannot do this, there is a likelihood of developments leading to a change in Azerbaijan's leadership, the Karabakh minister said. We have to take into consideration the international community, the opinions of various states and organizations, and the norms of international law, the head of Karabakh's Foreign Ministry continued. Karabakh believes that if the fighting on the battlefields can be brought within the framework of a political struggle, then Stepanakert will have the opportunity to present its arguments, which, the people of Karabakh believe, suffice to justify recognition of the independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. A. Gukasyan also said that full peace in the region will only be possible after the issue of Karabakh's status had been settled once and for all. Without this, there will always be the danger that military activities will be resumed, he said. Peace is not possible without settling the issue of Karabakh's status, the minister said.
