Are not the voters disappointed now? [Zhirinovskiy] I did not demand the posts that you have mentioned. I meant that if we are asked to participate in the government, we would specifically like to occupy the posts of powerful ministers: defense, internal affairs, security, foreign affairs, and finance, the key posts, but according to the Constitution, it is the president who forms the government. He is changing the lineup now, and it is even to our advantage for the people to understand that even if the Democratic Russia people [demorosy] and the reformers are removed, the government figures under the leadership of Chernomyrdin will not hold out for long. Thus, our ascent to power as a single-party government will be unavoidable. All other possibilities have been exhausted; the president addressed various political forces, and the only possibility left is the party that has won the elections -- the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. I think that we will be able to participate in the government by this fall. [Kobayashi] What period of time do you think will be necessary to implement your program? [Zhirinovskiy] We think in terms of months; we do not talk about 20 years or 15 years, we say: Had we formed our government in January, living standards would have increased by 30 percent by summer, by 70 percent by the end of the year, and twofold in a year or in a year and a half -- for every Russian citizen. [Kobayashi] But, excuse me, seeing the inflation rate today and the state of the economy, I am afraid that raising living standards by 30 percent by summer is quite impossible. What do you think? [Zhirinovskiy] We can solve the crisis by utilizing our formula: resume military factories' complete production immediately. Everything that they produce will be exported: planes, automatic rifles, submarines. Thus, we will at once earn $5 billion or $6 billion a year. Plus, we will sharply change our foreign policy; we will withdraw from the embargoes imposed on Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Libya. This will give us $15 billion. Thus, we will have $20 billion in 1994. We will also end aid to the nearby foreign countries, which is about $5 billion more; 25 billion is a huge amount. [Kobayashi] Do you not think that this promotes the arms race, or the race in arms production? [Zhirinovskiy] We choose the lesser evil. I said immediately and openly that some of our neighbors will not like our new policy, but we really will carry out our program, and the lives of Russian citizens will improve. I am telling the truth. If people vote for this program, I have the right to carry it out. If I had not discussed but implemented it, I would be misleading them. But I said this before the elections, and I won on 12 December because of this, and I am saying it now. I now have 64 deputies. To carry out the program, I need 264 deputies. Then I can carry it out. [Kobayashi] After the elections, Western states treated you with caution. What relations with the West do you envision? [Zhirinovskiy] There is a certain amount of apprehension because we are a new party. They have gotten used to communists, and during the past two and a half years they have gotten used to the democrats. But we are a new political force. People do not fully know me, and sometimes my image is distorted, and our program is distorted. Therefore, a kind of fear of the new is invoked. But I openly say everywhere: There is no need to fear us. We are against violence, against war. All we support is peace, cooperation in the areas of the economy and culture, and regional cooperation. We are against superpowers. We support getting along well with our neighbors, including Japan. [Kobayashi] You have said that you support peace, but they say that you mentioned a war with Japan to someone. [Zhirinovskiy] We have concluded a peace treaty with Germany, and we have concluded a peace treaty with everyone in the world with whom we fought -- also with Finland. We have no peace treaty only with Japan. I was simply stating the situation as a lawyer: The lack of a peace treaty means that in a certain, narrow sense, we are in a state of war with this country. There is no third possibility. Can you name a third possibility? No peace treaty was concluded, yet there is no war. So what do we have? What do we have? We have a hermaphrodite -- neither a man nor a woman -- but that is the worst possibility. It is the same here. The relations between Japan and Russia are like a hermaphrodite -- neither war nor peace. Which is it? War or peace? [Kobayashi] Why do you want to become president? What ideas would you like to realize in this country? [Zhirinovskiy] If I assume the post of head of state, we will fulfill our minimal program in several months and then move on to a broader program of reforms in the country. Therefore, one must assume the highest post -- the head of state. Because today, all right, I am the head of the party of the parliamentary majority, a winning party. The next step is participation in the government, and finally, the post of head of state. [Kobayashi] Do you envision early presidential elections? [Zhirinovskiy] Without a doubt. Elections will be held next year, and maybe even this spring. [Kobayashi] This spring? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. [Kobayashi] And through what means? [Zhirinovskiy] Through the resignation of the president. [Kobayashi] And for what reason? He has already expressed his intention to continue until.... [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] May God give him health and let him continue until the end, but the parliamentary elections were also supposed to be held in two years' time. After all, the parliament was elected for five years, but the elections were held two years early. They also wanted to continue until the end, until 1995, but they were made to go, they were forced to go in 1993. The situation in the country is getting worse every day, and it will force the president to form another government while relying on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in which case he may continue until the end of his term. [Kobayashi] And you are ready.... [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] We are ready, and I have informed him of this, him and Chernomyrdin. We are ready to participate in the government, but we do not.... [Kobayashi, interrupting] And the elections? [Zhirinovskiy] We are also ready for elections. [Kobayashi] Some say that you demand money for interviews with journalists. Does this mean that you have lost the support of voters? [Zhirinovskiy] Support from the voters is still coming in. Thousands of money orders arrive every day at Moscow post offices, but because a lot of correspondents want an interview, in order to regulate this queue, I say that I am willing to give interviews to those who pay for them. Very often there are correspondents who say: Let us interview you, and we will pay you. I do this to regulate the queue. If I started giving interviews to everyone -- I do not have the time. So, because you have propelled us toward the market, and because market relations are a commodity-money-commodity thing, and because my commodity is my working time; a person must rest, yet I am working with you. So, you are paying for spending my working time. I do not care if this is an interview, a book, or a conversation. My working time is worth money. I must receive compensation for my expenses for communicating with you, whoever you might be. This does not apply to an interview as such; this is my work, my working time. [Kobayashi] You have mentioned that you will travel abroad in the next few days. Where and what for? [Zhirinovskiy] I am leaving for Slovenia on Thursday [27 January], then for a 2-million-person rally in Belgrade, and then the Poles are waiting for me. I am touring all the Slavic states of East Europe. This is a burden for me, and they pay me money to go there. My journey is paid for in full, and I get 30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 [currency not specified] to go to them and meet them there. I will not go anywhere just like that, but only when it is paid for in full. For example, I am going to go to Turkey, and they are paying for a 15-person staff. This includes a doctor, guards, press secretary -- 15 people. They are paying for everything--15 people. [Kobayashi] Excuse me, you mentioned a doctor. What kind of illness do you have? [Zhirinovskiy] I have no illness. Simply, there is the doctor, the guards, and my coach. We exercise in the morning. The doctor takes my pulse. I would not be taking my own pulse, would I? Let him take my pulse and say: more effort, less effort. Dietetic food. I do not eat just anything. I like dietetic food: shrimp, octopus, boiled tongue, turtle soup, and things like this. The doctor must check it, taste it, and then I can partake of it. But me, I am healthy. What I mean is, my daily schedule is under medical control. [Kobayashi] You drink a lot. [Zhirinovskiy] I drink one and a half liters of water a day. I drink no alcohol and do not smoke. But I am supposed to drink one and a half liters of water a day.
