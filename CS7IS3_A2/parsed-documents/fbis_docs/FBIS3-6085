However, now views in the government and coalition parties are emerging questioning his TMD position, citing the (1969) Diet resolution on peaceful use of space and the doubtful performance of interceptor missiles. It is apparent that the matter will have to undergo further adjustments of views. In the meeting, Director General Aichi said: "As far as I am concerned, I would like to present a concept (on TMD) in the revised program for defense." Even if this concept comes to be adopted, the expression for "TMD" is expected to be changed to something like "missile defense improvement" in the new defense program. It is likely that the United States has taken "the remark (of Aichi) as Japan's pledge for cooperation in the TMD program." Within the ruling coalition parties, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] thinks the TMD concept goes against the Diet resolution on the peaceful use of space. On the other hand, from other parties there are strong voices asking: "Can the system cope with the Nodong-1 missiles of the DPRK (North Korea)?" because of the recent reports that data show the Patriot missiles that came into the limelight in the Gulf war in fact had poor accuracy.
