Shipping percentages for individual supply plants and units of supply plants are reduced to 1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, for the month of September. The action is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling. A proposed reduction for the month of August was found to be not necessary. effective date: Amendment number 1 is effective September 1, 1994. Amendment number 2 is effective September 1, 1994, through September 30, 1994. Amendment number 3 is effective October 1, 1994. for further information contact: Constance M. Brenner, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;2357. supplementary information: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued July 11, 1994; published July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36094). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of ยง1030.7(b)(5) of the Chicago Regional milk order. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 36094) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping percentages under the Chicago Regional milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of August and September 1994. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by July 22, 1994. Two comments supporting the proposed revision for the month of September were received. The comments agreed that the degree of adjustment that the order allows the market administrator to make in supply plant shipping requirements would be sufficient for the month of August. No opposing comments were received.
