Blaya Mashasha, an Ethiopian, entered the cockpit immediately after take-off at dawn in Jeddah and demanded that the pilot fly to London, a ministry statement quoted by the official Yemeni news agency SABA said. The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 757 had been scheduled to fly to the Ethiopian capital. Authorities in Jeddah and Djibouti refused it permission to land, but after two hours the Yemeni authorities said it could land at Sanaa airport "for humanitarian reasons, because the fuel was in danger of running out," the ministry said. "After great efforts and discussions between the Yemeni authorities and the hijacker all the passengers were freed. The pilot and co-pilot remained on the plane, but were finally freed at 1:00 p.m. (1000 GMT)." The authorities started questioning the hijacker, but no details were released about his motives nor the circumstances of his surrender.
