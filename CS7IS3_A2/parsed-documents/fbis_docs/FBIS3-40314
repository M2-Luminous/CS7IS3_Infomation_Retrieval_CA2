"These may be preliminary talks, but they are quite important," said EFTA spokesman Jorg Renk. The two delegations began discussing a draft free trade agreement, prepared by EFTA experts. In its form and content, the draft is very similar to agreements between EFTA and other central European countries. The delegations also agreed that Slovenia should prepare a list of products on which import taxes will be gradually lowered by 2001. Slovenia is to hold bilateral talks with EFTA member countries on agriculture. Vojka Ravbar, the state secretary at the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development, is heading the Slovene delegation in negotiations, while Joseph Mayer, deputy director general of the Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs, is the head of the EFTA delegation. A new round of talks between Slovenia and EFTA is scheduled in the spring. However, no exact date was set, since simultaneous talks are also planned between Slovenia and the European Union. "We observe the principle of strictly parallel meetings with the EU," Renk said.
