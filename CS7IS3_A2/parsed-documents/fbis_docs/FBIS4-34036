The Interior and Defense Ministry issued a communique on this which was revealed today. The decision is based on Articles 60 and 62 dated 26 December 1978, which refer to immigration and emigration and compels the owners of hotels and boarding houses to report the presence of foreigners in that timespan. The communique warns that if this demand is not met, they will proceed to arrest the people responsible and suspend the licenses and operating permits of the hotels and boarding houses that operate in the country. With this measure, the "de facto" government wants to gain control over the foreigners who arrive in Haiti in case of a possible foreign intervention in this Caribbean country. The Interior and Defense Ministry also calls on the people to be vigilant and report the presence of unknown people in their areas and to be prepared to maintain their civic duty of defending the fatherland. Furthermore, it calls on people to avoid moving far from their areas of residence to avoid the risks of being killed in the face of a possible foreign invasion. On Monday, a short while after the state of emergency was declared throughout the entire country, the "de facto" government reported that it guaranteed the security of foreign citizens in Haiti. In this sense, the Information Ministry has requested foreigners to go about their regular business and expressed its surprise at U.S. State Department statements regarding the security of U.S. citizens in Haiti and said the U.S. Government's statements were "precipitous."
