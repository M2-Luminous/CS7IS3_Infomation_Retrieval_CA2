According to the latest statistics, the province's gross domestic product last year amounted to 94 billion yuan, and the rate of growth was the third highest in the country. Its gross industrial output value last year was the seventh greatest in the country, and its agricultural output value fifth. Anhui, whose rate of growth of foreign trade ranks sixth in the country, has caught national attention, a provincial official in charge of economic development said. The official attributed the good result to the hard efforts of its citizens who have taken an active part in the reforms, in a down-to-earth manner. Last year saw Anhui's state-owned enterprises spend 17.17 billion yuan on fixed assets, an increase of 42.6 percent over the previous year, and 6.26 billion on technical transformation, also up 42.6 percent. Infrastructure facilities which were completed last year included a railway running from Hefei, capital of the province, to Anqing, an ancient city on the bank of the Chang Jiang River; a furnace with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meters in the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Complex; and advanced program control telephone exchanges in every county town in the province. Construction of a number of key national capital projects is in full swing. Included are a Chang Jiang River highway bridge in Tongling City and the Tongling Cement Plant. Anhui, which took the lead in China's rural economic reform, has paid attention to developing quality and efficient agriculture, and encouraged the surplus rural labor force to set up more rural industrial enterprises or go to cities to contract for construction and other work. Anhui's agricultural output value last year totalled 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent over the previous year, exceeding the average annual increase rate of 2.8 percent in the 1986-90 period. Its gross output value generated by rural industrial enterprises last year also set a record. By carrying out the enterprise reform, a number of key state enterprises have rejuvenated themselves. At present, 15 prefectural centers and cities have opened securities markets, paving the way for enterprises to collect funds for modernization. In addition, Anhui is building an economic belt from Wuhu City on the banks of the Chang Jiang River to Hefei and Huangshan, one of China's tourist attractions, while improving transport facilities to link the province to other parts of the country as well as the outside world. The improved investment conditions have helped the province to boost its foreign trade and attract more foreign investment. Anhui's import and export volume topped 1.2 billion U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year. Included were exports totalling 960 million U.S. dollars, up 16 percent. The official said: "With abundant natural resources and convenient transport facilities, Anhui has become a favored place for overseas investment." Business people from Taiwan and Japan and elsewhere are streaming into the province, which has concluded dozens of contracts on the technical transformation of old enterprises and improvement of urban infrastructure facilities. A survey shows that the provincial government approved the establishment of 1,040 overseas-funded enterprises last year.
