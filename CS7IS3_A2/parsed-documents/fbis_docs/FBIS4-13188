FBIS4-13188 "drnes075_d_94003" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Libya `Defecting' Officers Note Recent Rebellion, Coup Attempt `Defecting' Officers Note Recent Rebellion, Coup Attempt JN1804202594 JN1804202594 BFN [Editorial Report] London AL-HAYAH in Arabic, on page four of its 13 April issue, publishes an approximately 2,500-word report by reporter 'Ali al-Ruzz in Stockholm. The report cites interviews with three defecting Libyan officers, who are in a Scandinavian country after fleeing Libya when their military plot against the al-Qadhdhafi regime was discovered. The report begins by saying that three Libyan officers managed to flee Libya after participating in the "October uprising" events. It adds: They are, perhaps, the only members of the secret military organization who escaped the arrests and managed to reach safety after having traveled for five months in Arab and foreign countries, and they are now members of "the National Front for the Salvation of Libya." The three defecting Libyan officers, whom AL-HAYAH met in a Scandinavian country, are: 1. Lieutenant Colonel pilot Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, born in Bani Walid, who joined the Libyan Army in 1978 and received training in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that in 1988 he considered playing a role that would effect a change in Libya, and that he joined a secret military organization led by Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 1991 after the latter talked to him about this organization. 2. Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, born in Bani Walid. 3. Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, from Bani Walid. Lt. Col. Salih points out that "the Libyan situation compelled me to think in this way because we do not have a state, institutions, laws, or a constitution." Discussing the role of the al-Warfallah tribe in the military rebellion, Maj. al-Wa'ir says: "The fact that most participants in this military action belong to the al-Warfallah tribe does not mean that other tribes did not take part." He adds: "As officers, we all agreed to hand the authority over to a civilian if our movement succeeded. He is Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Maqrif and he does not belong to the al-Warfallah tribe." Regarding how this secret military organization was established, Maj. al-Wa'ir says that he was the first one who had the idea of establishing this organization. He adds: "Since my graduation in 1980, the Libyan Army has been sent on missions whose objectives were not known to us. We fought in Chad and Uganda, and in 1987 I stayed in Lebanon with the force of volunteers to champion the so-called the nationalist and Islamic forces and assist Palestinian organizations. In December 1988, I returned to Libya and briefed a group of officers on the idea of the organization. There were just five of us. Afterward, I went back to Lebanon in 1990, and I met with Colonel Mustafa Balqasim in an Arab state and briefed him on the organization. We agreed that he would act in one direction and I would act in another direction in absolute secrecy. I once again returned to Libya at the end of 1991, and finalized the establishment of the organization whose membership reached 10. I believe that the number of members in Mustafa's organization was similar to ours." Discussing their story with the Salvation Front, Maj. al-Wa'ir indicates that in 1992 he briefed Col. Balqasim on the need to open a channel of communications with this front abroad because "it is the only effective faction, and because we received news about it through smuggled newspapers or radios, and also because the Front's members are known in Libya for their honesty and efficiency. Balqsim concurred." Maj. al-Wa'ir adds that in 1993, a third organization led by Colonel Miftah Qarrum, who suffers from leukemia, joined the two organizations, and that "following several contacts and meetings, a plan of action was agreed, and was to be implemented no later than the spring of 1994. I agreed with Balqasim and Qarrum on the broad outlines of the program designed to topple the regime and on the transitional period. There was one objective; namely, to topple the regime and establish a democratic constitutional state." Concerning the details of the coup attempt, Cap. al-Wa'ir discloses that, according to the plan of action, military units would move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah, Tarhunah, Sabratah, and Gharyan. He also revealed that the targets of the coupists were the army command headquarters in Bab al-'Aziziyah, the intelligence directorate, the al-Jamahiriyah security commission, and centers belonging to a group of the Republican Guard battalions. However, he adds, the Libyan regime discovered the plan, so the coupists sought to implement the plan on 15 October but the arrests and confrontations with the regime began on 12 October, so the coup attempt failed. The report cites Lt. Col. Salih as saying that on 12 October the Libyan military intelligence arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum, Col. Mustafa Balqasim, Major 'Ali al-Kakli, Major Khalil al-Jadak, Major Ramadan al-'Ayhuri, and other officers. Concluding, the report cites Major al-Wa'ir as refuting the claims that the organization's officers recently shown on Libyan television were spying for the United States and stressed that these officers are honorable ones who were only agents working for Libya.
