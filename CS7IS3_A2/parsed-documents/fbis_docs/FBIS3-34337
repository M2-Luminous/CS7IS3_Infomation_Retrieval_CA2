Your esteemed newspaper on 31 January published an article on page 18 by Dr. Muhammad al-Mahasinah under the headline "Was Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah a Victim of Polarization or Peace?" In view of the errors contained in the article and given the freedom of the press and opinion, we would like to have the following explanation published with our thanks and appreciation. Dealing with the difficult and critical situation in the Islamic world requires all of us to pool our efforts and remain vigilant to foil the plots by the enemies of the Islamic nation. This requires wariness and alertness in order to avoid being dragged behind the venomous and propagandistic media of world arrogance and Zionism that is aimed against the entire Islamic world. In this regard, writers should rise to their responsibility and be truthful and sincere, and to play their role in enlightening people and exposing these desperate attempts. However, and with deep regret, certain people are contributing to strengthening the trend that serves our common enemy. Yet, we are certain that, although they make mistakes in analysis and interpretations, these pens do not have aims or ambitions other than to present their own views and to reveal facts. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Amman respects and appreciates such honest writers but will not remain silent toward those who do not appreciate the situation and who are unaware that they are serving sides that want to harm inter-Islamic relations, especially between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Therefore, we find it necessary to reply to what Dr. al-Mahasinah wrote in his article. 1. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounces and condemns the terrorist and cowardly act which led to the death of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. The embassy can only extend its sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and the sisterly Jordanian family as whole and to beseech God almighty to have mercy on his soul and to grant his family solace and patience. 2. It is a source of consternation that this article, which lacks objectivity and logic, should be written by a Jordanian figure of the status of Dr. al-Mahasinah, who is the professor of Law at the university. In his article, al-Mahasinah tried in vain to link this cowardly act with the Islamic Republic of Iran's stand on the so-called peace or with the issue of the reduction of the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan. How did he link these two issues, which have nothing to do with this criminal act, unless it was something out of his own creation and imagination? It is regrettable that in this regard, the voice of a Jordanian brother joined the voices of Westerners and Israelis who continue their feverish efforts to shake and confuse relations between Islamic countries in general, and countries in the region in particular. Moreover, Dr. al-Mahasinah should not have announced his stand off the cuff. He should have waited until things became clear and facts became solid before leveling accusations at others. In order to put him in the picture along with others who do not know, we say that the Islamic Republic of Iran's stand toward the Zionist enemy is a principled and constant stand that will not change one iota under any circumstance. This stand was not developed yesterday or by chance. Indeed, it is older than the victorious Islamic revolution in Iran. History recorded the Islamic and principled stands adopted by Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his secret, throughout his life against the occupying enemy whether in the Shah's dungeons, in exile, or in power. Therefore, our stand toward what is now called the peace process emanates from this principled and deep-rooted stand. As regards the issue of reducing the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan, we would like to emphasize that the warm relations between the two fraternal countries, which are permeated by the spirit of brotherhood and love, are proceeding forward under the wise leaderships of the two countries. For our part, we are concerned about maintaining these relations and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. From this particular premise, we say that the reduction of the number of diplomats is purely an organizational issue as stated by responsible quarters in Jordan. Here, we also reaffirm our concern about maintaining the higher interest of the two countries and about proceeding forward with these active relations no matter what the sacrifices are. We have no doubt at all that the Jordanian leadership shares the same feeling and that the recent statements by the wise leadership in Jordan are evidence of this. Hence, while we reiterate our deep regret about what was written outside the realm of logic, we ask the honorable and esteemed SAWT AL-SHA'B newspaper to be accurate and cautious more than ever before. [Signed] The Embassy of The Islamic Republic of Iran in Amman
