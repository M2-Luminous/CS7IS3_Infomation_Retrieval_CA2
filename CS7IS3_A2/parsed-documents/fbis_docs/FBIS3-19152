[passage omitted] After extensive Air Force procurement, it is now time to develop the land and naval forces, according to the new commander. [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, while you are commander of the Defense Forces, Finland will have to take far-reaching decisions; how does possible EU [European Union] membership change Finland's security policy status, in your view? [Haegglund] It will open new possibilities for us that do not exist without the membership. That is one important factor, the other one is that of course Finland, as a member of such a big Union alliance, will be in a different kind of position than being alone, and we would then have to make all sorts of policies run in parallel with these partners. [Korkkula] So what is Finland's position if it stays outside the EU? [Haegglund] Well, then nothing will actually change in a defense policy sense, because then there are no other alternatives but military nonalignment and national defense, in other words what we have now, and it would be quite logical to continue on the same course after that. [Korkkula] There has also been talk about Finland's possible membership of NATO. Lt. Gen. Haegglund, will this matter be topical while you are the commander of the Defense Forces? [Haegglund] I do not have a crystal ball, so I cannot predict that. [Korkkula] There has also been talk about the threat from the East in Finland, what do you think about this sort of talk? [Haegglund] I think it is more or less nonsense. As far as I understand there are quite a few internal problems and factors in the East currently, and the trend there is withdrawal from the West and not pushing into the West. This thinking is maybe slightly outmoded. [Korkkula] In the recent report on the EU commissioned by the government, it is said that Russia might sooner or later bring Finland into its sphere of influence if Finland does not join the EU, do you agree in this matter? [Haegglund] What else could I do but agree with the government while I am serving the government. [passage omitted] [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, the Air Force is in the next few years going to take up a large part of procurement appropriation in Finland; what other branches of defense should especially be developed in Finland now? [Haegglund] Well, the land and naval forces, we have no branches of defense other than these three; these must be developed in equal measure so that nothing is allowed to become completely run down. At the moment, the emphasis is moving from the land forces, which were developed recently, to the Air Force, and that is quite correct because the Air Force would in a few years be the weakest link in Finland's defense: The fighter aircraft we have are getting old, and that would leave a gap that would have to be filled, so it is now the Air Force's turn.
