Are they boastful because they fought for the liberation of Palestine, the Golan, or southern Lebanon? Or, are they boastful because they joined forces with the Zionists, the Americans, and other enemies of Arabism for the sake of a single Arab nation? One of the theorists of Hafiz al-Asad's policy, a freak called Zuhayr Diyab, spoke boastfully to the Zionist paper HA'ARETZ, thus openly declaring the traitorous normalization between the al-Asad regime and the Zionist enemy. What did he say? Let us read parts of what this member of Hafiz al-Asad's party has said. He said: The Syrian decision to join the peace process was not made when President al-Asad accepted the Bush initiative, but some 20 years earlier, after the 1973 war when Syria's inclination toward recognizing the Jewish state and abandoning the policy of eliminating Israel began to crystallize. Why, then, did they get angry when Iraq called the 1973 war, the war of reactivation [tahrik]? This typical slanderer, who represents Hafiz al-Asad's authority, said: The majority of Syrians -- intellectuals, militarymen, businessmen, and politicians -- accept the reality of Israeli existence. This proves the matter depended not only on a decision by al-Asad, but was also a development that began some 20 years ago. Thus, the chain of Arab recognitions is crowned by a boastful remark that Hafiz al-Asad was the first to recognize the aggression and injustice embodied by the Zionist enemy. This is not the main point. The main point is that every Arab ruler or government official who today rushes to Tel Aviv to kiss the ground under the Zionists' feet claims he is doing so because it is a public desire and that he is only carrying out the people's wish. This was done by Anwar al-Sadat when he embarked on his treason in Camp David. But time proved our people in Egypt opposed that blatant treason. The Gaza-Jericho agreement, signed on behalf of the Palestinian people in the occupied homeland, is also being staggered by the overwhelming pressure of public opposition and the continuation of the brave intifada. As for the claim by this trivial opportunist that our Syrian people accept the Zionist entity, it will, sooner of later, be faced by the masses of our people in Syria. But the main question is: If the traitors and weaklings now lining up outside Tel Aviv are honest when they say they represent the wishes of the masses in their countries, why then do they not hold free and honest referendums so people can express their opinion on a question that affects their security, present, and future, as well as the future of the Arab nation? Or does the ruler who carries out the orders of his overlords believe he can think on behalf of the people, and that he is in a position to determine their destiny, even if he has to place all the people in his big prison? What appears in the HA'ARETZ interview about normalization with the active member of al-Asad's apparatus and party sheds light on all the stands and policies al-Asad has adopted since 1973, including the entry of his forces into Lebanon in 1976, his support for the Iranian war against Iraq, his attempts to split up the Palestinian organizations and Lebanese forces, his open alliance with the Zionists and the other agents in Hafr al-Batin, his feverish rush to Madrid, and then Washington, in order to liquidate the Palestine question, and his conspiracies against the historic leadership of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party party since 1966 and up to this moment.
