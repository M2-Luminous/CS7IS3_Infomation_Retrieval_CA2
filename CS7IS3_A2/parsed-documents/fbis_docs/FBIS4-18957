Aho, who returned home this afternoon, said before leaving Beijing that Finland and China had a good chance to increase their cooperation, particularly in the forestry industry, in the energy sector, and in environmental protection. Aho said that during the visit Finland did not want to make an issue of China's human rights policy. [Begin Aho recording] These individual cases, which have received quite extensive publicity, were not raised in the talks we conducted, and it has not been part of our tradition to discuss them in political talks either. We concentrated on a more general level on discussing human rights and political rights and voiced our views on that. In other words, this issue was not discussed. Our basic attitude to human rights issues is similar to that of France and other West European countries. Our attitude to human rights issues is, in principle, similar, but it must be admitted that there have been and are differences in the approach between Finland and many West European countries. [end recording] The high-level visits between Finland and China will resume as early as this spring. Chairman of the Chinese People's Congress Li Ruihuan [title as heard] will pay a visit to Finland in May.
