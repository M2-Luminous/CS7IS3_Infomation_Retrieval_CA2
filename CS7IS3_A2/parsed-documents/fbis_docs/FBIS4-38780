This is the opinion of the head of staff of the Crimean president and government Viktor Minin. In a Wednesday interview with INTERFAX Minin said that the situation in the peninsula is being used for a top-level power struggle in Kiev. Minin, who met the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament Aleksandr Moroz several days ago, hopes that the parliament will not support the proposals of several politicians in Kiev to introduce direct presidential rule. According to him, Moroz is the only person in Ukraine representing the new legitimate power and does not want to be held responsible for the sins of the old leadership. Several days ago Moroz spoke against presidential rule in Crimea. Minin predicted that direct presidential rule would lead to confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. "Russia would either have to wash its hands, or react", he remarked. "If Yeltsin does nothing, Zhirinovskiy and the Russian military are going to demand either tough measures or a change of government." In Minin's opinion the only reasonable way out of the crisis is the signing of a treaty between Ukraine and Crimea as a republic within Ukraine and the expansion of trade and economic relations between Crimea and Russia.
