FR940429-0-00190 FR940429-0-00015 Discussion : The Secretary believes that the other standards requiring the use of provisional certification are adequate to identify institutions where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions are appropriate. The Secretary agrees that longstanding institutions with no previous problems identified in their administrative capability or financial condition will not require the use of provisional certification where the current audits and application submitted by the institution satisfies the financial and administrative requirements under the regulations. Furthermore, since provisional certification is required for initial applicants and for existing institutions whose financial condition or administrative capability cannot be shown to meet the required standards, there does not appear to be a corresponding need to require provisional certification if a participating institution satisfies the proposed standards when the Department reviews its application for the first time. Changes : The provision that provided that the Secretary may provisionally certify an institutions if the financial responsibility and administrative capability of the institution was being determined for the first time has been deleted from these regulations. Comments : A number of commenters objected to the proposal that provisional certification be used for all occasions where the institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control. Instead, the commenters suggested that there were numerous instances where a transfer of an institution to a new owner should be viewed as a positive step that should be encouraged by using full certification, especially where the transfer was to an owner that had already established a good track record with the Department. Some comments also recommended that transfers to family members or to employees that had experience operating the institution should not require provisional certification. Discussion : The Secretary agrees that some transfers to family members or to personnel that own stock in an institution who have also worked for the institution should be treated differently from other changes of ownership that result in a change of control. These transfers to family members or to certain other owners have been exempted from treatment as a change of ownership resulting in a change of control in the regulations codified at 34 CFR part 600. In all other situations where there is a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to use provisional certification in order to provide more protection to the Federal interests while the new owner demonstrates the ability to operate that institution successfully. Such concern is especially warranted where a financially troubled institution has been acquired for little or no capital investment by the new owner, because the risk of loss is minimized if the institution fails as a business investment. Even though it may be a positive step for an institution to be bought by a new owner who can provide greater resources and experience in its operations, it is also reasonable to provide for the greater oversight and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that are available under provisional certification. Also, the period of provisional certification may be established for a shorter period where the particular facts so warrant. Changes : None. Comments : A number of commenters were concerned that an institution that had applied for recertification in a timely manner would be placed on provisional certification if the Department had not processed the application before the institution's participation agreement expired. These commenters objected to changing an institution from full certification to provisional certification where the delays were attributable to the Department's review process rather than to a tardy application for renewal from the institution. Some remarks were also submitted by these commenters suggesting that formal notice be required from the Secretary of the expiration date for an institution's period of participation before any such ending date could become effective. Discussion : The Secretary agrees that delays in processing applications by the Department should not be the cause for transferring an institution from full certification to provisional certification. In such a circumstance where a complete application for renewal was timely submitted, it is appropriate to provide for a mechanism that will continue the institution's full certification on an interim basis. The Secretary has decided to establish a target date for institutions to submit certification renewal applications at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's current program participation agreement. Provided that the application is materially complete when submitted, the institution's full certification will continue beyond its expiration date on a month-to-month basis until the Department issues its decision on the application. If the institution's application is not approved for full certification, the program participation agreement will expire on the last business day of the month in which the decision is sent to the institution. If the application for full certification is not made at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's program participation agreement, the institution will only be permitted to participate under provisional certification while an application for recertification is pending. When an institution is notified that its application for recertification was not materially complete when submitted, the Department will exercise reasonable discretion in determining whether to deny the application as submitted or to request additional information, and to determine whether the institution may continue to participate under provisional certification while the application is reviewed. The Secretary continues to believe that it is appropriate for the institution to monitor the expiration date for its participation rather than relying upon the Secretary to tell it when it must reapply. Although the Secretary may provide routine notices to institutions concerning upcoming expiration dates, the institution will be held responsible for submitting an application for recertification in a timely manner in accordance with the expiration date on its program participation agreement, regardless of whether the institution receives a notice of expiration from the Secretary. Changes : Section 668.13(b) is amended to provide that full certification will be extended on a month to month basis following the expiration of a program participation agreement where the institution's application for recertification was materially complete, and submitted at least 90 days prior to the expiration date. Requirements for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible . Comments : A number of commenters stated that an institution should not be placed under provisional certification if the institution satisfied the criteria for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible. These commenters believed sufficient protection of Title IV, HEA program funds was obtained from the required posting of a reduced surety in conjunction with using a funding arrangement other than the advance payment system without the additional requirement of only granting provisional certification to the institution. Several of the commenters also argued that any institution meeting these criteria should be considered to be financially responsible, and therefore not placed under the provisional certification that would trigger heightened monitoring by the Department and by the other members of the triad. The commenters also observed that institutions that were in financial difficulties would probably experience further hardship by being required to post a surety and receive Title IV, HEA program funding through an alternate mechanism. A few commenters noted that this provision appeared to require provisional certification if an institution did not demonstrate financial responsibility under the general standards of financial responsibility set out in ยง668.15(b), and that such a construction of the regulation would mean that institutions demonstrating financial responsibility under the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility set out in ยง668.15(d) could still be required to use provisional certification.
