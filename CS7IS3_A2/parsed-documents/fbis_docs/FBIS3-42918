Shcherbakov: "What Caused the Changes in the Oblast Administration?: Some Details"] [Text] The changes in the oblast administration have not passed unnoticed by the readers of this newspaper. They are interested in what caused these changes and why the names of A.D. Belishko and L.I. Ratnikova are not on the list of the administration's deputy heads. We asked B.N. Mityurev, press secretary of the oblast administrative head, for an explanation of these matters. [Mityurev] The preamble of the decree involved here unambiguously emphasizes the motives for reforming the structure of the executive branch. These comprise the new sociopolitical circumstances which have now evolved in our oblast, as well as an analysis of the two years of work done by the administration under the conditions of emerging market-type relations. The need to make further progress along the path of economic changes also impelled Vadim Solovyev to adopt this decree. We can hardly recognize it as a normal situation when the apparatus of an oblast administration contains 11 deputies, including three first deputies. At present seven deputies remain, and their powers of office have been greatly expanded. The following three names are no longer on the list of deputies: A.D. Belishko, L.I. Ratnikova, and V.V. Gorodnichiy, the administrator of affairs. Their positions have been abolished. But that does not mean that these persons have been dismissed from work. A.D. Belishko was offered the post of heading up our delegation in the association of republics and oblasts in the Ural Region with the retention of his salary and transportation expenses. L.I. Ratnikova was offered the post of heading up the committee on science. This is the kind of work that she knows very well. A no less important post within the new structures was likewise offered to V.V. Gorodnichiy. To be sure, Andrey Dmitriyevich Belishko refused to accept the new appointment indicated above. [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, was not his failure to be appointed a deputy head caused by some kinds of personal relations with the administrative head, or some kinds of business-type qualities? [Mityurev] Unfortunately, it must be stated that this was noticeable recently; some kind of tension and alienation could be observed in the relations between V.P. Solovyev and A.D. Belishko. Frankly speaking, I do not know what lay behind this. But it came to the surface in various obvious ways and details of behavior. [Shcherbakov] Was not the administrative head's decision with regard to L.I. Ratnikova influenced by the criminal events within the Committee on Medicine under the Chelyabinsk City Administration? The office of the city procurator uncovered instances of large-scale misappropriations and even thefts in this structural sibdivision. And, of course, Lyudmila Ivanovna Ratnikova was--as we know--in charge of this oblast's medical establishment. What is your opinion on this matter? [Mityuyev] I think that this could have influenced V.P. Solovyev's decision. But--in principle--he did not state any lack of confidence in her, and he offered an important post to her. In the final analysis, my opinion is as follows: An administrative head has the right to improve the administrative structure, as well as the right to decide with whom he is to work. [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, as far as I understand it, the new structure does not contain the position of first deputy head at all. But what if the head goes on leave or on a business trip--to whom would the reins of government be handed over? [Mityurev] To be sure, the position of first deputy is not provided for in the new structure. When and if Vadim Solovyev goes on leave, he can leave any of his deputies "in charge." That is the way it has been in practice. And I fail to see any problem in that regard. I want to emphasize the following point again as specifically as possible: There was nothing overly hasty in Vadim Solovyev's decision to abolish the post of first deputy. This decision was adopted based on an analysis of the entire system of mutual relations which had evolved over the last two and a half plus years. [Shcherbakov] How will this reorganization affect committees, sections, and administrations? [Mityurev] Reorganization of the apparatus has been going on for a long time. The staff was recently cut by one-third. This is a normal process, brought about by life itself. And we need not see in this some sorts of problems. The reorganization and efficiency improvement of the administrative apparatus will continue.
