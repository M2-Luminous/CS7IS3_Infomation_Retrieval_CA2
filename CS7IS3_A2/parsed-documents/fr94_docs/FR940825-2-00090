ACTION: Notice of change in authority citation for supplementary rule. SUMMARY: The supplementary rule establishing a camping stay limit for campgrounds and undeveloped public lands in the Eugene District was originally published in the Federal Register on May 5, 1983 (Vol. 48 No. 88). The authority for this supplementary rule was contained in 43 CFR 8363.1&hyph;3(b) and 8363.3. These regulations were subsequently amended and the authority for the subject supplementary rule was recodified (see 48 FR 36384, August 10, 1983) and is currently cited as 43 CFR 8365.1&hyph;2(a) and 8365.1&hyph;6. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wes Seckler, Law Enforcement Ranger, Bureau of Land Management, Eugene District Office, P.O. Box 10226, Eugene, Oregon 97440&hyph;2226. Telephone (503) 683&hyph;6600. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: There is no change in either the Eugene District's camping stay limit rule or the authority under which it was promulgated. The only purpose of this notice is to eliminate confusion resulting from the 1983 re-numbering of the applicable part of Title 43 CFR cited as authority for the camping stay limit rule.
