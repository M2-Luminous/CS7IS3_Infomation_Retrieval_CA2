Its contours, the minister did not neglect to note, are formed "on the basis of carefully weighed balance of state and regional interests." In proposing to the dispassionate presidents a "state view" on the future of Russian-Georgian relations (as is known, at the Federation Council session on the same day they opposed the signing of a full-scale treaty with Georgia, including the definition of the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia), the minister observed that Russia, as well as the integrated and economically prosperous Georgia, need certainty on matters of protecting their external borders and also on prospects for the disposition of Russian troops on the republic's territory. Assuring those present that the treaty between Russia and Georgia will become a stabilizing factor in the life of the region, Andrey Kozyrev pointed to its direct link with a political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia where Russia still does not abandon "the difficult but noble" mission of peacemaker. Kozyrev stressed that it is wrong to see in Russia's peacemaking efforts in the Caucasus "the Zhirinovskiy factor," something being speculated on both within the country and abroad. Russia's position on Abkhazia's political future, the foreign policy department head said, is unchanging: While supporting the thesis of Georgia's territorial integrity, the Russian leadership is ready to assist the elaboration of such a status for Abkhazia that would take into account the interests of its multi-ethnic population. In this light the legitimacy of the referendum in Abkhazia on the future political structure is, according to the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, directly related to the settlement of the refugee problem. Rejecting suggestions about the Russian leadership's sympathies toward Tbilisi, the minister made it clear that the sanctions used by Russia against the Abkhaz population had nonetheless been correctly understood and appreciated by the Sukhumi leaders. The latter are invited (for their own well-being) to "realistically sum up the situation, display flexibility, and work toward a compromise." In the course of the president's visit Moscow also hopes for success in a South Ossetian settlement, where, it believes, the thesis about Georgia's territorial integrity must remain unchallenged. In addition to recommendations about inviting the South Ossetian leadership to participate in working out Georgia's new constitution, Tbilisi, as Kozyrev promises, will also be encouraged to deal with the issue of the Ossetian refugees, whose return to Georgia would be conducive to resolving the essentially Russian Ossetian-Ingush conflict. During the visit to Georgia, the minister assured, the question about the position of Russians in the republic -- pensioners, war veterans, and former Soviet Army servicemen -- is also bound to come up. And although the official position by the Georgian leadership with respect to the Russian- speaking minority does not arouse Moscow's concern, Moscow cannot but note that in the last two years 150,000 citizens have moved to Russia. Concluding the meeting, Kozyrev stressed that the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Department on Liaison with the Federation Components, Parliament, and Public and Political Organizations seeks to expand cooperation between the Russian regions and the neighboring countries, while the leaders of the North Caucasus republics, who are expected to display understanding of the statewide importance of the upcoming visit to Georgia, are free to join this process. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has learned, the reaction by the North Caucasus republics' leaders to Kozyrev's report has not been enthusiastic, to put it mildly. By general admission, one of the "guests" at the house on Smolenskaya Square confided, a treaty with Georgia is untimely. The unfavorable situation in Tbilisi, leaders of the Russian Federation components think, in contrast to the Russian foreign minister, is not yet cause for Russia's tutelage of Georgia. The opinion of the Federation Council, as articulated by Aslan Dzharimov and Akhsarbek Galazov, presidents of the Republic of Adygeya and North Ossetia; and Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma's Committee on CIS Affairs, will apparently create certain difficulties in ratifying the draft treaty prepared for the visit.
