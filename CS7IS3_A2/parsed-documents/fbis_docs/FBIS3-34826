According to the information minister, more than 20 members of this network's nucleus who were either aware of the assassination plan or who cooperated with the terrorist have been arrested. The information minister added: During the preliminary questionings, all the people who were arrested confessed their ominous and counterrevolutionary objectives. These confessions have shown that most members of the group were involved in many immoral and corrupt acts. The general decision of the terrorists was to start shouting antistate and apparently revolutionary slogans in order to attract the attention of public opinion and to justify their counterrevolutionary movement by distracting the people. They intended to propagate their blind ideas in order to impress the Muslim nation with their terrorist act and to spread public mistrust toward high-ranking pious, revolutionary, and hardworking elements. The information minister also stated that in order to ensure that the assassination plot would be as successful as possible, the suspects had held a coordination meeting the night before the attempt and had discussed the details of the plan. The information minister said: There are persons among those who were arrested who were affiliated with atheist leftist groups and have a criminal record. The criminal records and confessions by the suspects have shown to also have a record of drunkenness, moral corruption, and addiction.
