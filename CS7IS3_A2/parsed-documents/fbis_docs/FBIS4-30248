FBIS4-30248 "dreas122_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 South Korea Further Reportage on Strike Activities, Results Further Reportage on Strike Activities, Results Government, Workers Positions Viewed SK2406050994 SK2406050994 BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 24 June carry editorials, reports, and articles on nationwide strikes by locomotive engineers and subway workers. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a 1,100-word editorial entitled "Should the Innocent Citizens Suffer Pains?" Noting that the railroad is the "main artery of the nation and the subway is the feet of the people," the editorial stresses that their operation should not be suspended under any pretext, and that the "serious traffic disorder" caused by recent strikes by railroad and subway workers is indeed unfortunate. Pointing to the "deplorable position of the people who can do nothing except watch the strike," the editorial writes that "the one who suffers pains and damages for the strike is none other than the nation and the people," not railroad and subway authorities or their trade unions, asking if the leadership of the railroad engineers and subway workers unions has ever thought about the "catastrophic consequences" to be brought about by their strike. The daily stresses that the locomotive engineers trade union's demand for improvement of working conditions and the subway workers union demand for a 15.4 percent wage increase does not justify such a drastic act which "restricts the national economy and binds the citizens' feet." The editorial points out that the railroad and subway are different from private enterprises, and moreover, railroad engineers are public service personnel, and the law prohibits their strike and "sabotage." The paper denounces their hasty strike as an act of driving the nation and the people into "a bog of confusion." The editorial emphasizes that the people do not think that "the demand of unionized subway workers is urgent nor has justification and that their strike cannot evade condemnation by the citizens as an act of betrayal." The paper writes that the railroad and subway are "possessions of the nation and the people," not of the government or the trade unions. The editorial concludes by stressing that "it is a most urgent task, which should be resolved before anything else, to normalize the operation of the railroad and subway." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 3,000-word editorial, under the headline, "Who Has Stopped the Train?--The Government's Hardline Measures Cause Catastrophe." The editorial points out that the "serious traffic disorder" caused by the suspension of train and subway operation is "the result of the government's wholesale roundup of striking locomotive engineers" in a bid to prevent the strike of railroad and subway workers slated for 27 June, defining this step as "the worst choice" among measures for resolving the labor-management dispute. Thus, the editorial writes, the very "ringleader" who caused a catastrophe is none other than the government, and the government's step even violates the law, because the workers taken to the police did not refuse routine daily work nor did they disturb normal operations. Branding the government's arrest of the leaders of the workers in strike as an "excessive step," the editorial observes that the strike was prompted by "outdated labor management and the policy of unreasonable repression of wages" by the railroad authorities and that the workers' demand reflects the urgency in their working condition and everyday life. The paper then notes that the demands of workers in the past were "ignored and refused" by the authorities, who are the users of workers. The editorial stresses that the government should have shown "a sincere attitude" to make its best efforts for a satisfactory solution of the dispute instead of shifting the responsibility to the workers. The paper then calls on the government to release all arrested workers and to provide the union leaders with the opportunity to participate in negotiations with the government for a solution to the dispute. While urging the workers' side to show a sincere attitude for a solution of the situation if the government puts forward concrete measures, the editorial calls on the press to make a fair and impartial report. The paper urges the people "not to condemn only the workers' side but patiently endure personal inconveniences and wait for the satisfactory settlement of the situation." The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 30 a 1,000-word article by reporters Son Yong-kyu and Pak Chon-ho on citizen reaction to the railroad and subway workers strike: Chang Chun-su (age 36, businessmen living in Puyong Apartment Complex in Pyongchon, Kyonggi Province): Trade union workers should not victimize the citizens' everyday life to accomplish their demands. The attempt of some workers to sacrifice all the people for the interest of some trade union workers should not be pardoned. Yu Hui-su (40, business company employee): The attitude of the locomotive engineers trade union to accomplish their will by binding the citizens' feet is erroneous. The government is also responsible for failing to prevent the paralysis of the national economy. Both sides should show the will for a satisfactory solution to their dispute at an early date. So Kyong-sok (member of the National Federation for Economic Justice): Drastic actions causing acute confrontation are always a problem. The illegal strike by railroad workers can hardly win the support of the people. A matured attitude for a solution through dialogue and negotiations is urged. Kim Song-su (40, public service official): Both sides should show an attitude of making concessions. The government should also show a more sincere attitude for negotiation with workers. The citizens' unrest is increasing for the strike, in addition to the North Korean nuclear issue.
