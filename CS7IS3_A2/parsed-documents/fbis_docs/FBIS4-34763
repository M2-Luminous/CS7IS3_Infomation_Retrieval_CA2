He said 80 percent of trade with the island consists of basic products, and he believes emphasis should be placed on investments in areas that generate capital for the country, such as exports. He also believes emphasis should be placed on production in areas that can substitute for imported products. The general manager of the ING Bank in the Netherlands listed some of Cuba's assets as: an educational system that guarantees a highly skilled work force; huge nickel reserves that can be exploited efficiently and at low cost; and an excellent reputation in tourist development. Denker is attending the second round table conference with the Cuban Government organized by THE ECONOMIST financial magazine. The conference, which is being held in Havana, is scheduled to last two days.
