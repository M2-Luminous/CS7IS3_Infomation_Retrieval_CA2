Taking part in the Hallmark of the Times program on Radio Kragujevac, Martic said that claims that Serbia has given up on Krajina are pure speculation. He stressed that the talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb are useful for many reasons: They are to be held on neutral territory, equality in talks has been ensured and, most important, the door has been opened for the RSK to join international negotiations on the former Yugoslavia. Asked about his views on the role of the Russian side, which is sponsoring the talks, Martic said Russian diplomacy has an important role in stabilizing the situation in the Balkans and in establishing peace. He said the Washington agreement between the Muslims and Croats was the result of the U.S. initiative which should secure long-term U.S. interests in the Balkans. The RSK president believes that the [Croat-Muslim] alliance will not last long. "The alliance will make the RSK's position difficult for a while, but no one can return the RSK to Croatia by force," Martic stressed. Our fate depends most on the determination and readiness for further efforts and pressures which will follow both in the sphere of diplomacy and defense.
