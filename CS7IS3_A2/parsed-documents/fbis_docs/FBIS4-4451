The government parties opposed the change in the agenda order, but the change was approved by a vote of 342 to 199. Extensive debate by Assembly members continued without a break. In the afternoon, the prime minister, sitting among the Democrat Party's seats, stood to counter the allegation by certain senators about the government's violent and excessive suppression of the people.

Regarding the alleged suppression, the prime minister said the officials on duty were working under extreme pressure and had to protect themselves. The debates continued until 1800, when the session was adjourned by a vote of 351 to 176. A procedural roll call was then taken on the first reading on whether or not to accept the amendment proposals in principle. The voting ended at 1920 with a count of 369, with 194 abstentions, to accept the draft constitutional amendment of the opposition parties. The session ended at 1930.
