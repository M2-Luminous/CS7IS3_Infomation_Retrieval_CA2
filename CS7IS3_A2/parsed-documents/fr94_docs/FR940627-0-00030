FR940627-0-00030 FR940627-0-00009 Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should add a new provision prohibiting pipelines from providing a discount to an affiliate which is a supply area interruptible shipper. 18 They assert that affiliates can use a pipeline's standing offer of a transportation discount to undercut a transaction negotiated by a non-affiliated competitor and that even contemporaneous disclosure of the discount does not provide the non-affiliate with sufficient time to save its transaction. 18 Indicated Parties would not prohibit supply area discounts if the discount offer is posted on an EBB significantly prior to gas flow so all shippers can avail themselves of the discount. They also would not prohibit individual discounts to market area shippers. At this time, the Commission is not convinced that pipelines' incentives or ability to favor affiliates has been so significantly reduced by Order No. 636 that these provisions can be removed entirely. 19 While the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service does create a more competitive gas market, pipelines may still have an incentive to skew transportation transactions and information in such a way as to benefit affiliates. The requirement to post information on EBBs has not eliminated the pipelines' ability to favor their affiliates with information. By virtue of their position, pipelines may still be privy to important information regarding transportation capacity that they are not required to post on their EBBs. 20 More important, at this stage, the Commission does not have sufficient experience with the new capacity release mechanism established by Order No. 636 to evaluate whether this mechanism will create such a competitive market for transportation capacity that pipeline preferences for affiliates will no longer be of significance. 19 The absence of any significant complaints is not necessarily due to the pipelines' lack of incentive or inability to favor affiliates. It may, instead, be due to the pipelines' adherence to the Order No. 497 requirements and the public scrutiny of affiliate transactions provided by the regulations. 20 For example, pipelines will be aware of their own future plans, such as anticipated expansions, which might be valuable planning information for marketers. Without the Standards of Conduct, the pipelines could favor their affiliates by providing advance notice of their plans. Nonetheless, the purposes of Order No. 497 can be achieved in a manner that is substantially less burdensome to pipelines. The Standards of Conduct and reporting requirements that remain establish a reasonable balance between preservation of the affiliates' ability to compete and the prevention of undue favoritism to the affiliates. As discussed later, the Commission is retaining all the Standards of Conduct (with the exception of Standard H). These Standards generally require pipelines to: refrain from disclosing non-affiliate information to affiliates; contemporaneously disclose to the market any general transportation information provided to affiliates; make any discount offered to an affiliate contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliates by posting the information on the pipelines' EBB; and maintain separation of pipeline and affiliate operating personnel to the maximum extent practicable. These Standards of Conduct do not prevent pipelines from transacting business with their affiliates or communicating with or providing discounts to affiliates; they require only that the pipelines initiate common sense procedures to ensure that affiliates are not provided with information or discounts not available to others. Only two reporting requirements remain: the current requirement to maintain discount information for affiliates and non-affiliates and a revised requirement that some pipelines maintain and disclose the data used to allocate service on their systems. These requirements are much reduced from those under the current regulations and are the minimum needed to provide sufficient information about affiliate transactions for the Commission and shippers to monitor and police these transactions. The Commission will not prohibit supply area discounts to affiliates, as Indicated Parties suggest. Preventing all supply area discounts would seriously impede the ability of affiliates to compete by denying them justifiable discounts available to non-affiliates. New Standard H requires pipelines to make any such discounts contemporaneously available to other similarly situated shippers and this provision strikes the appropriate balance between protection of non-affiliates and maintenance of competition between affiliates and non-affiliates. The Commission is not proposing a sunset provision for these regulations, because a firm date, such as one year, may not provide a sufficient period for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of Order No. 636 on the affiliate regulations. The Commission, however, is committed to reviewing these requirements as the industry obtains more experience operating in the restructured environment, and, in particular, is interested in the effect of capacity release on pipeline interruptible service. VI. Standards of Conduct The Commission proposed to delete only one provision from the Standards of Conduct (§161.3 dealing with take-or-pay issues). Tenneco and KGPC contend that all Standards of Conduct provisions should be removed because the conduct they seek to prevent is already precluded by the requirements, in §§284.8 and 284.9, that pipelines must not unduly discriminate in the provision of transportation service. Tenneco asserts the standards actually may send the wrong signal by suggesting that unduly discriminatory conduct not mentioned in the standards is somehow considered less egregious than conduct specifically mentioned. Many other commenters request that the Commission delete or modify specific provisions.
