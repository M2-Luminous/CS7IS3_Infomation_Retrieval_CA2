FR940413-0-00078 FR940413-0-00026 Several commenters stated that although these objectives are laudable, their inclusion in a regulation is inappropriate, and at variance with the statutory requirements. Other commenters stated that the inclusion of these objectives in the rule added to the complexity of the rule because it was unclear whether these objectives were intended to be advisory or mandatory, and it was unclear whether a PHA could designate a project for elderly families if these objectives were not met. A few commenters stated that the final rule should be revised to require compliance with these objectives. The objectives listed in ยง945.293(a)(2) of the proposed rule are advisory and not mandatory. The Department agrees with the commenters that these objectives are laudable, but acknowledges that these objectives are just that_``objectives'' and not ``requirements''. Accordingly, to comply with the statute and minimize confusion concerning what is required to be addressed in the plan, and what is not, the final rule removes these objectives from the regulation. The Department is confident that without the regulatory reminder, PHAs will strive to meet these objectives. The Department's confidence is based in part on the improved public participation procedures for allocation plan development required by this final rule, and which are discussed below. The Department believes that these procedures will provide PHAs with valuable input on proposed allocation plans, including any possible problems, and options for expanding housing choice and creating integrated settings. Revised Consultation Procedures for the Plan Development A number of commenters criticized the ``public consultation process'' of the proposed rule on the basis that the rule simply mirrored the statutory language, and failed to provide adequate guidance on the extent of consultation involved. The Department found merit in the commenters' criticism and the final rule provides for a two-stage consultation process. The first consultation occurs at the pre-plan development stage, and the final rule specifies the parties that must be consulted at a minimum. The second consultation occurs after plan development, but before submission of the plan to the Department. The final rule requires the PHA to provide for review and comment on the allocation plan by all members of the public. This two-stage consultation process was recommended by several commenters. For the first stage of the consultation process, the final rule requires the PHA to consult with the State or unit of general local government where the project is located. (In response to public comment the phrase ``where the project was located'' was changed from the proposed rule phrase of ``in whose jurisdiction the area served by the PHA is located.'') The final rule also provides for PHAs to consult with representative advocacy groups, where these groups exist, for each of the following categories of families: Disabled families, elderly families and families with children. The final rule establishes consultation with public housing residents (again in the pre-plan development stage) by requiring consultation with the representatives of the residents of the buildings proposed for designation, as a minimum requirement. For the second stage of the consultation process, the final rule provides for public participation review and comment on the plan. The commenters stated that this type of public participation process would provide all families affected by the designation with the opportunity to express their support, voice their objections, and offer comments on the proposed allocation plan. The Department agrees with the commenters, and the final rule requires that following completion of the draft allocation plan (and the draft of any update of the allocation plan) the PHA shall: (1) Issue public notices regarding its intent to create designated housing and the availability of the draft allocation plan; (2) Contact those parties, with whom the PHA is required by regulation to consult, and other individuals and agencies that expressed an interest in the PHA's plan; (3) Allow not less than 30 days for public comment on the draft allocation plan; (4) Make free copies of the draft allocation plan available upon request and in accessible format, when appropriate; and (5) Conduct at least one public meeting on the draft allocation plan.
