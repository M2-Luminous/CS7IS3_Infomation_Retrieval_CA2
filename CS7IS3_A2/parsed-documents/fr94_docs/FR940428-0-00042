FR940428-0-00042 FR940428-0-00016 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 0 [DA 94&hyph;310] General Information agency: Federal Communications Commission. action: Final rule. summary: The Federal Communications Commission is modifying a section of the Commission's Rules that implements the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) fee schedule. This modification pertains to the charge for recovery of the full, allowable direct costs of searching for and reviewing records requested under the FOIA and the Commission's rules, unless such fees are restricted or waived in accordance with the Commission's rules. The fees are being revised to correspond to modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress. effective date: May 31, 1994. for further information contact: William Cline, Freedom of Information Act Officer, Records Management Division, room 234, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, (202) 632&hyph;7513. supplementary information: The FCC is modifying 47 CFR 0.467(a) of the Commission's Rules. This rule pertains to the charges for searching and reviewing records requested under the Freedom of Information (FOIA). The FOIA requires federal agencies to establish a schedule of fees for the processing of requests for agency records in accordance with fee guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In 1987, OMB issued its Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines. However, because the FOIA requires that each agency's fees be based upon its direct costs of providing FOIA services, OMB did not provide a unitary, government-wide schedule of fees. The Commission based its FOIA fee schedule on the grade level of the employee who processes the request. Thus, the fee schedule was computed at a Step 5 of each grade level based on the General Schedule effected January 1994. The instant revisions correspond to modifications in the rate of pay recently approved by Congress. Regulatory Procedures This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined not to be a ``significant rule'' since it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. In addition, it has been determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 0 Freedom of information.
