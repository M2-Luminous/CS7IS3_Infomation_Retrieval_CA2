In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said this appalling crime is a glaring example of racist Zionist policy and how the United States and its Western allies react to such acts. He said the United States and its Western allies use the most violent means of interference in response to their supporters' allegations about so-called human rights in one country or another. But when large numbers of Palestinians are publicly killed in a brutal and dirty manner, all that Washington, London, and the other Western capitals offer is words. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: The way the United States and some Western states reacted to this crime, which is part of the genocide that the Palestinian people have been subjected to since the partition and consequent usurpation of Palestine, is evidence of the double standards the United States and its Western allies follow in their dealings with world issues. We have always noted these double standards. Wherever the United States and its Western allies want to impose their political will and their economic interests, they use the UN Security Council and international organizations, as well as direct force, to achieve their objectives. But when it has something to do with peoples' rights and protecting them against genocide, U.S. and Western reaction is confined to the shedding of crocodile tears, maneuvers, and deception. Concluding his statement, the foreign minister said: The world peoples who love peace and justice and truly believe in human rights, the peoples who denounced this dirty Zionist crime against the people of Palestine, should denounce in the strongest way the stand of the United States and some of its Western allies on this crime. They should denounce their use of double standards toward all fair world and Arab issues, primarily the Palestine issue.
