SLD Sejm Deputies Want Dismissal of MON Chief"] [Text] Roman Nowicki and Stanislaw Janas, Sejm deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], announced during a news conference yesterday that a motion will be prepared to have the chief of the Defense Ministry [MON], Piotr Kolodziejczyk, recalled from his post. According to Nowicki and Janas, the minister humiliates the Sejm and acts against the interests of the Polish defense industry. In Nowicki's view, he will have no problem finding 15 members of parliament ready to support such a motion. The affair began when Sejm deputies made a decision to include a provision in the budget that MON will have to purchase Iryda aircraft costing 300 million zlotys [Z] each. "I have a copy of a letter addressed to the Mesko plant in which the minister justifies a decrease of orders with a decision by the Sejm Budget Commission regarding the purchase of Iryda," Nowicki displayed a pile of documents. These were confidential expert opinions from which it could be concluded that the Iryda is a good aircraft. Nowicki complained that, in his recent statements, Minister Kolodziejczyk "made fools of the Sejm deputies." The Sejm deputies also pointed out that, under the "Expenditures" section of the MON budget, a sum of Z400 billion is listed as being devoted to the purchase of 152 passenger cars, 150 terrain-passenger cars, and 10 buses, among other things. "Perhaps the ministers would like to be driven around in Mercedes cars. But they have no right to complain they have no money for equipment," Nowicki concluded. Through the president, Minister Kolodziejczyk has addressed the Constitutional Tribunal with a question of whether forcing MON to make these kinds of purchases is in accordance with the legal system. He also voiced the reservation that, even if the Tribunal disagrees with him, he will not buy the Iryda aircraft in the version proposed by the Mielec-based plant. "We want to purchase about 40 pieces, but they must be the kind of equipment that would present combat value. For the moment, Iryda is just a training and educational type of aircraft," said Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, in a determined manner. General Henryk Mika, the director of MON's department for arms and military equipment supplies, was surprised by the Sejm deputies' accusations. "We are devoting Z120 billion for cars, and these are financial means that the Army itself has come up with. The only Western-made vehicles we have are the 16 Peugeot 405's that were manufactured in Lublin and are being tested now because, in general, we purchase [Polish-made] Polonez cars," he explained to GAZETA WYBORCZA. According to a high-ranking MON official, the confusion caused by the SLD Sejm deputies is "the communists' revenge for the failure of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski's candidacy for the post of deputy minister in MON."
