FBIS4-48237 "drafr094_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 15 May South African Press Review for 15 May MB1505105194 MB1505105194 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Stem Past Excesses -- While "few leaders come to power on tides of warmth and goodwill such as President Nelson Mandela enjoys," the "afterglow" is expected to last a "brief period" when "the new president must strike the major themes of his term of office, and win to his purpose the major constituencies of a complex society," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 15 May on page 22 notes. "The country at large has been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites, destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency, resentment and irresponsibility." And the "greatest threat to the future" is the "flight of capital, the wariness of investors that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy, ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country inherits from the NP [National Party]." "Mr Mandela's first challenge is to set a different tone" and deal with a civil service "adept at looting, a parasite class." "Mr Mandela is the only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his administration his own instincts for order, frugality and propriety." SUNDAY NATION Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this country is "bound together with a sense of optimism about the future," "the unfolding process could certainly represent a genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their vote is working for them to usher a new era," an editorial in Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states. Strikes in Transkei, Bophuthatswana and among Eastern and Western Cape interpreters "mark the beginning of many tests which our newly-found freedom will be subjected to" and "further trouble could either be contained or be allowed to spread to areas like Ciskei, Venda, Lebowa and even Qwaqwa." "It is true that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined fashion." "Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all." BEELD RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- "Yesterday at the Union Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all its people," says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 11 May. "President Nelson Mandela said after his inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki. However, "they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone. There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people." "If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of hope and promise to the rest of the world." Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial on page 12 of BEELD argues: "The presence in South Africa of a high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton administration is busy putting words into action and reaching out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done. This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7 countries -- could provide the spark which the South African economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach is most welcome." Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role that day, and his reference to them as "our police." BEELD continues: "These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African society." "That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a minority government, but of a generally accepted government of all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact, it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,' it's `our country.'"
