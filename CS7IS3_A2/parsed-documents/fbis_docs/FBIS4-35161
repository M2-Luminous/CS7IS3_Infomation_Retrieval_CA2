The six former commanders, who said they represent the chiefs of the four war fronts of the defunct contra group, said during a news conference that the occupations are lead by Enrique Quinonez, "who never was a legitimate RN member." They also appealed to the true former members of the Resistance, who are currently at the OAS International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) building and those who are at the embassy, to "not engage in actions that damage the organization's image." In addition, they asked the government to comply with "what is lacking" in the agreements (Toncontin, Honduras; Olof Palme; and Hotel Las Mercedes) signed between 1989 and 1990 for the overall reintegration process of the demobilized and of the former contras. Rodolfo Ampie, alias "comandante Invisible;" Luis Angel Lopez, alias "comandante Leonel;" Edgar Molinares, alias "comandante Richard;" Salvador Talavera, alias "comandante Esteban;" Jorge Avalos, alias "comandante Avalos;" and Erving Barberena, alias "comandante Oscar" are the former RN commanders who appealed to the occupiers to "think over their attitudes." According to "comandante Invisible," Violeta Chamorro's government has only complied with 40 percent of the agreements on the delivery of over 400,000 manzanas of land (571,428 hectareas) to former contras. More than 1,000,000 manzanas (1.4 million hectareas), as well as houses, work tools, and urban lots for the construction of homes are still pending delivery. Other former contra chiefs indicated that at "Reparto 380" and "Hialiah" [temporary living facilities] in this capital the demobilized have not received materials for the construction of housing, while in the "Villa Reconciliacion," the houses lack electricity and potable water. In addition, they pointed out that thousands of former contras, after returning to their places of origin and finding themselves without jobs, left behind their families again to go to Managua with the hope of solving their problems, but this has not happened. The peaceful occupation for the second day of the CIAV-OAS is being lead by disabled commander Lorenzo Seledon, alias "Chispero," while the action at the Colombian Embassy is being lead by Jose Luis Arguello Montiel, alias "commander 002." Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta accused the occupants of the diplomatic mission of committing crimes of extortion, threats, coercion, and kidnapping. He said the government will not negotiate with these people. This afternoon, a lengthy meeting was held at the CIAV-OAS headquarters. Present at the meeting was Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, who was representing Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. However, no representative of the Violeta Chamorro government was present. Also present at the meeting were Argentine diplomat Sergio Caramagna, CIAV-OAS general coordinator; Enrique Quinonez, representing the RN Superior Council, which consist of 57 leaders of the demobilized rank and file; and "Chispero." However, results from the meeting were scarce. Today, approximately 20 demobilized and former contras occupied the offices of the Nicaraguan Institute of the Agrarian Reform in Chinandega, in the western part of the country, in support of the similar actions in Managua.
