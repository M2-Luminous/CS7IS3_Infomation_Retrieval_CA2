Under his coordination, and with the help of Ceara Deputy Sergio Machado, the PSDB national board will make a chart showing the prospects for regional alliances, which are essential for the success of the presidential candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Based on the result, the alliance will be either strengthened or discarded. "If the incompatibility index is very high, the alliance with the PFL will not be worthwhile," Jereissati said. He added that, based on the survey results, a decision will be made as to whether PFL Bahia Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes has the most appropriate profile for running as vice president on Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket. "There is still a long way to go," he added. The survey will not break the negotiations over a common government program, which the two parties will begin studying on 11 April. Jereissati added that the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] and the PP [Popular Party] -- which also might join the alliance -- will be called to debate the common program. He ruled out the possibility of creating another Democratic Alliance -- an agreement between the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] that sponsored the candidacy of Tancredo Neves in 1984 and the government of Jose Sarney. For example, in order to harmonize the situation in Bahia, Neves gave two ministerial posts to the divergent movements, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for the communications portfolio and Waldir Pires for social security. "It was the time to come out of the dictatorship, but the situation is different now," Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas said with dissatisfaction. "How will I explain to my grass roots the alliance with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes?" To this Jereissati replied by saying: "Protests always come from the same people." In Jereissati's opinion, "convincing political adversaries" reflects democratic progress. There might be more than 14 states in which the PSDB leadership considers the alliance with the PFL is impossible. Bahia, Piaui, Maranhao, Rondonia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Ceara, Paraiba, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Parana, and Rio Grande do Norte are considered the most difficult cases. Negotiations are under way in Pernambuco, Sao Paulo, and Amazonas.
