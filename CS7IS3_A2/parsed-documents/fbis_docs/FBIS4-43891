One of the leading candidates is Sir Leon Brittan, a "heavyweight" of the Commission since 1989. But France and Germany oppose him, and Brittan desperately needs Italy's support. However, Sir Leon has countered Italy in matters ranging from steel to milk, and in 1991 he prevented Alenia's purchase of De Havilland and defended the British side. Just after the European elections, Brittan rejects his anti-Italian label and puts forward his vision of Europe -- a union of right-wing forces in parliament, an Italian-British axis, and limits on the Commission's decisionmaking powers. [Squillante] The European elections brought losses for the Socialists and a fragmentation of the Right, with the entry onto the scene of the anti-Europeanists. The only exception to this was London. What is your assessment? [Brittan] Your analysis is correct. The Left was weakened, but the Right is more fragmented. The Right's capacity to resist the Socialists therefore depends on cooperation among its various parts. Personally, I am in favor of a rapprochement among the groups of the moderate Right -- and I stress, moderate. [Squillante] What role would you assign, as president, to the Commission? [Brittan] The Commission must respond to public opinion and acknowledge that in Europe now those who are unenthusiastic about the speed of integration do enjoy some support. We must involve the public and national parliaments more and tackle the real tasks of EU, without becoming involved in the ordinary lives of businesses and individuals. The first problem to tackle is unemployment. The second is to extend the Union to the countries of Central and East Europe -- and not only them -- without causing a slowing of the Union as a result. [Squillante] Without a joint executive, can the governments, exposed as they are to changes on the part of the electorate, guarantee a continuous leadership of a Europe that will perhaps have 20 members in the future? [Brittan] The distinction between intergovernmental and Community action was made in the Maastricht Treaty, and it will not be substantially modified. With the membership of new countries, it will be necessary to give careful attention to all the Union's institutions and to consider how they might function with 20 or 25 member countries, what changes need to be introduced to ensure their proper functioning. [Squillante] [Former French President] Giscard has again suggested the idea of a "European president." Can this be considered? [Brittan] It is certainly an interesting idea, but I doubt whether it could be accepted by everyone. [Squillante] Britain has always advocated a "free trade" Europe rather than a federal union. Some people in Rome share this philosophy. Is it possible to envisage an Italian-British axis? [Brittan] At present there is a broad range of common interests, but this was so with previous governments too -- for instance, in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty and in common defense policy. These interests must be supported increasingly in other European countries too, and I think that Britain's and Italy's ideas will become increasingly important in the Europe of the future. [Squillante] Italy will be crucial in the election of the president of the Commission, but you have made a reputation for yourself as Rome's stubborn adversary... [Brittan] This is not true. Italy is a country to which I feel very close, but I draw a distinction between the interests of certain sectors of industry and the interests of Italian consumers and taxpayers. When I was responsible for competition I tried to reduce state aid to industry, which at the time constituted 28 percent of your budget deficit. If I had succeeded, one of the main financial problems would have been considerably reduced, and Italy would have had a better chance to share in the single European currency. [Squillante] Pardon me, but Mr. Berlusconi controls a large proportion of the advertising and television market and has interests in construction, commerce, and finance: Why should he support somebody like you, who has adopted free competition as his philosophy? [Brittan] I do not want to enter into domestic political matters. If anyone thinks that Europe's laws have been violated, he must address the Court of Justice and prove it.
