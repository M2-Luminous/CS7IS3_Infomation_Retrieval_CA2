Van der Broek was to meet with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov before heading to Athens where he was to try to persuade Greek officials to lift their eight-day blockade against the former Yugoslav republic. Greece's partners in the 12-member European Union have threatened to take Athens before the European Court of Justice unless the dispute is resolved. Athens announced on February 16 that it was blocking all trade to Macedonia through the northeastern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the country's imports including oil. Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name. Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said Wednesday that Athens wishes to have good relations with Macedonia but the latter must accept the "logical" demands made by the Greek Government.
