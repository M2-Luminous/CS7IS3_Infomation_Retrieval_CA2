"No matter for who Ames worked, we believe the punishment to be too harsh," Tatyana Samolis, spokeswoman of the director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, told TASS on Friday. "I believe that after the end of the `Cold War' and with the general warming of the world political climate, as well as from purely humane considerations, he should not have been sentenced for life," Samolis said. She added that most of her colleagues regard the ballyhoo around the so-called "major spy case in the history of the United States" as hypocrisy. Addressing Russian intelligence officers on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin said that the "true reasons of this anti-Russian (Ames) affair have a purely political tint" and added that the United States is "mounting efforts to recruit spies in Russia."
