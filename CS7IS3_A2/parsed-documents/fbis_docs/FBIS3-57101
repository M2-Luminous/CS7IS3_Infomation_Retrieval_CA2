All these apparatus posts were allocated among Russia's Choice, Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc], the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR], the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR], the "New Regional Policy" [NRP], the Communists, Zhirinovskiy's followers, and the Women of Russia. The Women of Russia have obtained the opportunity to chair the Committee for the Affairs of Women, the Family, and Childhood. Yabloko occupies the leading positions on two committees (but what committees!): The Committee for International Affairs (V. Lukin) and the Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances (Mikhail Zadornov). Aleksey Mikhaylov, who is deputy chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy, is also from that bloc. Members of the NRP association have become chairmen of three committees. The PRUA and APR and the Communists chair two. Russia's Choice has chairmen on four committees, including defense (Sergey Yushenkov) and information policy and communications (Mikhail Poltoranin). However, the makeup of their deputy chairmen -- that is to say, Communists and deputies from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and APR -- raise doubts about the strength of Russia's Choice on those committees. The LDPR has installed chairmen on five committees. A proposal to vote for each committee individually did not find support. However, the ritual of candidates presenting themselves and their programs did begin. I think it is a great pity that television is not broadcasting the sessions of parliament now. The election of the State Duma apparatus promised to be instructive as regards the candidates' character and potential. Sergey Glazyev (chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy, DPR) was single-minded and businesslike. Mikhail Lemeshev (LDPR) was approved as chairman of the Committee for the Environment in his absence. Vladimir Isakov (APR), chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform, proposed creating the "most sophisticated system of legislation in the world" through computerization. You will recall that not so long ago there was half-joking discussion of whether the stress on the first syllable of "nachat" ["to begin"] will become the norm. Lyubov Rozhkova (NRP), chairman of the Committee for Education, Culture, and Science, launched a new philological tendency: Quoting Franklin, she twice referred confidently to him as Veniamin. And, admittedly, Fedor Roosevelt and Misha Faraday might well extend the bounds of Russian knowledge, might they not? Eight potential committee chairmen spoke that day. The pointless procedure was cut short by a deputy's address: "The 'party bosses' have already shared everything out, that's enough time wasted, let's vote." And voting did take place, demonstrating once again that every opportunity for independent deputies to influence the work of the committees has been removed.
