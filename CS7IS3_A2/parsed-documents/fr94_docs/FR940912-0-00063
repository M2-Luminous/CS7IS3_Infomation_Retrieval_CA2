All regulations applicable to Schedule I substances continue to be in effect as of September 12, 1994 with respect to AET. This substance has been in Schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h) since March 12, 1993. The current applicable regulations are as follows: 1. Registration.

The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the placement of AET into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical use in the United States. In accordance with the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this scheduling action is a formal rulemaking. Such proceedings are conducted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and, as such, are exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866, 3(d)(1). This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
