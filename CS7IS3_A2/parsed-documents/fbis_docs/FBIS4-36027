Addressing the congregation, which embraced a large group of mourners and pilgrims from various parts of the country and the world to the blessed shrine of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, Ayatollah Yazdi said that taking part in ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Imam's demise has become an Islamic ritual. [passage omitted] The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the recent guidelines of his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the leader of the Islamic revolution, which stated that the nation, the government, and the country's officials should refrain from doing things which could serve to inspire hope among the enemies. Ayatollah Yazdi urged the nation to pay careful attention to these guidelines, and said: Those who speak in certain forums and gatherings in a very unfair way and away from the norm of constructive criticism, and tend to deny all the achievements of the Islamic revolution and overlook all the great tasks which have been accomplished since the victory of the Islamic revolution -- in particular during the era of reconstruction -- are in fact creating a gap in the ranks of the nation, thereby undermining the nation's unity and enabling the enemy to exert its influence. Ayatollah Yazdi then condemned the slogan of separation of religion from politics and, calling on the clergy and all the strata of the nation, said: We must move in such a way that our policy remains identical to our religion. Furthermore, he condemned the Zionist regime's kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of the Believers' Resistance Movement of Lebanon, as well as Israel's air attack on the Ba'lbek area in southern Lebanon. He considered these acts to be a blatant violation of international norms and conventions concerning the territorial integrity and independence of a country. He, moreover, condemned the silence of international forums toward these crimes, and said: These acts of the Zionist regime show that until the people of the occupied territories return to their homeland, and until Israel is completely destroyed, the Mideast region cannot hope to witness peace and tranquillity.
