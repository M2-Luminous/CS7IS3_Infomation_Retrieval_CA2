FR941104-2-00098 FR941104-2-00058 Draft NUREG; Issuance, Availability The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a draft report entitled ``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;6174). This draft report, prepared for the NRC by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL), is available for review and comment. The draft report presents the results of a review and reevaluation of the original boiling water reactor (BWR) decommissioning study (NUREG/CR&hyph;0672), and subsequent addenda which addressed technology, safety and cost issues associated with decommissioning a large nuclear power plant. This reevaluation was performed to update the current cost estimates to decommission the reference BWR from NUREG/CR&hyph;0672, which was Washington Public Power Supply System's Washington Nuclear Plant Two (WNP&hyph;2). This report and the recently released draft NUREG/CR&hyph;5884, entitled ``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station'' should be viewed as a first step in developing a more parametric approach to estimating decommissioning costs. The results of these studies, including input from the public, will be utilized by the NRC staff as part of its effort to determine if revisions of the decommissioning regulations are warranted. A separate draft report, NUREG/CR&hyph;6270, entitled ``Estimating Boiling Water Reactor Decommissioning Costs'' will be issued shortly for public comment and it will be noticed in the Federal Register when it becomes available. It is a user's manual for a computer program developed by PNL that was used to calculate the decommissioning cost estimates presented in NUREG/CR&hyph;6174. Comments and suggestions on the Draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6174 should be sent to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Comments and suggestions will be most helpful if they are received by December 23, 1994. Copies of NUREG/CR&hyph;6174 may be purchased from the Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082, telephone (202) 512&hyph;2249 or (202) 512&hyph;2171.
