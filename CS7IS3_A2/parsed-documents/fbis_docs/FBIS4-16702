He said that Russia favored the idea of demarcating the Estonian- Russian border and granting it a state status. "Estonia has neither directly accepted it, nor objected to it in principle," he said. The border dispute between Russia and Estonia still remains unsettled. Tallinn does not recognize the current borders, because in accordance with the Tartu treaty signed back in 1920, Estonia included some of the regions which were joined to Russia during and after World War II. "We want to secede from Russia with the same territory we had when we joined it," the commission co-chairman Enn Leison told Interfax. He pointed out, however, that Estonia did not seek the return of the territories in which ethnic Russians constituted 60 percent. "We wouldn't like to have non-natives added to Estonia," he said. On April 18 and 19, the commission members met in Moscow to discuss social guarantees for Russian military pensioners living in Estonia, and the most favored nations trade regime provided for in the bilateral treaty. The next session will be held in Estonia on May 15.
