The participants first heard reports on the examination on the draft laws on foreign trade and state compensation, and a draft decision on punishing violators in the management of companies and enterprises. The reports held that the two draft laws and the draft decision, after repeated examination and revision, are generally feasible. They therefore proposed that the drafts be adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC. Tao Siju, minister of public security, read to the legislators draft supplementary provisions to regulations governing offenses against public order which, targeted at newly-emerging problems and phenomena, define 18 new offenses. Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political Department, explained the draft amendments to the regulations on active service and rank of military officers of the People's Liberation Army. He said that the revision of the two regulations was meant to meet increasing needs of the reform and construction drive of both the nation and the armed forces. The revised draft amendment to the regulations on military rank spell out the disestablishment of first-class (highest rank) general. It also stipulates that no military rank will be granted to the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the rank for vice chairmen of the commission is that of general. The draft amendment to the regulations on active service takes two to three years off the ceiling age for officers of deputy-army level, officers at the level of deputy commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and officers with elementary professional posts. According to a report on the draft Law on Management of Urban Real Estate, delivered by Vice Minister of Construction Ye Rutang, the development of the real estate industry will on the one hand provide the basic material foundation for urban economic growth, and on the other hand help improve the living standards of urban residents. The minister said that the position of the real estate industry in the national economy and its role in social progress have obliged it to be standardized, guided, promoted and secured by law. The draft decision on punishing criminals violating copyrights stipulates that copyright violators can meet with punishment ranging from five years in prison to detention and fines. The legislators also heard explanations on the draft laws on judges and prosecutors made respectively by Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Siqing. Ren said that for more than four decades China has not had a law on judges, who are both state functionaries and professionals. Legislation in the field is very necessary for the scientific and standardized management of custodians of the law, he said. Zhang said the law on prosecutors is aimed at establishing a mechanism to restrict the behavior of prosecutors. Today's meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
