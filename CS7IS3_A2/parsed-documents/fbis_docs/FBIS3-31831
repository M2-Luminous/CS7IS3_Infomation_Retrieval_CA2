Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic, set off to the meeting armed with several proposals regarding the opening of Sarajevo and the normalization of life in both parts of the city. The proposals in question concern the so-called blue roads leading toward Sarajevo, which would be controlled by the peace forces, and the free departure of civilians from the city, primarily Serbs who since the beginning of the war have been hostages of the Muslim authorities. The outcome of this meeting is awaited impatiently, and it will depend to a great extent on the Muslim side's position.
