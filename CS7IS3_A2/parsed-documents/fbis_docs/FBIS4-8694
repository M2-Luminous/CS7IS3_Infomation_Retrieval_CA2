I presume you are doing the same. Is there any original idea in the economic program of the National Democratic Federation [NDSZ]? [Pozsgay] Our program has two basic elements: One is the starting of economic growth, the other is the protection of domestic industry and production, and we will also contribute to this with protectionist laws if necessary. This is not something to hide at all. I visited the United States recently and I saw there a protectionist legislature bordering on discrimination. I think we also have an original idea on how to handle our debts. We are convinced that we are unable to create adequate means for economic growth precisely because of the large-scale outflow of resources. We do not say that we do not want to pay at all; we only say that foreign debt is not a fate, but the consequence of a mistaken economic policy. Therefore, we want to renegotiate our repayment system. [Peter] According to experts, this is impossible because of the structure of our foreign debt. [Pozsgay] We also have experts who claim that the repayment conditions are renegotiable and that it is possible to handle even such a diversified and funded debt. It is possible to convince the creditors to invest their bonds in Hungary. The bonds of those who refuse to do this must be sold. This way, we could fulfill our repayment obligation while the money would stay here and could be used for development. Taking new credits is not risky in this system if the creditor is interested in domestic investment. [Peter] You mentioned economic revival. How do you envisage this? [Pozsgay] First of all, we must find the sources that make it possible to start the economic growth, in our view, manpower and the joining capital. As I already mentioned, we can get capital by restructuring our debt and by targeted capital investment, and not one that further increases our debts. All this is needed for this well-trained society capable of work to be able to work. We think it is a mistaken policy to focus on handling unemployment; our goal is to create employment, and economic growth is a precondition for this. We also think it is important to develop a credit system to support the new ventures, a system that would also give a chance for the people working in agriculture and food production to survive. [Peter] The NDSZ has a rather original idea on privatization. If I recall it correctly, in one of your speeches, you mentioned a privatization by referendum. [Pozsgay] My words were probably misunderstood, because I spoke of national consensus, and not a referendum and, in my opinion, the fate of our national property also belongs here. We say that we should convene a national coordination congress to deal with the preparation of a new constitution and the coordination of public interests regarding the protection of national property. As a result, the big national interest organizations could come to an agreement, like the state, the employers, and the employees in Austria and Spain. Among other things, this agreement would deal with the management of our national sovereignty; in other words, we must decide what we can give away from our independence regained with bitter struggle for the benefit of our joining the international integration. [Peter] What is your opinion about the privatization practice? [Pozsgay] In my opinion, in working out the concept of privatization, a very important element was overlooked, namely that we are not talking here simply about the exchange of property, but about a change in social structure. Therefore, the Hungarian privatization cannot be compared with the British one, for example, where privatization is simply a matter of rates: When the Labour Party is in power, they nationalize property; when the Conservative Party is in power, they engage in privatization. They can do that, because all this only affect a tiny part of the national property. There has been no privatization in Hungary before; we must change a system called socialist and of stalinist origin into a market economy: almost 90 percent of industrial equipment and millions of workers. Therefore, in my opinion, corruption is not the biggest mistake of the Hungarian privatization, because this is only something that accompanies the distribution, something that originates from a lack of concept. [Peter] You said in one of your interviews that the party that can bring hope to people will win the upcoming elections. In your opinion, is the NDSZ capable of doing this? [Pozsgay] Yes, because we offer work to the people. If they have work, their living conditions will improve and their fear from tomorrow will disappear. Let us not forget that we are part of European civilization and people adjust their demands to this. If needed, people can give up some of their demands, but they will not endure deprivation beyond a certain limit. Therefore, we must provide a systematic security to the weak strata of the population and to the backward areas. Unless we come to our senses, our capital city will soon resemble Mexico, while other areas become poor and deserted. [Peter] Regarding its economic program, with what other party could the NDSZ cooperate? [Pozsgay] If you allow me, I will not name parties here; instead, I will say that we can cooperate with all the parties engaged in the protection of domestic production and domestic market and which regard domestic bourgeois civilization and the necessary modernization as essential. We also think that the national feeling is not an obstacle in all this; on the contrary, only a nation can create a community. Without a community image, we will become a smeared manpower source in Europe at most.
