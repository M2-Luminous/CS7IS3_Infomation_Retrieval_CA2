Asked about the Iranian Government's protest, through the Thai ambassador to Iran, about Thailand's arrest of Iranians suspected of preparing and transporting C-4 explosive for sabotage at the Israeli Embassy, the permanent secretary said it was difficult for him to comment since this might affect relations. Besides, the permanent secretary said he still knew nothing about the protest. Asked whether it would be possible for Iranian diplomats to meet the suspects, he said this would be up to the police. He said the diplomats can call on the suspects to provide them with a lawyer should he be arrested. However, he said, he was not sure if there really had been a protest as he had seen nothing to that effect. Ari said legal proceedings against the suspects will be based on Thai law because the incident took place in Thailand. He said the suspects might not be granted bail if there is no guarantee of security. He said that under Thai law, Iran cannot seek extradition for trial in Iran. He is confident the police will adhere to Thai law, particularly as the case is considered an important one involving national security. He noted that the police have followed quite proper and thorough procedures. The police are speeding up the investigation for the result of the case.
