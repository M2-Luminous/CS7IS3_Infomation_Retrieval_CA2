FR940826-0-00144 FR940826-0-00020 (5) Public Mobile Services ( see 47 CFR Part 22), except in the 800 MHz Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service, and in the Rural Radio Service. This paragraph does not apply to applications in the cellular radio service, such as cellular unserved area applications, that were filed prior to July 26, 1993; (6) Specialized Mobile Radio Service (SMR) ( see 47 CFR Part 90, Subpart S) including applications based on finder's preferences for frequencies allocated to the SMR service ( see 47 CFR 90.173); and (7) Personal Communications Services (PCS) ( see 47 CFR Part 24). Note to paragraph (a): To determine the rules that apply to competitive bidding in the foregoing services, specific service rules should also be consulted. (b) The following types of license applications are not subject to competitive bidding procedures: (1) Applications for renewal of licenses; (2) Applications for modification of license; provided, however, that the Commission may determine that applications for modification that are mutually exclusive with other applications should be subject to competitive bidding; (3) Applications for subsidiary communications services. A ``subsidiary communications service'' is a class of service where the signal for that service is indivisible from that of the main channel signal and that main channel signal is exempt from competitive bidding under other provisions of these rules. See, e.g., ยง1.2102(c) (exempting broadcast services). Examples of such subsidiary communications services are those transmitted on subcarriers within the FM baseband signal ( see 47 CFR 73.295), and signals transmitted within the Vertical Blanking Interval of a broadcast television signal; and (4) Applications for frequencies used as an intermediate link or links in the provision of a continuous, end-to-end service where no service is provided directly to subscribers over the frequencies. Examples of such intermediate links are: (i) Point-to-point microwave facilities used to connect a cellular radio telephone base station with a cellular radio telephone mobile telephone switching office; and (ii) Point-to-point microwave facilities used as part of the service offering in the provision of telephone exchange or interexchange service. (c) Applications in the following services or classes of services are not subject to competitive bidding: (1) Alaska-Private Fixed Stations ( see 47 CFR Part 80, Subpart O); (2) Broadcast radio (AM and FM) and broadcast television (VHF, UHF, LPTV) under 47 CFR Part 73; (3) Broadcast Auxiliary and Cable Television Relay Services ( see 47 CFR Part 74, Subparts D, E, F, G, H and L and Part 78, Subpart B); (4) Instructional Television Fixed Service ( see 47 CFR Part 74, Subpart I); (5) Maritime Support Stations ( see 47 CFR Part 80, Subpart N); (6) Marine Operational Fixed Stations ( see 47 CFR Part 80, Subpart L); (7) Marine Radiodetermination Stations ( see 47 CFR Part 80, Subpart M); (8) Personal Radio Services ( see 47 CFR Part 95), except applications filed after July 26, 1993, in the Interactive Video Data Service ( see 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F); (9) Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation, General and Business Radio categories above 800 MHz, including finder's preference requests for frequencies not allocated to the SMR service ( see 47 CFR 90.173), and including, until further notice of the Commission, the Automated Vehicle Monitoring Service ( see 47 CFR 90.239); (10) Private Land Mobile Radio Services between 470&hyph;512 MHz ( see 47 CFR Part 90, Subparts B&hyph;F), including those based on finder's preferences, ( see 47 CFR 90.173); (11) Private Land Mobile Radio Services below 470 MHz ( see 47 CFR Part 90, Subparts B&hyph;F) except in the 220 MHz band ( see 47 CFR Part 90, Subpart T), including those based on finder's preferences ( see 47 CFR Section 90.173); and (12) Private Operational Fixed Services ( see 47 CFR Part 94). ยง1.2103 Competitive bidding design options. (a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The choice of competitive bidding design will generally be made pursuant to the criteria set forth in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;61, adopted March 8, 1994, available for purchase from the International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M St. NW, suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, telephone (202) 857&hyph;3800, but the Commission may design and test alternative methodologies. The Commission will choose from one or more of the following types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to competitive bidding: (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); (2) Sequential oral auctions; (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. (b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of auction. (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction. ยง1.2104 Competitive bidding mechanisms. (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish the sequence in which multiple licenses will be auctioned. (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. (c) Reservation Price. The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to auction will not be awarded. (d) Minimum Bid Increments. The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. The Commission may also establish suggested minimum opening bids on a service-specific basis. (e) Stopping Rules. The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the auctions within a reasonable time. (f) Activity Rules. The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity.
