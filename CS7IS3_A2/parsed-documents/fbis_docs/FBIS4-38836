Military-technical cooperation with Beijing is based on the fact that Chinese combat equipment is originally based on our weapons. [Kokoshin] They are seen by the Chinese army and the Chinese navy as the most suitable for them to produce. [Peslyak] There is a world-wide struggle for the armaments market but the Chinese side itself wants to develop, for example, combat aircraft construction on the basis of Russian achievements, starting from small beginnings. [Kokoshin] At this stage it is a question of, specifically, supplying a batch of SU-27s. [Peslyak] Kokoshin said that at present the development of not only Russia's military but also its civilian technologies is being paid for from the defense budget, not to mention that this expenditure is to a large extent social expenditure since it provides for closed military and scientific townlets. [Kokoshin] Today expenditure on defense research and development is money being spent on strengthening Russia's position in the world economy.
