During an interview with the media that have accompanied him on his visit to the Republic of South Africa, Fidel Castro said Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sincerely expressed with "heartfelt words that came from the bottom of his soul" what the aid given by Cuba represented for his country. Today, the two leaders held a meeting following the inauguration of antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela as South African president, an event that shook the world on 10 May. Referring to the meeting, the Cuban head of state said dos Santos also told him that Cuban cooperation was important not only for Angola but also for South Africa and the rest of that vast continent. He added that dos Santos' words shook him when he referred to the unselfish aid given by the Cuban people to that region of the planet. Today, Fidel Castro talked with a dozen African heads of state and government who attended Mandela's inauguration, including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President San Nujoma, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano. He also talked with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, among other personalities invited to Mandela's inauguration, which was attended by 150,000 guests, including 42 leaders.
