He explained that, as a result of changes in the style of managing enterprises, "the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] will be unnecessary." He will submit the conclusions from these talks to the Council of Ministers. "There is a certain risk, but I believe that we are prepared to take this risk because we can count on responsible cooperation on the part of trade unions and managers." As the prime minister wants it, the government will probably decide not to submit a new popiwek bill to the Sejm. Even though Pawlak did not tell journalists directly that he would not forward the new popiwek bill for the time being, Ewa Spychalska, chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], stated that he had admitted that would retreat from this idea. He will not forward this bill to the Sejm for a month, unless some violent wage increases are observed during that time. According to Pawlak, the road to maintaining a stable economy without controlling wages is "accelerating the work on laws concerning collective agreements (wages would be negotiated in them), legal regulations concerning the status of the Trilateral Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs, including the issue of the representativeness of trade unions, and accelerating the commercialization of companies manufacturing goods for the Polish market." "In the first order, we should commercialize enterprises that are in good financial shape. We will try to implement these processes as fast as possible, so that, in companies that are in a position to increase wages, the founding organs will be able to control these processes efficiently," said the prime minister. He also stressed that it is important to "maintain the special character of a public company, mainly in the area of services, such as the railroads or post offices." "I am counting on a responsible attitude of trade unions and managers. For the time being, there is no danger of an uncontrolled wage increase. If we take advantage of a frank and open exchange of views, we will be able to go further and introduce solutions that are effective and proven in countries characterized by well-organized cooperation of social partners. The Council of Ministers will discuss the conclusion of our meeting--that one can live without a popiwek as well." Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], stated that, before the consultations in the SLD leadership, he could not comment on the statement by Prime Minister Pawlak. Most of the trade unions were nicely surprised by the prime minister's decision to retreat from the new proposal on wage controls. OPZZ: A Meeting a Month Leaving the Office of the Council of Ministers, Spychalska reported that, on 15 April, a meeting would be held on the governmental program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97. On 14 April, there will be a meeting on the final version of the Labor Code. On 27 April, the government will submit the main points of the reform of social insurance. According to the OPZZ chairperson, the prime minister also assured the trade unions that the labor minister had given up the changes in family allowances--"their size will depend on a given family's income, not on the number of children." "In the middle of each month, consultation meetings, similar to the one held on 13 April, will be held with representatives of trade unions and employers," said the OPZZ head. Solidarity ["S"]: Prime Minister Speaks About Our Proposal "I will not beat around the bush and say bluntly that the government has not implemented most of the "S" demands; however, we are satisfied with the prime minister's announcement of departing from the new popiwek law, which is in line with the opinions of experts," Marian Krzaklewski commented on the government's stand on the "S" demands. "We have always thought that wage regulation should be conducted through a system of collective agreements; now, because there exist enterprises of a monopolistic character, which may raise wages by setting higher prices, there should be some kind of control system. It seems that the government will agree to our proposal that, in those enterprises, wages not only be regulated in collective agreements but also be confirmed in the Trilateral Committee. A list of such enterprises should be drawn up by the Antimonopoly Office," stated Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the "S" National Commission [KK]. The KK hoped to receive a reply from the Council of Ministers before the session--the council discussed the "S" demands on Tuesday [12 April]. It did not receive a letter from the prime minister, and it learned about the government's stance from a reporter. Asked after the meeting with trade unions about the "S" demands, the prime minister dodged the question, drawing attention to the fact that it was a meeting with many unions and employers and that the conclusion was different. Stanislaw Alot, KK secretary delegated to yesterday's meeting with the prime minister, stated that the government had actually answered only two demands: that it will depart from the popiwek, and that it will review earlier agreements with "S" over the next two weeks. It opened itself, to a certain extent, to other demands--among other things, the government intends to implement a law on collective agreements, representativeness, and the Trilateral Committee within a month. Alot also wanted an answer to the other demands, but he did not receive it, or, as he says, the answer was unsatisfactory. The Strikes Are Dying Down The "S" head announced that the strikes would be continued. "It is not a matter of fighting during the next days or weeks but months. In the fall, price increases will be the most numerous, which will cause an outbreak of strikes," stated Krzaklewski. Earlier statements by "S" leaders suggested that, if the talks with the government failed, one should expect, if not an escalation of protests, at least their continuation. During their session, most KK members were unanimous in saying that the entire action and the talks with the government held so far were not a spectacular success. "The strikes made it possible to regulate the legal status of the Trilateral Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs and the issue of the representativeness of unions," said Maciej Jankowski. The Mazowsze leader, who is said to be the greatest radical, admitted that strikes were dying down and that "today there is not a good atmosphere for strikes." Similar views were expressed by other KK members. "The union has regained a good position in society. The protest should be continued; we should fight for public support. We should keep pointing to the discrepancies between preelection declarations and the activities of the government coalition. In the fall, price increases will be most numerous; this is when a wave of strikes will surge. Let us use this time to collect strike funds," appealed Jacek Rybicki, of Gdansk. According to "S" Spokesman Piotr Zak, it was finally decided that the protest action would not be discontinued; but, at the same time, no serious strikes should be expected. He announced street demonstrations and "a major propaganda campaign." The fundamental goal is still collecting money for the strike fund. Most of the "S" decisionmakers believe that a meeting with President Lech Walesa is necessary--skeptics believe that only after Walesa defines his intentions, others that cooperation is needed because both Walesa and the union would like the present postcommunist government to step down. There was not much enthusiasm over the recent proposal by Zbigniew Religa; he proposed that the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] become a political representative of "S" in the Sejm. "Many BBWR activists are antiunion," some said. The KK decided that the Sixth National Congress of "S" delegates would be held between 30 June and 2 July in Mielec.
