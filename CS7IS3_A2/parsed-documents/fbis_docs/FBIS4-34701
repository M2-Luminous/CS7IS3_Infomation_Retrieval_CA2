Emisoras Caracol Network has learned that in an operation conducted near the capital -- either in Chia or Cajic -- seven people, including Caraballo, were apprehended. The Army, with the assistance of the National Registrar's Office, is now attempting to confirm whether the captured individual is indeed Caraballo. A news conference will be held within the next few hours by the 13th Infantry Brigade to report on the details of this operation. Caraballo, who was active in Cordoba and Antioquia's Uraba region, has long been involved in the EPL's war against Patriotic Unity in Uraba. He is Fidel Castano's No. 1 enemy and, we reiterate, one of the Colombian Army's most wanted guerrillas.
