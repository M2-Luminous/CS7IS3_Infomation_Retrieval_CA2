This year, China will mainly work on 10 major railway projects and is now planning three other railway projects. In an interview with this staff reporter yesterday, Wang Chengzhi, an official of the Planning Department of China's Ministry of Railways, said that this year, the central authorities have allocated over 40 billion yuan to the Ministry of Railways for new investment plans, some 10 billion yuan more than last year. Moreover, the funds are for key state guaranteed projects. The central authorities have given "military decrees" to Baotou, Anshan, and Panzhi, the three large iron and steel corporations charging them with the task of producing millions of tons of tracks and supplying them for use in the Beijing-Kowloon railway, which stretches some 2,538 kilometers. Moreover, additional track will be procured from abroad. China's 10 major railway projects are: The Beijing-Kowloon railway (which connects to Kowloon), the Baoji-Zhongwei (Shaanxi's Baoji-Ningxia's Zhongwei) railway, the Lan-Xin (Gansu's Wuwei-Xinjiang's Urumqi) railway, the electric railway project for the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Nanning-Kunming railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi double-track (Hangzhou-Zhuzhou section) railway, the Beijing-Guangzhou railway expansion project, the Hou-Yue (Shanxi's Houma-Henan's Yueshan) railway, the Xian-Ankang railway, and the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway. Wang said: In addition to that, the Ministry of Railways is planning to build a 710-km railway from Nanjing to Wuhan along the Chang Jiang. There are already railways in both Nanjing and Wuhan, but between them is only the 237-km railway along the banks of the Chang Jiang from Anhui's Tongling to Jiangxi's Jiujiang. Therefore, the state has recently approved building of a new railway along the Chang Jiang. He said: The project on the Nanjing-Wuhan railway, which runs along the Chang Jiang, is expected to be started next year and put into operation by 1998. At that time, the railway will link the Beijing-Shanghai, the Anhui-Jiangxi, the Beijing-Kowloon, and the Beijing-Guangzhou railways, and will shorten the current railway transportation mileage between Wuhan and Shanghai by over 200 km and alleviate the increasingly heavy sea transportation along the Chang Jiang. Wang said: The Ministry of Railways also plans to build two special passenger railways running between Beijing and Shanghai and between Shenyang and Qinhuangdao. The Beijing-Shanghai route will stretch for 1,460 kilometers and entail an investment of 70 billion yuan, and the Shenyang-Qinhuangdao route will stretch for 430 kilometers and entail an investment of over 10 billion yuan. There are plans to use foreign capital for the two routes.
