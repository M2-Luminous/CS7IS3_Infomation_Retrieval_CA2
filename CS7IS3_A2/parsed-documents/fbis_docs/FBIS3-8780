SRI investigations conducted thus far "indicate that this institution has not been and is not involved in the mass media dissemination of the respective materials" (materials published by the ROMANIA MARE weekly, which contained accusations of espionage for foreign secret services -- our editorial note). However, as the report points out, the guilt has been passed onto certain former employees of the counterespionage or foreign intelligence services. In conclusion, the SRI report stresses that "after studying and examining the materials published in ROMANIA MARE, it has been ascertained that certain data sent to legal consumers were the basis of articles published by Corneliu Vadim Tudor [owner and chief editor of ROMANIA MARE weekly]"; consequently, the documents were not appropriated from SRI archives, but were lost en route from one institution to another.
