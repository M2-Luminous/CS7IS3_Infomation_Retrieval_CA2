Such hopes are not groundless given the stable position of the dinar and stagnant prices, Dragoslav Avramovic, the governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, said today at the "TANJUG's Guest" panel. Hard currency reserves have gone up by about 450 million German marks in the past 100-odd days. One third of this amount has been earmarked for the importation of necessities and what is missing on the market. These goods, Avramovic says, will arrive soon, thus changing the ratio of supply and demand. "Instead of reducing the hard currency reserves we have registered their increase, something that confirms our belief that the best way has been chosen in these difficult circumstances. In spite of the severe embargo we are outmaneuvering the unprecedented and unjust sanctions by relying on our creativity. ``There is no reason whatever to devalue the dinar. Production is on the rise while every issued dinar is covered by hard currency or goods. [passage omitted] Despite predictions, when sanctions are lifted, Avramovic believes, our position will not be untenable because we will have a great deal to offer to the world market -- textiles, footwear, meat, and all the other goods that proved successful abroad in the past. ``We have done everything possible in today's circumstances to facilitate the country's speedy recovery. We started with a 200 million U.S. dollar hard currency reserve with the provision that the National Bank of Yugoslavia could borrow 300 million U.S. dollars. This, in addition to the measures of fiscal policy and eliminating the budget deficit, will be yet another impetus for reviving production, public works, and suchlike." [passage omitted] The initial successes in curbing the rate of inflation and our economic difficulties have already impressed the world, the blockade has practically been breached. These days it is evident that foreign reporters are constantly interested in our present and future moves, Avramovic said. Of course, not all our problems have been solved. The key remains -- a strong dinar based on the recovery of the economy. Some things, such as development plans and others, disappeared from our practices in the past. Some of these institutions, Avramovic maintains, should be reintroduced and we should proceed along the conventional path. We should not fear credits geared to the reviving of production, particularly so if their price is realistic. This in itself obliterates the fear of increased production being stranded in an allegedly small market. The National Bank governor categorically says that a large number of products would find their niche in the market, even in today's circumstances, and even more so if national income goes up by 100 percent in a certain period of time. ``For example, of the 1.5 million cars on our roads at least half of them should be replaced because of their age. This is enough to keep Zastava [automobile producer] busy for another 10 years." [passage omitted]
