And the PMEs [Small and Medium-Sized Business(es)] are invited to "do their shopping there." How to fettle an octagonally shaped porcelain plate, automatically. The problem might appear trivial. But engineers of the CEA's robotics unit at Fontenay-aux-Roses (Hauts de Seine) did not consider it beneath them to work away at it. And at the end of a few months, they proposed a solution to Jammet Seignoles, the small Limousin-based company (30 million francs[Fr] in annual revenue, 100 employees), which had posed the problem. "We dealt with persons who knew very little about ceramics, but who knew how to think, and they came up with a method that has the merit of being very simple," says Henri Seignoles, CEO [chief executive officer] of the company. A prototype, built by Cerlim, satisfied the principal condition of the specifications: the ability to fettle an octagonally-shaped plate with facets of unequal lengths, a task that is beyond the capability of present-day machines. Other examples could be cited in which PMEs have found within the CEA laboratories the capabilities they otherwise lacked. But until just recently, it was up to the companies to find a way to access this reservoir of know-how. A far from productive method of proceeding, in the view of the CEA. "We decided to invert the procedure and to reach out to industry ourselves with a view to evaluating its needs," says Alain Bugat, director of advanced technologies, the CEA department responsible for the dissemination of technologies to the industrial sector. A dozen or so engineers from the different research centers have been placed on detached service with the regional delegations of the ANVAR [National Agency for the Development and Commercialization of Research]. This week, on 3 November, in keeping with this policy, the CEA is opening 11 of its research centers, including certain military laboratories, to industrial firms. Each of these centers will offer its know-hows in a specific domain: ceramics for the Bruyeres-le-Chatel (Essonne), lasers for Limeil (Val-de-Marne), microelectronics for Grenoble (Isere), etc. Enterprises interested in a technology can take advantage of this policy in several ways. Through a simple consultation or a full-fledged expert evaluation procedure. Two years ago, for example, the Trefilerie des Vosges company, specializing in the manufacture of rails for miniature trains, sought to acquire a Japanese license for an alloy used in the manufacture of eyeglasses and jewelry. The company requested a study by a CEA laboratory in Saclay (Essonne). It was well that it did: The alloy in question was found to be too prone to oxidation. Another example: Inoteb, a small Bretagne-based company, specializing in osseous prostheses, called upon the CEA's analytic capabilities (gamma radiography, radioactive tracing) to track the recolonization of prostheses by bone, in a living organism. The CEA's assistance can go further. Sodeva, a PME based in Annemasse (Haute-Savoie), requested the aid of the Grenoble center in developing an ultrasonic sprayer-drier. "We had the know-how in the technology of power ultrasonics, and the CEA had the know-how in spraying-and-drying technology," says Dominique Dubruque, the CEO of the small company (four persons). The company sold four systems, one of them in the food industry field. For Sart, an enterprise with 75 employees and an annual revenue of Fr50 million, located in Noisy-le-Grand (Seine-Saint-Denis), collaboration with the CEA took the form of a joint study that led to the cession of a patent. This PME, specializing in the manufacture of gate valves, flap valves, flowmeters, etc..., was asked, early on, to develop magnetically-closed safety valves, based on a CEA idea (under the Tore Supra project). It is now the proprietor of a patent, and pays the CEA a royalty on each valve it sells. Its principal client is currently the CERN [European Nuclear Research Center], which has a requirement for 2,600 valves. And shortly, Sart hopes to add the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company.
