FR941216-2-00164 FR941216-2-00093 Whether some SOES activist volume merely shifted to one of the many alternative execution systems following the January 1994 SOES changes or whether some trading activities ceased because they were only profitable in a regulatory environment with higher market-maker exposure requirements has not been determined. Some traders apparently have resumed using SOES at the 500 share level even with the lower exposure limits. This is suggested by the fact that the SOES average trade size continues above the mid-1988 level and the decline in the number of SOES trades was much less than the decline in SOES share volume. SOES activist traders generally trade in the maximum order size permitted in SOES. Displayed Quotation Spreads Displayed Quotation Spreads declined in the six months following the January 31 SOES changes. The improvement in displayed spreads 9 is evident in the pattern of average bid/ask spreads of the largest NNM stocks (see Chart 3). Average spreads of the largest 500 NNM stocks, those most affected by SOES trading, appear flat immediately following the SOES changes; but they then decline sharply (see Chart 4) as market makers became aware of the lower risks involved in moving their displayed spreads closer to the actual trade-to-trade price changes that were occurring in the order-driven segments of the market. The first sharp decline in spreads is evident between the April 28 and May 12 sample days (see Chart 4). A second sharp break occurred between the June 23 and July 18 sample days. However spreads appear to be narrowing throughout the post-SOES change period. 9 Measure of spread used is the average of the observed market displayed spread each time a trade occurs. Confirmation of the improvement in displayed quotation is the proportion of share volume occurring in stocks with closing displayed bid/ask spreads of one-quarter or less. The percentage of volume accounted for by such stocks fluctuated around 61 percent until May 1994, when it rose to 62.5 percent, another clear indication that spreads were tightening (see Table 1). It rose further to 65.6 percent in June, to 66.2 percent in July, and to 68.7 percent by September. Additional supporting information, in Charts 5 and 6, shows SOES average trade size and the number and percentage of NNM stocks with end-of-day quotation spreads less than 50 cents. SOES average trade size reflects the entry and activity of SOES activist traders. Firms effecting proprietary trades through SOES caused the average to rise briefly in 1988, but SOES volume attributable to individual traders active in SOES started in 1989 and expanded until January 1994. A major decline in the percentage of NNM stocks with end-of-month spreads less than 50 cents per share is apparent as SOES traders took advantage of the mid-1988 institution of the 5,000-share minimum exposure limit for SOES active stocks. An uptrend in that percentage has emerged following the January reduction in market-maker exposure minimums. To examine further these quotation spread patterns, regressions were prepared using NNM stocks grouped by various characteristics. The regressions controlled for market factor influences on spread including volume, stock price, and intra-day price volatility. A dummy variable (0,1) was used to reflect the periods before (0) and after (1) the SOES changes. Regressions were run using all NNM stocks, the largest 500 NNM stocks, 1,000- share tier, 500-share tier and 200-share tier stocks and stocks with a proportionate decline in SOES activity after the January 1994 changes. These regressions confirm that spreads narrowed in the six months following the SOES changes for all groups of stocks except for those stocks in the 500- and 200-tier categories, even after controlling for volume, price and intra-day price volatility. For the 500-and 200-tier groups the before and after changes overall were not statistically significant. A negative beta coefficient for the dummy variable indicates a decrease in spreads from the period before the changes to the periods after the SOES changes. For the first three months after the changes, the beta coefficient for the dummy variable is generally negative but statistically insignificant. However, by the second three-month period the coefficients were negative and statistically significant for all NNM stocks, the 1,000 share tier group and the largest 500 group, indicating that quotation spreads were indeed narrowing. Because SOES volume for the largest 500 NNM stocks represents 65 percent to 75 percent of the total SOES volume, the significance of the statistical results is critical for this group. Successive regressions then were for the largest 500 group using for each stock the average of the pre-change days, and separately the average for each of the post-change days to observe changes in the beta coefficient of the dummy variable. The negative value of beta depicts a negative difference between the pre-change average spreads and the post-change individual day observation sets for every day in the post-change period. Beta coefficients are negative for each day and statistically significant for each day except for February 17, April 14, April 28, and May 26, 1994. It is clear that the changes is SOES reduced uncontrollable or mandated market-maker risk exposure across all NNM stocks and the changes appear to have resulted in significantly lower spreads for the largest 500 group. Volatility As the SEC pointed out in the release, differentiating between the effects on spreads and stock-price volatility attributable to active SOES traders and the effects attributable to other factors may not be possible. Market volatility, in particular, surges and recedes. This makes exceedingly difficult measurement of temporary impacts on price volatility of unnecessary market-maker risk exposures that provide profitable trading situations to opportunistic traders. It is apparent from the volatility of the various indexes (see Chart 7) that dramatic changes occurred in market volatility during the six months following the SOES changes. The average absolute value of daily percent changes of the Nasdaq Composite Index fluctuates from over 0.03 percent in January 1994 to practically no change in February and March. Then it jumps to nearly 0.07 percent in April. Substantial effort would be required to empirically sort out the effects on volatility of the SOES changes, if indeed it is possible to sort them out. NASD attempts to isolate these effects statistically have not been successful. Nonetheless an analysis was performed of stock volatility distributions on the sample days. Valatilty is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the absolute percent changes in the bid price. A frequency distribution of each stock's bid volatility was constructed for each day in the analysis, and the skewness of these distribution curves was computed. Skewness is a measure that describes to what extent a curve deviates from a normally distributed bell shape. The distribution of stock volatilities is found a contain a smaller right tail in the post-change period than in the pre-change period as evidenced from the declining measure of skewness (see Chart 8). The smaller right tail reflects a smaller percentage of stocks with extreme relative price volatility in the post-change period. Also the measures of dispersion of the individual stock volatilities are smaller for the post-change days. These distributional differences suggest a reduction in relative volatilities in the post-change period. Other Considerations Major improvements, other than the SOES changes in January 1994, are being instituted in Nasdaq trading to enhance market quality. New requirements affecting the handling of customer limit orders were adopted on July 9, 1994; a shore-sale bid test took effect in early September; and the proposed NPROVE system to replace SOES is awaiting SEC action. As a result, identifying the delayed impacts of the SOES changes may not be possible beyond the first few months included here. Conclusion The reduction in the mandatory minimum exposure limits and SOES order sizes, which in turn decrease market-maker risk exposure, clearly have been associated with positive changes in market quality. In particular, displayed spreads have narrowed. More importantly, there is no evidence of negative impacts on market quality.
