There seems to be reason to make this sensitive issue a subject of discussion after the statement issued by our foreign minister on the nuclear program. Even most of the opposition parties have expressed satisfaction over the government's stand that whatever happens the nuclear program will not be rolled back keeping in mind the greater interest of the nation. However, Mian Nawaz Sharif and his followers, just out of their old habit, have made the nuclear program a subject of controversy. According to one sources, the prime minister has directed the president's attention to this issue and told them that all of us have taken the oath to protect national secrets; therefore, we cannot allow open debate over the nuclear program. She added that the noise raised by the opposition is meaningless. The prime minister asked the president since he is the custodian of all national assets including the nuclear program. As the leader of the nation, he should officially remind the opposition leader of the oath which he has also taken. In our opinion, the opposition leader is not a naughty child who should be admonished from unnecessary stubbornness. He knows well that nothing was done about the nuclear program that could have made our government's policy disputable. The present government if following the same policy as formed during Nawaz Sharif's government. The only difference is that the U.S. government has introduced a new amendment in the Congress. This proposed amendment will remove the clause in the Pressler Amendment that was used to stop aid to Pakistan. This amendment will also the give the right to the U.S. President to exempt specific nations from restrictions on U.S. aid that come under the Symington, Clayton, and Solarz amendments, if it is necessary to achieve his foreign policy goals. The U.S. President, however, will make sure that such countries are not involved in terrorism, violating human rights or nuclear proliferation before he grants exemption. This progress is positive from Pakistan's point of view. Perhaps, the opposition leader has concluded from this progress that the prime minister and the U.S. government has some secret agreement, and decided to challenge the government in his ritualistic attitude. He smells some conspiracy and threatens that rivers of blood will flow if the nuclear program is rolled back. Perhaps because of this noise raised by the opposition, it was necessary to warn Pakistan that it should not be deluded to believe that the new legislation will give it freedom to make nuclear weapons.
