However, it has become clear since the war that Russia has made advances in the development of high-tech weapons at a much faster pace than predicted. Sources well versed in international military affairs said: "One of Russia's aims is to obtain foreign currency through the export of high-tech weapons." They also noted that "more fundamentally, the aim is to build up the Army with the long-term in view." The comments are a warning that if Western nations, currently enjoying the post-Cold War peace, neglect research and development, it is possible their high-tech weapons technology will be behind that of Russia 10 years from now. Among Russia's high-tech weapons is the "SU-34 air fighter," dubbed "Russia's miracle," which has been a source of surprise for military analysts in Western nations. The aircraft, which can fly a distance of up to 4,000 km without the need to use reserve fuel, is equipped with a system which makes it possible for the aircraft to skim over terrain and make observations in the way a cruise missile can. A big difference between the SU-34 and conventional Russian military aircraft lies in its "comfort." The cockpit of the SU-34, which is covered with 17-mm-thick bullet-proof glass, is equipped with an air conditioner, a microwave oven, and a toilet. The cockpit is so large that a pilot can stand up and do exercises inside it. It is said that even after flying a distance of 1,000 kilometers, the pilot of an SU-34 feels no fatigue and can immediately go into combat operation. There is also an SU-35 air fighter, which is capable of carrying out the "cobra" maneuver in which the aircraft climbs while flying in circles. Western nations have no aircraft superior to the SU-35, and it is suspected their best planes would lose out in a dogfight against the SU-35. Russia is also expected to put FST-2 and FST-3 tanks into practical use in the late nineties. These tanks carry either a 135-mm or 145-mm gun, larger than the (120-mm) gun carried by Western tanks. It is said that because these tanks are made of "advanced armor plate" such as a ceramic complex armor plate and electromagnetic armor plate, Western tank shells would not be able to penetrate them. Russia is also currently improving and modernizing its SS-25 strategic nuclear missile. It is also developing the SS-X-26 and SS-X-27 missiles. Among Russian-made missiles, the AAML air-to-air missile has drawn much attention because of its long 400 km range. In comparison, U.S. Phoenix missile has a range of only 150 km, the longest among comparable U.S. missiles. With the AAML Russia can attack weapons such as airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, a key command device, from a distance out of firing range. Russian research and development of high-tech weapons covers a wide area. In addition to the aforementioned weapons, it is also energetically developing helicopters, armored vehicles, and firearms. During the period 1991 and 1993, Russia developed 14 new pieces of equipment in nine different weaponry areas. It is said Russia is currently developing about 30 kinds of new weapon over more than 12 areas. It is believed that following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Russia, with the help of Western nations, promoted the conversion of the defense industry to civilian production in preparation for a shift toward a market economy. Nevertheless, Russia has made advances in weapons development. A military expert believes that "because it cannot produce good civilian products, Russia is gradually going back to the development of weapons, which is its strength." He said it should also be noted that "even in the current political and economic confusion, the Russian Army is steadily preparing for 10 years from now."
