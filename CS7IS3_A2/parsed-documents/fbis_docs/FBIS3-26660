"Sino-US trade volume will see double-digit growth over the $27.7 billion in 1993," said Sun Zhenyu, director general of the American & Oceanian Affairs Department at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). As evidence, Sun pointed to a string of positive signs, including the settlement last month of bilateral textile disputes. However, he warned against potential one-sided pressure from the U.S. Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead a delegation of Chinese Government and business leaders to the US in April to promote trade. Apart from attending the eighth session of the Sino-US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, China will hold two large trade conferences in Los Angles and New York, Sun revealed. "Our business delegation will enter into purchase contracts with U.S. businesses and invite them to invest in China during the conferences ," he said. But Sun declined to disclose which sectors are likely to close major deals on imports and investment. In a parallel move, Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, will attend a bilateral conference on scientific co-operation in New York. During Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's recent visit to China, the U.S. has agreed to provide technical help for China's transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented one, which Sun described as an indication of improved relations. However, Sun urged the U.S. to relax its controls on hi-technology exports to help reduce its trade deficit with China. "The U.S. competitive edges on the world markets lie in its hi-tech items," Sun said. "If their exports to China are relaxed, it would be good to both sides." The U.S. claims it had a $23 billion trade deficit with China in 1993, counting Chinese exports via Hong Kong. But Chinese customs put China's surplus at only $6.2 billion. Sun said Minister Wu Yi and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown had agreed to set up a working group to resolve the difference. "Both sides should enhance mutual understanding and resort to consultation on an equal footing so that our co-operation can be strengthened," he said, adding that any unilateral sanctions would be self-defeating. Sun urged better understanding by the U.S. of China's situation regarding intellectual property rights protection, textile trade and other issues. "And it's unreasonable to link human rights with trade issues, such as the extension of the most-favoured-nation (MFN) status," he asserted. "We must get rid of the long shadow cast by the MFN issue, which has hampered what could have been a quicker development of bilateral trade." If settled once and for all, Sun explained, U.S. businesses, especially those of medium and small size, could draw up long-term strategies towards the Chinese market. "But if the U.S. should revoke MFN for China, it would deal a blow to the entire course of China's reforms and opening to the outside world and cause equal damage to the U.S. investors," he said. Sun also urged the U.S. to keep its promise of giving China "staunch support" in resuming its membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The U.S. will send a delegation to China this month for further negotiations on this matter.
