On the contrary, it seems that upon entering Nicaragua's polluted air both gentlemen lost their sense of direction and started speaking erratically that, at least for this observer, has created more confusion than hope. We do not know if this is a common situation, but we cannot help commenting on the fact that Watson referred to the Sandinists as "a legally constituted political party" in Nicaragua. In other words, he came to give us old news. In reality, Sandinism has been legal for a long time, so long that it is legally registered, it has definite legal representation, and has lost 2 to 1 in the electoral field since 1984. In other words, it has lost two elections and won one, and in that one it did not have a real contender. Mr. Watson is gone, and we do not know why he came to give us that kind of news. When he tried to take the bull by the horns, it was disastrous. General Humberto Ortega was bold enough to tell him to his face that he will not tolerate another situation like 2 September 1993, when the legitimate Nicaraguan President, Violeta de Chamorro, hinted, not ordered, that she would like Gen. Ortega to resign in 1994. In other words, Gen. Ortega discounted the top civilian authority in the country in front of Mr. Watson. Ortega, who had already insolently rejected President Chamorro's suggestion, now clearly repeated his response to the State Department. Those who live on illusions say that Gen. Ortega already knows he must leave and that he was just bragging in front of the Yankees. Frankly, it is difficult to be that optimistic. Ortega is not an actor, and as things stand now, he could very well resign in 1994 but then again he may not. Having given the people's representation to the National Assembly to the Sandinists, Ortega could even become a presidential candidate, with his general stars and all. There is no real obstacle to that if he decided to become Nicaragua's dictator. Those who sold the people's electoral victory in 1990 would not be able to stop him because they did not stop him in 1990 when they should have. We thought Camdessus came to sign a document entitled ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], which requires no translation, but according to experts is the last hope for the country's economy even though it includes a tremendous increase in the severe tax system confronting Nicaraguans. Camdessus, however, came to tell us that the ESAF would not be signed in March as the government expected, but maybe in June. What is ESAF? Apparently, large sums of money obtained through long-term credits at very low interest rates. The surprising part was that Camdessus, who apparently knows nothing about Nicaragua either, also came to tell us that we have already asked for too much and to tell us that "we must save." Save what? White collar workers are burdened with taxes, can barely cover their needs, and have nothing left to save. As for blue collar workers, they not only lack the funds to save; they have no jobs to survive. Although some economic sectors have managed to save some money, they did it during better days and they are firmly protecting those funds so as to avoid falling in the complete depression that lays ahead should the ESAF not be signed and Gen. Ortega decides to ignore the calls to submit his retirement, both valid possibilities. In other words, Mr. Watson and Mr. Camdessus came here, very deferentially, to tell us that the Sandinist party is a legitimate party and that we should save. That is really impossible. The only way we as a nation could start saving is by implementing drastic reductions in the country's costly Armed Forces, which is headed by Gen. Ortega, who does not want to resign. As some friends once told Cardinal Miguel Obando, it would seem there are no solutions for Nicaragua's problems. At that time, the cardinal said that despite everything, we must all continue to pray for Nicaragua. That is all we have left.
