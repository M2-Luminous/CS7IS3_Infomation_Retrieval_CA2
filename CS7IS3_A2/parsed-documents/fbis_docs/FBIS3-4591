North Korea issued visas for the seven-man team through its embassy in Vienna Saturday after a series of negotiations with the United States on a compromise deal. Pyongyang was to allow unrestricted IAEA access to its seven declared facilities and hold working-level talks with Seoul on an exchange of presidential envoys. In return, Washington agreed to suspend this year's "Team Spirit" military exercise held jointly with Seoul and to conduct high-level talks with North Korea next month. The IAEA inspectors will arrive in Beijing on Monday and reach Pyongyang on Tuesday. They will spend about two weeks checking the seven installations and another three to four weeks producing inspection reports. The last full-scale inspection in North Korea took place in January last year. Checks since then have been restricted to replacement of batteries and film in monitoring devices.
