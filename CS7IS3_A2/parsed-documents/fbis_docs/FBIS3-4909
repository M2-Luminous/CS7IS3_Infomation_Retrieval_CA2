The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 1 March carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial urging the ROK Government to be prudent in enforcing its policy toward North Korea. The editorial reports that the North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys will encounter many difficulties, noting the fact that North Korea failed to respond immediately to our side's proposal to hold the contact and that it has bitterly denounced President Kim Yong-sam's 25 February new conference. The editorial notes that "such an attitude by North Korea, though an hackneyed one, may be a tactical trick designed to lead the contact favorably." The editorial continues that, nevertheless, our government's attitude toward the upcoming North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys gives the impression that it has forgotten such a hackneyed attitude of North Korea. The editorial stresses that "negotiations require strategies and tactics," and advises that the government use adequate negotiating cards in the upcoming working- level contact. The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "We Should Be Hasty in Dealing With the North-South Issue." Noting that North Korea is actually interested mainly in talks with the United States, not in North-South dialogue, the editorial urges the government to be prudent and not to show the North Korean side a hasty attitude in the course of the upcoming North-South working-level contact. Citing the difficulties in dealing with the North-South issue and North Korea's cunning tactics, the editorial concludes: "We should not repeat our past mistakes in the upcoming North-South dialogue. We need to learn from past lessons with modesty." The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Oppose Unsubstantial Exchange of Special Envoys." Stressing that the realization of the exchange of special envoys depends entirely on North Korea's sincerity, the editorial reports that the prospect of the exchange of special envoys is not so bright because North Korea has reluctantly accepted the North-South working-level contact with the aim of suspending the Team Spirit military exercise and holding a third round of U.S.- North Korean talks. The editorial continues that if the exchange of special envoys is realized without producing substantial agreements, it will be meaningless and will not be conducive to easing tension on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, the editorial stresses that our government should adhere to and achieve the precondition it has put forth, that is, the realization of simultaneous inspections in the North and the South. In conclusion, the editorial stresses that the government should cancel its plan to announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise at an early date and, at the same time, should make efforts so that the United States refuses to hold a third round of talks with North Korea in case North Korea shows an insincere attitude at the upcoming North-South working-level contact. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries on page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "There is No Short Cut to the Settlement of the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The editorial welcomes North Korea's acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, nuclear inspection. The editorial stresses that if North Korea's nuclear transparency is to be firmly guaranteed and the upcoming North-South contact is to start off on the right foot, there will be many barriers to overcome. The editorial, however, warns that the IAEA inspection is just the beginning and that we should not expect much. The editorial urges the government to act prudently in the negotiations with North Korea and not to tread upon thin air -- believing that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspection is the realization of the normalization of North-South relations. In conclusion the editorial emphasizes that we should clearly present our demands to North Korea and keenly grasp North Korea's strategies toward South Korea in order to avoid becoming entangled in them. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Expecting Productive North-South Dialogue." The editorial analyzes that the delay in the North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys is due to North Korea's indifference to dialogue with the South. The editorial stresses that "ROK is the only country in the world that can quickly and accurately provide North Korea with what it needs desperately, including food, energy, economic aid, and even active support in the improvement of relations with the United States and Japan." The editorial reports our side's delegate to the contact should convey this point to North Korea because past dialogues were only superficial and each side had different objectives. The editorial hopes such mistakes will not be repeated so that the exchange of special envoys will be realized soon for a more productive dialogue in the consequent North-South summit talks. SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by Yang Sung-hyon summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of the 25 February agreement. The editorial reports the game cannot be won one-sidedly as Foreign Minister Han said: "It is not a zero-sum game but a nonzero-sum game." The article explains that "the two sides' goals of the nuclear negotiations are not necessarily conflicting but complementary." The editorial continues that North Korea did not "win" the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, which the ROK and the United States had little intention to continue as they did not include it in their budgets for this year, but used the suspension to convince North Korea to accept the inspections. The article contends that all sides desired the third-round talks. The article reports, however, North Korea did not lose everything because it has succeeded in obtaining written promises to suspend the Team Spirit exercise and to resume the third-round talks in return for North-South working-level contacts, which it can suspend anytime with trifle excuses. The article adds that the exchange of special envoys was not mentioned in the agreement and nuclear inspections were defined to only provide assurance of the continuity of safeguards, thus North Korea still has the initiative on this subject. The article concludes the score is ROK and the United States, 55; North Korea, 45. The pro-government HANGYORE SINMUN on 2 March carries on page 2 a 1,400-word article by Kang Tae-ho and Yi Sang-ki on the delay of the North-South working-level contact. The article analyzes there are two reasons for the delay: one, because the ROK Ministry of National Defense postponed the announcement to suspend the Team Spirit exercise to the afternoon of 1 March to coincide with the arrival of the IAEA inspection team in North Korea; second, because North Korea misinterpreted "the resumption of working-level contact" as "agreement on the resumption," not "actual holding of working-level contact." The article expresses optimism because North Korea showed a different attitude by saying "the exchange of special envoys is an urgent task that cannot be delayed" in its telephone message. Therefore, the article expects it will not be very difficult to reach a compromise on the follow-up steps, including the methods of the exchange and the duties of special envoys. The article concludes that the government should be prepared for North Korea's additional demands to suspend other military exercises, including the Ulchi exercise.
