Especially in times rife with economic problems the "council of researchers" gains added importance. The Institute of World Economics (IfW) in Kiel is Germany's oldest economic research institute and probably the best known internationally. Whenever Horst Siebert cannot think of anything new he looks out the window. The view is stimulating indeed: from the second floor of the former Imperial Yacht Club one can see large tankers and small yachts go by on Kiel's Foerde. Since April 1989 Siebert, an economics professor, has headed the Kiel Institute of World Economics, the oldest economic research institute in Germany and perhaps the best known internationally. In the almost five years since Siebert took over from his predecessor, Herbert Giersch, the annual reports have been getting more voluminous and the number of researchers has increased from 75 to 92. Siebert himself, who both heads the IfW and holds a professorship of economics at Kiel University, is viewed as one of the first social scientists to treat economic and enviromental issues as a unit. In addition, numerous publications of his have been devoted to international economic relations and foreign trade. In the past four years the IfW has shifted the focus of its research on the economic side of German unification as well as on the question of how planned economies can be turned into market economies and be integrated into the world market. From time to time as many as 20 researchers in different IfW departments are working on various aspects of this historic transformation, Siebert says. The media accused him in this connection of "muscling in everywhere." But that does not faze the 55-year-old professor who has also been a member of the council of experts for the assessment of overall economic development since 1991. Of course "we jumped on this issue," says Siebert, who has written a book entitled Das Wagnis der Einheit--Eine wirtschaftspolitische Therapie [The Risk of Unification--An Economic Policy Therapy]. Scientists have to be enthusiasts because "one simply does not move without an impetus." What is more, "we are in the midst of competition and look upon new issues as challenges." The public sector is the IfW's principal client. The Economics Ministry in Bonn alone commissioned research studies in 1993 worth 1.287 million German marks (DM). Some of these studies will occupy the researchers until 1995. In addition to collaborating on joint research projects which six different institutions prepare each spring and fall the IfW is working on the "Main Report Within the Framework of Reporting on Structure" which the institutes submit in annual rotation. At the end of 1993, the IfW produced the ninth report on "Overall Economic and Managerial Progress in Adaptation in Eastern Germany" in collaboration with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin and the Institute for Economic Research in Halle (IWH), the 1992 successor to the East Berlin Institute for Applied Economic Research. From the middle of 1993 to the middle of 1995 these reports will cost the economics minister DM1.535 million. DM625,200 of the total will go to the IfW, DM645,000 to the DIW, and DM264,700 to the IWH. It was not the institutes themselves, Siebert says, that wanted to collaborate but the express wish of the Economics Ministry. The "basic idea, however, was that they should compete with one another," he adds. Aside from the government, the institute receives major funding from foundations, e.g. from the Bertelsmann Foundation which has commissioned a multiyear study on "the future outlook for the social market economy." As part of the study the institute's researchers are investigating issues such as ethics and the marketplace, international rules on competition, management, and motivation as well as the connections between the ecology and the economics of the marketplace. "The project hopes to determine how the market economy will legitimize itself in the future in view of the fact that the collapse of the socialist planned economies has robbed it of its counterpart," Siebert says. The aim is to find out what incentives will be required in the future in order to maintain the efficiency of the market economy in the absence of competition with the planned economy model. The Volkswagen Foundation has commissioned a study of eastern Central Europe and the Baltic region. The EU commission has also become one of the institute's major clients. This part of the institute's business can still be expanded, Siebert says. The IfW's well-known critical stand on protectionist trends and a rapid monetary integration of the EU places more or less natural limits on expanded cooperation with Brussels, he adds. In 1993, the studies commissioned by the Economics Ministry, land ministries, foundations, and the EU have earned the IfW DM4.12 million. Given a total budget of DM29.7 million, this adds up to a third-client quotient of 14 percent. Compared to other institutes--particularly to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich--this is a very small ratio. Basic subsidies from the Economics Ministry last year amounted to DM11.377 million. The institute received the same amount from the land government of Schleswig-Holstein. The IfW spends a good two-fifths of its budget on the Central Library of Economics--an added expense but more than worth it from the standpoint of prestige. The IfW library numbering almost 2.3 volumes and occupying about 25 miles of shelf space is the most important economics library in Germany. It also contains Econis, a 500,000-title database on economics literature. The IfW grew out of the political science seminar of Kiel University. In 1914, Prof Bernhard Harms founded the IfW under the then-name of "Koenigliches Institut fuer Seeverkehr und Weltwirtschaft" [Royal Institute for Maritime Affairs and World Economy]. In the twenties, the inflation-plagued citizens of Kiel referred to it merely as "sehr verkehrte Weltwirtschaft" [the "upside-down world economy" institute]. Today, the IfW has a staff of 341, of whom 120 work in the institute's five research departments: growth and structural policy, resource economics, regional and transportation economics, developing countries and world economy, economic trends. The institute's regular publications include KIELER STUDIEN [KIEL STUDIES], WELTWIRTSCHAFTLICHES ARCHIV [ARCHIVES OF WORLD ECONOMY], DIE WELTWIRTSCHAFT [WORLD ECONOMY], and KIELER DISKUSSIONSBEITRAEGE [KIEL DISCUSSION PAPERS]. For the past 10 years the institute has been offering a one-year advanced study program in international economic policy research for young economists. The faculty is made up primarily of practical economists of international standing. The entire program is conducted in English. Some of the graduates stay on at the IfW, Siebert says. "But the World Bank grabs them up so fast and we can't compete with it."
