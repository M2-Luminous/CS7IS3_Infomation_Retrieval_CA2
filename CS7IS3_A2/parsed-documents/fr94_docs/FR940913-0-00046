FR940913-0-00046 FR940913-0-00015 To determine point source emissions, the IEPA used permit-based data from the State's Emission Inventory System (EIS) for all process emission sources in the ozone nonattainment areas and for major sources located within 25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas. This data base provided current documentation of the facility-specific and source type-specific emissions for all facilities with VOC, NO X , or CO emissions to an accuracy of 0.1 pounds per hour. Data obtained from the EIS were cross-referenced with data from other databases, such as USEPA's Toxic Release Information System (TRIS) and the Illinois Manufacturers Directory to assure data accuracy and completeness of source coverage. Potentially missing sources were identified and were contacted concerning their ozone precursor emissions. The point source portions of the emission inventories contain detailed facility-specific emission listings at the source segment level as well as facility emission totals. All facilities emitting VOC, NO X , or CO at an actual rate of 10 tons per year or more are covered in the point source emission listings (many facilities with lower emissions are also included). Emissions were calculated using techniques outlined in the approved IPP and included the use of emission factors obtained from stack tests, the AP&hyph;42 Compilation of Air Pollution Emission Factors, and other publications containing current emission factors. The point source inventory detailed listings identify the emission factors, source activity levels or throughputs, operating schedules, and control equipment efficiencies used for each facility and source segment. All emissions were adjusted in the facility emission totals to reflect weekday emissions for the June through August period. Where covered by emission controls, total facility emissions were adjusted to account for rule effectiveness and rule penetration. Sources subject to controls with emission control efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent were covered by facility-specific rule effectiveness studies. For these facilities, rule effectiveness values determined through the studies were applied to the facility emissions. For those facilities with emission control efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent but not covered specifically in the rule effectiveness studies, a median rule effectiveness level of 92.1 percent was assumed. For all other facilities, a default rule effectiveness of 80 percent was assumed. Using guideline emission profiles, the State has adjusted emissions to exclude compounds considered by the USEPA to be nonreactive. Area source emissions were calculated using a variety of information sources and guidance from the USEPA. Where appropriate, point source emissions have been subtracted from the calculated area source emissions to account for source coverage overlap between the point source emissions and the area source emissions and to avoid double counting of emissions. For all source categories covered by emission control regulations, the IEPA has assumed a rule effectiveness level of 80 percent where sources are covered by emission control regulations. To estimate the area source emissions, the IEPA primarily relied on the USEPA guidance documents, Procedures for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volumes I and II, EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;016 and EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;014, May 1991. The documentation of the area source emissions covers the techniques used for each source category. Sample calculations are given for each source category and input data are documented for each source category by county. The data are well documented in both hard copy and in computer data files submitted as additional documentation. On-road mobile source emissions were calculated using USEPA's Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources and USEPA's MOBILE5a emission factor model. Weekday average Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and speed data by roadway link were obtained by the IEPA from the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) for the Chicago urban area and from the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council (EWGCC) for the Metro-East St. Louis urban area. These VMT and speed data were produced by the application of transportation models in these urban areas. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) provided VMT data by county and roadway type for the roadways outside of the urban areas and for roadways in the urban areas not covered by the transportation models. The VMT data have been quality assured by comparison of modelled roadway link traffic levels with current traffic counts (the IDOT VMT estimates were derived directly from current traffic counts). All VMT data supplied by CATS, EWGCC, and IDOT were adjusted, based on monthly traffic data, to reflect VMT levels during the peak ozone season. To determine speeds for roadways not covered by the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation models, the IEPA developed tables of speeds by roadway type based on the averages of speeds by roadway types derived in the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation models. Speeds for both congested periods and for noncongested periods were considered in the calculation of average day emission levels. The IEPA, based on hourly averaged traffic data, assumed that 75 percent of the daily VMT occurred at congested period speeds and that 25 percent of the daily VMT occurred during noncongested periods. It should be noted that the vehicle speeds were generated by the traffic models rather than generated independently as inputs to the traffic models. The IEPA has reviewed the speed assignments by roadway type and county and asserts that the speeds generated by the model are conceptually sound and are viewed as being quality assured.
