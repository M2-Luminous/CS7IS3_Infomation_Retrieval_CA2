Dr Marengwa, the PAC's premier candidate for the North West, said the "electoral national fiasco" had been caused by the inefficiency of the PAC head office. "I therefore call for an immediate national congress of the PAC to correct the ills. In the PAC certain heads must roll." Dr Marengwa would not elaborate on the nature of the inefficiency or the party members he was criticising. "That would be undemocratic," he told SAPA. "There is a national conference planned for December, but we think this is too long a time to wait. It must be brought forward. I have sounded out other leaders and I believe I will have support for the call to have an immediate congress. We need to make adjustments. This has to be thrashed out." Dr Ben Marengwa said he wanted to thank the 27,000 who voted PAC in the North West, and the 243,000 voters "out of a membership of more than a million who loyally voted PAC nationally".
