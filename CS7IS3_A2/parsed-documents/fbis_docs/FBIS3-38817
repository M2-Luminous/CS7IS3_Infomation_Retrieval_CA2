Raffaele Costa, Minister Raffaele Costa, is to open the 22d Italian Liberal Party [PLI] Congress today by suggesting no less than a renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty. "I will challenge the European Community -- now the European Union -- over its bureaucratic and welfarist approach," Costa revealed in this interview with IL GIORNALE, "and demand that the treaty be renegotiated and its implementation reviewed." [Guiglia] Is there still a Liberal Party? [Costa] There are many Liberals. Many more than voted for the PLI in the last election. I think that is what really counts. [Guiglia] Are you not afraid that the PLI will end up splitting like the PRI [Italian Republican Party], albeit in choosing between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni? [Costa] The Liberals are in a very different situation from the PRI. None of us has gone as far as to question liberal-democratic values. Among the Republicans there are those who have no qualms about hitching up with the grouping Communist Renewal is a part of. Frankly, I think that is a bit excessive. [Guiglia] De Luca is offering himself as a candidate for secretary. Will you step down? [Costa] I resigned from the post of secretary general a few months ago. In the past few days De Luca has made no secret of the fact that he is prepared to take on the job. I find that a remarkably courageous gesture at a time like this. We will see what the congress thinks about it. [Guglia] What has the PLI done to erase the memory of [former Health Minister] De Lorenzo? [Costa] The ombudsman's office, that was reestablished last summer after I took office, has gathered information from hundreds and hundreds of citizens, for months, on the inefficiency of the bureaucracy. We have listened to everybody. We have also been able to help some stand up for their rights. But that is not all: The overall picture that we have presented to the Italians is one of a party of honest people. [Guiglia] You are in your fifth parliamentary term. Do you feel part of the so-called "new vanguard"? [Costa] A mere two years ago, I appeared to be a sort of Don Quixote tilting at windmills. All of a sudden I find myself surrounded by illustrious people who appear to be discovering only now that the civil service is inefficient, wasteful, and arrogant. In 1992, I set up an inquiry into the 4 trillion lire development cooperation [Foreign Ministry department] affair. Everything is now in the hands of the magistracy, but at the time it was as if nobody wanted to acknowledge what was going on. [IL Guiglia] Will Segni continue to waver or has he settled down? [Costa] I would like to see him take one more small step toward establishing a moderate grouping. [Guiglia] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi, Berlusconi or [National Alliance leader] Fini -- which one would you choose for prime minister? [Costa] Berlusconi has shown himself to be a capable helmsman in a stormy sea. Bossi has exceptional insight, he knows what people want. Fini would have made an excellent mayor of Rome. [IL Guiglia] What issues could unite the moderates? [Costa] Privatization, deregulation, and the abolition of bureaucracy. [Guiglia] Do you accept the sanction opposed by the League against Liberal Party member Sterpa? [Costa] I have never heard of any sanction of that sort. [Guiglia] Liberal Party member Zanone intends to run for election in Turin. Will you vote for him? [Costa] Zanone has been moving down a different path from that of the Liberals for some time now. I do not see why our paths should cross again, now of all times. [Guiglia] Is it still possible to prevent Occhetto from reaching the Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]? [Costa] It depends. If those who claim they oppose him manageed to adopt a more open-minded attitude and ceased their futile arguing, we could succeed. The team we can count on now is already very good. [Guiglia] If it is to win, does the moderate grouping have to conquer the north or the center-south? [Costa] It has to convince the majority of Italians. And I would suggest that we are already a fair way along the road to success. How many Italians do you think want to see Italy turn into the last paradise of real socialism.
