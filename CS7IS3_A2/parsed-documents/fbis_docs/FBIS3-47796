The coalition was poised Wednesday night to vote on the package at the House of Councillors Special Committee on Political Reform. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said his party will not resume talks with the coalition Wednesday over possible revisions of the package. Eleventh-hour talks between the coalition and LDP took place earlier in the day in an attempt to compromise on LDP demands to modify the bills. The talks involved Juro Saito, chief of the LDP's House of Councillors members, Manso Hamamoto, Saito's Social Democratic Party counterpart, and Hiroshi Tsuruoka, his Komeito [Clean Government Party] counterpart. The government package cleared the lower chamber on November 18. The coalition holds a slim majority in the upper house. Some dissent in the Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the coalition, and the LDP have made the passage of the package unclear. Hosokawa has staked the fate of his six-month administration on the passage of the package during the current Diet session, which ends on January 29.
