The current social tranquility in the Czech Republic testifies also to the people's willingness to accept the road that had been embarked on, along with the problems which accompany it, Lux told journalists. He added that it was of key importance that social peace be preserved this year as well. Lux said that while implementing the principles of a market economy, the government had actually managed to establish the principle of a social market economy -- social consideration. He said he firmly believed that in the process of the general denationalisation of state-owned enterprises, trade unions should play an active role as a mediator between employers and employees and that the KDU-CSL intended to support them. As regards the envisaged five-percent unemployment, the KDU-CSL considered it necessary and acceptable, said Lux, adding that he considered the number of employed to be less important than the period of time during which people have no jobs. He pointed to the necessity of a more active implementation of regional policy in problematic regions and especially in areas with high unemployment.
