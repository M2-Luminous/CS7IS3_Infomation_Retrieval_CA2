Later they tried to penetrate the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's defense lines. However, thanks to the successful efforts of the Karabakh artillery units, the offensive was halted. The Azerbaijani units were forced to retreat after suffering several casualties. The reports we received as of noon today say that positional fighting is continuing at that part of the front line. The situation is tense on other parts of the line of confrontation, but relative peace prevails. Meanwhile, the provocations from Azerbaijani territory against Armenia seem to be unending. The defense positions around Berkaber in Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on at 1900 yesterday. The Armenian border guards refrained from returning fire. No one was hurt. The situation along the rest of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border has been relatively peaceful. Meanwhile, the neighboring republic must realize that it is impossible to involve Armenia in the conflict through provocative activities. Armenia maintains a peaceful policy.
