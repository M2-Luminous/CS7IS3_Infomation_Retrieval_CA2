His attention was drawn to the unsanctioned -- in quotation marks -- passage of a Russian train carrying armored transport vehicles through the territory of the Republic of Lithuania on the night from 19 to 20 February. It was requested that Russia should take measures in order that such incidents are avoided in future. On the basis of the explanations received from Moscow, the Embassy would like to report through ELTA to the Lithuanian public that the armament was being transported according to the procedure which was coordinated in 1992 by the Russian Defemse Ministry and the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry, which does not want to register officially a separate agreement or a protocol. Lithuania has not until now been informing the Russian representatives either about the procedure of informing the competent representatives of the Lithuanian authorities six hours before the arrival of trains to the border stations when this concerns military transit through the territory of Lithuania, or about the conditions of the armed guards accompanying transit military cargos through the territory of Lithuania. There is no doubt that situations such as this could be avoided in future if the negotiations started as soon as possible and the relevant agreements were prepared on military transit which would regulate in full the rights and obligations of both countries.
