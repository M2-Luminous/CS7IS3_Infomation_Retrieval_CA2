The constitution provides for a republic and citizenship for "members of the volk" [people]. Non-citizens' rights would be afforded protection by the law between nations (volkereg). There would be a bill of rights and responsibilities for citizens and non-citizens. The AVF said it would release next week the results of a survey it had conducted among landowners on inclusion in the volkstaat as well its claims on land it wanted included in its republic. The AVF said it would support any lawful claim on territory and that it would respect the wishes of landowners who wanted their land to be under "volkstaat" jurisdiction. It said it would back its land claims with all means at its disposal. The AVF said its republic would be Christian and would have English and Afrikaans as official languages. It would be governed by an assembly elected directly by constituencies at five-year intervals. There would be a state president and an executive council. The assembly would ratify the constitution by a two-thirds majority while a 51 per cent majority could force a referendum. Representatives who acted contrary to their mandates could be disqualified. The "volkstaat" economy would be run on free market principles. More details of the constitution would be released soon, Dr Hartzenberg said.
