Guerrilla Commander Rolando Moran said there are still several issues to be discussed with the government's peace commission, which is the reason both sides agreed to remain in Oslo where this new round of negotiations began last Monday. He added that there is openness with respect to an issue that has been under discussion since last year, but it is very difficult and problematic. The main challenge is to reach the end of the process with a political solution to the armed conflict that will not exclude an investigation into war crimes, because these crimes are part of the country's reality. Meanwhile, Hector Rosada, president of the government's Peace Commission (COPAZ), commented that there has been substantial progress, leading us to believe that there will be an agreement. He also stressed that the government does not fear confronting the truth. It is necessary for us to confront the past in order to brave the future. However, the greatest problem lies in doing what is right and that whatever is agreed upon has a political reality in the short run. Even though the negotiations are currently in the most difficult stage, Jan Egeland, secretary of state of the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry who is participating in the negotiations, believes that if they do not continue discussing the issue, the entire peace process will be jeopardy. It is for this reason that Norway has the moral obligation to ensure that all possible instruments leading to an agreement may be at the disposal of all parties, because these are practical and significant problems. In addition, it was learned that there is a rough draft of a document presented by the UN regarding the makeup of the investigative commission. In addition, there is another recommendation presented by the Guatemalan civilian sector that includes Argentine Nobel Peace laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel. This proposal was rejected by the government delegation because they believe Perez Esquivel is too politicized. Before the beginning of the talks, which were originally scheduled to conclude yesterday, the host country was too optimistic. Despite the fact that there is still no agreement with respect to the Truth Commission, they underscored progress made in the negotiations by pointing out the agreement signed on Friday concerning the relocation of people uprooted as result of the armed conflict.
