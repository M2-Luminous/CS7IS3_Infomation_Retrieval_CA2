Yeltsin told a meeting with major foreign investors on Tuesday that their fear to work in Russia is "outdated". "The recent months were the most quiet in political sense during the whole period of reforms in Russia", the president said and expressed conviction that stability will continue to dominate. Only before the presidential elections in 1996 "a certain political fuss" can occur, he added. The president underlined that the wave of strikes has gone down in Russia of late. "Which of your countries has no strikes at present? There is no such country, only Russia", he said. Yeltsin welcomed the arrival of major Western businessmen to Moscow to participate in the work of the Council on Foreign Investments. "You can see for yourselves what the situation in Russia is", the president said. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of such major companies as ABB, BASF, Citicorp, Coca-Cola, Ernst and Young and others.
