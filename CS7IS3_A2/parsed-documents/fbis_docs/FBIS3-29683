Established as a high tech silicon wafer maker in December, 1990, the company is a three-party joint venture among Pohang Iron & Steel Co. (POSCO), Samsung Electronics and MEMC of the United States. Its plant, set up at a cost of $200 million and located in Chonan, Chungchongnam-to, has been turning out 6-inch and 8-inch silicon wafers since last March. On Dec. 27, POSCO Huls, headed by Sin In-po, won quality recognition for its products, especially its 8-inch silicon wafers, from Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker. As the recognition was tantamount to that by the world's semiconductor markets, POSCO Huls began to mass-produce 8-inch silicon wafers from the onset of this year, according to a company spokesman. Operating the plant 24 hours a day, the company is supplying its products to domestic and foreign chip makers. Thanks to POSCO Huls' achievements, Korea has become the fourth country in the world to be able to manufacture 8-inch silicon wafers following the United States, Japan and Germany. The spokesman said that 8-inch silicon wafers enables their customers to sharply increase the added value of their products, while minimizing the defect ratio of their goods. At present, POSCO Huls can roll off 40,000 8-inch silicon wafers per month but plans to increase the volume to 100,000 from next year following the expansion of the plant. Monthly local demand for 8-inch silicon wafers now amounts to 15,000-20,000, most of which are used by Samsung Electronics. Domestic demand will increase to 40,000 by the end of the first half of this year and to 100,000-110,000 early next year, the spokesman predicted. The spokesman said that the manufacture of 8-inch silicon wafers by POSCO Huls will translate into an import substitution of $100 million at least for this year. Of the three joint partners, POSCO and MEMC specializing in semiconductor materials hold a 43.6 percent share of POSCO Huls each and Samsung Electronics the remaining 12.8 percent stake.
