The Estonian Foreign Ministry said that according to the decree, higher tariffs that were paid already, will be paid back or accounted for as advance payment. New tariffs were applied by the State Customs Office of the Russian Federation on 15 March to all states that do not have most favoured nations status agreements with Russia, thus causing the Baltic states, that do not have such an agreement, to pay twice as high tariffs as the rest of Europe, whereupon Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar called the action "economic war against Baltics." Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn said then that the reason for such an action was Russian unstable interior situation and it was aimed at protecting domestic markets and reducing profits made by the mediators. "They did not aim at putting the Baltics into a difficult position but as such an opportunity appeared it was taken advantage of," Kahn added then.
