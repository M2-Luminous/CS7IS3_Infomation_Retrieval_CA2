FBIS4-66842 "jpnea028___94010" JPRS-NEA-94-028 JPRS Near East & South Asia 18 April 1994 NEAR EAST SYRIA Bashshar Al-Asad Extolled as Successor to Brother Bashshar Al-Asad Extolled as Successor to Brother 94AA0065A Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic 18 Apr 94 pp 4-5 94AA0065A Beirut AL-SHIRA' Arabic CSO [Article by editor in chief, Hasan Sabra] [Text] It is not unusual for President Hafiz al-Asad to receive his official guests early in his office at Tishrin Palace. But Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of Arab-Zionist negotiations, was set to meet the president at 1100 on Wednesday, 23 March 1994. However, the appointment was moved back to 0800, because President al-Asad would be going directly to the airport after receiving Ross to fly in his private plane to al-Qardahah. There, he was to find his distinguished family waiting to accompany him to the grave of his late son, Basil, to read the Surat-al-Fatihah [the opening passage of the Koran] for Basil's virtuous soul. This occurred on Basil's 32d birthday, the first at which he would not be present. Basil's father opened his hands toward the sky, reading the Surat-al-Fatihah, praying for mercy for his eldest son's soul. He then murmured an apology to his son, Bashshar, for his late arrival at the grave to commemorate his son Basil, now under God's protection, two months and one week after Basil's departure to his maker. The meaning of the garden of eternity is that, after death, one is reborn in the hands of God. No one except for his family saw al-Asad's tears, shock, and emotion as he stood, head bowed, his eyes fixed on the ground, as if he were reading there the phrase of [the Syrian poet] Abu-al-'Ala': "Tread lightly. The ground, I believe, is composed but of these bodies." Dr. Bashshar accompanied his father back to the car, which would take them to their home, so that he could hear from the president what the premature spirit of responsibility had placed upon his shoulders following his older brother's death. Al-Asad's sons had perceived their brother Basil's shouldering of responsibility upon their father's direction. They had overflowed with happiness over the eldest son's preparation for assuming responsibility based on his worthiness, competence, enterprising spirit, initiative, excellent reputation, rectitude, and noble character--characteristics that honored the family. Each son had devoted himself to his work and independently chosen post, satisfied and confident. Bashshar's hobby and passion has been ophthalmology, which he began studying at the University of Damascus. He excelled in this and then went on to continue his specialization in London. The other son, Mahir, joined the armed forces, where he distinguished himself for his bravery, which is not unusual for the al-Asad family. However, the trusteeship fell upon Bashshar and his hobby and academic studies. Major Basil al-Asad was killed on the morning on which he had been scheduled to meet his brother Bashshar in London. Basil had been en route to the Damascus Airport to fly on a civilian plane to Germany and then to London to meet his brother Bashshar. But fate was faster than the speed with which Basil drove the car. "We are nearer to you than the jugular vein." "It is but like lightning." Bashshar was notified of the need to interrupt his studies in London to go to Damascus before President al-Asad learned of his eldest son's death. Bashshar had called his father from London to ask him why he had been summoned to Damascus at daybreak on that densely foggy London morning. Bashshar had made that call before the president received another telephone call from two officials in the capital, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi and Lt. Gen. Mustafa Talas, who had asked to see the president on that tragic morning. The president/father made a connection between the two calls. He asked the two officials: Did something happen to Basil, oh my God. The father's heart and feelings told him that something awful had happened to his son, whom he knew was to have left for Europe on a plane. Yes, Basil has passed on. And Bashshar came to Damascus to bear responsibility. The Intelligentsia's Questions When news of Basil al-Asad's death became known, the hearts of millions in the Arab world, specifically in Syria and Lebanon, trembled in anxiety and grief, as never before, over the loss of this young public servant. Their political and emotional sympathy stemmed from the pain, which they felt over the loss of a young politician considered a model of responsible youth, and from the fact that he was the son of a leader to whom millions have given their trust out of love and conviction, even after that leader had made difficult decisions, which might not have been popular at first (e.g., his historical, strategic positions regarding Lebanon and the Gulf). This sad public consensus was the outcome of a previous poll, which paid homage to Basil in the presence of his father, may God prolong his life. When Basil left to be at God's side, the people wanted to tell al-Asad that their homage to Basil stemmed primarily from their homage to al-Asad and from al-Asad's trust in Basil, trust that reflected the people's trust in this promising young man. When Basil died, the people saw that a dream of the leader had been buried, and that the dream goes beyond the strictly human aspect to the political continuity that President al-Asad found embodied in his eldest son, and that he mentioned with each step taken by Basil in his youth. Continuity in any regime, especially after it has been established and tested, safeguards the accomplishments that that regime achieved in the period of its establishment and testing. The Syrian regime is the creation of al-Asad's hands, effort, intellect, and calculations. It is Hafiz al-Asad's regime in every sense of the word. If we now wish to assess this regime, we have only to look at Syria's position on the political map of the Arab east, the Arab world, and the world. It is no surprise that, according to the assessment of the majority of prominent Western political writers, Hafiz al-Asad is one of the most skillful politicians of this era, and Syria has been at the acme of its role and radiance in al-Asad's era. The man acknowledges his stature modestly, confidently, and with the strength of character of an enlightened person. He allowed his eldest son to become familiar with the regime's intricacies and role by serving as a model father, distinguished political and strategic leader, and brilliant political visionary. Basil's father was correct to think well of Basil. Hafiz al-Asad was truly proud of his son and the effort made by his son, who spared no action or skill for the sake of success. Basil's success was a guarantee of continuity in the sense that we have depicted above. With Basil gone, the hope is that Bashshar will take up the banner. Some of the intelligentsia have questioned, publicly and perhaps privately, the advantage and rightfulness of a son succeeding his father in a republican, presidential system. They have also asked whether the opportunity, circumstances, and superior effectiveness of Basil guaranteed continuity, and whether this means that Bashshar can embody the same continuity! Some have posed these questions based on their fundamental opposition to hereditary succession in a republican, presidential system. Others have asked them based on their criticism of al-Asad's regime and their objection to its foundation. However, we examine this question from a different, objective angle in this quickly compiled report. We maintain that the issue of who was to succeed Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was earnestly and agonizingly posed during two historical stages in the life of Egypt and the Arabs after the death of that Arab leader. The first was immediately after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's death, when Anwar al-Sadat assumed power in his capacity as the vice president temporarily on 28 September 1970. The second was after Anwar al-Sadat's coup against 'Abd-al-Nasir's regime on 13 May 1971. We were in the prime of life. Everyone's deepest anxiety after 'Abd-el-Nasir's death concerned the search for continuity. Some of us had delusions about 'Abd-al-Nasir's institutions serving as the basis for continuity. These institutions included the Arab Socialist Union with its pioneering organizing work, legislative and executive organizations, the security and intelligence agencies, the armed forces, the Interior Ministry, and the information agencies. These institutions were supposed to have filled the vacuum. The popular sentiment--and I am closer to party restraint, ideological inquiry, philosophy, and theorization--was autocratical. The people asked, why Anwar al-Sadat? Where are the sons of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Where is Khalid ['Abd-al-Nasir's son]? We laughed at the "naivete" of the people's questions. We maintained that continuity lay in organization, institutions, and.... However all of this collapsed suddenly in one cunning coup engineered by Anwar al-Sadat, a man who turned his back on all institutions and was able to arouse the people's emotions with several slogans, in the absence of any role for his rival, 'Abd-al-Nasir's lieutenants. Al-Sadat filched power, and our theorizing proved wrong. The people's intuition remained more reliable. Why is it that Khalid 'Abd-al-Nasir did not succeed his father and take power? The answer is that 'Abd-al-Nasir did not prepare any of his sons for power. Moreover, he did not permit any of them to engage in political activity. He did not place them in any organizational, institutional, security, or military cadre. They learned only those military matters learned by other compulsory conscripts. 'Abd-al-Nasir had his opinion regarding this exclusion. 'Abd-al-Nasir died, and power was transferred to institutions. A man named Anwar al-Sadat came and stole the government, imprisoning everyone, including the institutions. If only there had been a moment of regret. Hafiz al-Asad did not exclude his children from politics. Rather, they have been immersed in political activity their entire life, since their earliest awareness. As a head of state, he provided them with everything that can benefit them in their political training, fundamental orientation, knowledge of secrets, and knowledge of the shortest, soundest routes to sound decision making and logical thinking. Hafiz al-Asad did well to find someone who shared his home, dining table, and the corners of his office with whom he could debate and discuss the issues based on love, without hypocrisy, fawning, fear, dread, hesitation, or calculations. Leaders throughout the ages have tended to develop such relationships. The almighty God addressed his most noble, Arab Prophet, God bless him and grant him salvation, about bringing hearts together and about those whose hearts are bought with money. There is thus nothing strange in Basil being the main person with whom his father could be open and candid and with whom he could examine the issues without having to be calculating. Why should Bashshar not play the same role? No one in the world can for a moment doubt Hafiz al-Asad's good education and guidance of his children. If it was fortuitous that a difference in age briefly granted continuity to the martyr Basil, it was also fortuitous that fate itself granted continuity to Dr. Bashshar after his older brother's death. As for Now I have been leading up to Bashshar. From the very outset, this young man has possessed the basic elements that embody continuity. In his first meeting with Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Bashshar made an outstanding impression on the president with his incisive personality, disciplined spirit, and scientific mind. Bashshar came to the Guest Palace to meet President al-Hirawi, who had personally asked to meet him--after he left his camp for his home to put on his civilian clothes--in order to address him confidentially and to give him an attentive audience, a primary characteristic of success being that one excel at listening before excelling at speaking. Those who know the two brothers say that Basil was both shy and self-confident, and that Bashshar is bold and decisive. It thus comes as no surprise to see the continuation of the Basil's course of pursuing violators of the law and smugglers of narcotics and goods over the Lebanese-Syrian border, without hesitation and tirelessly with respect to narcotics dealers. Perhaps the most curious incident seen by the security agencies in the Lebanese governorates of al-Biqa' and al-Shamal [North Lebanon] is the following: On the evening of 17 January 1994, two days after Basil's death, a Lebanese security officer received a report over the radio about three smuggling and kickback operations in Tripoli. His first comment when he heard the report was, "What has broken loose? The man [Basil] has been gone only two days." However, the security officer regained his composure after Dr. Bashshar took up his responsibilities. He no longer reads in the security reports anything to the effect that anything has changed in Basil's absence, for Bashshar represents continuity.
