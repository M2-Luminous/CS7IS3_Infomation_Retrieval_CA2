FBIS4-15957 "drsov071_v_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Lithuania U.S. Firm Winning Oil Terminal Bid Reported U.S. Firm Winning Oil Terminal Bid Reported WS1204175694 Vilnius TIESA in Lithuanian 5 Apr 94 No. 65 pp 1, 2 WS1204175694 Vilnius TIESA Lithuanian BFN [Report by Terese Staniulyte: "The Americans Will Design the Oil Terminal. The Search for Builders Continues"] [Excerpts] TIESA has already reported that the government announced the U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" the winner in the competition for designing the oil terminal in Butinge. We are acquainting the readers with the results of this competition in greater detail. [passage omitted] The winner was expected to emerge in the first round of the competition in early February. However, the government decided then to continue negotiations with the first three winners: The U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" which scored 91.5 points, the Italian company "Snamprogetti" (82 points), and "Techint" from Argentina (80.7 points). The same proposal also came from the consultants of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the London-based Rothschild Bank. The Butinge oil terminal will be designed to import and export oil and its products -- the total of 12 million tonnes a year. Its construction was estimated at approximately $170-200 million in February. If Lithuania had announced one winner, the latter could have dictated its own terms, which was unacceptable. Lithuania expected to reduce the costs of construction by extending negotiations. A. Vazgilevicius, representative of the oil terminal construction management in Vilnius, has explained to TIESA how negotiations were arranged, and whether it was expedient to hold them if the winner was the same company as in the first round. According to him, the three companies received packages of questions, while their responses were assessed by the same commission of government experts. The firms had to repeatedly specify some financial and technical terms of the terminal construction. Moreover, they had to indicate how they intended to use local building materials, labor force, to study the possibility of assembling the floating system at the Klaipeda shipyard, and to provide conclusions whether an additional port for service boats was necessary in Butinge. As has already been said, all comparisons were made with the aim of reducing construction costs, which is important both for our state and the company that will design and build the oil terminal. After assessing the layout of the port, the subsidiary facilities, storages, and other criteria, "Flour Daniel" again emerged as the winner. In the opinion of the commission of experts, this company presented the best project and devoted the most attention among all firms to the employment of our building companies. Attempts to "knock down" the price were also successful. Although A. Vazgilevicius could not tell the exact price, which is understandable, according to him, however, the costs "approximate $135-140 million" with a few-million-dollar error. The sum will be specified with design work under way. On 11 April, "Flour Daniel" representatives are coming to Lithuania to prepare and sign a contract. A. Vazgilevicius stated that this work might take about a week. The text of the contract is as yet nonexistent, and it will take shape during negotiations by coordinating every issue. Although the Lithuanians have no experience in drafting such large projects, however, they are not afraid of this. According to A. Vazgilevicius, "we have official consultants of the British Government and support from other companies consulting on energy issues and working on the preparation of such typical contracts." Thus, the Lithuanians are not expected to lack competence. Lithuania is also planning to invite a foreign engineering company that will examine proposals of design work. Asked by TIESA to explain the meaning of this assessment, A. Vazgilevicius replied that experts hired for small payment, who work in the sphere of supplies and building materials, will establish whether the prices offered by "Flour Daniel" are not overly high. Although these prices were linked with European costs, it might be possible to reduce them even more by way of negotiations. [passage omitted] At a press conference last Thursday [31 March], Prime Minister A. Slezevicius said that the possibility of oil imports is the most important for Lithuania. Therefore, the first stage in erecting the oil terminal will be the construction of the floating platform in the sea and the laying of oil pipelines and, maybe, of one for oil products to Mazeikiai. This work will cost around $70 million. The second stage will be the construction of storage facilities for oil and gas products on the sea coast and in Butinge, and the creation of facilities for the export of oil products. The prime minister confirmed that construction will have to begin in the middle of this year and will last for a year and a half. `Flour Daniel' intends to prepare the design documentation in four months. Thus, it should be ready by August. Asked by Tiesa whether any construction work will be performed over those four months, A. Vazgilevicius explained that he could not answer this question. "It will depend on our agreement with `Flour Daniel'," he said. "It might happen that excavators will arrive in May and that an agreement will be reached to do something. Everything will become clear after representatives of the U.S. "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers," which will design and build the oil terminal in Butinge and perform its technical supervision, arrive to Lithuania, sit down to negotiating table, and `untangle all the details'." While the preparation of design documents is under way, the government will have to make its choice about the foreign firm to which it would entrust the construction of the terminal. According to Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, "Flour Daniel" could also be the subcontractor. [passage omitted]
