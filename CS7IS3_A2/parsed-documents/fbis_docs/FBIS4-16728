FBIS4-16728 "drsov075_s_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Georgia Shevardnandze Discusses CIS Summit, Bosnia Shevardnandze Discusses CIS Summit, Bosnia LD1804090994 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in Georgian 0555 GMT 18 Apr 94 LD1804090994 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network Georgian BFN [Studio interview with Georgian State Council chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- live] [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, in the light of comparatively less encouraging information received from Geneva lately, do you think more real significance will be attached to a statement made by the CIS Security Council? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. You are right. I have already expressed my considerations about the statement made by the CIS summit. This is a statement which undoubtedly has good prospects and which may acquire paramount importance in the issue of settling the Abkhazian conflict. The thing is that we can renounce none of these possibilities. The process of negotiations under UN auspices in Geneva is still in effect. This remains a major trend. And it is very significant that the specific participation of the CIS countries in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict is becoming clearly visible. There may be yet another way, the way many people often speak about and try to induce us to take, I mean the military way. But I would say that although we must be ready for this third way, we have to do our best to exhaust all peaceful options. This problem cannot and will not remain unsolved. Abkhazia cannot and will not be lost. This will never happen. This cannot be allowed to happen. The main thing is not just returning it. The main thing is that it should happen on time, soon and in a period as short as possible. Therefore, the variant which was outlined in Moscow, I mean the CIS variant can become more real if it leads to our objective more quickly. If the UN forces are deployed there mostly as neutral forces and the process drags, it was mentioned in Geneva that certain units could be gathered by August or a little earlier or a little after that, this variant will be unacceptable for us. Therefore, I attach special importance to what has happened in Moscow. This is yet another chance to get the Abkhazian conflict settled promptly and the people returned to their homes so that they can start a normal life. We shall yield to those who give us more guarantees. Now, I am not going to remind you of a known formula given in the Moscow statement. However, this might be necessary. First, we appeal to the United Nations to act promptly and take a decision which will guarantee refugees a secure and honorable return to their homes. This will also create guarantees for the unity and integrity of Georgia and the protection of rights of Abkhazs within this state. This in one side of the appeal and the other side of the statement is that if this cannot be achieved for whatever reason, the CIS council of collective security will take its own decision to deploy peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia. I think this is an important achievement. Today, I am having a meeting with a delegation I am sending to Moscow. Mr. Sandro Kavsadze [Shevardnadze's personal envoy on conflict situations] will return to Moscow together with other members of the delegation to start seeking the best possible variants in Moscow so that the statement will not remain only on paper and the taking of a final decision will not be dragged out. Meanwhile, the process in Geneva has not stopped. Today or tomorrow, talks will resume there. This time, the issue of Abkhazia's status will be in the foreground. Yet another group of experts left yesterday. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani is also there with other representatives. Let's see which way is the shortest, demanding no sacrifice and securing our territorial integrity. [Oniani] Among the documents adopted at the CIS summit, you paid special attention to the declaration on the sovereignty, territorial integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of the CIS member states. Do you believe that this is a real guarantee for our sovereignty? [Shevardnadze] The CIS charter itself and other statutory documents of political nature and importance contain, in principle, the ideas and provisions outlined in the declaration, albeit in a scattered form, in separate clauses, different documents and so on. But at a time when many CIS countries are facing serious problems relating directly to their territorial integrity, when there are a few border disputes - not so many in our region as elsewhere, when there are movements in some countries calling for border revision and so on, when conflicts are going on the territories of a number of countries and the unity, integrity and inviolability of the borders of many countries are under direct threat, I believe that today, at the current stage, when we are heading for a crisis, the declaration has great importance. To be honest, I left the news conference slightly disappointed because neither journalists nor other participants in the news conference paid proper attention to this document and ignored its highly important provisions. I repeat that the recognition of territorial integrity, sovereignty, equal rights, noninterference in internal affairs, and some other principles should become the CIS's cornerstone and foundation. At least, that is what the document says. Apart from these interesting and highly significant provisions, there is also a clause which is of special importance to us and, in my opinion, not only to us. It says that separatism and separatist movements should not be used to violate the integrity of states. In fact, a common approach and position have emerged and they are shared by all the CIS member states. This is very important today and in the future. [passage indistinct: Oniani's remark on definition of separatism] [Shevardnadze] It can be said without exaggeration that it is Georgia's priority to look for formulas and definitions, and not only Georgia's. Everybody has finally understood how serious a threat -- at least within the CIS -- aggressive separatist movements are today. I would add on this subject that if the CIS remains committed to these principles, then it will acquire more and more (?qualities) of a true interstate organization and an international status. What we have at the moment...[pauses] I repeat that if our relations within the CIS are built on these principles, it will become an international organization in which all the states of the former Soviet Union -- and perhaps others too in the future -- will cooperate freely and successfully with the aim of achieving their goals and receiving guarantees of their freedom and independence. If these principles are adhered to, the CIS may become one of the guarantors of a free and independent development of its members. [Oniani] Thank you. Agreements of economic character were signed at the summit, for instance, about a free trade zone, or pertaining to an integral economic space and others. Later, you defined these documents as a favorable economic integration. To what extent do you think Russia feels the necessity of establishing economic relations based on equal rights and to what extent do you think economic integration will promote political integration? [Shevardnadze] Economic integration is one of the major tendencies in the world today and among not only developed countries but also numerous developing countries that have overcome an economic and social crisis of which we have numerous examples in the east, south or west. This is a result of an involvement in the process of economic integration, which answers the standards of today's requirements. Economic integration is a basis of any sort of modern union or alliance. Economic integration must become the basis of the process of the unity of the Black Sea basin countries we have already started. The CIS can become a major, one of the major guarantors of stability across the space of the former Soviet Union and it will become this if economic processes are managed correctly. If this fails, additional political difficulties and additional difficulties in social sphere will arise. I think that unlike the previous years, we, all the states, have to take care of the CIS as of a formation which can act as a sort of guarantor of independent development. This is possible all right. Unless we take care of this, we may receive variants which will be hard and unacceptable for our life and development. We could speak about former Yugoslavia as an example. We can all see an eventuality when a region does not care about its own guarantees. The present horrible tragedy is a result of disregarding all that was useful and essential for the countries, even from the point of view of economic integration only. Therefore, I think that economic integration, care about a single space in science, culture, judicial and other spheres may become definite guarantees of economic, social and political stability for the CIS countries. But economic integration still remains the basis. I will naturally be asked a question whether a manifestation of great-power tendencies can be expected along with the usefulness and beneficial features of integration. It is impossible to rule out this. But when we are together, when there exists a system of managing all processes like the council of heads of states, the council of heads of governments and many other securing instruments, I think a domination of negative tendencies is less likely. At least we are capable of preventing those today. At least, it is easier to do this when we all are together than separately, when we deal with bilateral relations. However, I would not like to diminish the significance of bilateral relations with it. Once documents in the sphere of economy are signed, a lot will depend on an initiative abilities of the Cabinet of Ministers, individual ministries, associations, private business and generally ordinary citizens who also have possibilities and rights at the same time to establish relations with other countries, citizens of other countries in the economic sphere. Thus, prospects are good and interesting. Now, the main thing is how much initiative and courage we shall be able to demonstrate in our activities at the present stage. [Oniani] You mentioned the former Yugoslavia. In assessing last week's bombing by NATO planes of Serb positions near Gorazde, you said that it was the first serious attempt to counter the phenomenon of war with force. Do you think that NATO's involvement in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was a success? Does it mean that NATO has begun taking up a peacekeeping role -- something you were discussing a long time ago, at the beginning of the war in Abkhazia? [Shevardnadze] As for the specific issue of Yugoslavia, I think that a great number of mistakes and sins have been committed there, starting from the first stage, when the disintegration of the state was beginning. My impression is that countries which could have played a role in preventing this drama and tragedy failed to agree among themselves. However, this is a thing of the past. I would like to touch upon another issue, which is more fundamental and substantive. Today it is Yugoslavia, tomorrow it may be Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan or Tajikistan. Unfortunately, it is difficult to rule out that such conflicts can break out in other regions. Therefore, I think that endless debates and discussions as well as slowness, which is so typical of the UN -- I called it an academic style in the past, now I am speaking about slowness -- lead to most serious results in the end. We are often prisoners of regulations created by ourselves and our predecessors. We keep failing to free ourselves from this captivity. I am profoundly convinced that, in the end, the UN with all its institutions and structures should take up the role of supreme judge in the world. By the way, this function is enshrined in its charter and in its structure. Everything is there in theory. Unless this happens, the UN itself will be in serious danger. The interesting ideas of reforming the UN, as outlined in the secretary-general's report -- and I welcomed these ideas -- should result in concrete action, not in a large number of resolutions. You know how many wonderful resolutions on Abkhazia have been passed during the past year. And what do we have now? [Oniani] Nothing in the end. [Shevardnadze] How many wonderful resolutions were passed on Yugoslavia and other countries. There were five or six resolutions in connection with the Karabakh conflict. The shower of resolutions must end and practical actions should start, practical and courageous actions to solve conflicts. Otherwise, we will have to deal not only with conflicts, but also large-scale wars in the near future. [Oninai] Having returned from Moscow, you said at the meeting of the Union of Georgia's Citizens: I want you to be tolerant toward other political organizations, it is necessary to begin a dialogue with political parties, to cooperate and unite around at least those five or six basic principles which by themselves can unite any force and so on and so forth. Now that we can say that we live virtually in the period of election campaign, do statements like this made by the chairman of the Union of Georgia's Citizens mean that it will not participate in elections separately but jointly with another political organization or other political organizations? [Shevardnadze] When speaking at the meeting of the board of the Union of Citizensabout about the tolerance and principles that all Georgian citizens should live with, I meant the Union of Georgia's Citizens and the whole population of Georgia. I cannot help hailing our great academic and great philosopher Niko Chavchavadze, who put forward this issue so courageously at a parliament meeting recently. The issue of Georgia's existence will very much depend on our ability to live a friendly and brotherly life with all the people actually living alongside us in Georgia. This was the main line when I spoke about tolerance and I want this feature to become an essential and integral part of each member who linked his fate with the Union of Georgia's Citizens. I have also suggested that we cooperate with all forces whose thoughts meet state standards and who place the state interest above all. I mean all patriotic forces. I certainly do not rule out a joint platform in various aspects of elections, be it parliament elections or elections of the head of state or president in future, in the elections of local authorities and so on. I have observed that there certain gradual changes are taking place in the stances of many political parties. This has occurred in issues pertaining to relations with Russia, with the CIS. The aggressiveness so characteristic two or three months ago has diminished. Some even try to overtake us. We have long wanted to be friendly with Russia, they say. They do not renounce the CIS and so on. I can only welcome this. Because this is an evidence of our parties' becoming more tolerant. At least those, who did not share this stance in the past, have become more realistic in relation with life. If this process keeps going I do not rule out that the Union of Georgia's Citizens will propose a joint platform with some other political forces in order that we all together build a democratic state of Georgia and solve the most difficult problems that have accumulated in social spheres and save the people, the country and the nation. I reiterate, I do not rule out our cooperation with any really patriotic force and every individual citizen. [Oniani] In recent days, relative cleanness and order have been established in Tbilisi. It has become perceptible, at least. More public transport have appeared in the streets. Does it mean that this process of stabilization, as seen by these first signs, will go on or this will have a shape of a one-time campaign to which we are quite accustomed, unfortunately. [Shevardnadze] We can now speak of first steps only. We have grounds neither for great joy nor for a bitter disappointment. We become convinced that a lot, if not everything, depends on us and we are to handle it. Every morning, the moment I get into the car, I request a report on crimes committed in Georgia during the past 24 hours. It was only this morning that I heard that a mere seven criminal offenses were committed in the past 24 hours. There were no cases of homicide, no other grave crimes. Even in the past, when that huge machine was fighting crime, days like this were rare. I do not mean that all is well now, that everything has been well arranged, but do we not see that there can be a positive result? [passage omitted] Almost 80 enterprises have started running in recent days. Nothing has been produced and nothing has been done for the past two or three months. Some of these have been shown on television, but not all. We have to show the people this process. Work is beginning, production is beginning. Once we yield production, we shall have goods and small resources and reserves will be created for the country to exist. [passage omitted] We often hear reprimands that the government is anti-reform, that there are no reforms, no program, no concept. To tell you the truth, I am tired of such talk. I beg everyone to read what has already been written, what is known, what is in effect. Take the plan of coming out of the crisis approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and which I endorsed and which was drafted on the basis of my edict. There exists a plan like this. Stages for the implementation this plan in the countryside as well as in town, in industry and trade have been defined. We have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recommendations which have been arranged lately and have received their ultimate shape. I would like to appeal to everyone to get familiarized with all this. Sheer words that reforms do not exist and the authorities are anti-reformist cannot do any good. This is not a way out.
