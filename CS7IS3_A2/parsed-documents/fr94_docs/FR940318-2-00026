SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a new grant to the University of Florida for the purpose of conducting a training course during the period May 4 to June 15, 1994, under the sponsorship of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The course is the 1994 U.S.-Hosted Inter-Regional Training Course for IAEA entitled ``Use of Isotopes and Radiation in Insect Control and Entomology.'' The period of performance will be from the date of award through September 30, 1994. The estimated cost is $87,000. PROCUREMENT REQUEST NO.: 05&hyph;94IS40025 PROJECT SCOPE: This new grant is to conduct a course that has been held at the University of Florida every other year since 1963. The primary purpose is to provide technical training for research entomologists world wide as part of an international effort to increase food supplies through controlling pests that cause significant losses. The course promotes the peaceful use of atomic energy as well as public interest in disseminating knowledge about techniques to control insect pests harmful to the United States. The University of Florida has the unique availability and access to major Federal, State, and University entomology laboratories that are all located within the Gainesville, Florida, commuting area. Their location enables the course to enhance lectures by including site visits and hands-on laboratory work. Eligibility for this award is, therefore, restricted to the University of Florida.
