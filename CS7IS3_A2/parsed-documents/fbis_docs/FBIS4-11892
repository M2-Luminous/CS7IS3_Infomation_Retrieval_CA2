To free the two Chinese experts, the kidnappers are demanding that work on the road, which extends over 76 km along the Saudi-Yemeni border, be stopped. The project was started in 1991. On 12 February, Yemeni gunmen kidnapped three Chinese experts working on the same project. The experts were released on 21 February. Informed Yemeni sources have indicated that the Saudi regime is behind the kidnapping, and that this regime seeks to obstruct the project, which, once completed, would allow the Yemeni authorities to control smuggling, curb acts of economic sabotage, and check the Saudi regime's ambition to expand into Yemeni territory.
