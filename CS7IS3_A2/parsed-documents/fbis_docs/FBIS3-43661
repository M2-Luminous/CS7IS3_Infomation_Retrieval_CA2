In other words, the authorities are forbidding certain opposition members to leave the country. Mr. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe, leader of the Gabonese Party of Progress, explains. He spoke to Ghislaine Dupont: [Begin recording] [Agondjo] We are, in effect, forbidden to leave the country, and we regard this as a very serious measure. It violates freedom of movement; it violates the charter of fundamental freedoms in Gabon, and it even violates the constitution. It is very, very serious because we are moving slowly towards a return to dictatorship. [Dupont] Do you think that you are under house arrest? [Agondjo] It practically boils down to that; it is practically house arrest. [Dupont] What do you think the authorities are afraid of? [Agondjo] I think the authorities are afraid of the truth. They are afraid that if we go abroad we might tell the international community about what is really happening in Gabon, in particular what happened on 5 December 1993. [end recording] That was Mr. Agondjo, the leader of the Gabonese Party of Progress. The coordinating body of the opposition of Gabon met today. It is to continue its consultations tomorrow to decide on the response it will give to the Libreville government.
