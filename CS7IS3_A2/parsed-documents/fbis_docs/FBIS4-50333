Chien said Monday [16 May] that President Li's 13-day, four-nation visit has contributed greatly to the strengthening of Taiwan's relationships with both friendly countries and those countries with which it does not maintain formal diplomatic ties. Chien, who was a member of President Li's entourage during the overseas trip, made the remarks at a press conference. President Li returned home Monday afternoon after visiting Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland. Chien said that Li had met with around 30 heads of state during his stay in South Africa. He said he would like to use the Chinese proverb, "I will do what I should do no matter how difficult it is," to describe what Li had done and his dedication in expanding Taiwan's diplomatic arena. Chien, however, denied news reports that Li met with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during his stopover at Singapore's Chang Kai-shek International Airport on Monday morning. He said Li only had a 30-minute meeting with Ker Sin Tze [name and title as received], Singapore's state minister for information, arts, and education.
