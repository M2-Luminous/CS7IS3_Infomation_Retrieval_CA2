FBIS4-33285 "drlat108_a_94029" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Suggests Fewer Blackouts Nationwide Suggests Fewer Blackouts Nationwide FL0406133994 Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 4 Jun 94 FL0406133994 Havana Radio Progreso Network Spanish BFN [Report by correspondent Pedro Garcia] [Text] The generation of electricity will include a deficit of 415 megawatts next week. This figure is consistent and does not alter the normal rationing program, as happened in the phase ending 3 June. This means in layman's terms that there may be fewer blackouts nationwide, barring unforeseen circumstances. The Electric Union has also reported that this is an acceptable balance given the current situation in the country, adding that maintenance work scheduled for thermoelectric centrals at the national level continues at a positive pace. A unit of the Carlos Manuel Cespedes Central, in Cienfuegos, will soon undergo minor maintenance work. This will not affect the average daily generation of 1,420 megawatts significantly. It has been officially reported that if this pace of repair and maintenance in the country's plants continues, a 60-percent generation level will be achieved by December.
