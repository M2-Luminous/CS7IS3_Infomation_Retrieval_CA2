In a letter addressed the 25 May to U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali, the king said Cambodia was unfortunately divided in two parties, one is the zone under the government control and another is the Khmer Rouge autonomous zone. However, the king said he had to obtain from the Khmer leaders of the two warring parties a durable and unconditional cease-fire on the whole territory of Cambodia. The Cambodian government side agrees with the cease-fire, but the Khmer Rouges still keep silence in this matter, King Sihanouk said. The Khmer Rouges did not implement the Paris peace agreement of Oct 23, 1991, therefore a new meeting in Paris or Jakarta would be useless, the king said. No one will be able to threaten the Khmer Rouges to do what they refuse to do, King Sihanouk said. "This is a long-term problem which threatens the existence of Cambodia and worries me a great deal and causes me to fall in despair," he said. King Sihanouk said he would preside over the round-table talks at Chhanghsu-on on May 27, with the participation of National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim, Co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan, president of Kampuchea Democratic party.
