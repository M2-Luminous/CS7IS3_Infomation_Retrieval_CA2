FR940303-2-00146 FR940303-2-00078 The proposed rules also will mandate a formal standard of review to be applied in appeals beyond the Risk Assessment Committee review. Currently, either MCC's or MSTC's board may in its discretion reverse, modify, or remand for further consideration any decision adverse to an appellant. Under the proposed standard, neither board shall reverse, modify, or remand for further consideration any decision adverse to an appellant if the factual conclusions in the Risk Assessment Committee's decision are supported by substantial evidence and if the decision itself is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Finally, the proposed rules add provisions relating to MCC's and MSTC's liability and suits filed against MCC and MSTC and their employees. The possibility of suit against individual staff members of MCC or MSTC acting on company business makes it impossible for such persons to perform properly their duties. The proposed rules will prohibit an MCC or MSTC participant from suing any officer, director, employee, or agent of MCC or MSTC, of the Chicago Stock Exchange, or of any of their affiliates, if such person is acting on the business of MCC, MSTC, the Exchange, or of any of their affiliates. These proposed rules will not prohibit a participant from suing MCC or MSTC as a result of the actions of these individuals; they merely will prohibit suits against individuals acting in their official capacities. The proposed rules also will limit MCC's and MSTC's liability to participants to situations where MCC or MSTC acted willfully or with gross negligence. Finally, the proposals will add new provisions that require an MCC or MSTC participant that fails to prevail in a legal proceeding instigated by that participant against MCC, MSTC, or any of its officers, directors, committee members, employees, or agents to pay MCC or MSTC all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by MCC or MSTC in defending the proceeding if those expenses exceed $20,000. The proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 17A of the Act in that they will facilitate the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in MCC's and MSTC's custody or control or for which they are responsible. (B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition MCC and MSTC believe that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule changes. (C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants, or Others No comments were received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organizations consent, the Commission will: (A) By order approve the proposed rule changes; or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changes should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.

All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR&hyph;MCC&hyph;93&hyph;7 and SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;93&hyph;14 and should be submitted by March 24, 1994.
