We are seeking to integrate land use planning into an overall strategy that contributes to both environmental and economic objectives, one that includes both transport and the environment. "To allow us to do this we must have a framework for transport decisions that will allow us to meet the environmental objectives. The chief measures within that framework are pricing to reflect the full costs of travel, and careful land-use planning to help us to reduce the need for that travel in the first place. "Our planning policies will be taken forward in the new Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 : Transport, which we have produced with the Department of Transport and the Welsh Office. The draft, on which we received over 800 supportive and constructive comments, set out clearly how local planning authorities can reduce the need for travel in the first place and provide people with a choice of means of travel. "We are looking to publish the final version of the guidance note very shortly. Without pre-empting what it will say, the key issues must be: -- maintaining and, where cost effective, improving strategic communication within the South-East and between the South-East, the rest of the UK and continental Europe; -- reducing and managing the pressures of congestion and its impacts on the local urban environment; -- providing for a better relationship between home, workplace and other activities to reduce the need to travel; -- encouraging more efficient transport choices and enabling people to walk, cycle or catch public transport; and -- improving the environment. "This is not an issue that we in the UK are tackling alone; it is one which is being tackled all over Europe. There are no ready answers, and there are difficult choices to be made, but they are choices which we will make together to produce a transport planning policy that meets all the aims of sustainability."
