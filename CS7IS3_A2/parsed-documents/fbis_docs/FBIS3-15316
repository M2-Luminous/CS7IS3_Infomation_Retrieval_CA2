This Is How the Results of the Parliamentary Elections Can Be Interpreted"] [Text] Chisinau -- The initial results of the elections in Moldova provide a basis for forecasting the upcoming 6 March national poll on unification with Romania. The defeat for the People's Front clearly reflects the population's failure to countenance the slogan of unification with Romania. Even at this stage, it can be said that victory has been won by supporters of the republic's independence. Some 42 percent of the votes went to the Agrarian-Democratic Party, while the left-wing bloc embracing the socialists and the "Unity" movement received 25 percent, with just 6 percent of voters favoring the People's Front alliance. Petru Lucinschi, chairman of the old parliament who ran for the agrarians, expressed the conviction that the Agrarian-Democratic Party will win the right to form a new government. The majority of seats in the new parliament will go to the agrarians and left-wing parties. The People's Front, together with the "Peasants and Intelligentsia" bloc which is standing on its platform, can expect one-fifth of the deputies' mandates at best. If victory for the agrarians was wholly predictable, the information received from the southern regions, which declared their intention to vote just two weeks before the elections, came as a shock. Having boycotted Moldovan political life for over three years, this region, which is densely populated by Gagauz and Bulgars, demonstrated by far the greatest zealousness. Around 90 percent of voters went to the polls. By expressing confidence in the republic's new parliament in advance, the Gagauz are hoping, having obtained President Snegur's word, to draw attention to the fate of their region in the opening days of session. If the status of the south is again evaded by the deputies, the Gagauz will return to their original demand for an autonomous republic. However, the majority won by the agrarians and socialists in the new parliament in practice nullifies this outcome. A real basis for resolving the problem of the Dniester region will emerge. The agrarian region's population expressed a preference not for the party of the same name but for the socialists. The left-wing bloc represents the ethnic minorities most broadly. Given that, in terms of candidate profiles the other parties are in fact mono-ethnic, then it is not surprising that the Gagauz, the Bulgars, and the Russian-speaking population from the central part of Moldova cast their votes in favor of this bloc. Nevertheless, owing to the Dniester region's nonparticipation in the elections, the ethnic profile of the republic (35 percent of whose inhabitants are not Moldovan) will not be reflected in the new legislative organ. Simultaneously with the poll on the status of Moldova, there will be a referendum in the south inviting the population to decide whether it agrees that the southern regions should develop as an autonomous national-territorial formation within Moldova. An affirmative response depends directly upon the final disposition of forces in the new parliament.
