There are various reasons why no room is being found for environmental protection. The main reason, in my opinion, is that environmental protection is being constantly confronted to economics and that is why it is compelled to "run from behind," to control and not to form the policies of the development of state economy. Only three years have passed since the reorganization, and again there are plans to restructure the system of environmental protection. Discussions of the draft law "On the Elimination of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Republic of Lithuania and On the Founding of the Ministry of the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of Lithuania" have begun in the Parliament. This restructuring has both supporters and enemies. Some complain about haste, others about delay, and a third group is proposing new variants of restructuring. To form a more objective opinion, we should briefly survey the present condition of the management of environmental protection in Lithuania. Following the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the environmentalists anticipated the dangers of the future reforms and proposed a new model of environmental protection (although they did not even agree among themselves which model of administration they should choose). A Department of Environmental Protection was established and it was subordinate only to the highest, i.e., law-making power. Yet such subordination was effective only up to the first obstacle. For instance, any attempt to correct the activity of the Department of Environmental Protection or to abolish disagreements between it and other departments or local administrations leads to a blind alley -- to put this into effect, a parliamentary decision is necessary. But the Parliament already has plenty of work, and a lot of time goes by until such an organizational question is put on the Parliament's agenda, except in the case of ecological problems or conflicts on the national level that would make the Parliament react and take decisions without delay. If the Department of Environmental Protection would be part of the Government structure, a governmental or the Prime Minister's decision would be enough to take care of many conflicts. But the Parliament reserves the right to control the activity of any minister and to express lack of confidence in any minister. The Department of Environmental Protection is not functionally connected with the Parliament and only formally reports to it once a year. The department exists next to the Government and the Parliament. Because of such gaps that were left in the model of administration, the institution becomes unmanageable, begins to live for itself, and the department loses the direct practical links. In the governmental sessions, the department's leaders are limited to a mere deliberative vote. Therefore it happens that the governmental structures ignore the department's directives. In such cases, it is again necessary to turn to the Parliament... The essential shortcoming of this administrative model is that it does not allow for a simultaneous solution of economic and ecological problems, as it would be appropriate, but separates them artificially. In fact, the Department of Environmental Protection is limited to only a formal participation when the Government prepares the strategic programs of the reconstruction of economy, energetics, transport, agriculture, and others. The department creates its own programs for the protection of the environment separately from the Government. They are not being coordinated, and the result is an ineffective use of energy and a waste of funds. Of course, the transformation of the department into a ministry will not do anything good if the Government itself will not slowly renounce economic functions and will not strive to integrate management by issuing new ministry regulations. There will be little change, if the internal structure of the future ministry will be formed by disregarding the principle of the delimitation of functions, responsibility and accountability. During the discussions on the territorial administrative reform, which took place in the Parliament at the beginning of this year, the Prime Minister surveyed the future of the state management and remarked that the Government is ready to pass the economic functions to the local administrations. If this is really the case, then the issue of property and other economic questions would not impede the Government's execution of state policy and the adoption of impartial decisions related to the protection of the environment and the use of natural resources. It is already clear that it is inexpedient to separate control from the other functions of the future ministry. If the Ministry of the Protection of the Environment has no right of control, then it, in the words of V. Adamkus, is a "toothless granny." Should two institutions be created that control the same area? Somebody may gain from that, but it will not be Lithuania's nature.
