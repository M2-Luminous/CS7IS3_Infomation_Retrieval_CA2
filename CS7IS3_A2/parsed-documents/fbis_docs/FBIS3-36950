Abkhazian Prime-Minister Sokrat Dzhindzholia told ITAR-TASS on Thursday that "this is necessary to prevent new combat activities and stabilize the situation". Commenting on the joint message sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze to the U.N. secretary-general, Dzhindzholia agreed that the U.N.-and Russia-brokered accords between Georgia and Abkhazia in Geneva indeed "mentioned the deployment of peace-keepers just along the border line but not on the territory of Abkhazia itself". Yeltsin and Shevardnadze proposed that the Security Council discuss "the launching, by the United Nations or with its approval, of a peace-making operation, involving, if necessary, a Russian military contingent". Dzhindzholia said it was inadmissible for peace-keepers to carry out police functions giving them the right to maintain public order and disarm the Abkhazian Army. The prime minister rejected Georgian media reports, which claimed that the recent military operation staged by the Abkhazian forces in the Gali region was directed against the civilian population of Georgian villages. "The operation was aimed against groups of terrorists, not against civilians", he stressed. "Every state has the right to maintain order on its territory using its own forces. That is exactly what we are doing", Dzhindzholia said.
