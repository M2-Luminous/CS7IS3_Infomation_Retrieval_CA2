Ministers Serreqi and Daskalov agreed on the extension of joint contacts at all levels for a great economic-trade cooperation, the protection and encouragement of investments and further promotion of cooperation in the context of the Black Sea agreement. Among the fields of cooperation were transport, trade, education, and culture. Ministers Serreqi and Daskalov also agreed on an interparliamentarian cooperation, removal of double taxation and relations between the academies of sciences and chambers of commerce of the two countries. Mr. Daskalov asked from the Albanian party that Albania be a free trade zone for Bulgaria like some other countries, and the opening of an exhibition with Bulgarian products in Tirana. This will serve the promotion of trade cooperation between the two countries. They also discussed the possibility of constructing a gas pipeline which will pass across Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to supply Albania with gas. Regarding the situation in the region, the two parties had similar opinions for the solution of the crisis and the possible threat of the extension of the conflict in the Balkans. Mr. Serreqi and Daskalov supported the latest Croatian-Bosnian agreement. They considered as fundamental element the Kosova factor and added that the embargo against Serbia must not be lifted. Both parties supported the role of the peace-keeping forces in the former Republic of Macedonia and underlined the need of the international observers in Kosova as well. Mr. Serreqi confirmed once more the Albanian point of view that the relations with the Macedonian state will be conditioned with the observation of the rights of the Albanians living in Macedonia.
