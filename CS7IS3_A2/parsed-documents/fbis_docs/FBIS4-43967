Their talks will be focused on a successor to European Commission Chairman Jacques Delors. The two most promising candidates for the top office, which will be vacant in January 1995 -- Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene and Netherlands head of government Ruud Lubbers, both of them Christian democrats --will take part in the meeting, as will Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Observers are hoping for a preliminary decision by the Christian democrats, which form the European People's Party group in the European Parliament. The socialist Jacques Delors will have a Christian democratic successor, who will be selected by the EU heads of state and government at their summit meeting on the Greek island of Corfu on 24 and 25 June. Kohl's preferred candidate is Dehaene, who is apparently backed by the majority of the "Twelve." If the leadership of the European People's Party opts for one of the candidates, this vote will be decisive for the EU summit. The possibility has not been ruled out, however, that no vote will be taken, in order to avoid a conflict. Both candidates are considered "highly qualified" for the top position at EU headquarters. The European People's Party leaders will also discuss the outcome of the EU parliamentary elections.
