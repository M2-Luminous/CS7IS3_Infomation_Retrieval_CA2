Roengchai Marakanon, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, said on Thursday night that the economy was showing signs of strong and rapid revival. To avoid overheating, the central bank has therefore decided to further control excess liquidity so that the projected 21 percent credit expansion can be achieved. The strong growth is partly attributable to the export growth of last year and this year, which is likely to surpass all expectations, Mr. Roengchai said. Last month's annual export value increased by 15.6 percent, while the target was set at 14.6 percent. This indicates quite definitely that the economy will grow by not less than 8 percent this year, he said. Mr. Roengchai added that the financial system will be tight in the short term, depending on the spending of the public during certain periods. In these cases the central bank will accommodate through the extension of short-term loans. If, on the other hand, there is excess liquidity, the Bank of Thailand will adopt absorption measures, some of which may include bond issues by government enterprises such as the Bank for Agriculture and Cooperatives. In the long rung, however, Mr. Roengchai said he believes that the liquidity excess will be lower than last year but not to the level of tight money thanks to the remaining capital inflows, particularly in non-resident baht accounts and in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. The outflow experienced during last month did not even reach 5 percent of the total capital inflow of last year which stood at 280 billion baht he said. Although deposits have risen 17 percent to 18 percent while credits have expanded more than 21 percent, the financial market will not be tightened. This is because commercial banks can mobilize foreign funds from abroad, he explained. Consequently, the central bank must follow the situation closely to ensure adequate liquidity and to avoid overheating resulting from an excess in credit expansion (more than 21 percent) and high inflation (higher than 4 percent). It is vital to control inflation at the projected level as it plays a very important role in fostering the competitiveness of Thai exports. Malaysia, for example, has inflation of as low as 3 percent, Mr. Roengchai said.
