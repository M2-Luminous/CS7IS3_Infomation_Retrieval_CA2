In this news conference, which was held at the House of Representatives, the brother House speaker explained that his recent visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia was a normal visit that falls within the framework of the understanding and ties between the two fraternal countries. These ties, he said, are eternal and strong. We must all exchange views on issues that are of interest to the region. He added: The visit also aimed at explaining developments to the brothers in Saudi Arabia. We found that Saudi Arabia and the other fraternal Arab states support legitimacy. Asked if the House decision to remove al-Bid's legitimacy and suspend [Prime Minister] al-'Attas came late and if it should have been taken at the start of the crisis, Shaykh al-Ahmar said: As regards 'Ali Salim, he does not enjoy legitimacy because he did not take the oath before the House of Representatives. He defied the House. The House took the appropriate Constitutional decision. As regards Haydar al-'Attas, he was given the vote of confidence to implement the government statement. He asked for a period of few months to implement the statement. He, however, did not fulfill his promise and continued to procrastinate, after the House made several requests to him and after his government failed to implement what it pledged. As for the delay, it stemmed from the House's concern to contain the crisis fabricated by 'Ali Salim and his gang. All the forces continued to work to contain it, but he continued to escalate the crisis to the level of a military explosion and then the House had to take that position. The House speaker added: Within that context, and after the rebels ignited the war, the House position is supportive of the head of state and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and the forces of the people, which are the forces of legitimacy. This is natural in such circumstances. He noted that the formation of a new government is a prerogative of the Presidential Council chairman.
