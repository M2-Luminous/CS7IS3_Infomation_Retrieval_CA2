The country's three-year economic restructuring plan may prove unworkable unless Dushanbe gets credits from the IMF and donor countries, he said. Koichumanov said Kyrgyz industry was in need of updating and some loss-making businesses should be liquidated. He said the budget was being filled only to half its requirements and the bulk of expenditure sent to cover social needs. Taxation rather than industrial earnings is the main sources of government revenues, he said. In his view, government resources are being channeled to meet social needs such as grain, energy and medical imports with money spent for "consumption rather than production." Koichumanov said that nothing short of foreign credits and investment could help lead the country out of the crisis. For this to happen, he said, maximum incentives must be set to attract foreign investors, particularly leading transnational corporations.
