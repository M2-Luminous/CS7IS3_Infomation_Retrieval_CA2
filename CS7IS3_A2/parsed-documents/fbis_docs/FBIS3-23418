This was announced by Sa'd Mujbir, secretary of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the General People's Congress in Libya, in a speech he delivered at the meeting of the International Parliamentary Union currently being held in Paris. Sa'd Mujbir said that "to you and through you, we declare to the whole world that we officially accept the proposal by Mr. Black, professor of law in Scotland, for the Libyans to be tried before the International Court of Justice in The Hague with the participation of judges from Scotland". It is worth noting that Colonel al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the Libyan revolution, has previously agreed for the two Libyans to be tried at the International Court of Justice without mentioning Scottish participation, but this was rejected every time by the United States and Britain.
