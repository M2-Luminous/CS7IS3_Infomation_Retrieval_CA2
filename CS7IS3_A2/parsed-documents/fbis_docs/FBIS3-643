Nan, welcome again. What's the latest? [Roux] Well, the latest is that the situation in Mmabatho, in Megacity, is definitely still very volatile. I can hear the shooting now as I sit here in my hotel room. We heard an interesting report that a prison, Mogwase Prison near Sun City, apparently all the prisoners were let free earlier this evening, and there was a lot of shooting between prison warders and the security forces. What you are seeing there now is the road going into Mmabatho, that was still earlier this afternoon. That is from our reporter Estelle Pienaar, who followed the people. And this is when the situation started getting really bad, when the shooting started in Megacity. People are very confused. The police are shooting at random, there does not seem to be any control over what is going on. There is a lot of looting going on, aparently that is still the case in Megacity. There were reportrs that bodies have been seen lying next to the road; one of the SABC reporters saw bodies lying there. He could not confirm whethter they were dead or alive. But he has seen bodies. We have had no official report of casualties or any deaths. Ambulances were also seen going into the area. As you can see, people are running for cover. The shooting is just at random. Looting, people are stealing. The police were seen trying to stop the people, apparently it was a very half-hearted attempt to stop them earlier this evening. After a while the police apparently just gave up and stood watching the people. They tried to get some of the stuff back, but it's very chaotic, very disorganized. [Modise] Nan, has there been any activity coming from South Africa into Mmabatho at this stage? I mean, security forces or anything of that sort? [Roux] Well, going out of Mmabatho into South Africa, we went this afternoon, there are Defense Force vehicles there. Danie Hefers, our other reporter, saw them yesterday as well, but we haven't seen anything in Mmabatho. Reports of that cannot be confirmed. [Modise] The South African Embassy? Is there any word from them as to.... [Roux] Danie Hefers apparently tried to speak to the ambassador this afternoon, but did not manage to get hold of him. The police apparently did go to the embassy this afternoon, and handed over a memorandum demanding incorporation into South Africa and the resignation of the Commisioner of Police. But word from the ambassador, we have not heard anything. [Modise] And the military barracks, in Mmabatho -- have you seen any activity from that side, the army or the Bophuthatswana Defense Force? [Roux] It's been mostly security forces, very little defense force. We have seen helicopters. There seems to be a lot of shooting and awful scenes. This is in Megacity, where most of the shooting took place this afternoon. Estelle Pienaar was in Megacity this evening, and she said it was absolutely chaotic. As you can see, people are just running, people are looting, huge crowds are coming into the area. [Modise] Who is shooting who? [Roux] The security police are doing the shooting. They are shooting live ammunition, they are shooting with rubber bullets and with tear gas. [Modise] Is there any truth in other reports that indicate that there could be AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members who have come into Mmabatho? [Roux] Well, there were reports this afternoon. I met up with policemen at Rooigrond, 15 km outside Mmabatho, this afternoon. They were apparently waiting for the AWB who were massing, but we haven't seen any reports of them. As you see, people here are also stealing clothing. Estelle Pienaar made reference to that. Alcohol is being stolen, jewelry is being stolen, and the police are just standing by helplessly watching. They are not doing much to interfere. But AWB, no, I haven't seen any. [Modise] And government members, the cabinet members, it is not known there they are at this moment? [Roux] No. We have had reports that Lucas Mangope, President Mangope, fled the country this afternoon, people saw him, but we haven't heard from any other cabinet ministers, no. [Modise] And so far the situation is, as you say, very chaotic? [Roux] What you are seeing at the moment is what's going on at the moment as well. It is a bit late and I can hear sirens, I can hear gunshots. It's chaos, it is too dangerous for us to go in there at the moment, so we haven't got the latest, because we cannot go in there, but it is very, very, very chaotic. [Modise] Nan, okay, we stil have you on the line. You say you haven't been able to hear any word from the South African Government as to what action they are going to take? [Roux] No. We haven't heard any word from them. One reporter did see white people in camouflage uniforms at Megacity. They are not sure from which defense force they are, whether they are Bophuthatswana Defense Force or South African Defense Force. So any South African interference, we haven't heard any word from that. The visuals you are seeing now is Estelle Pienaar, who went in earlier this evening, and she just reports that it is crazy. They really risked their lives to go in there to get these visuals, because most of the press have pulled out. [Modise] We see this happening at the shopping center, but the government offices, are they still intact, nothing has happened with them, within the buildings? [Roux] No, nothing. We have no knowledge or rumors of anything having happened there. The university, there have been problems there, the soldiers went there earlier this afternoon.... [Modise] Okay, well, we're losing Nan there, and we're losing the pictures, but Nan, thanks again for coming through with that report, and good night to you, and we hope that you'll still be giving us more reports.
