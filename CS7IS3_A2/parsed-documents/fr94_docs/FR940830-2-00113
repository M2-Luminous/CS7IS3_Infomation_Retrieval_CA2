FR940830-2-00113 FR940830-2-00057 July 7, 1994. Mr. Richard Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001. Re: United States of America v. Electronic Payment Service, Inc., U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Civ. No. 94&hyph;208 In response to the invitation extended on page 24712 of the May 12, 1994 edition of the Federal Register (59 FR 24712), Cash Station, Inc. comments on the proposed Final Judgment filed in the proceeding named above. Cash Station, Inc. operates a regional automated teller machine (``ATM'') and point-of-sale terminal (``POS'') network, and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Our comments are as follows: 1. Paragraph IV.H_Branding Restrictions Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to permit MAC members to display multiple network marks on ATMs and ATM cards, stating that ``Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs *␣*␣* [and] shall not prohibit any institution ATM card issuer located in [specified states] *␣*␣* from issuing cards that display multiple ATM logos.'' Despite that restriction, EPS is permitted to ``restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function.'' Assuming that it is appropriate to limit EPS's ability to restrict co-branding in connection with the ``MAC'' logo, the exclusion of stored value cards from this limitation creates a significant loophole for EPS. First, as drafted in the proposed Final Judgment, the stored value card exception appears to allow EPS to retain its prohibition on co-branding simply by causing all of its debit cards to be reissued on card stock that has, in addition to the magnetic stripe found on the cards currently issued, and integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function. We expect that many of EPS's smart cards will be multipurpose cards that bear both the traditional magnetic strip technology found on today's on-line debit cards and an integrated computer chip with a stored value function. Assuming that it is appropriate to provide relief on the branding restrictions in the case of the stored value cards (see below), Paragraph IV.H. should specify that such relief applies only to cards that function solely through use of the computer chip and do not also function as a traditional debit card using existing magnetic strip technology. Otherwise, the benefits sought to be obtained under Paragraph IV.H. may be illusory. Second, again assuming the EPS is entitled to some relief with respect to its stored value card, we question whether EPS should be allowed to further the market power enjoyed by the ``MAC'' ATM brand by suing that brand to identify the store value card technology. In other words, if EPS is allowed to avoid the effects of the Final Judgment in connection with an ancillary product, should it not also be precluded from promoting the ancillary product with the brand that is central to the Final Judgment? Finally, it is not clear why any protection is appropriate in the case of EPS's stored value card product. It is our understanding that EPS did not invent the chip card technology but is simply applying existing technology. 2. Paragraph IV.I._Voidability of Existing Processing Contracts. The proposed Final Judgment does not clearly indicate that the contracts entered into illegally by EPS for ATM processing and authorization processing are voidable at any time by the financial institutions. Paragraph IV.A of the proposed Final Judgment states that EPS ``shall not maintain or enforce any *␣*␣* contract, agreement or arrangement'' that furthers the tying practices that are the subject of the proceeding, and Paragraph IV.I. of the proposed Final Judgment allows EPS to sign up new customers by delivering a copy of the Final Judgment (apparently on a prospective basis only), but nowhere is it stated affirmatively that each of EPS's existing ATM and authorization processing customers may cancel its processing agreements with EPS at any time without penalty or that EPS must notify its customers of their rights to terminate these agreements. If it is not made clear that the existing contracts are voidable, EPS may enjoy the benefits of the tying arrangements through the expiration of these contracts, which may not occur for several years. ␣␣␣Very truly yours, Cash Station, Inc.
