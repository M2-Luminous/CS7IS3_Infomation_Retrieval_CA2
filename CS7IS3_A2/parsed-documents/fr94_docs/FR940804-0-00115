FR940804-0-00115 FR940804-0-00024 This paragraph includes procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers are in fact voluntary, knowing, and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal proceeding or is named as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, this paragraph requires that several steps be taken before a government attorney may engage in a substantive discussion with the represented party. First, the government attorney must inform the individual of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any communications with the government attorney. Second, the represented party must manifest his or her desire to waive the right to counsel in a voluntary, knowing, and informed way. If at all possible, the attorney for the government should obtain a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate district court judge, magistrate judge, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. Then, it is up to the court to determine that the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule or that substitute counsel is in place (including counsel appointed at that time by the court) who has consented to the communication. This paragraph does not require, however, that the waiver must always take place before the judge or magistrate judge. In exceptional circumstances, it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate judge to secure the waiver. In such circumstances, the government attorney may secure a waiver from the defendant outside the court, and, before any substantive discussion between the defendant and the government takes place, bring evidence of the waiver to the court so that the court can determine whether the waiver was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. One United States Attorney's Office commented that paragraph (c), as proposed, appeared to require an attorney first to obtain an informed waiver and only after receiving such a waiver to bring the matter before the appropriate tribunal. The Department does not intend to require (and does not understand the text of paragraph (c) to require) an attorney for the government, when contacted by a represented party, necessarily to attempt to secure a waiver himself or herself before bringing the matter to the attention of the court. A government attorney who is contacted by a represented party may, consistent with this paragraph, choose to bring the matter directly to the attention of the court, assuming the represented party has manifested his or her desire to waive the right to counsel. The court then would determine whether the party wishes to waive the presence of counsel for the communication. In general, however, the usual practice is for the government attorney to obtain from the represented party a waiver before bringing the matter before the court. As noted above, the initiation of ex parte contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed, not whether the represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision. One organization objected to the extension of this exception to anyone other than a ``fearful defendant,'' suggesting that any other client will have no better reason to initiate communication than ``a misguided belief that he can help himself by talking to the prosecutor.'' The Department believes that it would be overly paternalistic to refuse to permit any but fearful represented parties to initiate direct contact with the government. Given that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to decline legal representation entirely, see Faretta v. California , 422 U.S. 806 (1975), government attorneys should not be ethically bound to refuse to listen to a criminal defendant who chooses to decline the presence of counsel for purposes of a particular communication with appropriate court approval. Additionally, it would be neither workable nor proper to require a Department attorney or judicial officer to probe the client about his or her relationship with counsel in order to ascertain whether the client is genuinely fearful, or fearful enough, of his or her attorney's involvement to justify a conversation outside the presence of counsel. Such an inquiry would tend to enhance, not minimize, intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. A more reliable protection of the client's interest and of the attorney-client relationship is this paragraph's careful process of testing the client's desire (as opposed to the client's reasons) for waiving the presence of counsel. This is the same analysis the courts undertake in assessing waivers of the constitutional rights to counsel or against self-incrimination. The proper issue in such a setting, as here, is whether the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.
