The purpose was to evaluate a drive to renovate banking inspection, control, and regulations over the past three years -- 1991-93 -- and to set forth tasks for 1994-95. Over the past three years, banking inspection, control, and regulations have been gradually brought into in line with renovation of the banking sector, ranging from special inspection and control drives to long-range supervision and on-the-spot large-scale inspection of credit organizations. This has contributed positively to restoring order and discipline in banking operations. Addressing the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai commended the sector for its efforts last year to contain and dispel inflation and gradually increase the value of Vietnamese currency. The sector's credit operations have gradually provided good service to various economic components. Financial settlement work has shown progress, resulting in an end to the shortage of cash. Many banks have had a surplus. The deputy prime minister also pointed out major tasks to be carried out by the sector in 1994, which consist of formulating measures to stabilize the value of the Vietnamese currency; stepping up the mobilization of capital among the people and of foreign capital for economic components; managing foreign currency more satisfactorily; and reducing negativism and inconveniences if the banking sector is to meet various capital demands of the national economy.
