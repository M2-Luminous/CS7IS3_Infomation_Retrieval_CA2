Our Belgrade correspondent, Vladimir Solovyev, reports: [Solovyev] No aircraft fly into Yugoslavia because of the sanctions, and the usual way here is by car from Budapest Airport. Several thousand people gathered on the square in the Serbian town of Subotica, the first town after the border, to hear Zhirinovskiy. At his first news conference in the restaurant of Belgrade's Hotel Jugoslavija, the democrats' leader was given an ovation. In his usual declarative fashion he said precisely what the people here have long wanted to hear. In Zhirinovskiy's view, there is only one way to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina: by withdrawing the entire foreign military contingent from there and giving the Bosnian Serbs the opportunity to finish the war victorious -- and even ultimately by sending the Russian army in to help them. Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] said that NATO air strikes against Serb positions would automatically be a declaration of war against Russia, and anyone taking part in that sort of action would soon lose the taste for it. Zhirinovskiy will meet with the presidents of two Serb provinces today -- Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic; he will address rallies in Bijeljina and Vukovar and on Wednesday will probably address a big rally in the center of Belgrade. After that he will leave for Montenegro and the Serbian Autonomous Province of Kosovo.
