The Estonian representatives have had several meetings. A meeting with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had also been likely before the conference began but it never took place. In an interview to Estonian Radio, Major General Aleksander Einseln, the Estonian defense forces commander, said that he had had a meeting with the U.S. Defense Secretary and his general staff as well as with a NATO forces commander. According to Einseln, Estonia can count on their comprehensive support. The Estonian defense forces commander concluded that it is beneficial to Estonia that Russia is joining the PFP plan. Estonia's cooperation with NATO is increasing. Our NATO representative is currently making preparations in the Netherlands for the exercises due in October, and Estonian defense forces will also take part.
