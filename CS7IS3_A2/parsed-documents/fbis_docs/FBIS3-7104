With this in mind, Australia has strengthened economic relations with the region, particularly with ASEAN, to firm up its foundation for future interests. However, if Australia regards all Thais who step on its soil as criminals, it is creating danger for itself. Australian immigration officials can hardly deny that they are treating every Thai man and woman arriving at Australian air and sea ports in a discriminatory manner. Their luggage is thoroughly inspected and women are given body searches as if they are wanted criminals. All of this is simply because they carry Thai passports. This is untolerable. If things worsen to the point that Thai people express their dissatisfaction with Australia at the national level, Thai-Australian relations will be harmed more than by any expression by the Thai Government. Thai people have wondered for some time what criteria Australian officials use to reach the assumption that all Thais are heroin traffickers and Thai women are prostitutes. Holders of other passports do not seem to be subjected to this assumption. We want to warn Australia that things will worsen if it does not rectify this matter. The discrimination against Thais is unacceptable. It is a fact that Thais hardly create any problems for Australia, compared with refugees coming to that country. Thais certainly create less problems than the large number of Hong Kong nationals, who merely go there to establish permanent residency but never really live there. In addition, the Thai Government has never treated Australia in an aggressive manner as it has some countries. Does Australia want to be treated that way by the Thai people? If ASEAN should get tough, Australian aircraft and commercial ships will face great difficulties and Australian interests in Southeast Asia will shrink. Australia must not forget how countries having ambassadorial-level relations should treat each other. The treatment of Thais as if they are criminal suspects should be regarded as an insult to Thai people. We ask Australia to remedy the way it treats Thai people. We want to know how Australia will feel if all holders of Australian passports are given completely thorough luggage checks and Australian women are given body searches as they arrive at Thai airports, sea ports, or border train stations.
