Raja Mohan: ``Agni: India Should Stand Up to Pressures''] [Text] Washington, Feb. 20--With the successful third test firing of the medium range Agni, an important phase in India's missile development has come to an end. The scientific community of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has delivered in a grand manner. It has proudly propelled India into the league of great powers. Now it is up to the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the military services to put the missile technology that has been demonstrated to the best possible political and strategic use. There has been some political dithering and vacillation in the past in the face of external pressures to forego the development of India's missile technology. Hopefully that phase of hesitation too has come to an end. The DRDO has now successfully demonstrated the key aspects of long range missile technology, effective integration of different stages of the medium range missile and re-entry of the warhead and its terminal guidance have now been proven. The Agni missile can deliver a payload of one tonne over a distance of 1,500 km or a smaller warhead of 500 kg over a longer range of 2,500 km. The design of such payloads for the missile is well within the competence of Indian scientists. The leadership of the Indian military and political establishment must now take the appropriate organisational, financial and political decisions in conformity with the national security needs. The late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had approved three test firings of the Agni missile as part of technology demonstration of India's long range missile capabilities. Mr. Rao now has the opportunity to transform this technological demonstration into all important strategic asset. To be sure, India must expect some negative reaction, particularly from the U.S. to the successful testing of the Agni missile. It is certainly likely that Washington may not lift the sanctions against the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that expire in May 1994. If New Delhi can signal that it is fully prepared to brush aside these pressures and proceed with the operationalisation of the Agni missile, it will earn grudging respect from the U.S. The alternative option of giving up the development and deployment of the Agni can only be disgraceful. Humiliating MTCR Conditions It is possible that the U.S. will dangle the prospect of lifting the sanctions on ISRO and even a membership of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), if India is ready to forego its missile development. Any such proposal deserves nothing but contempt. India should not allow the U.S. or any other nation to set Indian technological priorities. Besides, the conditions for entry into the MTCR have been humiliating. When Argentina was allowed into the MTCR last year, the U.S. demanded and got rights to verify the complete destruction of all components of its Condor missile programme. Brazil had last week applied for the membership of the MTCR. It remains to be seen what kind of conditions the U.S. will demand before it lets in Brazil. India can join the MTCR only on one basis: in return for abiding by the export control regulations of the MTCR, New Delhi will have full access to the civilian space technologies. India must make it clear it will accept restrictions on its missile development and deployment only as part of a larger global regime of missile disarmament. There is little reason for India to be frightened by the current rhetoric on nonproliferation or the immediate threats to impose more restrictions on technology transfer to India. The debate on export controls in the U.S. is undergoing a major transformation. The American business community and the Commerce Department are pushing for a substantive liberalisation of export controls, driven as they are by the need to promote American jobs and exports. The U.S. Defence Department, too, motivated by the desire to protect the competitiveness of American aerospace industry and its technological base, has come round to supporting the loosening of export controls except in the so-called ``choke-point'' technologies that are critical for the manufacture of mass destruction weapons. Traditionally, the Pentagon has been the most vocal opponent of liberal American technology exports. As India expands its abilities to develop and export space related technologies including missiles, the U.S. will find that it is in its own interest to get India participate in the missile technology control regime, as an equal partner. In the final analysis, it is only those countries that can show the determination to stand up to pressures that will be accepted as great powers. The Indian Government has two options on the Agni missile. It can decide on early deployment of a limited number of medium range missiles. Or it can authorise more tests of the missile to improve the overall design and reliability. The improvements in particular could focus on a better ``aspect ratio,'' by reducing the height of the missile and increasing its width. India is said to have appropriate capability in solid propulsion technology to achieve this. In any event, further work on the improvement of the missile and an early decision on its operational deployment need not be mutually exclusive.
