The bribes, said the sources, were paid for public bids to build a freeway linking the Venice-Padua highway to the Marco Polo airport of Venice. De Michelis and Bernini are among five members of parliament who may face charges of corruption and violation of party financing laws for their alleged involvement in kickbacks for public bids in the northern Veneto region. (Barbara Coelin, De Michelis' former secretary, told Milan magistrates she received "envelopes" from several businessmen, including former Montedison chairman Carlo Sama, which, "for the way they were given to me, the instructions I received and the discretion I was told to use, I could understand they contained money," according to transcripts of the questioning, which took place in Switzerland on March 2.) The other MPs are former Christian Democrat treasurer Severino Citaristi, another Christian Democrat Senator, Pietro Montressori, and Socialist MP Raimondo Galluppo. The public works projects under investigation by the Venice public prosecutors include pesticide cleanups in several Veneto provinces and a pollution cleanup project just outside Venice. De Michelis was the most powerful Socialist politician in Venice before being implicated in a number of corruption probes; Bernini was a local heavyweight in the Christian Democrat party who has also been involved in a series of investigations.
