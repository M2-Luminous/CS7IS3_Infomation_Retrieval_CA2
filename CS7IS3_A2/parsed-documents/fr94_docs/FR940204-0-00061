FR940204-0-00061 FR940204-0-00021 The largest population of Erysimum teretifolium, located at the Quail Hollow Quarry, contains about 75 percent of the total number of known individuals of this species (approximately 5,400 individuals) (Bittman 1986). This population was already reduced in size by sand quarrying, and ongoing quarrying will likely continue to reduce the size of the population. A current proposal to expand mining operations at this quarry would eliminate habitat supporting several hundred individuals of E. teretifolium, as well as an undetermined number of Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana (Strelow 1993). Of the remaining populations, none comprise over 400 individuals, and about half total less than 100 individuals each (Bittman 1986). Aside from the largest population, several of the smaller populations were also reduced in size by quarrying, as well as by development of private lots. Occurrences of the plant were repeatedly vandalized in the Bonny Doon area (California Native Plant Society 1986), apparently by landowners intent on developing their properties. Quail Hollow Ranch, a site which supports less than 300 plants, was recently acquired as a park through the joint efforts of The Nature Conservancy, Santa Cruz County, and the State of California. However, management plans developed for the county portion of Quail Hollow Ranch may include development of recreational facilities, which may affect E. teretifolium (County of Santa Cruz 1990). B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. No evidence of collection for commercial, scientific, recreational, or educational purposes exists; however, acts of vandalism have impacted Erysimum teretifolium and Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana. In addition, increased awareness of the need for protection of these species could increase the threat of vandalism to these plants and their habitats. At least one population of Erysimum teretifolium was destroyed by a private landowner during and shortly after the plant was processed for endangered status by CDFG in 1981 (CNDDB 1992). Other occurrences of vandalism of this species were reported from a sand and gravel mine (Bittman 1986). A parcel of land owned by the San Lorenzo Valley Water District that supports several of the unique elements of the Ben Lomond sandhills habitat, including Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana, was badly damaged by off-road vehicles despite efforts to fence off the area by the District. C. Disease or predation. Two of three populations of Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii were grazed by horses in Scotts Valley. No data exist to substantiate whether grazing threatens this plant. No information exists concerning the threat of disease or predation to the other three plants. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Under the Native Plant Protection Act (Division 2, Chapter 10, sec. 1900 et seq. of the Fish and Game Code) and the California Endangered Species Act (Division 3, Chapter 1.5, sec. 2050 et seq. ), the California Fish and Game Commission listed Erysimum teretifolium as endangered in 1981. Though both the Native Plant Protection Act and the California Endangered Species Act prohibit the ``take'' of State-listed plants (Chapter 10, sec. 1908, and Chapter 1.5, sec. 2080), State law does not protect the plants from taking via habitat modification or land use change by the landowner. After CDFG notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires only that the landowner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 10, sec. 1913). Although these State laws provide a measure of protection to the species, these laws are not adequate to protect the species in all cases. Numerous activities do not fall under the purview of this legislation, such as certain projects proposed by the Federal government and projects falling under State statutory exemptions. Where overriding social and economic considerations can be demonstrated, these laws allow project proposals to go forward, even in cases where the continued existence of the species may be jeopardized or where adverse impacts are not mitigated to the point of insignificance. The California Environmental Quality Act requires that environmental documents disclose the full scope of impacts anticipated to sensitive resources within a project area. The initial documentation of a project in Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii habitat failed to include adequate information concerning the presence of and the potential impacts to this plant. A lawsuit settlement required that additional surveys of occupied and suitable but unoccupied habitat for the plant be completed (Jane Haines, Environmental Law Services, in litt., 1992). However, the lawsuit failed to specify that the information was to be used in redesigning the project to provide adequate protection for the plant.
