FR941026-2-00032 FR941026-2-00022 The proposed project would disrupt high quality aquatic ecosystems already experiencing stress from encroaching development in southern New Hampshire. The large direct loss of wetlands would cause the death and displacement of wildlife, and reduce water quality functions. Uncommon species would suffer the most, especially area sensitive animals, species dependent on riparian habitats, and smaller animals that are either less mobile or depend on vernal pools. The project would destroy at least 5 vernal pools. Vernal pools are especially valuable to wildlife, particularly as breeding areas for amphibians. Given the strong fidelity of numerous aquatic species to their natal ponds, the direct destruction of the pools results in the loss of a large and important wildlife resource. Several populations of different species would be lost, including spotted salamander and the rare state listed blue-spotted salamander. The highway would impact one of the last essentially intact ecosystems remaining in the greater Nashua area and cause impacts well beyond the footprint of the fill. Numerous streams and wetlands would be bisected, thereby altering the hydrology, disrupting species movement and increasing predation of uncommon species. Indirect Impacts to Wildlife In addition to direct losses, the NHCH would degrade wetlands, including vernal pools, that would border the proposed highway. When a large highway fragments habitat blocks, common species proliferate at the expense of the more unusual wetland wildlife species. Fragmentation causes increased nest predation and parasitism to songbird populations. Large highways act as funnels moving some predators, such as red fox and crows, into previously buffered wetland interior areas. Riparian corridors help maintain viable wildlife populations by adding to the natural connectivity of habitats already fragmented by development. Far ranging aquatic mammals inhabiting the site which often travel along streams, such as fisher and mink, would be impacted adversely. While such species are capable of crossing highways, they often avoid areas of human disturbance. Fast moving vehicles would kill some of these individuals which venture onto the highway especially at night. Large highways restrict wildlife movement and interfere with the natural exchange of genetic material. A large highway with fences, broken canopy, and vehicle activity throughout much of the night presents a significant barrier to the movement patterns of animals, resulting in increased direct mortality and avoidance behavior. Because of its size and projected high traffic volume, this highway will likely act as a barrier to restrict the movement of numerous wetland species across the landscape, especially small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.
