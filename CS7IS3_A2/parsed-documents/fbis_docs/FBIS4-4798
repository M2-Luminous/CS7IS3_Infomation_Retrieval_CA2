Korea Denounced"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] released a statement today warning that if the U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters brought Patriot missiles into South Korea and persistently sought a war in spite of the strong opposition of people at home and abroad, they would have to pay dearly for it. Viewing their aggressive arms buildup and war provocation moves as a heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean nation into a nuclear war holocaust, the statement says: The United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons into South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war games. This indicates that it seeks a solution to the issue not through negotiation but by strength, unilaterally reneging on its promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear weapons which was stipulated in the DPRK-USA joint statement. The South Korean puppets continue introducing U.S. nuclear weapons into South Korea to slay the fellow countrymen in the North with the help of outside forces. This is an anti-national criminal act which can be committed only by flunkeyist traitors without a shred of national independence and an unpardonable perfidious act of unilaterally denouncing and reducing to a sheet of waste paper the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization banning the production, introduction and possession of nuclear weapons. If the strained situation is to be relaxed in Korea and a correct solution to be found, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK must be changed and such flunkeyist traitors as Kim Yong-sam be removed from power in South Korea to be replaced by pro-reunification, democratic forces, national independent forces which value the sovereignty of the Korean people. The United States and the South Korean puppets would be well advised to stop running riot, clearly mindful that with no amount of military threat, can they frighten the Korean people united in one mind around the party and the leader or stifle Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses.
