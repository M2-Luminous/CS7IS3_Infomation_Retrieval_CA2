At the conference, the leaders in charge of literary and artistic work, persons in charge of literary and art departments, and old and new writers and artists were gathered together and conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art and Chairman Jiang's important instructions on Army literary and art work. They discussed how to make Army literary and art work flourish, obtained a clearer understanding of the situation, confirmed the orientation, specified the tasks, and boosted confidence. CMC Chairman Jiang, Vice Chairman Zhang, and other leading comrades had a cordial meeting with the deputies to the conference. Chairman Jiang gave an important instruction, which was the greatest encouragement and spur for the literary and art workers Army-wide. In pace with the reform and opening up and the vigorous strides of the overall building of the Army in the new era, gratifying achievements have been made in the Army's literary and art work. Many excellent works that are ideologically sound, refined in taste, and artistically valuable have been created in literature, dramas, films, television programs, songs, dances, acrobatics, quyi [collective term for folk art forms including ballad singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, and cross talks], and fine arts. They have exerted an extensive influence in and outside the Army and on cultural exchanges with other countries. The old, middle-aged, and young literary and art workers helped each other make progress and a batch of outstanding, young, and talented people have shown themselves, reinforcing the contingent of writers and artists. The broad ranks of literary and art workers went to the grass-roots levels with full enthusiasm. They created works and gave performances for soldiers and were accorded warm welcome. The cultural facilities at the grass-roots levels have been constantly improved and the cultural life at the company level has been enhanced. The CPC Central Committee and the CMC have paid close attention to, and been very concerned with, the Army literary and art work. Recently, Chairman Jiang pointed out: "In strengthening the Army's building of spiritual civilization, it is imperative to make energetic efforts to advocate healthy, uplifting, inspiring, and colorful cultural life in the barracks." The Army literary and art workers should "take pains to sing the praises of the new people, new things, and new habits in the Army; provide them with more spiritual food that is both educational and well accepted by the broad ranks of officers and men; and make new contributions to the building of socialist spiritual civilization and enhancement of the Army's fighting capabilities." "Our army should play a better role as pacesetter in the building of spiritual civilization and move ahead in the forefront of the society." To this end, the Army literature and art must conform to the circumstances and development, as well as the ever-rising demand of the broad ranks of officers and men on their cultural life, and develop and flourish to a greater extent. This is the expectation of the party and the people and the call of our times and history. In making Army literature and art flourish, the most important link is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art as the fundamental model. Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art is an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is very rich in content and is highly creative and practical. On the basis of inheriting and developing Mao Zedong's thinking on literature and art, it scientifically sums up the experience of our party in guiding the literary and art work in the past decades. It is a concrete embodiment of the party's basic line in the literary and artistic sector, it clearly points out the direction for the development of socialist literary and art undertakings in the new historical period, it answers the many new questions facing the literary and art work in the new era, and it is the very basis on which we can do a good job in the Army's literary and art work. We should unify our thinking, equip ourselves mentally, and guide our practice with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art so that we can grasp better the laws and trends of the Army literature and art in the new historical context and enable the Army literature and art to develop and flourish in the correct direction. Encouraging the main theme is required of Army literature and art in our times and an important premise and basic orientation of the Army literature and art for making the reinvigoration possible. In this great epoch we are in now, the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, the glorious practice and creative spirit of the masses in the reform, opening up, and modernization, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation constitute the main theme that promotes social development and the progress of our nation. Our literary and artistic creation and performance should accurately grasp today's spirit, profoundly reflect the nature and mainstream of the real life, and sing praises of the excellent quality and brilliant achievements that the soldiers and civilians of our country have displayed in the great cause. In the meantime, we should strive to improve artistic quality and, through lifelike, vivid, and moving artistic images and different styles of expression, impart not only a powerful ideological persuasiveness, but also a strong artistic appeal to the works that encourage the main theme, so as to arouse the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad ranks of cadres and men in making a good job of Army building and reform. In promoting the development and flourishing of Army literature and art, it is necessary to put the focus on the creation and performance of works on military topics. The dignity of the country, the soul of the nation, and the spirit of the people are often more clearly manifested in the Army. The works on military topics have a special educational, encouraging, and spurring effect. Army writers and artists should explore this field of topics in great depth, draw artistic inspiration from deep within the history of the revolutionary wars and the fiery struggles in reality, emancipate the mind, make bold explorations, and make continuous innovations, express their deep insight and penetrating judgments on history, society, and life from various aspects, levels, and perspectives, create the images of today's soldiers with distinct characteristics of the times, and help the creation and performance of works on military topics to flourish. To make Army literature and art flourish, it is imperative to build a contingent of writers and artists who are ideologically and politically sound and have high professional quality. The contingent of writers and artists in the Army has a glorious revolutionary tradition and enjoys a high reputation among the general public. In the new historical context, it is necessary to keep strengthening the building of professional ethics, conscientiously resist the influence of money worship, out-and-out individualism, and decadent life-style, establish a correct outlook on life and values, work diligently, quietly dedicate oneself, and make oneself worthy of the title of engineer of the soul. They should constantly temper themselves and improve their artistic and cultural understanding, consistently go into life and maintain a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses and the broad ranks of officers and men, so as to absorb strength from them extensively and inspire their own creativity. The leaders at various levels should show concern and care for literary and artistic workers in political terms, in ideology, in professional activities, and in daily life, and give maximum play to their wisdom and artistic talents, so that the contingent of writers and artists in our Army will always maintain a vibrant life force and vigorous vitality. The ultimate objective for making Army literature and art flourish is to bring up a generation of revolutionary soldiers "with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of discipline," to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and to enhance the Army's fighting capabilities. Therefore, we should not only build well the professional contingent of writers and artists, but also pay close attention to the guidance for the mass cultural and entertainment activities in the barracks. While holding fast to high standards and cultured taste, it is imperative to ensure the regularity and institutionalization of the spare-time cultural activities of the troops, conduct such activities as watching movies and television, entertainment, reading, and sports extensively, and make the cultural life in barracks colorful, down-to-earth, and effective. The CPC Central Committee and the CMC set great store by the flourishing of Army literature and art. The broad ranks of officers and men and the masses place high hopes on the Army writers and artists. The cause is a glorious one, whereas the task is heavy and the road is long. Let us unite as one, forge ahead with a trailblazing spirit, and open up a new prospect of greater flourishing in the army literature and art with creative work and rich fruits.
