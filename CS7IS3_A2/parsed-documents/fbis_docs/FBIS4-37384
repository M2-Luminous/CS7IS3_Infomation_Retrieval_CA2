The embassy added that this visit confirms the United Kingdom's continued concern for the security of Kuwait. It pointed out that the visiting admiral will discuss the continued rounds of joint military exercises between Kuwaiti military ships and the royal ships of the Armilla Patrol in the Gulf. The forthcoming exercises of these forces are scheduled to take place next September during the visit of HMS Cornwall. During his visit, Admiral Bathurst will meet with Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud, General 'Ali Mu'min, chief of the general staff, and Dr. Hamud al-'Utaybi, under secretary at the Defense Ministry. Admiral Bathurst will also meet with Commander Muhammad Yaqut al-Fayruz, deputy-commander of the Kuwaiti Navy, during his visit to the naval base in al-Julay'ah. It is worth mentioning that the United States, Britain, France, and Russia have signed defense agreements with Kuwait since the end of the war to liberate the State of Kuwait in February 1991.
