FBIS3-51731 "drlat016__a94015" FBIS-LAT-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Belize * Judicial Reform Priority of Constitutional Revision 94SM0166B Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 19 Dec 93 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94SM0166B Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:CSO [Article by Itamar Garcez] [Text] Brasilia--The Judiciary Branch is the chief target of legislators working on the constitutional revision. About 25 percent of the more than 17,000 proposals for amendments that have been submitted deal exclusively with the courts and the magistrates. Article 93, for example, which governs the magistracy, was the favorite of deputies and senators, who suggested about 640 modifications in it. This statistic, a preliminary finding by Prodasen [Federal Senate Data Processing Center], confirms expectations that the National Congress wants outside control over the Judiciary. The desire to set limits on the actions of judges is nothing new. Ever since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, legislators have had the Judiciary Branch in their sights. To repeat that year's success, when they survived unscathed despite many pressures, the judges will have to work a good deal harder. Legislators of all stripes have already catalogued their suggestions. Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino (PT) [Workers Party], like his colleague Jose Dirceu (PT, Sao Paulo), proposed a Council of Justice to exercise administrative, financial, and disciplinary control over the judiciary. Rondonia Senator Odacir Soares, (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], wants to end the lifetime appointment of ministers, so he proposes a 12-year term of office. His colleague in the Chamber, Para Deputy Luis Carlos Hauly (PP) [Progressive Party], goes further: he wants to give the Legislative Branch the power to remove ministers from superior courts by a vote of "no confidence" to be approved by an absolute majority of deputies--the same quorum required to approve any proposal in the constitutional revision--293 votes. This predilection to suggest changes in the Judiciary has not, however, prevented deputies and senators from setting to work on all areas. In the most recent survey done by Prodasen, Article 138, which contains the rules governing a state of siege, was the only one not on the list of proposed changes. At the other extreme, Article 5, on the rights and duties of citizens, ranked second as a target of the legislators. More than 610 proposals seek to modify that long constitutional provision, which has 77 subsections. For example, it is in Article 5 that Rio de Janeiro Deputy Amaral Netto (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] will try, once again, to insert a point on which he has been adamant: the plebiscite on the death penalty. The members of this Constituent Assembly will not have much luck, however, since Article 5 is one of the clausulas petreas, provisions that according to Article 60, paragraph 4, cannot be amended. The major topics will probably be: the tax structure, the petroleum and telecommunications monopolies, social security, the civil service, the public administration, congressional representation formulas, the federative pact, and agrarian reform. [Boxed chart page 8] Prodasen has just completed a preliminary survey of proposed changes in the Constitution. Using these figures, it will be possible to identify the legislators' principal interests. The survey categorized 17,269 proposals for revision. Here is a look at what the legislators have in mind. Proposals by Title of the Constitution - Title I, The Fundamental Principles - 68 proposals - Title II, Fundamental Rights and Guarantees - 1,779 proposals - Title III, The Organization of the State - 2,683 proposals - Title IV, Structure of the Branches of Government - 5,843 proposals - Title V, Defense of the State and Democratic Institutions - 751 proposals - Title VI, Taxation and Finance - 1,790 proposals - Title VII, The Economic and Financial Order - 1,300 proposals - Title VIII, The Social Order - 1,771 proposals - General Provisions - 470 proposals - Transitory Provisions - 819 proposals Note: Sometimes a single proposal modifies more than one article.
