The vice-premier visited the transaction halls and met with regional trade officials, in the company of Wu Yi, the minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and Zhu Senlin, the governor of Guangdong Province. In his speech to the officials, Li congratulated the fair on its record transactions, saying that the introduction of a competitive mechanism is a major reason for its success. Li affirmed that competitive bidding for export quotas is an effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between Chinese export companies. Li said such a practice should be applied to more commodities than the present 13 sorts. Li said he fully agrees with the plan that from the next session, commodities of the same sort will be displayed at one place, though business delegations will still be sent by provinces as they are now. Li also urged local trade officials to take advantage of the country's new trade policies issued this year, for example, the application of a single exchange rate, to boost their local exports. While admitting that the new policies have room to improve, the vice-premier called on trade authorities to improve them and to take measures to prevent possible problems from arising. For example, Li said, foreign importers may unreasonably depress the prices of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters may also unreasonably raise the prices, all resulting in a rise of the cost of foreign currencies. Li pointed out that the establishment of a modern enterprise system and multinational operation should be the direction taken for the remolding of China's foreign trade enterprises. However, the vice-premier noted that the remolding should be properly approved and strictly follow the instructions of the State Council so as to hold mistakes to a minimum. He stressed that in forming stock holding companies, internal shares must be limited to the promulgated amount as a measure against the loss of state-owned assets. In his speech, the vice-premier also talked of improving the investment environment and training more competent foreign trade professionals.
