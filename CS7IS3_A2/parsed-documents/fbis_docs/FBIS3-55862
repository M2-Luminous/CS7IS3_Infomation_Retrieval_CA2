Ramiz Rizayev, Ambassador Plenipotentiary of the Azerbaijan Republic to the Russian Federation, Denies Reports About Afghan Mojahedin Involvement in Hostilities"] [Text] [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, at a recent meeting of the CIS heads of state in Ashgabat President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan demanded that a mechanism be worked out within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty that would enable the CIS countries to ensure Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Could you speak about the Azerbaijani initiative in greater detail? [Rizayev] The fact is that the provisions of the Collective Security Treaty are so defined today that it is oriented toward a rebuff against an "outside enemy" if such, God forbid, ever appears. Although, to be frank, neither Iran nor Turkey are threatening Azerbaijan; on the contrary, we enjoy good-neighbor relations with these countries. This treaty in its present shape does not provide for the possibility of collective defense in a situation when one country -- a party to this treaty, in particular Armenia -- commits aggression against another CIS member, Azerbaijan. Armenia, trampling upon international law and UN Security Council resolutions, continues to occupy approximately one-quarter of Azerbaijani territory. All the peace efforts undertaken earlier by the CSCE and the Russian Federation to deal with this issue have not brought any tangible results, primarily because Armenia continues to speak from a position of force. The unprecedented case -- the shooting by Armenian snipers at Russian Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov's mission on 20 November -- has testified once again to Yerevan's unwillingness to come across with any concessions. After that attack, as is known, Russian Ambassador Kazimirov had to cut short his peacemaking efforts. It is also indicative that Armenia has demonstratively refused to apologize for this incident to the Russian side. In this situation we have the right to expect that parties to the Collective Security Treaty will give a legal assessment to Armenia's expansionist policy, because otherwise the very idea of a collective security system within the CIS framework can be discredited. [Mikhaylov] Russian diplomat Vladimir Kazimirov in the course of a recent visit to Tehran stated that Russia is ready to continue its intermediary efforts to achieve a settlement in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. How does Baku appraise Russia's peacemaking efforts? [Rizayev] We can only support the aspiration by the Russian side to ensure peace and stability in this region. Russia in this mediation process can and should do a lot: Russia's geopolitical and economic interests call for stability along its southern borders, and moreover there are approximately half a million Russians living in Azerbaijan who consider our republic their motherland and share all the hardships on a par with everybody else. The peacemaking process should be based on the principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. At the same time one should bear in mind that the so-called "self defense forces of Nagorno- Karabakh" are a myth. In fact the formations acting in the zone of combat operations are a component part of Armenia's national guard. Therefore all attempts by the Armenian side to accord Nagorno-Karabakh the status of an independent party in the talks hold no water. How has the tiny Armenian community of Karabakh come by such a mighty power -- tanks, missiles, aircraft, and fuel to fill the deadly military machines? Therefore Yerevan's assertion that the conflict is occurring between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh is nothing but an attempt to absolve itself from responsibility for the ongoing war in the region. [Mikhaylov] Some time ago first Armenian sources and then some Russian papers began to report that Afghan mojahedin are fighting on the Azeri side. Could you confirm this information? [Rizayev] I can only express a feeling of utmost amazement. The Russian mass media are once again demonstrating unanimous silence over the tragedy unfolding in Azerbaijan before the entire world. More than a million civilians have been left without shelter; death is taking its toll; a real genocide is occurring, but we are not hearing any condemnation of this fact by the Russian public. At the same time certain papers are willingly airing the subject of Afghan mercenaries. Framed "documents" are being used and these fabrications are being backed up with fantastic figures. The impetus to this campaign was provided by statements of Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. This is an attempt to divert world public attention from the numerous facts of the involvement of foreign mercenaries as part of Armenia's occupation forces. There is evidence to suggest that Armenians who have been trained in Kurdish guerrilla camps in the Middle East are then transferred to Karabakh, and Syrian and Lebanese hirelings are also arriving here. [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, I would like to ask a final question, which is related to the internal political situation in Azerbaijan. Could it be said that the present leadership has succeeded in achieving national accord in the country? Some time ago Ayaz Mutalibov, former president of the republic, expressed his readiness in the press to collaborate with the current authorities.... [Rizayev] The Azerbaijan leadership is ready for a constructive dialogue with all healthy political forces of the country wishing to undertake efforts to lead the country out of the crisis. As for Mutalibov, I can say the following. It is bad when a man does not want to understand that his time has passed. It is okay if lying behind Mutalibov's statements are only his personal ambitions, but there is a danger that the ex-president is being turned into a kind of banner by well-known forces aiming to destabilize the situation in Azerbaijan, which is difficult as it is.
