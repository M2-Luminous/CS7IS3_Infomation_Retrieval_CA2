Yue] [Text] The Legal Department has taken a major move in anticipation of future Basic Law requirements by appointing two local candidates as law officers who rank just below the Attorney-General. Daniel Fung, at 41 one of the youngest QCs in Hong Kong, will become Solicitor-General. Criminal lawyer Peter Nguyen will be Director of Public Prosecutions. They will be the first local Chinese to occupy the posts. The appointments pave the way for a local Attorney-General. Under the Basic Law, the Attorney-General should be a local Chinese with no right of abode in any foreign country. The present incumbent, Jeremy Mathews, and the five law officers below him are expatriates. Both Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen have been given three-year contracts. Mr Fung will assume the post--vacant since the departure of Bertrand de Speville to become ICAC [Independent Commission Against Corruption] Commissioner in February last year--in December and will serve beyond the change of sovereignty in 1997. Mr Nguyen, 51, will succeed retiring Director of Public Prosecutions John Wood in two months and will serve until July 14 1997. Yesterday, both expressed the wish to stay on to work for the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. Mr Fung said he would renounce his British passport, which he obtained through studying in Britain. "It would not be a difficult choice for me to renounce the British passport and to have a SAR passport," he said. Mr Nguyen, Chinese by nationality, was born in Vietnam. He holds a British Dependent Territory Citizen's passport. Traditionally, the Solicitor-General is regarded as the shadow attorney-general and the front-runner for the job. But Mr Fung said yesterday: "Since the post is occupied, there is no room for me to speculate on that." Although Mr Fung took donations to students staging a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square during the pro-democracy movement in 1989, he did not think that would affect his career in the Legal Department after 1997. "I personally do not think it would have any effect because most Hong Kong people supported the democracy movement at that time." He said he took about $100,000 to students in Beijing in an individual capacity and had not been a member of any of the pro-democracy groups. Joining the Legal Department will mean a drastic cut in salary for Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen, but both said financial gains did not rank first in their decision. The appointment also means a breakthrough in the pace of localisation in the Legal Department. The slow pace has attracted much criticism and Governor Chris Patten promised in his policy address last year that three of the top five law officers would be local by 1995. "The policy of localisation which was implemented some years back has run into difficulties, but the recent appointment--that is mine and Mr Nguyen's--is an indication that the logjam has been broken," Mr Fung said. With the new appointments, 28.8 percent of the department's directorate are locals. The overall localisation rate of the department is 54 percent.
