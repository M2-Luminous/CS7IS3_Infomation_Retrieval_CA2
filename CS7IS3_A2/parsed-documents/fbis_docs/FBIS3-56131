The two abovementioned events bear such great importance for Belarus (especially the latter one), so different political forces have begun to comment on them. Stanislav Shushkevich, who had long resisted the agreement on collective security and even spoke of holding a referendum on this issue, has suddenly changed his principles and signed the documents, which, according to his own words, may lead to a situation when our boys will be sent to Tajikistan. Zyanon Paznyak [BNF chairman] described the speaker's inconsistency as a desire to avoid his probable dismissal (we would like to recall that the legislative faction Belarus again plans to put the issue of Shushkevich's ouster on the agenda, immediately after the winter holiday). It is not sure whether the legislative majority will praise the speaker for this accomplishment and forgive him his previous inflexibility on this issue. Judging by all signs, BNF is not going to forgive its former supporter for his betrayal of Belarusian interests (as Paznyak described the signing of the treaty). In the opinion of the opposition, the situation in Belarus has deteriorated considerably recently. This is connected not only with the deep economic crisis, which, according to BNF, was caused by the government's clumsy activities, but also with attempts against the political independence of Belarus. With the signing of the agreement, the principles providing for Belarus' nonnuclear and neutral status included in our Constitution have been annulled, believes the opposition. Moreover, INTERFAX has disseminated Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's statement, in which he admitted of possibility of Belarus joining NATO, should Russia do so first. "What is going on," complained Zyanon Paznyak, "first the agreement on collective security, now -- NATO?! What about our nonnuclear and neutral status?" (By the way, permanent NATO members do not rush to make room for new members from the former socialist camp. Instead of full NATO membership, they have come forward with the "Partnership for Peace" initiative -- a compromise that has been received by East European countries with skepticism). Belarus should seek Europe's support, stated Paznyak. However, the opposition is to take advantage of the upcoming visit to Belarus by the U.S. President. Clinton will visit Kurapaty and meet with the opposition, possibly, its leader. Furthermore, the latter initiative, according to the opposition, has come from the American side. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the opposition touched upon the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, which, in the opinion of BNF, has political overtones. They also described the government policy as treacherous, and compared the situation in Belarus to the 18th century partition of Poland. At the end of the conference, Zyanon Paznyak expressed hope that 1994 will be the last year of nomenklatura rule.
