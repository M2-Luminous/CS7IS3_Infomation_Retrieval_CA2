In the course of the Treaty's hearings in the Russian parliament in the spring of 1993 a number of arguments were put forward against it and they still define the critical attitude towards START II on the part of some Russian politicians, military brass and representatives from the military-industrial complex. Proceeding from the need for debate on this issue, MN has decided to publish an article received by the newspaper from three experts in this sphere. The article also raises a highly important question bearing on the further development of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The opinions in this article are solely the authors' and in no way reflect MN's position on the Treaty. By printing the article, MN hopes that the discussion of this issue will continue. Recently, growing importance has been placed on the need to elaborate the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). We are well aware of the fact that such ideas quickly travel from the pages of academic journals to official doctrines, accords and programs and this is why we consider it important to understand a likely result of all this. While all past mutual agreements between the USA and the USSR on nuclear armaments stipulated a mere reduction in the number of strategic armaments, leaving each side free to decide on the structure of its strategic nuclear forces, START II for the first time outlines requirements on their qualitative and strategic performance. This treaty envisions a dramatic reduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with multiple independently targeted warheads but the ideas for future elimination of land-based ICBM's and a transition to a certain nuclear diad consisting of strategic aircraft and nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles on board. What Does START II Have in Store for Us? The implementation of START II allows the USA to preserve a "triad" structure relying heavily on the submarine fleet, which reasonably serves the interests of a major sea power. As for our country, according to the treaty we are to eliminate our land-based ICBMs, a measure which would hardly be reasonable or well-founded from the point of view of Russia, a major land power. The gist of all this can well be shown by comparing the structural composition of strategic nuclear forces of each side (in terms of combat charges) prior to the implementation of START II -- 1991, and following it. It is obvious that should land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads be eliminated, Russia would lose a large part of its strategic nuclear forces which were most reliable, i.e. strategic rocket troops (SRT). If START II is implemented, SRT will be left with only "Topol" (SS-25) ICBMs which carry only a single warhead. The USA, according to START II, also must sharply reduce its strategic ICBM's including its "MX" missiles. One should not forget the following however, First, the land-based missiles have never been of the utmost importance to the USA. Second, the American strategic nuclear forces still keep the "Minuteman-3" ICBMs which are capable of carrying multiple warheads, but under START II will be allowed to carry only a single warhead. This will allow them to be reequipped with a separating head section carrying three warheads, since START II does not stipulate any measures for preventing an inversion of those missiles. Also, one should not forget the plan to replace the outdated warheads on 500 Minuteman-3 ICBMs with the 500 modernized warheads which are being removed from 50 MX missiles (each of them carries ten warheads). This actually means a planned replacement of old ammunitions with modernized ones. As to the rest of the components of the nuclear triad affected by START II, the matter is as follows. The USA has traditionally had powerful strategic aircraft which successfully combine the advantage of heavy aircraft-carriers with the possibilities of medium-speed low-flying and difficult-to-detect ALCM strategic rockets. The USSR strategic aircraft existed just "for show" and what Russia has today is not even worth taking into consideration: only several dozen out-of-date Tu-95 heavy bombers and only two modern Tu-160 aircraft. As to the sea-based component of the strategic nuclear forces, Russia's marine constituent of the triad is largely inferior to America's with respect to the accuracy of the submarine ballistic missiles, the noise level of the submarines themselves and their deployment. Suffice it to say that less than 30 percent of Russian submarines are on combat duty at a given moment, this figure for the USA is 80 percent. In addition, the USA possess a most powerful anti-submarine network covering practically all the regions where our submarines conduct patrols. It is also noteworthy that the American attack submarines act, let us say frankly, quite brazenly in Russia's territorial waters, close to the Northern Fleet. What Does the Nuclear Diad Have in Store for Us? One should be aware of what we give up and what we get if the diad is implemented. First, Russia would be deprived of its traditionally most significant and essential component within the strategic forces, i.e. strategic rockets. Second, due to the physical and moral wear-and-tear of strategic aircraft and submarine fleets we would be forced to spend large sums on building new bombers and nuclear submarines, as well as on the renovation of their infrastructure (land, air and sea). The best proof for this can be found in the figures: the cost ratio of a missile fired from a land-based ICBM and that of a submarine-launched ballistic missile is approximately 1:10. This means that an ICBM is ten times as cheap to launch. Third, the ecological risk will still be with us since constant combat patrolling and training flights of heavy bombers as well as the presence of nuclear submarines in the world's seas threaten with disasters such as the "Palomares" (the loss of an atom bomb from an American bomber in Spanish waters in 1960s), or our "Komsomolets" submarine or the American "Thresher" and "Scorpion" submarines. Fourth, the structure of the strategic nuclear forces of Russia and USA will gradually stabilize owing to the qualitatively different performances of strategic aircraft and attack submarines, and discrepancy between Russia's diad and its geopolitical features: US aircraft and submarines can be deployed secretly and are capable of delivering a surprise and uncontrollable attack. Nor should one forget about the US air bases beyond its national borders, nuclear weapons mounted on 18 aircraft-carriers, as well as about sea-based rockets mounted on submarines of the US Navy. What Is the Solution? Thus, additional measures would leave us with less mutual security rather than more. This can be argued with the fact that the above concerns could be justified only by a confrontational approach to the issue. We do not insist on our concerns being absolutely justified. However, if Russia and the USA retain warm relations and trust, wouldn't it be better if we do otherwise: completely liquidate our nuclear-powered air and submarine fleets retaining only ICBMs on our respective territories. The remaining ICBMs of a single-warhead type would be easy to mutually control since they are deployed on national territories. Their maintenance is relatively inexpensive. What is more, their warheads can be removed for better confidence and greater security. This would also mean that the marine component (cruise missiles and nuclear aircraft on the aircraft-carriers) is no doubt, to be destroyed too. All this should result in maximum confidence and equally ensured global stability with the lowest level of nuclear armaments. With other nuclear powers being prepared to adequately reduce their nuclear arsenals, one could also ponder on lowering this level to 500 ICBMs. It goes without saying that the option would stabilize the international situation as a whole: if only Russia and the USA would set a strong example for other members of the "nuclear club," the latter would find it hard to refuse from adequate moves. In addition to apparent political and moral gains one can discern many others. First of all, the sides would enjoy a huge savings of money, eliminating the expenses on production, testing, maintenance, and subsequent retiring the aircraft and submarines (as well as their nuclear armaments), and on the maintenance and development of all kinds of infrastructure for the air and submarine fleets, etc. (Incidentally, the USA could gain a great deal since they would be able to save on a most powerful system of anti-submarine defence.) What is more, by abolishing the air and sea nuclear components, Russia and (especially) the USA would relieve the territories beyond their borders of a potential threat -- by eliminating a network of foreign bases. No doubt, these possibilities could be realized in an atmosphere of genuine and equal partnership and sincere intentions. But if this raises questions, then is it right to initial START II and destroy the missiles which can be kept even under this treaty and to proceed to a diad?
