The sources identified the points so far agreed with the Israeli side as follows: 1. Presence of international forces in Hebron, as a unit including international observers from Norway. 2. Formation of a Palestinian police unit for deployment in Hebron. It will have a joint Israeli-Palestinian command and is expected to consist of several hundred members. 3. Joint patrols of Israelis, Palestinians, and foreign observers to be formed. 4. Seven days after the final agreement between the two delegations to the negotiations, a Palestinian armed police force to enter the West Bank and assume its task of maintaining security. 5. The "caravans" quarter in the Jericho area to be vacated and the Jews evacuated from central Hebron three months later, to be assembled elsewhere, perhaps in the settlement of Qiryat Arba'. 6. All deportees to be allowed to return to Jericho. 7. The PLO leadership to enter Jericho one month after the establishment of a Palestinian police headquarters. A vanguard force may be allowed in before that to pave the way for the arrival of the leadership. The sources say that 'Arafat still has not given his final approval and linked the resumption of the negotiations to the implementation of practical measures, and that there is still some disagreement on details such as the size and powers of the international force. 'Arafat has rejected the idea of international observers along the lines of the International Red Cross and the Relief Agency. There is still some disagreement regarding the status and armament of the Palestinian police force in Hebron and regarding the evacuation of settlers from the area of the holy al-Ibrahimi mosque. According to sources close to the Palestinian president, the main issue which still worries 'Arafat and which has been the subject of Arab and international contacts is the PLO's deteriorating image in Palestinian circles after the Hebron massacre. That is why he has sought support for moves to compel Israel to make concessions on matters relating to the living conditions of the people of the occupied territory, to make them feel that there has indeed been some change. Meanwhile, an official spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], led by Dr. George Habash, has stated that the second Hebron massacre which was committed the day before yesterday -- in which five people were martyred, a large number were wounded, and over 10 houses demolished -- confirmed that Security Council Resolution 904 did nothing for the Palestinian people and only offered a way out for the resumption of the negotiations. The spokesman called for an immediate halt to the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, effective international protection for the Palestinian people, and efforts to dismantle the settlements which, he said, are "a time bomb set to explode at any moment." The Palestinian official spokesman said that it is the duty of the world and of the Security Council to protect the Palestinian people, implement the UN resolutions, and deter the occupation's policy of daily massacres, destruction, and murder. The Palestinian spokesman held Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and his clique largely responsible for what is going on in the occupied territory and urged him to resign. He added: The patriotic forces will continue their struggle by all political and military means and will escalate the intifadah until the downfall of the "Oslo-Cairo agreement."
