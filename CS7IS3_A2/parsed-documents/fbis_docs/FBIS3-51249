First, it is worth explaining that the reasons invoked by the canal administration to justify the ban on Panama Canal employees' participation in the May elections are applicable only to U.S. citizens. To attempt to impose them on Panamanians is to disregard the basic principles of national sovereignty. Second, Panama's Constitution acknowledges the basic right to elect others and be elected to public office. A foreign law cannot infringe on precepts established in the laws of the nation. Third, the canal administrator's assertions are not in keeping with international pledges signed by the Republic of Panama by way of important human rights pacts and international agreements. Article 25 of the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights establishes that all citizens will enjoy the right to participate in the conduction of public affairs directly or through freely elected representatives. Due to all of the above, the CPDH reaffirms the canal area employees' inalienable right to participate fully in the nation's politics. Panamanian Human Rights Committee [signed] Roberto Troncoso B., president.
