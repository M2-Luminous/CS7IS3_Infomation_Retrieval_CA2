FR940407-2-00119 FR940407-2-00064 2. Forum supervises the overall management of the Trust and provides certain administrative facilities and services for the Trust under a Management Agreement with the Trust. Forum also acts as the agent of the Trust in connection with the offering of shares of the Funds under a Distribution Agreement with the Trust. Forum receives no payments for its services as distributor. 3. Shares of the Funds will be offered initially only to the Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (``Minnesota Mutual'') and Fortis Benefits Insurance Company (``Fortis'') to be used as investment vehicles for certain variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance contracts and variable group life insurance contracts. Shares of existing and future Funds also may be offered to separate accounts of insurance companies that are unaffiliated with Minnesota Mutual or Fortis (together, ``Participating Insurance Companies'') to be used to fund various variable annuity contracts, scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued by the unaffiliated insurance companies (collectively with the Fortis and Minnesota Mutual contracts, ``Variable Contracts''). 4. Norwest Investment Management (``Adviser'') serves as Investment Adviser to the Funds. The Adviser is a part of Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., a subsidiary of Norwest Corporation, a multi-bank holding company. The Adviser has not registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act'') in reliance on the exclusions provided under section 202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act and in reliance on the provisions of rules 6e&hyph;2(a)(7) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(a)(6) of the 1940 Act. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (``Trust Account''), rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e&hyph;2 is also available to a separate account's investment adviser, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted by the rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) are available only where the management investment company underlying the Trust Account (``underlying fund'') offers its shares ``exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company.'' Therefore, the relief granted by rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as ``mixed funding.'' 2. Additionally, the relief granted by rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts that fund variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable life insurance separate accounts of one insurance company and separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as ``shared funding.'' 3. In connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a Trust Account, rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) also is available to a separate account's investment adviser, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted by rule 6e&hyph;3(T) are available only where the Trust Account's underlying fund offers its shares ``exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which also their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company *␣*␣*'' Therefore, rule 6e&hyph;3(T) permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account, subject to certain conditions. However, rule 6e&hyph;3(T) does not permit shared funding because the relief granted by rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) is not available with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of a management company that also offers its shares to separate accounts (including variable annuity and flexible premium and scheduled premium variable life insurance separate accounts) of unaffiliated life insurance companies. 4. Applicants therefore request that the Commission, under its authority in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant relief from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder for themselves and for variable life insurance separate accounts of the Participating Insurance Companies, and the principal underwriters and depositors of such separate accounts, to the extent necessary to permit mixed funding and shared funding. 5. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser to, or principal underwriter for, any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to any disqualification specified in sections 9(a)(1) or 9(a)(2). Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) (i) and (ii) and rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii) provide exemptions from section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to limitations on mixed and shared funding. The relief provided by rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person disqualified under section 9(a) to serve as an officer, director, or employee of the life insurer, or any of its affiliates, so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund. The relief provided by rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying fund's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund.
