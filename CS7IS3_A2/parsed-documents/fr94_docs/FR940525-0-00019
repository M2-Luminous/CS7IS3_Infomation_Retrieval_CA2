FR940525-0-00019 FR940525-0-00010 21 CFR Parts 520 and 556 Animal Drugs, Feeds, and Related Products; Fenbendazole Suspension AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The supplemental NADA provides for oral administration of fenbendazole suspension to goats as an anthelmintic. The regulations are also amended to establish a tolerance for drug residues in edible goat tissues. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George K. Haibel, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;133), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1644. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206 North, Somerville, NJ 08876, filed a supplemental NADA 128&hyph;620 that provides for oral administration of a suspension containing 10 percent fenbendazole to nonlactating goats for removal and control of stomach and intestinal worms Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia circumcincta . Also, a tolerance for residues of fenbendazole and its metabolites in edible goat tissues is established. Approval is based in part on data and information in Public Master File (PMF) 5118 established under the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR&hyph;4), Northcentral Region, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824. The supplement is approved as of April 25, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905a and 556.275 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Additionally, the regulations for tolerances and safe concentrations for residues of the drug or its metabolites in cattle and swine are editorially revised to remove any reference to safe concentrations because they are irrelevant for residue monitoring purposes. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and ยง514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and no new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to approval of the supplement were conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects 21 CFR Part 520 Animal drugs. 21 CFR Part 556 Animal drugs, Foods. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR parts 520 and 556 are amended as follows: PART 520_ORAL DOSAGE FORM NEW ANIMAL DRUGS 1.

A tolerance 1 of 0.8 part per million is established for parent fenbendazole (the marker residue) in the liver of cattle and goats. 1 As used in this section: ``tolerance'' refers to a concentration of a marker residue in the target tissue selected to monitor for total residues of the drug in the target animal. (b) Swine . A tolerance1 for marker residues of fenbendazole in swine is not needed. Dated: May 17, 1994. Richard H. Teske, Acting Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine.
