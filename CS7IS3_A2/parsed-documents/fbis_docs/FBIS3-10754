Di Tella said that the agreement was signed after the two countries realized that Argentine-Brazilian bilateral relations were becoming too centered around Mercosur [Common Market of the South], that is, on talks centered around Mercosur concerns, while important bilateral aspects were being left aside. The agreement was discussed last night, following a closed door meeting between representatives of the two countries to analyze Brazil's purchase of subsidized Canadian wheat. Di Tella and Amorim also discussed the Argentine desire to have an option to join NAFTA, which is made up of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, without abandoning Mercosur. The agreement establishes that the two countries' presidents will meet once a year, while representatives of all ministries and the foreign relations vice ministers will meet every three or four months. Such meetings will create "ad hoc" working groups to discuss and follow specific matters. Di Tella and Amorim announced the details of the agreement today, shortly before their meeting with the other Mercosur member countries' foreign and economy ministers. Mercosur is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
