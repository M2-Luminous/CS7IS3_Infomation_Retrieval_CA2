Today, one diplomatic source in Seoul said: As letters have been exchanged between North Korea and the IAEA, the differences of opinion between the two sides have now nearly been settled. The IAEA says it will begin inspections of whatever is settled first, either the additional inspections or the witnessing of the change of nuclear fuel rods. It is believed that the IAEA will conduct other inspections when it visits North Korea.
