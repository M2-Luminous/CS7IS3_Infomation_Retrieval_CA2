These opinions are formulated to ensure the implementation of the "five new provisions" and to correctly handle acts in violation of the "five new provisions." 1. The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading government and party cadres at or above the county (department) level, including leading cadres and their deputies at or above the county (department) level in the party, the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and in administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs. Leading party and government cadres as well as their deputies who are continuing to perform official duties while at retirement age are also included. The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading cadres and their deputies at or above the county (department) level in enterprises (companies) and institutions (federations) of an administrative nature, in trade unions, Communist Youth League [CYL] organs, women's federations, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the China Association for Science and Technology; in party and government-owned newspaper offices, magazine offices, publishing houses, radio stations, television stations, party schools, administrative colleges (schools), and institutions; and in schools under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the CYL, and the All-China Women's Federation. The "five new provisions" are also applicable to cadres and deputies at or above the county (department) level in the aforementioned organs who are not holding leading positions. 2. In accordance with the demands set out in the "Circular Concerning Holding Special Seminars on Democratic Life and Meeting the Requirements of the Provisions on Ensuring the Integrity and Self-Discipline of Leading Cadres" (circular No. 3 issued by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in 1994), leading government and party cadres at or above the county (department) level must conduct inspections in line with the "five new provisions" at special seminars on democratic life. The inspections must be focused on acts in violation of the "five new provisions" after 1 July 1992. Leading cadres must take the initiative in correcting these acts. Party organs and governments at all levels must organize efforts to conscientiously examine and check on the progress of self-correction and self-investigations carried out by leading cadres. 3. Imported luxury cars purchased for the use of leading cadres at the county (department) level and above or obtained in exchange in seeking ease and comfort after 1 July 1992 in violation of the Central Committee's relevant stipulations must be replaced by other vehicles which meet current stipulations. As for those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or those who bought or exchanged cars in violation of stipulations after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, their cars in question will be taken away, with party and government disciplinary actions being taken against the leading cadres concerned. Various categories of motor vehicles procured through an exchange with or a loan from subordinate units, or purchased with apportioned funds by taking advantage of one's authority of office, must -- in the first two cases -- be returned to the original owning units, and -- in the last case -- funds so apportioned must be repaid to the relevant units. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or who exchanged with or loaned motor vehicles from enterprises or subordinate units, or who bought them with apportioned funds, shall be ordered to have them rectified within a specific period, with party and government disciplinary actions being taken against the leading cadres concerned. The practice of purchasing cars for the use of leading cadres with loaned or raised funds, or with special funds, should be checked. Cars purchased by misappropriating funds designated for disaster relief, relief, aiding the poor, or education, as well as those bought against regulations after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should be auctioned off or sold. The proceeds will be used to repay the misappropriated funds in full while party and government disciplinary actions will be taken against the leading cadres concerned and those who are responsible. Smuggled cars that have been purchased illegally should be confiscated with party and government disciplinary actions being taken against those who are responsible. In counties (cities) where wages owed to their staff and workers remained unpaid (the portion for which the financial authorities are to be responsible), cars purchased by their leading party and government organs and other wage-owing units should be investigated. Cars so purchased should be auctioned off or sold, and the proceeds from this are to be used to settle pay owed to their staff and workers. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily or who have violated the provisions after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to have them rectified within a specific period, with party and government disciplinary actions being taken against the leading cadres concerned. 4. Those who bought houses at a price lower than that set by local housing price evaluation bodies in accordance with sale prices of public-owned housing approved by provincial and autonomous regional people's governments, as well as people's governments of municipalities directly under the central government, in violation of the State Council's regulations on housing structural reform and taking advantage of the authority of office, must pay the balance in full. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily or who take advantage of the authority of office to purchase houses by decreasing their sale prices after the publication of "The State Council General Office's Circular on the Question of Preventing Low- Price Sales of Public Housing" on 31 December 1993 shall be ordered to pay the balance within a specific period and face party and government disciplinary actions. Those who buy houses in excess of state-stipulated criteria with the excessive portions not being bought at the market price must pay the difference. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or who did not buy the excessive portions at the market price after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to have these rectified within a specific period and face party and government disciplinary action. Those who take advantage of the authority of office by providing preferential conditions to their children, relatives, and friends in terms of house-purchase eligibility, sources of housing, and purchase prices must surrender their illegally gained benefits. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or who have provided preferential conditions for their children, relatives, and friends in buying houses after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, shall be ordered to surrender their illegally gained benefits and face party and government disciplinary action. Those who use public funds for personal housing renovations in excess of stipulated criteria must repay in full the excess. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily or who have used public funds for excessive renovations after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to repay in full the excess and face party and government disciplinary actions. Those who, prior to the sale of public housing, used public funds to renovate currently occupied houses should be dealt with seriously. Using public funds to renovate houses in excess of the criteria for subsequent personal occupation shall be handled according to the preceding clause. 5. Checks should be carried out on leading party and government cadres who, while carrying out their official duties within the country, have indulged in excessive dining and drinking by pursuing luxury and extravagance and in violation of food and lodging regulations set by the central authorities, and in excess of local reception criteria formulated or approved by provincial and autonomous regional governments as well as by governments of municipalities directly under the central government. For serious cases which have caused bad influences, the offenders should be ordered to carry out the appropriate economic compensation and face party and government disciplinary action. Those who fail to check and rectify voluntarily this issue or who have violated the regulations after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to pay the appropriate economic compensation and face party and government disciplinary action. After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, responsible persons of relevant departments and units found to be pursuing luxury and extravagance by receiving leading cadres in an extravagant and wasteful manner and in excess of stipulated criteria shall face party and government disciplinary action. After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, responsible persons found to be hosting with public funds and equipment exclusive dance parties for leading cadres in commercially run dance halls and other places shall face party and government disciplinary action. Leading cadres attending dance parties hosted exclusively in their honor should bear a certain portion of the expenses and should face party and government disciplinary action. 6. Checks should be carried out of those who indulge in huge extravagance and waste by capitalizing on such occasions as their own marriages and funerals, job transfers, birthdays, and housewarmings, as well as those of their family members. Those who make use of the perks of their job to indulge in huge extravagance and waste should be checked on. Those who fail to voluntarily carry out such checks, or who have made use of their job perks to indulge in huge extravagance and waste after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, shall be ordered to do so and face party and government disciplinary action. Those who take advantage of their positions to use public funds and properties or who accumulate wealth through unfair means by capitalizing on occasions such as their own marriages or marriages and the funerals of their family members; through job transfers, birthdays, and housewarmings must return the public funds and properties they have used and pay compensation for using them; money and materials received by taking advantage of the aforementioned occasions should be turned over to the state's coffers. In more serious cases, party and administrative disciplinary punishment should be meted out. Those who do not actively carry out checks and make corrections, or who violated the provisions after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to return and pay compensation for the public funds and properties they used or turn over the money and materials they had collected by taking the advantage of the aforementioned occasions to the state and receive party and administrative disciplinary punishment. 7. Those who borrow public funds for personal profit-seeking or illegal activities must immediately return the public funds borrowed and pay interest on them for the corresponding period at the rate set by the bank. The profits and illegal income earned should be confiscated and turned over to the state's coffers; party and administrative disciplinary punishment should be meted out. Those who do not actively carry out checks and make corrections, or who borrowed public funds for profit-seeking or illegal activities after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should be dealt with harshly. Those who borrow public funds to buy or build private houses for themselves or their relatives should, by the end of September 1994, return the public funds and pay interest on them for the corresponding period at the rate set by the bank. Those who fail to do so by this date, or who have borrowed public funds to buy or build private houses after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should be ordered to return the borrowed public funds and be given party and administrative disciplinary punishment. Those who borrow public funds for other reasons should repay all the arrears in public funds by the end of September 1994. Those who fail to do so by this date and those who have borrowed public funds for other reasons after the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and who have not returned them in six months should be ordered to repay them. In serious cases, party and administrative disciplinary punishment should be meted out. For those who really have difficult lives and cannot return on time the borrowed public funds, an installment repayment plan should be worked out and a moratorium can be granted after approval. 8. In the course of self-checking, problems that constitute graft, bribery, embezzlement, and other mistakes should be dealt with according to relevant stipulations; any violations of criminal law should be transferred to the judicial organs for handling. 9. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, and ministries and commissions under the central state organs may draw up specific rules for implementation in light of actual conditions and these opinions on implementation and should report these to the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the record. Localities and units which have conducted checks in light of the rules set by provincial-level party and government organs and which have dealt with the problems before the release of these opinions on implementation may choose not to repeat checks and the handling of relevant problems mentioned in the "five new provisions." 10. The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection Commission is responsible for the interpretation of these opinions on their implementation.
