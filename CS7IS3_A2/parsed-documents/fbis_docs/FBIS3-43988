In a joint statement, the General Confederation of Labor, one of the country's six labor unions movements, and four independent labor unions of civil servants have deemed "ridiculous" this "timid increase" promised by the authorities to cushion the effects of the devaluation of the CFA franc. They described as "meaningless" the time period allowed for the implementation of the increase, since most of the prices for consumer goods did not wait until April to go up and since particularly, they stated, price control is an "illusion." They also stressed the contradiction existing between the salary promises made by the government and the increases it authorized for imported rice -- 23.5 percent -- or for fuels -- 38.6 percent. "The government has left us with only one option -- struggling to make our voices heard. It will assume full responsibility for what happens," the signatories to the statement said, calling on their members "mobilize to respond properly to the situation."
