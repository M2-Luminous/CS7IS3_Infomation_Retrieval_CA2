FDA is taking this action in response to requests to allow additional time for public comment. DATES: Written comments by November 15, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 3, 1994 (58 FR 28821, 28822), FDA issued two documents entitled ``Review of General Biologics and Licensing Regulations'' (Docket No. 94N&hyph;0066) and ``Review of Regulations for Blood Establishments and Blood Products'' (Docket No. 94N&hyph;0080). Interested persons were given until August 17, 1994, to respond to the documents. The American Blood Resources Association has requested a 90-day extension of the comment periods for the two above mentioned documents. The Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have requested a 60-day extension for the general biologics and licensing regulations document. In order to allow interested persons to fully respond to the requests for comments, FDA believes it is in the public interest to extend the comment period to allow interested persons to carefully review the regulations and submit written comments. Therefore, FDA is granting the request by extending the comment periods for both documents to November 15, 1994. Interested persons may, on or before November 15, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the appropriate docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: August 12, 1994. Ronald G. Chesemore, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
