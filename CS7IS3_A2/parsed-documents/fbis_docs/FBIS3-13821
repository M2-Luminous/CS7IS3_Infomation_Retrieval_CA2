In the morning, the commission heard testimony from settlers. One settler, who was praying in the Cave of the Patriarchs at the time of the massacre, "ruled out the chance that Barukh Goldstein had an accomplice." Dani Gur-Arye reports: "The settlers who came in contact with Barukh Goldstein the morning of the massacre described nothing out of the ordinary in his behavior. Moti Ungar, the security guard at Qiryat Arba' who drove Goldstein to the cave that Friday morning, said he was calm and lucid like on any other day. Ungar said the two men discussed trivial things, such as the medical equipment on the ambulance at Qiryat Arba'. He said Goldstein was carrying an Israeli-made Glilon rifle and several cartridges. Just before leaving the jeep, Goldstein handed Ungar his car keys, asking that they be delivered to his wife. "Another settler, Ilan Tur, ran into Goldstein inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. Tur said: Goldstein asked me why the door separating the two halls in the cave were closed. I explained that Muslims were praying in one hall to mark Ramadan, while Jews were praying in another hall. He, obviously annoyed, said the Jews are entitled to pray on Purim. Tur said Goldstein had a gun and an automatic weapon, probably a Glilon. He said he later heard shots fired from what sounded like one weapon. He concludes from this that only one gunman was involved in the massacre." In the afternoon session, the commission heard border policemen who were supposed to be guarding at the Cave of the Patriarchs at the time of the event, and "all said there were clear orders not to fire at Jewish settlers under any circumstances." Mark Weiss reports: "All the border policemen testifying before the commission of inquiry said they had received the same orders concerning open-fire regulations against settlers. Army orders were clear-cut: Not to shoot at a settler under any circumstances. They were to wait until the settler had stopped shooting before approaching him. The judges challenged the border policemen repeatedly over the logic of such an order, but the answers were always the same: These were the orders, and we didn't question them. "Three border policemen who were supposed to be guarding at the Cave of the Patriarchs failed to arrive on time. The border policemen admitted there were arguments over who should guard and problems with the names written on the guard list. It took at least 20 critical minutes to locate three people to guard. Most of those testifying claimed that some of the border policemen on the list were not even on the base at the time. "By the time the guards eventually reached the cave, the massacre had already taken place. Barukh Azaza, the Ethiopian driver who drove the border policemen to the cave, denied under questioning that he had fired any shots despite testimony from colleagues that he had fired into the air."
