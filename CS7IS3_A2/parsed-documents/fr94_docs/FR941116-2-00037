FR941116-2-00037 FR941116-2-00024 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;40&hyph;000] Koch Gateway Pipleline Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization November 9, 1994. Take notice that on October 27, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway), P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;40&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to acquire a six-inch metering and regulating station from Gulf South Pipeline Company (Gulf South), under Koch Gateway's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;430&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Koch Gateway states that the metering and regulating station is located on its Index 198&hyph;3 transmission line in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. Koch Gateway proposes to acquire and operate as its own jurisdictional facility, a skid-mounted dual six-inch metering and regulating station and appurtenances from Gulf South, an intrastate pipeline company. The meter station currently serves Vista Chemical Corporation (Vista), and end user, near Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana with natural gas deliveries under Koch Gateway's ITS Rate Schedule which was authorized in Docket No. ST94&hyph;3043. Koch Gateway states that the acquisition will not require any construction or ground disturbance. There is not to be any impact on Koch Gateway's curtailment plan since there are no changes proposed in the existing level of service. The service provided through these facilities will remain within the current entitlements provided in the existing ITS agreement with Koch Gateway. The capacity is sufficient enough for Koch Gateway to render the proposed service without detriment or disadvantage to its other existing customers. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28213 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
