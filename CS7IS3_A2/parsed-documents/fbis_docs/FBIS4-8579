As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has declared null and void the pact between the two great tyrants of this century, Hitler and Stalin, by which Bessarabia split from Romania in 1940. ``It is regrettable that the recent vote of the Parliament in Chisinau reconfirms the criminal pact and repeals the right of the Romanian nation to live within the boundaries of its entire historical and spiritual space. ``Owing to the geographical position, culture, history and traditions, the normal place of our brothers on the left bank of the Prut is, no doubt, with us, in the big family of the European nations and not as part of Euro-Asian structures. ``We think that the application of the Republic of Moldova for admission to the Council of Europe, Moldova's signing among the first of the Partnership for Peace plan and the development of its relations with Western countries are significant steps, they express the Republic of Moldova's wish to be part of the present general process of European integration. ``Romania's Chamber of Deputies therefore declares in front of the whole world that it energetically supports the normal efforts of the Republic of Moldova to get integrated with the European structures and condemns the actions of political forces that are making an attempt to integrate Moldova in the old structures. ``The special relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova, based on a community in terms of kinship, national language, culture and history are and will continue to be one of the main priorities of Romania's foreign policy. ``Irrespective of situations specific to one moment or another, Romania, the Romanian people will continue to keep close to their brothers on the left bank of the Prut, to back them on a political, diplomatic, material and spiritual plane, in order to overcome the great problems confronting them.''
