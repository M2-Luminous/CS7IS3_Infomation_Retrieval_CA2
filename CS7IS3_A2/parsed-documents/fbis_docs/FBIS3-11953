FRAPH reminds the American Embassy that the Haitian Constitution remains a Haitian matter. [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording] Given the irresponsible behavior of some of our politicians, the U.S. ambassador thought it was useful to remind the Haitian political sector, all ot them together, that there is a Constitution in Haiti and that our country's fundamental law provides very clearly in Article 1: Haiti is an indivisible, sovereign, independent, democratic, and social republic. FRAPH is making a point in referring to the tactlessness of reminding all foreigners who are not subtly interfering in our internal matters that Haiti's law formally prohibits interference. FRAPH urges the Haitian people to be more vigilant to safeguard the higher interests of the nation. Therefore, since it is a matter of commemorating the seventh anniversary of the vote on our constitution, we invite all foreign personalities to carefully read our fundamental law, particularly Article 19. As for Haitians who intend to respond to this invitation, we tell them that the Haitian nation will finally know who are the real stateless persons and who are the real collaborators.
