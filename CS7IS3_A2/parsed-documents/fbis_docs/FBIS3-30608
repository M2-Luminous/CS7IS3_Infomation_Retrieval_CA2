According to the agreement, the SSJ and the LDP will establish economic, cultural, sports and, it was stressed, military cooperation "in the event of the endangering of the Serbian, Russian, or other Orthodox nations." Raznjatovic stressed that cooperation between the two parties began when there were seven LDP members -- who are now in prominent posts in this party -- with his volunteers in Krajina. Videnkin told journalists that the LDP had given Arkan "a secret electronic weapon" which is activated by "the fusion [spajanje] of protons and neutrons at high temperature." He pointed out that this weapon would be used if towns in Bosnia and Serbia were bombed and added that "the world does not yet know what force this weapon has." The LDP deputy chairman specified that this weapon acts in such a way that "in a few hours it can kill a person, without him knowing why he is dying." According to him, this same lethal weapon could be "used in small quantities and have a beneficial effect on people." He explained that "the secret weapon" had not reached the Serbian side through state channels, because neither the LDP nor the SSJ are ruling parties. A laboratory where experiments are carried out and the professor who created the weapon, which, Videnkin said, was tried out successfully near Brcko recently, were also made available to Arkan. Asked where this weapon was, Raznjatovic stressed that "neither the weapon, which arrived in the form of a model, nor the laboratory, nor the professor, are on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" and that the Yugoslav authorities know nothing of this. Arkan stated that this was a matter of a "weapon of peace," because it repels attacks and that next time it would probably be tested in Cyprus.
