Officially, the former prime minister has retired from the front line; however, in reality, it is reported that he still controls the faction as its supreme leader. The source got the information from a senior foreign ministry official through his friend, a French doctor, who says that a senior leader of the Pol Pot faction has been hospitalized in Beijing. The source said: "Judging by the medical history and other information, there is no question that it is either former Prime Minister Pol Pot or Noun Chea, ex-chairman of the People's Representative Assembly." Another Western diplomatic source says he has information that "former Prime Minister Pol Pot was first hospitalized in Thailand," but that, "he was later transferred to Beijing when his condition became more serious and the hospital was incapable of treating him." Pol Pot took power in 1975 and ruled Cambodia till he was ousted in 1978 by the aggression of the Vietnamese troops. He has been denounced as the ruler responsible for massacring one million of his own people through forced labor, torture and execution. Pol Pot has made no public appearances since 1979. However, it is reported he maintains a strong influence in the country. For example, he constantly plays a decisive role in the faction's conferences on important policies or operations. A witness reports seeing Pol Pot during the attack by government troops on Pailin last March, but no confirmation has been made of this report. According to a military source in Bangkok, Pol Pot has reportedly suffered for a long time from heart disease.
