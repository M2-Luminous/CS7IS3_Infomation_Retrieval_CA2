Butrus-Ghali unequivocally laid the blame for the deadlock in the latest round of negotiations on the Turkish Cypriot side which, he said, did not have the political will to reach an agreement on the implementation of the confidence-building measures. He went even further, submitting five options to the Security Council on how to proceed after the latest failure. One is to withdraw UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] from the island, which would, in effect, be a reward for Rauf Denktas intransigence, as it is the Greek Cypriot side that wants the peacekeeping force to remain in Cyprus. He also suggested the possibility of using "coercive" measures against the side which did not cooperate. Another option would be to allow time for reflection by the Security Council and the guarantor powers, not ruling out the calling of an international conference. The two remaining options are more familiar: a return to the set of ideas and the map, or another attempt to implement the measures, even though he admitted that the last option would fail. President Glavkos Kliridhis got exactly what he had been demanding in the report--the side responsible for the deadlock was blamed and the secretary-general suggested alternative courses of action. Now, whether the Security Council would adopt the suggestion for "coercive" measures is far from certain. What is certain, and in no way subject to interpretation, is Butrus-Ghali's assertion that the Turkish Cypriot side is lacking the political will for any agreement to be reached. He also exposed Denktas's favorite argument in rejecting UN proposals, about the Turkish Cypriots' security concerns--he did not see how this security could in any way be threatened by the implementation of the measures. In addition to this, he was emphatic (including documents to prove his point) in denying Denktas's claim that there had been changes to the original UN package. But things must be kept in perspective. Kliridhis, unlike his predecessor, is not the type of politician to present the report as some major triumph, even though he deserves credit for his skillful handling. He ignored the criticism from all directions, calculating that Denktas's lack of political will would be exposed if he played his cards right, which he did. No one can say of course that a Cyprus settlement, as envisaged by the Greek Cypriots, is any closer now; nor can anyone forecast what line the Security Council would take when it discusses the report. However the report could prove quite useful to the government next January when the European Commission will take a decision on Cyprus' application for membership of the European Union.
