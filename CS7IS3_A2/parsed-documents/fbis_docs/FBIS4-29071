FBIS4-29071 "dreas115_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea Envoy to France Says U.S. Agreed to IAEA Withdrawal Envoy to France Says U.S. Agreed to IAEA Withdrawal BR1506134494 Paris LIBERATION in French 15 Jun 94 p 29 BR1506134494 Paris LIBERATION French BFN [Romain Franklin report: "Pyongyang Confirms Withdrawal From IAEA"] [Text] Pak Tong-chun, the representative of the general delegation of North Korea in France, confirmed yesterday to LIBERATION that his country had withdrawn from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and that the United States, which is the depositary for the ratification instruments of the signatory states, had been officially notified of this on Monday, 13 June, in accordance with the required procedure. Nevertheless, North Korea is still a member of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). On the other hand, "if sanctions are decided by the United Nations," Mr. Pak said, North Korea "would no longer have any reason to stay in the NPT" and "will declare war on all those who seek to align themselves with the American strategy aimed at strangling our Republic," which, he continued, "can no longer tolerate attacks on its sovereignty." The North Korean representative also asserted that the United States accepted the principle of a withdrawal of its military forces from South Korea (37,000 men) within the framework of a "secret" bilateral agreement concluded between the two countries in New York in December 1993 and signed in February. Pak did not provide any evidence of this, however. "The United States asked us not to divulge this, but since then it has reneged on all its promises," he continued. A State Department spokesman responsible for Korean affairs contacted in Washington refused to comment on these allegations. He did confirm, however, that a "broad, comprehensive approach" was the "goal of the talks held between North Korea and the United States." According to him, Washington agreed, among other things, to provide "a guarantee of the non-use of nuclear arms on the Korean peninsula and diplomatic recognition" of the Pyongyang regime. In exchange, Pak said, Pyongyang "will return to the NPT and will once again authorize ad hoc IAEA inspections." "If the negotiations between North Korea and Washington had carried on as we requested, the whole problem would have been resolved," Pak said. However, the United States repeated on Monday that direct negotiations with Pyongyang would only be possible if North Korea "regularized its situation with the IAEA." The United States is preparing to submit a preliminary draft resolution to the United Nations aimed at imposing "phased" sanctions. This process will require "a certain amount of time," Washington said. It might take even longer since Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday that he wanted to make any "phased" sanctions "dependent" on the holding of a international conference on Korea. President Clinton does not want this proposed conference to become an "obstacle" to the imposing of sanctions.
