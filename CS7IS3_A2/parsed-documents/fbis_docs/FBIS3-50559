(Checher) has said that the government's concern has been to make the civilian population a priority, and this is why the national Army had not intervened earlier as the subversives were occupying San Cristobal de las Casas. He urged the people to act prudently to avoid being controlled by panic and rumors and to facilitate the work of the national Army to reinforce the protection and security of the affected towns. (Checher) has said that government efforts to establish a dialogue have not been well received, and this shall be construed as defiance and contempt toward the institutions; this, he added, has changed his attitude on the actions that should be adopted to immediately restore order, peace, and tranquility, which have always prevailed in the State of Chiapas. Thus, the governor has urged the population to remain calm. He said that with the government's leadership, Chiapas society will continue to improve its standard of living with strength, firmness, and enthusiasm, and with the dignity of a people who know where they are headed, because they have a well-defined course and fate. This was the message of encouragement issued by the governor of Chiapas State to his people.
