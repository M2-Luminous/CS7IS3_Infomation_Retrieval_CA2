This agreement is also an important step toward the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and integral state. For various reasons the SDA has been of the opinion that the first president of the federation should be current President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, which the public has been informed of with a statement from the 3 April session of the SDA Executive Concil. However, on that occasion already President Izetbegovic expressed the opinion that the agreement and implementation of the federation's constitution must not be put at risk on this issue, especially if the Croats demonstrate willingness to embrace solutions that are in the interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina. When the talks became deadlocked two days ago, President Izetbegovic informed the members of our negotiating team in Vienna of his position in writing, and this, among other things, helped to overcome the crisis. The Muslim people must have faith in the decisions of President Izetbegovic and there is no reason for concern. The SDA has an absolute majority in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and according to the constitution of the federation, the Assembly has overall control over the work of the army and the government. Besides, President Izetbegovic remains the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency until peace is restored. Finally, President Izetbegovic remains the undisputed leader of the Muslim people in the country and outside it," the SDA statement declares. "The Croatian Peasants' Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina believes that the Vienna agreement is yet another step toward the goal established by the Washington agreement. The party's opinion is that all this represents a painstaking progress toward the goal that is not as close as it would appear. The Croatian Peoples' Party considers it most important that the war between the two peoples has stopped." It is also reported that "the Croatian Peasants' Party expresses hope that with the assistance of the international community and the instruments that are at its disposal, the Serbian side, too, will join the agreement of the two peoples to preserve the integral Bosnia-Herzegovina within the internationally recognized borders." "The municipal committee of the Croatian Democratic Community Sarajevo expresses its satisfaction over the outcome of the talks in Vienna, hoping that the implementation of this agreement will be completed soon, secretary of this party Stjepan (Dacic), stated for B-H PRESS. He expressed hope that this agreement will give impetus to a resolution of all disputes and promote the relations between the Croatian and the Bosniak people. We expect that the constitutional assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation will soon pass appropriate decisions that will speed up the implementation of the Vienna agreement." The radio then goes on to report that "the Liberal Bosniak Organization [LBO] is of the opinion that the creation of situation that led to uncertainty in the implementation of the provisions of the federation's constitution was unnecessary, LBO Vice President Salih [word indistinct], said in light of the [word indistinct] agreement on federation in Vienna. According to him it is clear from this agreement that it involved a conflict of a personal nature and the grand aspirations of some individuals to assume certain posts. The LBO supports the decision that the function of federation president be performed by a member of one people and the post of prime minister by a representative of the other people. In this sense the party supports the president of the federation coming from among the Croatian people, however, this candidate must be determined for an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regarding the cantonal setup, the LBO does not consider it to be a firm territorial form of demarcation but rather an administrative form of government." In contrast to the above reactions, the radio reports that Dragutin Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Civic Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina from Zenica, "has said that the agreement on cantonal [word indistinct] is causing the Croatian Civic Party concern." Cicak adds that, "we cannot get into the heads of those who are working on the Bosnia-Herzegovina state constitution that the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens are sovereign over the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina territory." Cicak further states that the drawing of internal borders with ethnic connotations is "nonsensical." "We are once more creating an atmosphere that will again lead to more conflicts in linguistics, education, sport, culture, and so on, and which will again lead nowhere." He assails the allocation of ministerial and other functions on an ethnic basis as "idiocy leading nowhere," because the country is currently suffering from an acute shortage of capable cadres anyway.
