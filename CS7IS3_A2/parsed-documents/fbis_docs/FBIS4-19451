[Kanther] No, the thieves have not been identified yet. [BILD] The crime situation is deteriorating in Germany -- do you still walk around without fear? [Kanther] I feel safe. Yet, I do understand the concern of many citizens in view of the rising crime rate. It is the responsibility of the state to free citizens of this subjective threat. This is why I have initiated the anticrime law. [BILD] What do you think of the idea of citizens taking care of their protection themselves? [Kanther] Nothing. We do not need vigilante groups with armbands and wielding sticks. This does not create security. Another question is the increased use of volunteer police assistants. Qualified private security enterprises can also do good service, for example in the protection of buildings. [BILD] What sort of work might the volunteer assistants be asked to do? [Kanther] Pensioners could be called back from retirement to help do clerical work. I can even imagine volunteer officers driving patrol cars. This would release more officers for real police tasks. [BILD] Why are you called the "black sheriff?" [Kanther] Honestly, I do not care what people call me. However, if this label is intended to mean that I am a firm supporter of law and order, then I have nothing against it.
