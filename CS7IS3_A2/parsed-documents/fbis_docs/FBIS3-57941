[Bianco] First of all, we will confirm our confidence in him. We simply need to stress that our group is the one that has been most consistent in supporting his government and his policies, up to and including the approval of the Finance Bill, even if it meant we had to make unpopular decisions. [L'UNITA] Yes, but are there not many DC signatories to the no-confidence motion as well? [Bianco] Many colleagues have already clarified the reason they signed. They were afraid that parliament would be dissolved without them being consulted, and we would not have accepted that. Others, like [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto, felt such consultation to be superfluous, whereas for us it is not superfluous at all. Many of the signatures on the motion can be explained by the conviction that it was the only tool likely to bring about a parliamentary debate. Besides, even [Radical leader] Pannella today confirmed his confidence in Ciampi. [L'UNITA] But Pannella also wants a second Ciampi government. [Bianco] Nobody can stop him asking for another government; the important thing is that we confirm our confidence. Pannella also raises some serious questions, such as the possiblity, for example, that Ciampi's ministers might take sides with one or the other of the alliances taking the field in the forthcoming elecion campaign. [L'UNITA] Are there any conditions attached to your confirmation of confidence? [Bianco] We want the parliamentary debate to confirm confidence in Ciampi and the legislative term to continue for a few weeks more, although ideally we are in favor of the general election being held in June, at the same time as the European elections. [L'UNITA] Why? [Bianco] In these few weeks -- and I am talking about three or four, until 10 February -- we could address the modification to Article 138 of the Constitution, the right of Italians abroad to vote, the Court of Accounts, the modification to the preventive custody law, and the law on public contracts. Many of these laws have already reached the legislative stage in their respective parliamentary committees. And in any case the tax decree and the decree on RAI [Italian State Broadcasting Corporation] must be approved by a parliament in the fullness of its powers. [L'UNITA] So, in your view, the Ciampi government did not finish its job with the election laws and the Finance Bill. Are you asking for a renegotiation of the program? [Bianco] The fact that the government passed two decrees at the end of the year means that it sees them as essential for this legislative term. [L'UNITA] What if Ciampi were not to play ball? [Bianco] I think that is unlikely, because Ciampi has always been very respectful toward the will of parliament. We hope to gain the agreement of all the groups. We are not going to cling stubbornly to our position; we are prepared to discuss things with others. We are asking for agreement to be reached over the dissolution of parliament and for the essential things to get done in the meantime. That is the position we are putting forward. [L'UNITA] Is it a position you need to adopt in order to quell internal dissent? [Bianco] We have faith in our colleagues' sense of discipline. I have summoned a meeting of the DC group in the lower house for 11 January, and that is when I will ask for confidence in Ciampi to be confirmed.
