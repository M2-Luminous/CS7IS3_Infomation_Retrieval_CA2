The figure marked an increase of 29 percent over the previous year, surpassing the national industrial growth rate. Officials said it was the first time that Hainan's industrial output exceeded its agricultural yield. Last year, Hainan saw a year-end industrial profit of 430 million yuan ($49.4 million), up 164 percent over the previous year. Revenue collected in the sector hit 358 million yuan ($41.15 million). Meanwhile, 800 million yuan ($92 million) was invested during the year to modernize industrial production in the province. The figure was 64 percent more than in 1992. A meeting held to discuss industrial strategy, which concluded last week, set a target of 30-percent growth for industrial production in the new year. Industrial firms are being encouraged to pump out a total of 12.1 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in industry output in 1994. The annual industrial profit is expected to grow by 24 percent to hit 534 million yuan ($61.4 million) if that goal is reached. Provincial officials have also vowed to reduce the number of enterprises operating in the red by 40 this year. This would represent a drop of 7.5 percent in the number of enterprises running a deficit.
