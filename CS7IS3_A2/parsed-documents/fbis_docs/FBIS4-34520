The announcement was made after a meeting with Planning Minister Beni Veras, with whom he discussed a timetable for releasing financial resources in 1994 and in 1995. No priority project for the 1996/97 period was selected at yesterday's meeting. According to Iglesias, the Franco government preferred to leave the decision in the hands of the next administration, which will take power in January. [passage omitted] Iglesias said the lack of Brazilian matching funds for the projects has caused no difficulties between the IDB and the federal government. According to Agencia Brasil, Iglesias and Planning Minister Beni Veras said that the only difficulties have to do with project management. Iglesias said that projects worth $1.2 billion should be approved this year. This figure is higher than the $1 billion mark the government was expecting for this period. "This shows our confidence in the country," Iglesias said, praising the fact that the Real Plan was preceded by fiscal control measures. Says an IDB source: "They [not further identified] do not know much about the plan, but they have great expectations about stabilization; and wherever Brazil goes, Latin America will go." Projects amounting to $1.4 billion are listed for 1995. Iglesias said that it is their intention to earmark 50 percent of these resources for social undertakings including improved health, sanitation, education, transportation, and infrastructure facilities. There are, however, other projects intended for strengthening the institutions such as one concerning the restructuring of the Federal Revenue Secretariat, which is expected to receive between $78 million and $80 million in 1995. Iglesias also announced that the IDB will donate $20 million for projects involving assistance to street children in six cities: Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Teresina, Salvador, and Recife. The money will be handed over to nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) operating in those cities. The donation will be approved by the IDB "board" on 29 June. He said: "This will be a pioneer project in Latin America and shows the direction the IDB is taking." [passage omitted]
