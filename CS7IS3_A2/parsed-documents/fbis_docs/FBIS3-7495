They also expected few impacts from the decision on their businesses because production in the U.S. now surpasses exports. "We view it as an appropriate move amid increasing switches among Japanese carmakers to local production from exports," said Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. "We will pursue a further production shift in the future." Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., also said the Japanese step is in line with an agreement in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, completed last December, which determined voluntary restraints on exports as a "grey-zone" measure. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association also said the step will have "no major impact on Japanese makers because U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments have long stayed below annual ceilings." Japanese makers, prompted by the yen's appreciation, have started to boost their production in the U.S. since the latter half of the 1980s. In 1993, locally-made cars numbered 1.54 million units, exceeding exports in volume for the first time ever. U.S.-bound exports have been below the ceilings since fiscal 1987, and are expected to amount to 1.65 million units in fiscal 1993 through March 31, 300,000 units short of the upper limit.
