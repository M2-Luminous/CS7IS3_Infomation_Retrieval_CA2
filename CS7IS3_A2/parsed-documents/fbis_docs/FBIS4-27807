FBIS4-27807 "dreas107_a_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Resigned MITI Official, Naito's Case Resurfaces Resigned MITI Official, Naito's Case Resurfaces Official: Case `Fully Explained' OW0206093794 Tokyo KYODO in English 0738 GMT 2 Jun 94 OW0206093794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade ministry official said Thursday [2 June] the ministry has fully explained a personnel controversy that took place last year. "So I have no additional comments," said Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, referring to what ended in the voluntary resignation of a ministry bureau chief. Speaking to reporters, Kumano said, "I want to refrain from specific comments on the matter because the issue is very delicate." The remark came after parliamentary business stalled earlier in the day due to renewed bickering over last December's controversy at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). In mid-December, Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary and then MITI minister, asked Masahisa Naito, head of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, to step down to take the blame for an allegedly unfair promotion he gave to a MITI official who was leaving the ministry to run in a national election. The request, which ended in Naito's voluntary resignation, prompted public criticism regarding political interference in the bureaucracy. Naito, tipped as a likely choice for the next vice MITI minister, said such a promotion was customary at MITI for officials who leave to run in elections. Kumano said MITI's director of the secretariat clarified the situation surrounding the resignation at a House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday's lower house budgetary committee meeting stalled following the coalition parties' rejection of an opposition demand that Naito be summoned to the Diet to give details about the personnel controversy. Naito, who is now in the United States, was quoted as saying by an opposition interpellator during the committee session that he is prepared to return home "tomorrow." Kumagai said at his last news conference as MITI chief in April that his resignation request to Naito was necessary to "rejuvenate the management of MITI." The latest development over the MITI controversy came in connection with the question of whether Kumano will retain the current post of vice MITI chief in an overall personnel reshuffle to be made shortly. Some within MITI have said he should resign to take responsibility for causing the controversy.
