FR940405-2-00062 FR940405-2-00037 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Announcement 427] Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for cooperative agreements to: (1) Continue monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with the leading causes of premature death through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); and (2) Improve the State capacity to analyze program data collected through the BRFSS and ensure the use of analyzed data in program planning, monitoring, evaluation, determining program priorities, policy development, assessing trends, and targeting relevant population groups. Survey data collection will continue to be encouraged and supported, but the emphasis of this announcement is the analysis and routine use of collected data and information to actively direct successful program development. This announcement addresses two distinct levels of support. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which consists of using BRFSS data for planning, developing, integrating, coordinating and evaluating chronic disease(s) prevention and control programs, and monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with leading causes of premature death. The second is an Enhanced Program, which is intended to increase State capacity to analyze BRFSS data and institutionalize routine use of BRFSS data to develop meaningful interventions and direct program development. Applicants may apply for a Core Capacity Program or for both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program. Enhanced Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity Program awards. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area, Surveillance Data Systems. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section Where to Obtain Additional Information.) Authority This program is authorized under section 317(k)(3) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Assistance will be provided only to the official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities. This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Funding priority consideration for the Core Capacity Program will be given to States currently funded for BRFSS. Eligible applicants have been restricted to official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities because: 1. The conduct of statewide health promotion, health education and risk reduction programs directed towards reducing the prevalence of these behavioral risks in the population lie solely with State health departments.
