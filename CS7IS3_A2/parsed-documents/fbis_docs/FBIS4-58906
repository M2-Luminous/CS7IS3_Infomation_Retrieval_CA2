In a statement issued Saturday [7 May], the OIC expressed hope that usual stability and cordiality among the people of Yemen would be restored, differences would be discarded and efforts would be exerted to confirm their unity and resort to dialogue and understanding rather than violence and fighting. The OIC called on the leaders and people of Yemen to show restraint and remain committed to their firm belief and wisdom and work together for the progress of Yemen and the protection of its immortal civilization. OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid called on Yemeni leaders, ulemas and politicians to work as one for the best interests of the country. He asked them to find points of agreement and reduce points of disagreement and withdraw massed troops separating brothers to their previous positions. Dr. al-Ghabid once again confirmed the OIC's readiness to exert good Islamic offices and mediation efforts out of its Islamic duty and in conformity with the principles of Islam.
