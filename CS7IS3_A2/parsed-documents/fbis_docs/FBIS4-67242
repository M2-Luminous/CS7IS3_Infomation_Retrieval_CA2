During the operation, conducted in the municipality of Eduardo Neri and complying with a search warrant issued by the first district judge of criminal proceedings, with headquarters in Chilpancingo, the federal forces arrested a presumed drug trafficker. According to the briefing report submitted to the Federal Judicial Police general director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, by the force's deputy commissioner in Guerrero State, Jose Pulido Marin, the processing center was located at No. 10 Allende Street, in the San Sebastian district of the settlement of Zumpango del Rio. The action followed several investigations of chemicals arriving at that domicile, and of strong odors emitted there at night. With the data collected by federal agents, the federal social representative requested that the pertinent judge grant a search warrant to inspect the domicile. When implemented, it enabled them to discover the clandestine laboratory, where they captured the presumed drug dealer identified as Enrique Dimas Gonzalez, with 35 million new pesos' worth of drugs in his possession. During the execution of the judicial warrant, the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by the aforementioned court's clerk, noted the presence of a loaded 7.65-caliber squad pistol, a 22-caliber rifle, and 21 useful 22-caliber cartridges. Commander Marin also reported that various implements were found on the site, such as trays, jugs containing alcohol, bags of coarse and fine salt, two fumigators, a galvanized vat, and adhesive tape for wrapping the packages of heroin. Moreover, the federal social representative confiscated a late-model pickup truck with Guerrero State registration, also carrying metal containers used in the aforementioned laboratory. In connection with this case, the representative of the Attorney General's Office in the state, Joel Ortiz Hernandez, stressed that an investigation is being made of the possible participation of other persons presumably assigned to transport the narcotic to the U.S. drug market. He noted that, had they done so, thousands of doses would have been put into circulation.
