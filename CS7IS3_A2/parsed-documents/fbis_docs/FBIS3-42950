According to the heads of Minsotrudnichestvo [Ministry of Economic Cooperation with Commonwealth States], the improvement of the laws and treaties serving as the basis of interstate trade and financial relations will be fostered by "The Rules of Trade Operations with Commonwealth States and the Baltic Countries," a report which was prepared by the ministry and was sent to embassies in the CIS states yesterday. It defines the present conditions and procedures of trade and settlements within the CIS framework. The report the specialists from the Russian Minsotrudnichestvo prepared at the beginning of 1994 is an analytical resource document and is intended fueaprimarily to notify businessmen in the CIS countries of the procedure for carrying out trade operations and mutual settlements. In addition, the report provides a complete description of the present mechanism for the regulation of foreign trade, cooperative, and financial relations in the CIS and the Baltic countries. Throughout 1993 the Russian Minsotrudnichestvo repeatedly had to carry out the functions of the Commonwealth's interstate economic agencies and took on virtually all of the responsibility for drafting multilateral agreements. The report not only sums up the results of the efforts of government agencies in the CIS countries to establish the necessary conditions for the development of integration, but also points out ways of improving the laws and treaties lying at the basis of these processes in 1994. The report consists of 10 main sections, which cover all of the main areas and objectives of economic relations between the CIS countries. The most highly developed mechanism is the one regulating trade between Russia and the Commonwealth countries. In 1994, however, it will undergo some adjustments. The changes are intended mainly to establish stricter control over exports of Russian goods to CIS countries for the purpose of preventing their re-export. Besides this, there will be stricter control over Russian imports of goods from the former republics of the USSR. The purpose of these changes is stringent control over the origin of imported goods. It is no secret that some goods from Western Europe and the United States are now being brought into Russia through the CIS countries, which can allow for the avoidance of customs duties in the absence of strict controls over the country of origin. The terms of foreign trade operations with the CIS countries will become more inflexible in some respects (by means of stricter control), but the changes will also result in their comparative liberalization. The list of goods requiring quotas and licenses for shipment from Russia to the Commonwealth countries will be reduced to 14 categories in 1994. In contrast to the present procedure, all settlements between Russia and the Commonwealth countries will be made through the payment and credit center of the Russian Central Bank and through commercial banks. Funds transferred to the payee, however, will have to come from a correspondent account in a bank in the paying country. With this mechanism, which does not envisage mutual currency conversion, mutual settlements between enterprises in the CIS countries will be much more complicated and will take longer. The report says that some positive changes in this area could result from the establishment of the Interstate Bank, which should begin conducting settlement operations in a multilateral clearing network in the second half of 1994. If this bank is entrusted with the necessary powers, it could serve as an instrument to control the circulation of money and securities throughout the CIS. The Interstate Bank's ability to perform its functions will depend, however, on the creation of a CIS payment union, based on a single mechanism for coordinated national currency exchange rate quotations. [Box] Forms of Settlement and Terms of Payment Between Russia and CIS Countries All settlements will be made through the settlement and credit center of the Russian Central Bank and through commercial banks. Transfers of payments will be limited to the funds available in a correspondent account in a bank in the paying country. Settlements will be made in accordance with international and banking practice (payment authorizations, payment demands, and letters of credit). [Box] Terms of Russia's Trade with CIS Countries Shipments of goods from CIS countries to Russia will be exempt from import duties, value-added tax, and excise tax. Russian exports of goods originating in CIS countries will also be exempt from all types of taxes and duties, with the exception of a few types of commodities (mainly strategic raw materials). Russia's trade with CIS countries on a mutual noncash settlement basis in 1994 will be regulated by bilateral intergovernmental agreements. Quotas and licenses for Russian exports to Commonwealth countries will apply to only 14 of the most vital crude resources and materials in 1994. Starting on 1 January 1994 the exporter of Russian goods shipped to CIS countries will be obligated to submit a "transaction passport" to customs agencies for the export of critical raw materials, and starting on 1 March this passport will be required for all goods exported from the territory of the Russian customs zone.
