This will also give the reactor a new lease of life and serve as technology stimulation for the design of a 510 MWt multi-purpose research reactor which has been developed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre recently, according to Dr. R. Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. In his inaugural speech to the three-day, first annual symposium on "Ageing management of nuclear facilities" here today, he said the enormous cost of addition of new capacity and the lack of cleared sites for new nuclear power plants had made planners think of extending the operation of existing nuclear power plants and pilot plant studies had been initiated in a big way abroad. Continued operation of the existing nuclear power plants as long as it was safe and economical to do so should be an important element in any nation's energy strategy to meet their growing need for electrical power, he said. (His speech was read out in his absence.) He said the second research reactor, Cirus, (40MWt) would be shut down for about one year for execution of refurbishing programme as during recent years excessive maintenance efforts were needed on some of the components due to ageing-related degradation. It was commissioned in 1960. With refurbishing, its useful life was expected to be extended by 10 to 15 years, or even more. The Tarapur atomic power station (TAPS) commissioned in 1969 had not yet run its normal full course of design life. Dr. Chidamabaram said studies should be undertaken to understand the ageing mechanism of critical components of this nuclear plant and methods of assessing the residual life which will be based on vigorous inspections being carried out. Referring to stoppage of fuel supply from abroad along with the embargo put earlier on the supply of critical spares for TAPS, as it completes 25 years, the AEC chairman said the problems were being tackled by way of development of Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel to continue operation and also by undertaking development of certain critical spares with the help of Indian industries as also in-house development work in DAE establishments. Results of studies had shown that TAPS could be operated for up to 40 full power years. As regards ageing management of TAPS was concerned, critical components and ageing mechanisms to which each was subjected to had been categorised. A criteria had been evolved to categorise a component as critical, based on its potential to cause spreading of radiation within the site and beyond the plant boundaries, if it were to fail abruptly. Incorporation of special design features in new plants was being considered towards easy replacement of such critical components. The reactor vessel was the main critical component. Components of the pressurised heavy water reactors were also being studied. Dr. A. Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, delivering the topical address, outlined the technical requirements for safety assessment of ageing nuclear power stations and steps to identify the critical structures and components. He lauded the R&D efforts at BARC and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research at Kalpakkam in bringing about an understanding of complex phenomena associated with ageing of nuclear facilities and in the development of tools and techniques to measure and mitigate these effects. AREB would like the department of atomic energy to promote increased involvement of academic institutions, national research institutes and industry to accelerate the progress of such work. Mr. A.N. Prasad, director, BARC, noted that more than 400 nuclear power reactors were operational in the world, producing nearly 16 per cent of the total electricity generated globally. By the turn of the century, 160 to 170 nuclear power reactors of different designs would have reached a service life of 25 years, or more. A very large number of research reactors would also have reached the end of their service life by them, awaiting decommissioning. He said ageing related issues were under critical examination in the R&D studies of several organisations. BARC had undertaken a systematic study of identification of critical materials, components and systems of the pressurised heavy water reactors as well as the severity of operating and environmental stresses. Several techniques and software had been developed and were being applied for condition monitoring notable among them being current signatures for motor-operated valves in the emergency core cooling system and vibration signatures for the pumps in the coolant circuits and surface temperature of electrical systems to mention a few. Mr. S.K. Chatterjee, managing director of Nuclear Power Corporation, said the safety levels of nuclear power plants were not deteriorating with age because of the continued monitoring and assessment being made and the required level of safety met at all times. He, however, said while dealing with the issue of ageing management of nuclear plant one had to keep in mind the fact that public acceptance was likely to play a significant role in plant life cycle decision-making. Internationally, the ageing issue especially of nuclear power plants was assuming a great importance. The nuclear energy agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had created an international expert working group on plant life management to achieve a systematic and higher level collaboration among its member countries in Europe on these issues.
