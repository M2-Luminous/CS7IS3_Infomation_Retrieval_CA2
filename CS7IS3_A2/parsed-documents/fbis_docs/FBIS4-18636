It is significant and unprecedented. It comes in the wake of a series of negative and unhelpful signals from the British government and in the face of London's refusal to communicate with Sinn Fein. Yet to listen to Downing Street, or to the Unionist spokespersons and their allies, one would imagine that the IRA had announced a nuclear strike instead of a temporary halt to its actions. But it's only for three days, the begrudgers lament. Fair enough. Most republicans can accept such criticism from John Hume or Albert Reynolds or others who have been concerned to promote the peace process. Seventy-two hours isn't a long time. But for the IRA to suspend actions at all is a very meaningful step, and especially at this time. All of us who are concerned or involved with the peace process are committed to bringing about a total and permanent end of armed actions by all armed groups. Our quest for peace will not be satisfied with temporary suspensions by one group, though these are welcome as part of the effort to achieve a lasting peace. The significance of the IRA initiative does not lie in its duration. It was at this time last year, on Easter Sunday, that news about my talks with John Hume first emerged. Since then revelation has followed revelation. Few could have predicted at Easter 1993 that the situation could have been moved forward so much or that such a potential for further movement could have been created. There is now a new focus on the Anglo-Irish conflict, on the need for a negotiated settlement and on the core issues involved. All of this has had a major effect internationally and it has opened up a new potential, particularly in the US. Peace in Ireland is now on everyone's political agenda, despite the best efforts of some elements to go back to the failed policies of the past. The Downing Street Declaration marks a stage in the peace process. It also marks the beginning of what has become a stalemate because, when it launched the declaration, the British government also stalled the peace process by erecting a roadblock around the issue of clarification for Sinn Fein. The IRA announcement shows a willingness and flexibility by its leadership. It creates the opportunity for Sinn Fein and the London government to remove the block so that the peace process can move forward. Sinn Fein wants to move out of this very critical phase. The British government should seek to meet us half way. This does not mean negotiation, which is for a further stage in the process. If the London government does not seek to engage with Sinn Fein, how does it intend to make progress? How does it expect to make peace if it seeks only to marginalise the people who vote for Sinn Fein? It has already admitted that the IRA cannot be militarily defeated. How does it hope to end the war if it refuses to build a peace process? Mr Major cannot argue that there is a basis for peace unless he can produce and explain what it is. The Dublin government has been concerned to do this.London, so far, has not. Yet the British government talked with us for three years while activities by the British Army, loyalists and the IRA continued. What is the logic in holding up the peace process now? How does the London government aim to move forward if it does not deal directly with representatives of our party? Sinn Fein has an electoral mandate. The rights of those who support us have to be upheld by us. No amount of exclusion orders, or censorship or coercion will change this. We have been shot, bombed, imprisoned and demonised. Through it all we have retained a willingness to move forward. We are not concerned to force a public climb-down by John Major. We will be flexible. It has been said that we are attempting to embarrass Major. This is not the case. Of course, like every other party, we are concerned to promote our views but it a paradox of our time that republicans would prefer Major to be in a stronger position. His weakness limits the ability of all sides to manoeuvre. That is one of the lessons of last year when proposed meetings between Sinn Fein and the British government floundered upon Major's dependancy on the unionists and his own right wing. It is worth recalling that the IRA was asked by the British to suspend operations for two weeks in order to enhance the potential of those meetings. As is now well known, the IRA agreed to this request. That was last May. A lot has happened since to make all involved cautious. But Sinn Fein has been concerned to prevent this from derailing the peace process. It has also been alleged that we seek to divide the London and Dublin governments. On the contrary, we seek meaningful agreement between London and Dublin and a process led by them and involving all other parties so that a new, agreed, Ireland can be built by all the people of this island. So we have questions to ask of London and we require direct dialogue, not protracted deliberations or negotiations so that answers can be provided to us as they have been to other parties. The areas which require clarification are: 1. Matters of text in what is an ambiguous declaration. 2. Differences in interpretation and commentary of the declaration. 3. The steps envisaged to advance the peace process. If we are being told that Britain no longer has any selfish interest in Ireland, and that the only problem today is the legacy of the past -- the divisions among the people in Ireland -- then it is obvious that this division can only be healed by agreement. In these circumstances, is it unreasonable to ask the British Government what process, timeframe and framework it proposes for reaching such agreement? Is it unreasonable to seek to establish Britain's longterm intention towards Ireland? These fundamental questions deserve fundamental answers. Furthermore, direct dialogue would indicate a genuine interest on the part of the British Government in developing a real peace process through the recognition of Sinn Fein's rights as a political party, the validity of our mandate and the democratic integrity of our electorate. Major will be letting down the people of Britain as well as the people of Ireland if he fails to rise above his own difficulties so that the situation can be moved forward. I believe the IRA suspension creates a potential and it sends a signal, an encouraging signal, which can only assist those who are committed to this task. The significance of this should not be undervalued or underestimated. There are risks in all of this. But they affect everyone, republicans as well as prime ministers, and what is the alternative? In my view the price justifies the taking of risks. A lasting peace demands it. It's over to you, Mr Major.
