The point is that, according to one of the numerous versions associated with the name of Aleksandr Barkashov, the investigation into the participation of Russian National Unity's leader and his subordinates in the events of bloody October 93 has been ended. The "Barkashovites'" departure from the House of Soviets building before the start of combat operations is being advanced as an argument. Another question arises in this connection: Was the clash in which Barkashov was seriously wounded not the consequence of his initiation into certain details concerning the shooting up of the parliament building? According to information received by the editorial office the Russian National Unity leader was wounded in the back by automatic fire from a VAZ-2108 vehicle. And... -- a new detail emerges here -- ...it was his friends who picked him up, not a passing vehicle at all. As has been stated, it was they who took him to the hospital, giving a false name in the interests of personal security, because they feared not the official authorities but the same people who had instigated the shooting. In this context the information that Barkashov's supporters themselves appealed to the Internal Affairs organs 29 December, requesting that protection for their leader be organized, looks quite plausible. According to the same version the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] did take such measures and transferred Barkashov to its own departmental hospital. Various high-ranking officials in the MVD and General Prosecutor's Office refused to confirm or deny this version. Nevertheless, it is contradicted by information that the Russian National Unity Council has made a statement accusing militia organs of making an attempt on Barkashov's life and warning that it reserves the right to carry out its own investigation and take adequate measures to protect its leader, with all that that entails. At the same time we have learned that yesterday the Military Prosecutor's Office sent its investigators to the same MVD hospital where Barkashov is staying and began investigative activities.
