This is a decision that the Italian company made about 10 years ago when the first signs of difficulties were being felt in the defense industry. This field is characterized by extremely long design schedules and full aircraft operations: it may take up to 10 years from the date the program is launched to the date of installation on a jet. And the never-ending Eurofighter 2000 story is a wide confirmation of this fact. Therefore Fiar, anticipating the current market crisis, decided to invest in the avionic radar sector to upgrade a vast family of jets thereby lengthening the operational life of aircraft in an area (that of electronics) that characterizes a fighter aircraft, allowing it to compete almost on a par with more modern, but certainly more expensive machines. By pursuing and achieving this objective, Fiar ranks as one of the very few leading companies in this sector worldwide. Within the next 10 years these companies will share an international market currently estimated to be worth 15 trillion lire. The most recent Fiar success dates to a few weeks ago when Pakistan assigned the Milan-based company a 90-billion-lire order to upgrade the radars installed on its F7 fighter aircraft (the Chinese version of the MIG-21) with another 50-billion-lire option. And once again with Pakistan, Fiar is negotiating a new order to upgrade the Mirage line. However the electronic company marketing division is also negotiating interesting contracts with other countries in South-East Asia for the sale of a radar that derives from the Grifo model, also suitable for the U.S. Northrop F-5 fighter aircraft. Last year 76 percent of Fiar's orders came from overseas markets. This figure has permitted the company to cover a large part of the gap that comes from the national market whose budget is at survival levels following the constant cuts made by the last government budgets to the item on the upgrading of the Italian Air Force. This is a painful area for Italian companies, which have seen the third phase (of the six scheduled) of the order for the new AMX fighter-bomber aircraft (Alenia, Aermacchi, Embraer) stopped, without giving any go-ahead on the program to upgrade the jet with the Grifo X Plus radar. Fiar is currently developing the ECR90 radar for the Eurofighter 2000 with the British company GEC Marconi Avionics, DARA [German Aerospace Agency] of Germany, and Insiel of Spain, with a 26 percent share. Moreover since June 1992 Fiar has been the leading contractor in an order for the development of the Pirate infrared system (once again for the new European fighter). It is an extremely advanced piece of electro-optical equipment which, thanks to a particular data and signal processing capacity, can operate either as a fighter radar or in an entirely passive way, that is, without emitting radiation that can be detected by enemy sensors, in addition to allowing pilots to fly in the most absolute obscurity without the aid of any external reference points. And in the final stage of this program Fiar will develop a system that will send the images from the infrared system to a visor on the pilot's helmet and present television-quality images of the scene scanned by Pirate directly in front of his eyes. These programs, combined with others such as those for space equipment and new sonars for the navy, enabled Fiar to achieve 225.5 billion lire in revenues last year with a 344.5-billion-lire portfolio of orders and 57 billion lire allocated for research and development. Even this year, business should reach 1992 levels, but with a stronger share of foreign orders.
