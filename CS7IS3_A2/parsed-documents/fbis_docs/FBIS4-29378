FBIS4-29378 "dreas117_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam's Remarks at Carter Meeting Decried Kim Yong-sam's Remarks at Carter Meeting Decried SK1706033694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 16 Jun 94 SK1706033694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 16 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Provoker's Unreasonable Faultfinding"] [Text] Today the world' public opinion highly appraises our decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] as a just self-defense measure and as a courageous decision that only the DPRK can make. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are arguing with us, taking a displeased attitude toward our decision. In other words, in a meeting with former U.S. President Carter on 14 June, traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our withdrawal from the IAEA is an abnormal act, a challenge to the demands of the international community, and the like and babbled again about the inevitability of UN sanctions against the North. This is indeed a provoker's unreasonable faultfinding. Although the puppets are clamoring about an abnormal act, a challenge, and the like, as a matter of fact, it is precisely the agency's Secretariat, which has followed the U.S. imperialists' plot to crush our Republic, who thrust us out of the agency. As is known, since we joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and concluded a safeguards agreement, we have sincerely received inspections pursuant to it. However, giving up its mission and function as an international organization, the agency's Secretariat adopted a resolution regarding a special inspection of our military facilities by intentionally fabricating inconsistence [uidojoguro purilchirul manduro naeso]. Even after we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the declared withdrawal from the NPT, in an effort for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, the agency's Secretariat forced us to accept inspections equivalent to regular and nonregular inspections, not inspections to guarantee the continuity of safeguards. Hurriedly jumping at the distorted conclusion that it has become impossible to measure the fuel rods taken this time from the experimental reactor, the agency's Secretariat went so far as to adopt an unreasonable resolution of suspending the agency's coordination while demanding a special inspection of our military facilities. The agency Secretariat's arrogant and insolent maneuvers can be seen in this fact alone. Thus, as we received the agency's inspections and as we showed sincerity and generosity, some quarters of the agency's Secretariat further intensified its pressure upon us, thereby escalating its maneuvers of crushing the Republic. Under such circumstances, how can our Republic, which regards independence as its life, tolerate the agency's unwarranted acts? How can it idly look at the nation's dignity and sovereignty being trampled underfoot? As clearly indicated in the statement, our withdrawal from the IAEA is because the agency perpetrated an act of gravely infringing upon our Republic's dignity and sovereignty. Fair public opinion of the world says that the responsibility for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA lies in this agency itself. Our decision taken this time is a just self-defending measure to defend our dignity and sovereignty. The responsibility for our withdrawal from the IAEA lies also in the South Korean puppets. The puppets, who have been frantic in crushing us in collusion with the United States and some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat, are presumptuously talking about abnormal, challenge, and the like. This is indeed a shameless act. With no sophistry can the puppets escape their criminal responsibility for having driven the situation to this point. At a press conference on 14 June, the puppets clamored that if the North fails to change its attitude the UN Security Council will take a stern measure. This reveals once again their insidious attempt to isolate and crush us. UN sanctions are synonymous with a declaration of war against us. Therefore, the puppets' clamoring about the inevitability of UN sanctions is nothing but preaching of the inevitability of a declaration of war. The Kim Yong-sam ring is a ring of intolerable national traitors who are not interested in national destiny and who stop at nothing to do harm to fellow countrymen. The Kim Yong-sam ring will not go unpunished. If the Kim Yong-sam ring thinks that it can survive by doing harm to fellow countrymen, this is a foolish delusion. The puppets should not run wild like a mad dog.
