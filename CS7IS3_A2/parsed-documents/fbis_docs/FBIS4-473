He said at a news conference in Mmabatho that fundamentally different situations prevailed in the two territories. The president was speaking after talks with Bophuthatswana's two joint administrators, Mr Job Mokgoro and Prof Tjaart van der Walt. Mr de Klerk said the de facto situation in Bophuthatswana before the takeover was that former President Lucas Mangope was no longer in charge. This was not the situation in kwaZulu. He said the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal had no political or constitutional aim but was intended to ensure stability and create a climate conducive to free and fair elections. He said no comparison should be drawn between Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu. If Mr Mangope had acted differently he would still have been in power and would have handed over that power on May 1, when the Legislative Assembly for the new provinces would meet for the first time. Mr de Klerk said the talks with the two administrators had been to iron out "hitches". He said it was important that what had been built up in Bophuthatswana should not be put at risk because the territory would soon become part of the South Africa again. It was important that tension should be overcome so that things could normalise and return to stability. Both administrators had informed him that they were cooperating well. "Things go relatively well here," Mr de Klerk said.
