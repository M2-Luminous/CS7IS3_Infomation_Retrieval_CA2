Departing briefly from a prepared speech yesterday, he accused them of having triggered a crisis in the Balkans, of which the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue was only an extension. Addressing the organising committee for a PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party congress later this month, Mr Papandreou said: "We want to remind everyone that the drama of Yugoslavia is the creation of the European Union, particularly Germany and the Vatican...Europe should recognise that Greece is its furthest eastern point, to understand our pending national issues and especially our role in the Balkan region, whose crisis has sorely tried efforts to forge a common EU foreign policy. We Greeks know this better than anyone else." On Skopje, Mr Papandreou stressed: "We hope the EU would understand that we are forced to defend our national interests the best way we can." The premier's remarks coincided with U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz' return to Washington. The Greek and Skopje foreign ministers will meet separately with UN mediator Cyrus Vance in New York on April 11.
