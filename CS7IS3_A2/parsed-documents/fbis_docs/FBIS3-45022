In his welcoming remarks, Mesfin said that "we in the transitional government attach a very special importance to our relations with the People's Republic of China." He said, among the reasons for it, the Ethiopian people have always "considered the support and the assistance of the People's Republic of China as exemplary in international co-operation." "The Ethiopian peasants in numerous parts of our country have very fond memories of Chinese experts and the work they have left behind will always remain as a monument to the friendship between our two peoples," he said. "It is not only here in Ethiopia that the People's Republic of China and its people are held in a very high esteem. In the developing world in general, the People's Republic of China is viewed in a special light and is regarded as a true friend of their peoples and a genuine supporter of their causes," he added. In his reply speech, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen hailed the achievements the Ethiopian transitional government made during the past two year. Qian Qichen said "as an important country in east Africa, Ethiopia is firmly committed to good-neighboring and regional peace, and has played a positive role in promoting a political settlement of the Somali question, thus winning wide acclaim from the international community." Ethiopia actively advocates that African countries, under current unfavorable international political and economic situation, unite to strengthen themselves and advocate the African economic integration, he said, expressing deep appreciation of it. "To consolidate and strengthen unity and cooperation with African countries is an important component of China's foreign policy," the Chinese vice-premier said, adding China supports the African countries in their efforts to strengthen themselves through unity and cooperation and respects their desire to choose the road of development suited to their respective national conditions. The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here today on a two-day visit to Ethiopia at the invitation of Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin. During his first day of visit, he held talks respectively with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum and Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Commission Kifle Wedajo.
