They considered bilateral relations and a range of international problems. [passage omitted] Later today Mr. Kinkel was received by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. He discussed the state of Bulgarian-German relations and assured the president, Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Matinchev of Germany's support for Bulgaria's efforts to carry out economic reform. He also assured them that Germany would ratify Bulgaria's Association Agreement with the European Union before the election of a new Bundestag. Mr. Kinkel told President Zhelev that Germany would continue helping Bulgaria settle its foreign debt, including its trade deficit with what was formerly East Germany, the president's spokesman said. "Because of its unification, Germany can understand Bulgaria's problems better than any other West European country," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev, stressing that Germany would advocate Bulgaria's bid for closer ties with the European structures. At his meeting with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Mr. Kinkel said that at the beginning of democratic reform Bulgaria had been among the leaders in Eastern Europe but now it is lagging behind. "Bulgaria now needs classical private economic contacts," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev who informed him of the government's economic policy and the progress of privatization and the land reform. At his meeting with President Zhelev the guest pledged his assistance in attracting German investment. Saying that he would not like to interfere in Bulgaria's internal affairs, Mr. Kinkel told the National Assembly chairman he hoped that parliament would allow the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] convoy through Bulgaria into Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. Later on parliament granted passage. At his meeting with the president Mr. Kinkel highly praised the decision, the president's spokesman said.
