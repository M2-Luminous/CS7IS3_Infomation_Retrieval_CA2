"Our well thought out decision is to set ourselves on fire here," the group of approximately 120 of asylum seekers stated. These persons, who made their way into the ambassador's residence on Saturday, made that statement in one of the four handwritten documents they managed to smuggle out of the diplomatic mission and deliver to the foreign media despite police surveillance. "It is better for us to die than to fall into their hands (...) We have nothing left to lose... Our country is a true hell on Earth," one of the documents affirmed. When asked by the news media, Cuban official sources said they were not aware of the statements and reiterated that "entering an embassy is not the legal way to leave the country. Those who are at the Belgian Embassy must leave the building peacefully. Cuba is reiterating the guarantees given to Belgium that it will not take reprisals, and besides Cuba takes pride that it has not taken reprisals in previous cases." Dated 29 May, or a day after the group entered the residence of Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch, two statements are addressed to Pope John Paul II, the ambassadors stationed in Cuba, and human rights organizations. A third one is addressed to leaders of the Cuban exile community in the United States, Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the Cuban-American National Foundation, and U.S. Representatives from Florida Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balabart. "We are not in a condition to begin talks or reach any agreement" with the Cuban authorities, one of the statements indicated. It added that the takeover of the residence "was a necessary demonstration of the desperate situation of Cubans, whose only options are to live indefinitely in chaos and poverty or risk their lives on rafts." The second statement stressed the asylum seekers' determination. They describe themselves as peaceful opponents of the regime and human right defenders, of "staying here as long as it takes until our departure from Cuba with full guarantees is resolved by the Cuban Government in mutual accord with the government of any other country." The most recent statement, dated Tuesday, reported to the foreign media the deterioration of the situation inside the diplomatic residence owing "to the constants acts of provocations" by the security forces. Among the complaints of "acts of provocations," the document mentioned Sunday's entrance into the residence "in a manner without explanation given the strong surveillance of the place," of our individuals, one of whom left on Monday. It also cited "threats" and demonstrations of force during the night in the area around the diplomatic mission that seek to "frighten the women and cause further trauma to the children." This latest document noted that the asylum seekers created on 30 May an organization called Union of Cubans for Liberty [Union de Cubanos por la Libertad], headed by one of the asylum seekers, Sergio Aguilar Cruz. Meanwhile, one of the statements indicated there are 124 asylum seekers in the embassy (68 men, 32 women, and 24 children). Others put that figure at 119. Until now, the Belgian authorities have reported that 114 persons, including 24 children, entered the residence on Saturday.
