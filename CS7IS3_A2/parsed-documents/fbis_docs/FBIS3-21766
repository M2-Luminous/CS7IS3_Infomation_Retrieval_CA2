Andreas Nicklisch of the UN Information Centre in Prague added that Prague Airport is being used by South American businessmen in cahoots with Czech citizens to ship cocaine. The economic and political power of drug cartels is increasing, the report says. Drug trafficking is most active in countries where there is civil war or where international treaties either are being ignored or have not been accepted. Nicklisch said that a UN team is operating in the Czech Republic to work out an estimate of what countermeasures are necessary to halt the spread of drugs. There is currently a project, he said, supporting efforts in the Czech Republic directed toward cutting the flow of drugs through the country and limiting the establishment of supplies and markets. He also said that Interior Minister Jan Ruml would meet with the executive director of the UN programme, Giorgio Giacomelli, on March 3-4 to discuss further cooperation between the UN and the Czech Republic in drug control.
