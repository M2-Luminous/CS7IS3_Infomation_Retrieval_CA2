Russian Arms Trade Centralized"] [Text] The existence of a number of foreign economic structures involved in the sale of Russian arms has caused a fragmentation of Russia's efforts on the world arms market, has undermined the exporters' authority among the customers, and has somewhat disorganized government policy. This prompted last November the creation of a single government structure to export arms, ammunition, military equipment, and components -- the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company. Presently the company is staging its presentation to mark the start of its international operations. "The USSR and, later, Russia did not sell arms -- they only supplied them to allies within the framework of the former political course," Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company, said at a press conference yesterday. He also stressed that the company entrusted to him "is not afraid of accusations of being a monopoly," because in the past two years attempts by a multitude of sellers to trade in arms have failed. Only a single state company, such as "Rosvooruzheniye," will be able to do so successfully. The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms and military hardware export and import company was set up 25 November of last year in accordance with the Russian president's edict No. 507 on the basis of the "Oboroneksport" foreign trade association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" foreign trade company, and the Main Administration for Cooperation, to act as their successor. Under presidential edicts, Viktor Samoylov was appointed the company's director, and Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov was named the president's representative on its board. "Rosvooruzheniye's" entirely new objective is to invest private and government money into Russian military-industrial enterprises to create under contract weapons models that are most sought after on the world market. All Russia's largest defense enterprises will continue to be involved in foreign economic activity, but they will act under contract with the company. Arms will be delivered to foreign buyers out of the excess reserves of military hardware stored at military-industrial enterprises; revenues from the sales will not be transferred to the budget as was the case formerly, but will be received by the producer (with a deduction of 3-5 percent commission fees to be kept by "Rosvooruzheniye"), who will pay taxes to the state. It is well known that formerly the state allocated arms sales revenues between enterprises at its discretion. At the initial stage of "Rosvooruzheniye's" activity, its deals will be licensed by the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry; later the company itself will be authorized to do so. At present a special government decree and a new draft law on military-technical cooperation are being drawn up to set forth a new procedure for military exports. Tomorrow KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the company's activity in greater detail.
