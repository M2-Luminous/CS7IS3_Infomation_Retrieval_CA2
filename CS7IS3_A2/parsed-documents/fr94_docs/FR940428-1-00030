FR940428-1-00030 FR940428-1-00008 Cancellation of permits for the purpose of reissuance of a new ten year term permit is provided for in both the current and proposed rules. The current rule §222.3(c)(1)(iii) states that a permit may be cancelled at the end of the midyear of the decade for reissuance of a new permit. The term grazing permit also currently contains a clause which states that an authorized officer may cancel the permit at the end of the midyear of the decade so that it may be updated. The clause provides that, in such a case, a new permit will be reissued to the existing permit holder. This permit clause causes authorized officers to cancel all the term permits needing updating at the same time and reissue them. This practice results in inefficiency and delays in reissuing permits. Therefore, paragraph (a)(4) of this section of the proposed rule retains the authority to cancel permits to update their terms and conditions but does not limit the point at which this could be done. This charge would allow authorized officers to update permits over a period of time in an efficient and timely manner. Paragraph (a)(4) also stipulates that when a permit is cancelled under this provision, issuance of a new permit is preceded by a rangeland project decision and NEPA documentation. The current rule at §222.4(a)(6) authorizes the Forest Service to cancel or suspend a permit if the permit holder is convicted of failing to comply with certain Federal laws or regulations or state laws when exercising the grazing use authorized by the permit. The proposed rule at §222.10(b)(5) would change the words ``when exercising'' to ``related to.'' This proposed change would clarify that the Forest Service is authorized to cancel or suspend a grazing permit when a permittee is convicted of violating the listed laws even though the violation may have taken place outside the grazing season or the specific allotment, but there is a connection between the violation and the grazing use authorized by the permit. The current rule focuses on the permitted grazing allotment and on the permitted season of use. This clarification is needed so permittees, agency personnel, and the public understand the agency's intent, to broaden this provision of the rule beyond the grazing allotment and season of use specified in the grazing permit. The proposed rule would incorporate an existing procedure outlined in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration Handbook, FSH 2209.13, section 16.2, that requires an authorized officer to notify a permittee in writing of an alleged permit violation and that the officer is considering taking action against the permit. Under §222.10(d) of the proposed rule, the permittee would be allowed up to 30 days to respond to allegations. Proposed Section 222.11_Grazing Permit Fees and Other Charges This is a new section of the proposed rule that would direct authorized officers to establish grazing fees and charges for livestock grazing use in accordance with this section of the proposed rule and the rules in subpart C_Grazing fees of part 222. Additionally, this section would set out the charges to be assessed for unauthorized use and provide for the assessment of a service charge for recovery of administrative costs for processing actions related to grazing permits. Proposed §222.11(a) would permit recovery of administrative costs associated with issuance of grazing permits. Under the current regulations, the Forest Service does not assess a service charge to recover the costs of processing permit actions initiated by an existing or prospective permittee or processing of actions related to permit violations. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, the Forest Service believes it should recover the cost of providing services to users who seek a special privilege or use, especially when costs of responding to permittees or applicants exceed those normally incurred by the agency. Paragraph (a) would make clear that the Forest Service is authorized to assess a service change to recover the administrative and clerical costs for processing those permit actions initiated by an existing permittee or applicant. Examples of these types of actions are the modification of an existing permit solely at the request and benefit of the permittee and issuance of a new permit to a qualified applicant. It is estimated that out of the approximately 9,100 permittees on the National Forest System, 2,000 may initiate a permit action in any one year. The average service charge is estimated to be about $100 per action. It is the agency's intent to issue guidelines to its employees through the agency directive system establishing the service charge, which would include the processing costs and be adjusted periodically to reflect any changes in these costs. Proposed §222.11(b) makes clear that unauthorized use is a violation of the terms and conditions of the permit and establishes that authorized officers shall charge permittees and other livestock owners for any unauthorized use. Charges for unauthorized use are in addition to grazing fees assessed for authorized grazing use as prescribed in subpart C. Proposed §222.11(c) provides for determining if unauthorized use is willful or nonwillful. If unauthorized use is determined to be willful, the authorized officer is directed to determine if the offender has been responsible for other incidents of willful unauthorized use within a period of 36 months preceding the subject incident, and therefore is subject to the higher rate charge of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Proposed §222.11(d) establishes that the charge for unauthorized use will be the average monthly animal unit month (AUM) grazing fee rate for the 17 Western States published annually by the National Agricultural Statistical Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Direction for determining charges for unauthorized use is covered in the current rule in subpart C_§222.50(h). Since charges for unauthorized use are penalties rather than fees, this direction is more appropriately covered under Subpart A of the proposed rule rather than Subpart C where it is currently located.
