It will open 1,190 lines in 11 directions to such big cities as Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot, Urumqi, Lhasa and Haikou. This is the first of four such stations installed in China by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The station, located in the city's southwestern suburbs on a site of more than 2.6 hectares, is a huge modern building with two cassegrain antennas, one being 16 meters in diameter and the other 13 meters in diameter. The garden-like ground station, which cost 57 million yuan, can be linked, if so desired, to international telecom networks since it also passed the test of the International Telecom Organization.
