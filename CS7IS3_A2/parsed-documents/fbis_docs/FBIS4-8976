This was in response to a proposal to amend the Small Constitution tabled by the government coalition deputies who want the Sejm, not the president, to have the last word on appointing members of the government. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Katarzyna Kolenda] In an interview for Lithuanian television, Lech Walesa said that he had to give an example for the future because, according to him, the rules of the Constitution should not be changed according to the political situation. [Walesa] The president guards the Constitution, and if he is elected and has agreed to a Constitution, this Constitution cannot be changed in the midddle of the presidential term of office. The system cannot be changed in the middle of the term because then an honest president has to prevent this from happening by using all available means. [Kolenda] The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has officially invited the president to take part in the meeting of its parliamentary floor group. [Kwasniewski, SLD leader, identified by screen caption] I am ready for these talks. Everything is up to the president because it is better to keep talking. [passage omitted] [Kolenda] Both sides declare that the talks are the only way of solving this conflict, the conflict that has been going on for some weeks. It is known unofficially that the president and the coalition have set conditions that exclude any meeting. Everything points to the fact that a solution to the conflict and an appointment of the new finance minister are still far away. [end recording]
