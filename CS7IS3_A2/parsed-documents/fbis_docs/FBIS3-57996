Has anything changed in Bosnia since then ? [Morillon] He would no doubt be better able to speak of the present situation than me. He took over a situation, the consequences and difficulties of which I had analyzed. Remember that in June 1993 I expressed the fear that the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia would become impossible if things continued to develop as they were. General Briquemont has assessed on the spot the elements on which his decision was based. [Cordy] He is making his decision at a very particular time. [Morillon] Yes, at a very important period: International pressure on the parties involved in the drama must be stepped up on the eve of the NATO summit in Brussels. It was to be expected that the situation would deteriorate. If General Briquemont has chosen such a course of action, then I have every confidence in him. [Cordy] You left, and nothing changed. He is now leaving. What can change? Is his departure not really a rather meaningless gesture, as was your own? [Morillon] I do not believe that you have to interpret it like that: I was replaced because there was a change of mission. His departure, under the present conditions, marks a new development in the crisis. Perhaps not the final one, but one which I hope will prove useful. Let it be a shock which is well understood, both by public opinion worldwide and above all in the field. There must no longer be any pretexts for delaying peace. Any gesture which helps speed up a solution in favor of peace is worth making. [Cordy] It is said that General Briquemont is a friend of yours. [Morillon] Absolutely. I know him very well. We studied together at the Ecole de Guerre here in Paris, and I regard him very highly. [Cordy] But what can he -- or someone else -- achieve? [Morillon] First of all, the international community must be agreed on the principles. The first principle, in my view, is not to be party to the pursuit of a policy of "ethnic cleansing." And I am told that this is included in the draft Constitution. Belgrade is now asking for economic sanctions to be lifted. As the European Community ministers have indicated, this is something which cannot be negotiated on the basis of good promises, but on concrete acts and behavior. Starting perhaps with the implementation of the resolutions on safe areas and -- as a matter of priority -- Sarajevo. The Serbs must make a real gesture to show their genuine commitment to peace, which is at present still in doubt. The agreements on the demilitarization of Sarajevo (and other Bosnian towns), in order to place them under UN protection, have already been prepared. As, indeed, they already had been at the time that I left my command. I am sure that General Briquemont has tried to continue working on this. This is a first step which I feel must be demanded in return for any kind of negotiation whatsoever. [Cordy] In the meantime, does the double-dealing not continue ? [Morillon] This is of course intolerable. The positions taken by General Cot and General Briquemont correspond completely to what I always said and thought when I was responsible on the spot. [Cordy] As regards the West, do the politicians still make the decisions? [Morillon] This has always been the case. I have defended the prime importance of political negotiation in this matter, as in the case of any use of the armed forces. Once again, I believe that the Brussels NATO meeting should be very important in this respect. This is why it is good for public opinion to be made aware of this problem which was no doubt tending to be forgotten as other crises came along. [Cordy] You have just published (with Grasset) a book entitled Believing and Daring. What is there left to believe in today? [Morillon] The need for and the usefulness of this mission! That has always been the very basis of the action of our men and the maintenance of their morale. The sacrifices made in the former Yugoslavia are not useless, because we can see every day how human lives are being saved. Believing that this mission is necessary, but at the same time knowing that it is not enough: We are all perfectly aware of this. [Cordy] And the priorities ? [Morillon] I have sought to give public opinion certain keys: We must not confuse the United Nations' priority mission -- which is to help these populations to survive -- with what is the accompaniment to the diplomatic and political measures which are being negotiated in Geneva. We must not confuse Geneva with Sarajevo. First of all there is the rule of law. Then, the military there is to uphold the law. But it is not because peace is late in coming that we should cease to try to relieve the suffering. [Cordy] Humanitarian aid is arriving in dribs and drabs? [Morillon] And depending on good or bad intentions. This is nothing new: Long and humiliating negotiations have always been needed. The UN force must not be totally impotent, its action totally ineffective, but this is a matter for the military chiefs. To return to the title of my book: We must believe and dare in order not to be purely passive, because it is passivity which is ignominious. This means that a military chief cannot hide behind the rules in order not to act. And General Briquemont most certainly cannot be accused of that! I remain convinced that the most worthwhile task to be undertaken in that country is to avoid despair. As long as an international presence remains, there will also remain a glimmer of hope.
