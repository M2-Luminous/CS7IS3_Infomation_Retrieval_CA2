The center for asylum applicants in Niederwangen was used as the hub for this trafficking. A total of 10.8 kg of cocaine and 2.2 kg of heroin were seized and 30 individuals were arrested, according to the Bern police force. The investigations were carried out in cooperation with the Central Narcotics Office; the police forces of the Cantons of Zurich, Fribourg, Tessin, Vaud, Geneva, Basel; and foreign police forces. The magistrate in charge of narcotics affairs and Bern cantonal police officials have announced that the investigations are now completed. In 1992, the Bern police collected information on a group of traffickers, most of whom were Nigerian asylum applicants. At that time, 31 Nigerian traffickers were apprehended in Switzerland along with a total of 50 kg of drugs, mainly cocaine and heroin. Hub The investigation led by the Central Narcotics Office made it possible to dismantle the network passing through Niederwangen; illegally obtained visas helped traffickers conduct their business. Late in 1992, suspicions prompted investigators to search the Niederwangen center, which turned out to be an important hub for international drug trafficking. Until the summer of 1993, Nigerian carriers would come to Switzerland each week to deliver drugs. Several individuals were then arrested. The drugs were forwarded to other centers for refugees in Bern and disseminated all over Switzerland. The dealers used the profits from the sales to buy old cars, electronic and domestic appliances, and tools which they shipped to Nigeria. Twenty-Two Individuals in Jail Of the 30 individuals apprehended after the investigations--other arrests are still possible--22, including three women, are currently being held in custody in Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, France, and the United States. In many cases it has been impossible to determine their real identity. The Bern police added that the quantity of drugs brought into Switzerland through this network undoubtedly exceeds the 10.8 kg of cocaine and the 2.2 kg of heroin that were seized, even though it has not been possible to say exactly how much.
