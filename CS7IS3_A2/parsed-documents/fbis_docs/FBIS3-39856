One of the questions during the meeting was the hardening Swedish EU membership negotiations where Spain among others has thrown a wrench into the works; but Carl Bildt does not want to talk about a crisis in the negotiations. [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are on our way toward a decisive stage in the negotiations, and therefore it is natural that there are difficulties both when the Twelve are formulating their positions and tensions between the Twelve and the different countries seeking membership -- it can be Sweden or Austria or Finland or Norway depending what the questions are. And if we do what Helmut Kohl and I have done, we say that we need political strength on both sides for this to succeed, but we both believe that this will be managed. [Mosander] Have you asked the big boys, Helmut Kohl and Germany, to help in pressurizing Spain? [Bildt] No, I have not. But during the whole of this process we have had very close contacts with the German Government, as with other governments, and it is clear that we will do this also at the final stage. [Mosander] You definitely believe that this will be solved by 1 March? [Bildt] I have great hopes that the decisive round of negotiations we are now entering, only now, during these days in Brussels, and then after that we have a meeting of Nordic premiers on Friday [25 February], this will lead to success, definitely.
