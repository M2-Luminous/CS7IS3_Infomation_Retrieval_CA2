It is our commitment to the people and the government will not compromise on the country's nuclear program. The prime minister was replying to questions by newsmen in the Parliament House today. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said it has been the stand of Pakistan that the nuclear issue will not be solved by cornering it. The United States should have an even-handed policy toward both Pakistan and India and the Pressler Amendment, she added, is a veto in the hands of India. About the forthcoming visit of the American assistant secretary of state [title as heard], Mr. Strobe Talbott, the prime minister said Pakistan wants nuclear nonproliferation and has put forward many proposals for nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, but India has rejected all these. If any other nation puts forward its own proposals on the subject, we are ready to consider them too. We will not agree to unilateral capping of nuclear installations, but if the Indians do so, Islamabad would also agree to it. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the United States should realize that Pakistanis are a proud and honorable nation very conscious of their self respect and the government's policy on the nuclear program enjoys a national consensus. Replying to a question on the opposition's role on national issues, the prime minister urged that the opposition should give up its attitude of confrontation and join hands with the government on sensitive issues of national importance like Kashmir and the nuclear program. She said we should take the interest of the country above our personal interest and should work for the economic well being of the people. Mr. Benazir Bhutto said her government has taken revolutionary measures since assumption of power. Recounting these measures, she said hers is the first government in the history of Pakistan which imposed income tax on agriculture. Load shedding [power cuts] has been a problem since many years and her government soon after coming into power sanctioned two power projects -- one in Hab and other at Ghazi Barotha. We curtailed the deficit financing in the country and did not resort to mini budget which was very difficult. The results of our policies, the prime minister said, will become clear 18 months after our assumption of office. Talking about the increase in the base price of wheat, the prime minister said 70 percent of the country's population lives in rural areas and are farmers. They were not sowing wheat as its price was very low resulting in a decline in the country's wheat production. The government, therefore, had to import wheat. It was a difficult decision and those who have lust for power would not have taken this decision. But we take power as a noble trust by the people and as a responsibility. These are difficult decisions which will benefit the country in the long run.
