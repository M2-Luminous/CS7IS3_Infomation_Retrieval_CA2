FR940223-2-00058 FR940223-2-00035 In addition, the orders prohibit both ASI and TAALS from maintaining any agreement, understanding, plan or program to limit, restrict, or mandate the length of time that interpreters, translators, or other language specialists work in a given period, or for which they are paid for preparation or study. Further, under the orders the associations cannot maintain any agreement, understanding, or program to limit, restrict, or mandate the number of interpreters, translators, or other language specialists hired for a job or type of job. In addition to the restrictions they both share, the TAALS order prohibits further activities not addressed in the ASI order. TAALS may not limit or mandate the equipment used for performing interpretation, translation, or other language services. TAALS is also barred from restricting, regulating, or declaring unethical any form of personal publicity, including advertising. Finally, TAALS may not deprive consumers of any advantages, based on travel arrangements or geographic location, by regulating domiciles of members or by other means. Under both orders, ``fees'' are defined to include all cash or non-cash charges, rates, benefits, or other compensation. Thus, the term ``fees'' includes (but is not limited to): Lodging, meals, subsistence and travel allowances, reimbursements for expenses, cancellation charges, and compensation for time not worked, travel time or briefing time. ``Language specialist'' means one who performs ``other language services,'' which are defined as any services that involve the conversion of any form of expression from one language into another or any services incident to or related to interpretation and translation. Consequently, when the orders mention ``language specialists,'' they include, among others, anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or precis writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations. Further, ASI must amend its Code of Professional Standards, Professional Guidelines, and Yearbook Professional Guidelines to conform to the requirements of the order, which are summarized above. TAALS must amend its Professional Code for Language Specialists and all appendices to conform to the requirements of its order. Both associations must also amend their bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements of the respective orders. In addition, the orders require the associations to provide to their members and affiliates and to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to their bylaws, and the taxes of any new or amended rules, regulations or guidelines. The ASI order also requires that, within thirty days after obtaining them, ASI must provide to the Federal Trade Commission copies of all lists of fees produced by any association that come into ASI's possession. We note, however, that TAALS and ASI will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information concerning past fees that were actually charged in transactions completed no earlier than three years after the orders become final. Such information must be presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions. Similarly, the orders permit the associations to collect and publish accurate publicly available information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies, if the publication states the qualifications and requirements to receive such fees. Whenever they publish the fees that are permitted by the orders, ASI and TAALS must include a statement that they are prohibited from recommending fees and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the orders authorize the associations to provide information or their nonbinding and noncoercive views concerning the hours of work or preparation or the number of language specialists used for a type of job. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed orders, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreements and proposed orders or to modify in any way their terms.
