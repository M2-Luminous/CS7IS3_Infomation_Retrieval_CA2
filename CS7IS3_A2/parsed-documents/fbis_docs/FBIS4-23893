In the letter, the political leaders said they were surprised by President Mitterand's decision of sending French troops in Rwanda at a time when the United Nations has been trying to expand its force in the country. The president was reminded that when French troops were sent in Rwanda in 1990 when the war between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and government forces had just begun, they did not stop the imprisonment of over 10,000 innocent people and that at that time, killings of Tutsi were sanctioned in almost all prefectures especially Ruhengeri, Gisenyi and Kibuye, and the French troops did nothing to stop the killings. The letter goes on to say that since 1973, the French Government has supported the dictatorial regime in Rwanda which is responsible for the killing of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan people, including opposition leaders. France is the only country supporting the illegitimate government which assumed power on 9 April this year, and the French Government has refused to accept that the leaders of this illegitimate government are the ones responsible for the killings, when human rights organizations have already condemned these killers, the politicians told President Mitterrand. The letter goes on requesting the French president to abandon sending troops to Rwanda on the note that the French troops presence will be aimed at supporting the killer government and that France will have shown betrayal to the Rwandan people and the international community. France should instead help in setting up an international tribunal to bring to justice the criminals and should also avail the black box of the late President Habyarimana's plane to help in carrying out investigations. The letter to the French president was signed, on behalf of the PSD by the party president, Rugenera Marc and Rwangabo Pierre-Claver, for PDC Nayinzira Jean-Nepomucene, first vice president, for PL Joseph Nsengimana, and for MDR by Sixbert Musangamfura.
