Markulov, chairman of the Liberal Party of Ukraine [LPU], has held a news conference in Donetsk. Since the party's position is generally well known to the electorate, Markulov dealt chiefly with answering questions. The LPU is not going to form any electoral bloc because a political bloc with some other force, he said, will result in nothing but the neutralization of both forces. Personally, I will not put myself forward on the electoral list, Markulov stressed. This was what the party decided. A leader should concentrate on giving the greatest possible support to his candidates. One of the questions concerned the fulfillment of the protocol agreement between the LPU and the Donetsk strike committee. Here it was said that the coal lobby in the government does not want to sign a contract with the World Bank because of its condition that the coal industry be restructured. According to the LPU leader, if unprofitable mines continue to operate at the expense of profitable ones, the money allotted by the Bank may go into a black hole. It was also stated that the LPU has broad links with the Liberal International; however, the LPU domestic policy should not overstep state borders. The party does not receive, and has not received, any money from the West, in other words, the party does not rely on overseas funds. According to Markulov, the battle today is not between political parties, but between those who want to preserve socialism on one hand, and those who fight for radical reforms on the other. Another question concerned the LPU attitude toward Zhirinovskiy's party. The LPU chairman stated, among other things, that Zhirinovskiy's style and methods are unacceptable. To declare oneself a liberal and to pursue an extremist policy are incompatible things. The main thrust of the LPU is to support private ownership, while its economic policy is socially oriented. The party believes that Ukraine needs a presidential form of rule. Political fighting among certain individuals should not obscure the country's strategic line of development, in other words, the country's disintegration and interregional conflicts must be prevented. Answering a number of other questions about the upcoming parliamentary elections, the LPU chairman stated that the new parliament should consist of new people.
