FBIS4-186 "drafr064_e_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Togo CAR, UTD Announce Boycott of Parliament CAR, UTD Announce Boycott of Parliament AB0204202094 Paris AFP in French 1832 GMT 2 Apr 94 AB0204202094 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Lome, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The two opposition parties forming a parliamentary majority after the February legislative elections in Togo today decided to suspend "the participation of their parliamentarians in the deliberations of the National Assembly," in protest against the Supreme Court's invalidation of the election of three of their deputies. In a communique to AFP, the two parties stated that their parliamentary boycott would last until "the situation is clarified." The opposition coalition, comprising the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], had won 43 (36 for the CAR and 7 for the UTD) out of 81 parliamentary seats. Currently the coalition has only 40 (34 for the CAR and 6 for the UTD) out of the 78 declared seats, but it still retains a parliamentary majority. The Constitution makes it binding on President Gnassingbe Eyadema to appoint the future prime minister from within the parliamentary majority. Consultations have been continuing in this direction between President Eyadema and the opposition leaders since 15 March, but so far have not progressed. The CAR's Yaovi Agboyibor and the UTD's Edem Kodjo stated in their communique that one of the election annulments by the Supreme Court was "in flagrant violation" of the Electoral Law, while the reasons put forward to justify the two other annulments are, according to them, "poorly founded and devoid of any weight." In the first case, the court observed that the substitute for the elected parliamentarian was not eligible. In the other two cases it was of the view that "disturbances" had "undermined the sincerity of the polls." According to the opposition, these incidents were "fomented" by the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally [RPT] and that "it is inadmissible for the court to use this as a pretext for questioning the validity of the polls." Agboyigbor and Kodjo also deplored the fact that the "consultative mechanism put in place before the elections to ensure the "amicable" settlement of disputes had not been "operational." Finally, the UTD and the CAR "questioned" the "motives behind these maneuvers and the RPT's preparedness to play the democratic game." The appointment of a prime minister from the ranks of the opposition would compel General Eyadema, who has been in power since 1967, and who was reelected last August during an election boycotted by the opposition, to accept a new arrangement for cohabitation with the opposition in the governance of the country.
