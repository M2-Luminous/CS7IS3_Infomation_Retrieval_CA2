The ecological situation was aggravated by accumulation, due to calm weather, of industrial emissions of a timber industrial complex,aluminum smelting plant and thermoelectric power plant. The article calls the situation an ``ecologic explosion''. The obtained data were compared to the data of a similar 1990examination of 82 children (41 girls and a boy) in the same age group, when the air situation was relatively safe. Protein, carbohydrate and lipoid metabolisms, peroxidelipoid oxidation (PLO) processes, the activity of antiradical enzymes (catalase andperoxidase) and peroxide erythrocyte resistance (PER) were studied. The detected metabolic responses in preschool children during the especially unfavorable ecologicalsituation indicate a considerable strain of their homeostasis. The concentration of malone dialdehyde, an end product of PLO, in blood plasma and erythrocytes hadincreased, while the activity of antiradical enzymes (catalase and peroxidase decreased. The described children's metabolic responses demonstrate functionally unfavorable changes and the possibility of transformation of adaptation-adjustment responses during initial stages of pathological conditions.
