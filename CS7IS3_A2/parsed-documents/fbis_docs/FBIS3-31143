Speaking about the Albanian foreign policy, Mr. Arbnori said "Albania is committed to have good relations with its neighbouring countries like Italy, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, and Macedonia. But we do not have good relations with Serbia because it is pursuing a genocidal, dictatorial and chauvinistic policy. Concerning the Kosova question, Mr. Arbnori said that Albania is not for changing the borders by force, but we always will defend the rights of the Albanians who live there according to all the international charters. "The changes brought about by the reform and the new improved law on foreign investments are a guarantee for all the foreign investors," speaker Arbnori pointed out. President Tabone hailed the Albanian parliament for the work it has done in reforming the laws and establishing the democratic institutions which will advance Albania toward Europe. Considering the parliament as a living reflection of the democracy, Mr. Tabone expressed his pleasure for an interparliamentary cooperation between Albania and Malta. The Maltese President Tabone said the Albanian approach toward Kosova question is very wise and that her right request can be solved in the context of the European Union.
