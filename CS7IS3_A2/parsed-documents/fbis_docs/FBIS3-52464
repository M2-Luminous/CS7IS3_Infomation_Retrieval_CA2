The results showed the victory of 10 new aspirants while six incumbents retained their seats. Ishaq al-Farhan was reelected president of the executive council while 'Abd-al-Majid al-Dhunaybat was reelected as president of the Majlis al-Shura by acclamation. The Majlis al-Shura then elected 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shuraydah as its vice-president and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabir and Khalid al-Qudat as the president's assistants. Only 106 out of 120 Majlis al-Shura members proceeded afterwards to the election of the 16 executive council members out of 25 candidates; eight members cast empty ballots. Leading members Hammam Sa'id and Muhammad Abu-Faris refused to nominate themselves to the council despite suggestions by many. The results showed that moderates won most of the seats on the party's executive council. The IAF is the political branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and while Brotherhood membership is not a pre-requisite for IAF membership, most IAF members are Brotherhood members as well. A majority of IAF members, estimated by the party at between 3,000 and 5,000, supports the moderates. The new executive council and number of votes they obtained are as follows: 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat (78 votes), Hamzah Mansur (76 votes), 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Qudat (73 votes), Bassam al-'Umush (72 votes), 'Adnan al-Jaljuli (70 votes), Ahmad Tanash (69 votes), Ahmad al-Kafawin (69 votes), 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah (68 votes), Na'il al-Masalihah (68 voters), Muhammad 'Uwaydah (61 votes), Jamil Abu-Bakir (60 votes), Ibrahim al-Kilani (57 votes), Tariq al-Tall (57 votes), Zuhayr al-Zumayli (56 votes), Sa'ud Abu-Mahfuz (55 votes), 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur (53 votes) and Ziyad Khalifah (49 votes -- a reserve member) The first meeting of the council was set for next Thursday during which several committees will be formed, mainly a legal committee that will investigate into contestations raised by some IAF members of the results of the Shura council that took place last week. The IAF also issued a statement in which it condemns Vatican's recognition of the state of Israel that "denotes the submission of the spiritual leadership of the Christian followers to the Zionist domination." The statement also called on all political parties and groupings in the Arab and Muslim world to denounce this recognition.
