The paper exposed that the United States used germ and chemical weapons in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and even brought in a large amount of chemical weapons to South Korea after the Korean war, and that the South Korean puppets are preparing for a chemical war by reserving a large amount of chemical weapons under the protection of the United States. The paper pointed out that recently the South Korean puppets decided to produce chemical weapons in a meeting of so-called related authorities and to submit it to the National Assembly. The paper also exposed that the South Korean puppets presently possess some 12 chemical weapons plants and have a deposit of over 25,000 chemical weapons. This means that the South Korean puppets have secretly accelerated the preparations for chemical war and is now trying to push for such preparations legally and openly. It is an intolerable criminal act to drive fellow country men into the disaster of chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons. As everyone knows, the world's peace-loving people today strongly demand the complete abolition of chemical weapons, together with nuclear weapons, which are mass lethal weapons. Chemical weapons which kill and injure people with toxic chemicals have been branded as the cruelest massacre weapon and their use and development are banned by international agreement. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have produced and stored chemical weapons for a long time. There are some 40 underground nuclear and chemical weapons storage facilities in the areas near Mt. Kyeryong in South Chungchong Province and Suwon in Kyonggi Province. Even numerous ion chemical weapons, which are known as the most vicious and cruelest of mass lethal weapons, are stored there. Prattling about the possession of independent chemical warfare capabilities, the former South Korean dictators built more than 10 toxic gas plants in South Korea and produced numerous chemical weapons. The rascals brought in from the United States numerous military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs, and 155mm and 203mm guns which are capable of using them. The puppet army units have been operating chemical, biological, and radiological warfare schools for a long time to train chemical warfare specialists. The South Korean puppets also staged systematic chemical war exercises in collaboration with foreign forces. The fact that new chemical warfare equipment was deployed in the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that units specialized in chemical warfare training participated is one of the examples. Reporting on the true aspects of chemical war exercise staged during the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a South Korean broadcast revealed that in a chemical war exercise, a stimulated North area was wiped out by attacks by aircraft and by dropping smoke bombs, chemical bombs, germ bombs, and even drumming bombs so that no creature could survive. These facts prove that the South Korean puppets have accelerated chemical war preparations for a long time. What cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean puppets are bragging about someone's development of biological weapons while scheming a chemical war against fellow countrymen. This is a scheme designed to legalize the chemical war maneuvers, which the rascals pushed for in such a manner as to lay blame on us, and to openly accelerate such maneuvers. By spreading groundless rumors about us, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique openly announced that it decided to possess chemical weapons. This clearly shows how intentionally it is maneuvering to possess chemical weapons legally, not in a concealed manner, and to openly accelerate chemical war preparations. The puppet clique's past criminal acts were so enormous that it is impossible to conceal its chemical war maneuvers in such a manner as to reverse black and white. Kim Yong-sam, the puppet traitor who bragged that any foreign force could not be better than fellow countrymen in the beginning of his regime, is openly talking gibberish about possession of chemical weapons while stressing that one should foster strength. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which put out the signboard of civilian government, is attempting to inflict disaster of chemical weapons in addition to nuclear calamities on fellow countrymen together with outside forces. Thus, its filthy shape as ugly national traitor, murderer, and warmonger, has been exposed once again. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which turned down fellow countrymen's peace proposal and is dreaming of nuclear and chemical war, cannot avoid stern punishment by the nation. The Kim Yong-sam clique should look straight at the rushing flow of all fellow countrymen toward peace and reunification and should act with discretion. It should stop reckless war maneuvers and step down from power without delay.
