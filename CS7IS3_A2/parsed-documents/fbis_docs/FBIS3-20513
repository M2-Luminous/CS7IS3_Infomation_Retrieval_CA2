A new overall situation will arise, one of mutual respect and support, of bravely fighting shoulder to shoulder, and of unity between the military and the political authorities, between the military and the people, and between the various nationalities. After reporting on the successes achieved in the economic construction and other undertakings accomplished in Xinjiang, Abulaidi Amuderexiti said that Xinjiang's development and prosperity are the crystallization of the unity which has been established between military and people and between the various nationalities. The troops stationed in Xinjiang have made it their major task to assist this region in the development of its national economy, in the interest of ensuring social stability and promoting unity and progress among its nationalities. In recent years, officers and men of the army have participated in over 210 major local construction projects, assisted in over 310 public welfare undertakings. On over 1,200 occasions they have rendered emergency help in calamities, they have voluntarily planted over 1 million trees, built over 150 schools, and helped over 80,000 impoverished households in the encampment areas to extricate themselves from their state of poverty. Officers and men have dug 1,400 km of canals for people of various nationality; this expanded and improved the irrigated areas of land by over 1.4 million mu. The irrigation projects, named "Military-People-Unity Canal" and "Love-of-People Canal," can be found along the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan mountain range. The troops also voluntarily dug over 110 wells for the people and laid over 40,000 meters of pipes for running water supplies, thereby ending for over 120,000 herdsman households their long history of merely relying on snow and dirty water for much of the time. The various nationalities of Xinjiang will never forget the meritorious deeds of these fraternal soldiers, deeds which have been performed in the interest of Xinjiang's development. Pan Zhaomin stated that the various nationalities of Xinjiang "regarded the troops as a `Great Wall' and looked on soldiers as if belonging to their own families." Whenever soldiers had to perform large-scale, arduous tasks, people living nearby would send some of their own young, strong men as laborers to help transporting goods and provisions. Governments of all ranks, though financially hard pressed, would eagerly raise funds to resolve difficulties that the military may have with regard to drinking water and electricity, jobs for military dependents, and schools or child-care centers for their children. Commercial enterprises and supply and marketing coops of various types, as well as booksellers, would regularly send mobile units to the military camps. Border counties/cities and farming and stockbreeding communities would institute a joint military-citizenry joint defense system, energetically cooperating with the troops in assiduously patrolling the area and protecting the stability of the border region. The entire autonomous region has over 3,100 family service centers, who warmheartedly work to dispel anxieties and resolve difficulties for officers and men on duty guarding the border and for family members of fallen soldiers. Each kilometer of road, each military camp, each power station, each water supply engineering project, all these are the fruit of much painstaking labor of the peoples of various nationalities.
