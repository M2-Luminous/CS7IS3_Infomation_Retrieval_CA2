ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the State of Vermont is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy Program. Vermont has adopted drinking water regulations for eight volatile organic chemicals that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for eight volatile organic chemicals promulgated by EPA on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25690). EPA has determined that these State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve these State program revisions. All interested parties are invited to request a public hearing. A request for public hearing must be submitted by September 12, 1994 to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public hearing is made by September 12, 1994, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become effective on September 12, 1994. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing.
