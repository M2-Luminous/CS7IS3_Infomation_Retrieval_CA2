"The situation in the Gorazde area is complicated -- both sides are to blame." He also said that on 17 and 18 April he spoke on the phone with General Radko Mladic, the Serb commander in chief in Bosnia, and asked him "not to attack Gorazde." According to Gen. Grachev, the Serb forces did not attack Gorazde "for those two days." But afterward "provocative actions by the other side followed." Gen. Grachev said that "air strikes are very dangerous politically and they do not produce any military results. It is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table -- not for the officials who are currently holding the talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers, but at the level of heads of state and government." Russia is not going to send extra troop contingents to Bosnia, because, according to Pavel Grachev, "an extra battalion will not make any difference; what is needed is up to 70,000 soldiers, but this is unrealistic." But Moscow does not currently plan to withdraw its peacemakers, either. Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan, on his part, said that his country is ready to send troops to Bosnia.
