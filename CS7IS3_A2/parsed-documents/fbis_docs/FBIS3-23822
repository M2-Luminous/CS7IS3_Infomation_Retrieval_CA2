Udaltsov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editor in chief. Boris Grigoryevich, my first question is associated with the current array of political forces. Well, it is understandable that your opponents criticize you. However, here is Kozyrev stating that to him, Chernomyrdin is a reformer just like Gaydar, Popov stating that Gaydar's course was too pro-Western, Luzhkov stating that the last two "years of Gaydar" were an economic failure, Shokhin.... B. Fedorov. There already is complete clarity as far as he is concerned.... A. Udaltsov. So, what is happening? "Red Economic Managers" B. Fedorov. Everything is far from unambiguous. They talk about the "Gaydar government." However, Gaydar was not a member of the government between 12 December 1992 and 16 September 1993. After 16 September he did not actually take any action. It is just that for some reason everybody got the impression that he was prime minister all that time, and that Chernomyrdin in a way had no part of it. What policy did the government pursue, and what is reform? So, if you back 10 ministers against the wall somewhere and ask them to name at least five points which are characteristic of the reforms, I assure you that some might not answer at all, while others will merely repeat "reform! reform! reform!" This is why I would answer this way: Many of the people who were and still are members of the government had nothing to do with either the reforms or the policy pursued. Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin is the most vivid case in point. He was a member of Silayev's government in its time, and later successively deputy chairman for social issues, deputy chairman for foreign economic relations, and now minister of the economy; he is fighting to have the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations also subordinated to him. The Federal Service on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control or the Ministry of Education may be next up, and I would not be surprised because he has no clear-cut course, to say nothing about reformism. I have known Kozyrev for quite a long time: I came to the Silayev government just before him. My impression is: He believes that foreign policy can be separated from domestic policy. I am absolutely convinced that the opposite is true. If a turnaround begins in the country, considerable changes will occur in foreign policy, too. Of course, it is possible that he will turn out to be so flexible as to consider any change normal. There are a great number of purely functional specialists in the government--on transportation, etc. Naturally, they also never had anything to do with the reforms. When Gaydar came in 1991 he began, having secured the support of the president, to follow, essentially alone, a certain course which turned out to be short-lived because in the middle of 1992 it became different. I had only one task: A hard ruble was needed, and there was no escaping that fact. Financial discipline was needed. Prices had to be free, and the exchange rate had to be determined by demand and supply on the market. One did not have to be a prominent economist in that instance. The main point was to pursue a certain policy consistently. As long as Chernomyrdin was in a state of bewilderment over what economic policy in a market economy is, this was successful. However, in the summer of 1993 Gerashchenko pushed through monetary reform. He did it professionally: He put us off guard by statements that the currency would be exchanged until the end of the year, I went away on leave, and he struck a blow. It then became clear that adherence to reforms proclaimed by Chernomyrdin was a disguise, that he never considered broadly interpreted reforms his own. At present, "Red economic managers" play the leading role in the government; the prime minister himself has said today that he is proud of being a "Red director." The problem is that while they are experienced politicians, they do not know about the economy. To them, it is a different life. They do not understand it. I assure you that had it not been for the September events, the things that happened this January might have happened in September and October, because even then plans existed to squeeze certain people out of the government, to reduce their status, and to regroup forces. Individuals such as Shakhray and Shokhin, all their desire to display loyalty to the prime minister notwithstanding, will always remain outsiders in the government no matter what: they are not "Red directors." Shokhin, with his cozy thick glasses, will forever give the impression of an intellectual who is meddling in someone else's business. There will be more verbal glitter. So, I was in Davos in conjunction with the prime minister, who swore everywhere that he would combat inflation. However, given that on 20 January he said that his target for the end of the year was 8-9 percent, and on 25 January that the target already was 15-18 percent, the common man is compelled to ask: When did he speak the truth? And what kind of policy is being pursued? Look at just one problem--the savings of the population; not one of the "Red economic managers" discusses it at all. Meanwhile, this is the most important indicator of the health of a country. A state is doomed if the population has nothing and cannot save up. If there are savings that grow in real terms, the country has a future because there is a foundation for investment, for the extension of long-term credit, and for the expansion of production. In our country savings had been declining for two years, but began to grow in real terms in November and December. To be sure, the trend has now changed. So that I finish my soliloquy, after all: At present, everyone is tired of everything. How many times can we restructure? How many times can promises be made? Many people have begun to talk about unity and accord: Let us come to an agreement, they say, and it will be better for all. Or let us unite with Belarus--and prosperity will come about right away.... O. Moroz, member of the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial board. For Belarus, that is.... B. Fedorov. Maybe for Belarus. The events that happened in January do not allow even the relative success that has been achieved to be built on. In January the rate of inflation was not supposed to exceed 15 percent, whereas it was at 22 percent. This is just the beginning: Judging by the latest reports from the government, the Ukrainian scenario is drawing ever closer to us. Another two or three unifications of monetary systems--with Georgia, Tajikistan.... I think that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan will not be far behind--everyone wants to get at least something.... Mr. Gerashchenko's Scalp Yu. Kulikov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in chief. In the State Duma you were elected chairman of the subcommittee that will oversee credit and monetary policy. You will get to draw a lot of Gerashchenko's blood.... B. Fedorov. You see, I am a fatalist in the sense that I believe the progress of history cannot be stopped, and Mr. Gerashchenko's scalp will one day hang on the wall and adorn my house. Carthage must be destroyed. There is no doubt that he is a talented man. He is neither a central banker, because he does not understand what he is supposed to do, nor an economist, because he does not know elementary things about monetary circulation in a market economy. He is a man who managed to live abroad for 15 years and failed to understand how the economy works there. Incidentally, he did not manage to learn the language properly, either. However, he is talented in terms of his bureaucratic conditioning; he has already survived several regimes, and he always has a paper with the right endorsement. I think that my position will be very simple: We will begin to hold hearings in a fundamentally different way from that of the former Supreme Soviet, conventionally speaking, the way they do in England. We will word 300 or 500 questions and demand answers in writing. Thereafter officials from the Central Bank will answer questions, this time before the subcommittee--just as in the U.S. Congress, very quietly and amicably. After all, we are a legislative organ, and we cannot determine the policy of the executive authorities. However, we have a duty to know what goes on in the Central Bank. Naturally, I am extremely interested in the balance sheet. The bank was actually created in December 1990, but no one has seen the results so far. In the existing report there are a few lines about the balance sheet at the very end, on one page. However, when an international auditor writes in his statement that he does not understand many things about the Central Bank, and that he does not assume responsibility for saying that everything in the bank is correct, these are very sophisticated words to the effect that a lot is incorrect there. A. Udaltsov. Now that we have you here, could you sketch the "banking landscape" for us and name the most respectable banks? G. Tsitrinyak, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Such advertisement is expensive.... A. Udaltsov. Those with integrity will pay later. (Laughter). B. Fedorov. In terms of the level of development, the banking system is ahead of many economic sectors. Previously it did not exist, there was a niche. People came there who for the most part had not been bankers in their earlier lives. Gusinskiy of the Most was a director; Khodorkovskiy of the Menatep was a chemist; Petya Korotkov, with the Russian National Bank, worked with us at the DENGI I KREDIT magazine; I remember taking an article to him. Certain others.... People came in who did not have any dogmas and managed to get the system going astoundingly fast: At present Russia already has about 2,000 banks with 4,000 branches. I think that the banks will begin to play a quite conspicuous role. All of them, especially the large banks, take an interest in politics. All of them already have something to lose if we recall that some balance sheets already exceed $100 million, and the opening of each branch, for example in Moscow, costs $1 million at minimum. As I see it, there are not that many truly powerful banks that one can work with--between 30 and 50. During the past year the Ministry of Finance worked with 15-20 banks, and among them were the Most, Stolichnyy, Inkombank, and Menatep. There were also smaller banks--the Tveruniversalbank, the Russian National Bank, and a number of banks such as the Tokobank. These banks, whether one likes them or not, are quite reliable; they will not disappear soon. I also like the Tekhnobank headed by Garegin Tosunyan very much; it impresses me because it tries to think about the entire country instead of being wrapped up solely in its own problems. Yu. Kulikov. As you see it, why are bankers being killed? B. Fedorov. Not just bankers--if you have a lot of money and this becomes common knowledge.... However, there is one nuance in this instance: There are quite a few people in the banking community who are entangled in affairs that are hard to call legitimate. O. Moroz. You are seconding the dangerous point of view of the Ministry of Internal Affairs--that only those involved in criminal pursuits are being killed, they say. B. Fedorov. No, I am not seconding it. I merely said that this is also a fact. A large enough number of banks which were tied to groups of a particular kind have recently closed--this is also a fact. It is another matter that the law enforcement organs operate so inefficiently.... Here is an example: Everybody agrees that corruption is on the rise. However, who has been put behind bars in the last three years? Name them--it is just that I am interested to know.... Or taxes: It is clear that the revenue is small, that profits are being concealed. I called in the tax police and asked them when we would hold at least a few well-known individuals accountable.... S. Oganyan, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Did you name names? B. Fedorov. I hinted. (Laughter). So what? Nothing happened. An Interesting Detail G. Tsitrinyak. Effective 1 January, the circulation of foreign exchange in parallel with the ruble was discontinued. At the former foreign exchange stores they now put prices on the merchandise in dollars, take payment in rubles, and set their own exchange rates. Here is an official summary report for 7 February from the newspaper SEGODNYA: The ruble-dollar exchange rate at the "Shop No. 1" store--1,880, and at the "NBM"--1,555. For reference: On the same day the exchange rate of 1,560 rubles [R] to the dollar was fixed at the trading session on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. What is all this about? Did they fail to envision that the exchange rate at foreign exchange stores may differ from the rate at the trading session by more than a few percentage points? Did they officially authorize robbery? B. Fedorov. As early as 1991 I told Gaydar's guys that elementary rules should have been introduced at first when currency exchange bureaus opened in a country lacking culture in certain operations, in a country that had monopolies. Say, the selling rate of foreign exchange in exchange bureaus or shops should not have exceeded that on the exchange by more than 5 percent. We proposed this, but it was not accepted. However, the Central Bank may introduce this within three seconds without a problem. G. Tsitrinyak. Then why has the Central Bank not introduced it so far? After all, shoes can wait, but when one needs drugs.... B. Fedorov. I would undertake to put this question to Gerashchenko. O. Moroz. What do you think about the nonpayments crisis, and what way out do you see? B. Fedorov. One should not promise more than one has. In this instance, no knowledge of monetarism is required. The unpaid sums are a myth which is associated with one point: If the president and the prime minister of a state consider it possible to spend as much as they want and for whatever purposes they want, apart from the approved budget and its items of expenditure, the budget will certainly be busted. I even tried to explain to the government: "If you go shopping you cannot spend more than you have in your wallet...." Meanwhile, the state considers it possible to live any which way. Agrarian lobbyists forced through the grain price, plus repairs to the White House, plus 250 billion for the elections, and so on, and so forth. The Ministry of Finance had not built all of that into the budget. Naturally, there was no spare money; it was taken away from someone. Besides, to a considerable degree, legislation made it possible not to pay; there was no mechanism for bankruptcy, nor were there bankruptcies. Not a single director was relieved. In general, the lack of an industrial policy was the greatest mistake of the year 1993, just as it is now. There were many industrialists in the government, but there was no industrial policy because everybody wanted to work on finance and ask for subsidies. In essence, those who are received by the president and the prime minister are the directors of the largest bankrupt enterprises: Peskov from the Rosselmash or Gulko from the Metrovagonmash. Here is an episode: The director of a bankrupt enterprise came in and narrated publicly that he had consulted with the president in the company of those as bankrupt as he was, and communicated to me confidentially: "In general, we will have you removed, but we have not found another candidate yet. And we will demote Chubays...." For some reason they do not consult with the Uralmash--private capital has come along there. O. Moroz. Therefore, do you think that the clamor in the press on account of nonpayments is not commensurate with the situation? B. Fedorov. Of course. To a considerable degree the clamor is a continuation of corporate behavior and lobbying efforts. D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Some time ago Gerashchenko's deputy Solovov stated that the Central Bank issued R11 billion in cash to the government on the night of 3 October. What money was it and where did it go? B. Fedorov. They did not issue anything to us. Chernomyrdin had a question: Everything could have dragged out--fighting was underway, banks were closed; people had to be fed, but nobody gave anything for free. It would have been good for the government to have a certain reserve of, specifically, cash. It turned out that the government and the Ministry of Finance did not have a thing. Than we decided to officially withdraw from our account--that of the Ministry of Finance at the Central Bank--a certain amount of cash. Of course, that night nobody was there at the Central Bank. Commercial banks in which we had accounts helped: After a single telephone call they brought 10 billion. We held this money until the end of December, when I decided thus: Why would it sit here and bear no interest--and we returned it. I. Rishina, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA department editor. Today's MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI carries an interview with Shakhray, and these words of his are made into the headline: "...As far as the prospects for Gaydar and Fedorov, I think that they are gone from the government for a long time, most likely for good...." What does he mean? That you are gone, and that the era of Shatalin plus Abalkin, who it seemed to me could have never united, has come? B. Fedorov. Serezha Shakhray was a good guy.... Personally, I am truly pained by the strange behavior of Mr. Shakhray, whom I always considered to be one of the sober-minded individuals. His alliances with certain people, his bowing down to the policy against which he had come out.... My impression is that he has lost his bearings, and is now grasping this fact with difficulty. Those who have seen the academicians' program know that it does not have a single specific proposal. I have not yet read Glazyev's program--the hearings are tomorrow. I have just met the author and said: "Greetings, ideological enemy!" (Laughter). L. Velikanova, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Is there hope that the current situation may end in some civilized way, or does a civil war or a military coup await us, as many people predict? B. Fedorov. I do not believe in a military coup. However, it is unavoidable that the situation will worsen. I think that yet another experiment will be conducted--reform "Red economic manager"-style. Many programs will appear, although no more programs are needed--ever! After all, the entire program may fit on three pages: What are your priorities? What tasks do you set with regard to savings, the exchange rate, the interest rate, the growth of the money supply, and labor productivity? With regard to the real income of the population and the consumption of foodstuffs? That is all! I do not need anything else: We will proceed from this in solving the problems of unemployment and other problems. Yu. Solomonov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in chief. I do not believe that Gerashchenko's scalp can be your final objective. In this case, in the name of what do you work? B. Fedorov. I want major changes in the economy to occur in my country. If only we had overcome inflation and begun to develop quietly.... I think that after everything had been set right it would no longer have been interesting for me, and I would have left for an investment bank--to make money. O. Moroz. At some point will you raise the issue of confidence in our glorious government in the Duma after all? B. Fedorov. There should be weighty grounds for this, for example, the psychological barrier when inflation reaches 30 percent. You will see that the attitude in society will change then. A. Udaltsov. Should we perhaps finish on this note? Thank you for making it here, to us. It is even more interesting for you to come "out of office," because "in office" you need to restrain yourself somewhat on occasion. B. Fedorov. Of course, in that case I would have gone easier on certain names. (Laughter). However, here is yet another interesting detail in conclusion. I quit the State Bank, and the chairman was removed. I quit the Central Committee--the secretary for economics was removed. I quit the Silayev government--Silayev was removed one year later. I quit the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development--Jacques Attali was removed. I have now quit the government.... (Laughter).
