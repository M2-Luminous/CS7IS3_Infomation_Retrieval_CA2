The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' argued whether Britain or any other Western country had the right to question Iran's actions regarding adherence to internationally accepted conventions. "From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which regulate relations between individual countries," said the paper. The editorial said the 1961 and 1963 Vienna Conventions requiring the observance of mutual diplomatic rules among nations have been openly ignored by the West through their overt and covert support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in their countries. "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups they harbor in the West." The paper noted that the Iranian Government has been under increasing domestic public opinion pressure for not allowing Bader-Meinhof, Direct Action or the IRA to have offices in Tehran while anti-Iranian terrorist groups enjoy almost full diplomatic rights in Bonn, Paris and London. "The Iranian public opinion is consistently questioning the government why it adheres to international conventions regarding aiding and abetting terrorists when Western countries so openly and flagrantly ignore the same conventions." The daily termed the latest baseless British protest over the Iran-IRA contact as a "smoke-screen to hide the fact that Western based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing material and personnel to the Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic republic." Commenting on the same subject the Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that apparently Tehran-London ties would never be stable because evidence shows that the Britons have constantly tried to mar mutual ties by taking advantage of the status quo. It added that a review of Tehran-London political ties over the past 15 years reveals that not only such relations could never be relied on, the London government would occasionally misuse the ties under various pretexts. The paper called on the Iranian authorities to bring the ties with London to the lowest possible level, especially in economic field. It also recommended the decision-making bodies in the country to look into the new British game and not allow London to take advantage of such a political-propaganda ploy.
