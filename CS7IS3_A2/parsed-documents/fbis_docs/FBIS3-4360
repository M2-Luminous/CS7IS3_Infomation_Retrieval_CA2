At the same time, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that China will guarantee the quality of Chinese-made rice to be imported by Japan. With regard to the auto issue, Vice Premier Zhu said that since Japanese companies were reluctant to establish joint venture projects in the 1970's, China asked for the cooperation of such auto manufacturers as Germany's Volkswagen; that the Big Three of the United States have recently started producing auto parts in China while Korean companies have indicated their intention to produce auto parts; and that Japanese industries now can probably afford to cooperate in the area of auto parts production.
