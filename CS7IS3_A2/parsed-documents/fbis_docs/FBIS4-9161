According to Szabo, growth increases the demand for investment goods, therefore, we have to expect a deficit in the payment balance for years to come. This will establish the foundations for the long-awaited boom. [Merenyi] Nowadays, the biggest economic policy debates are induced by the attempts to find out what the upset macroeconomic balance indicates: The fact that the crisis is prolonged or that growth has started. What is your view? [Szabo] The truth is somewhere between the two. The same figures can indicate different phenomena. At the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, the primary cause of the decline was our reduced exports, which in turn was mainly caused by the recession in Western Europe. However, now, the same figure of balance deficit indicates something else. The bigger half of imports consisted of investment goods in 1993, too. The payment balance will continue to be negative for another three to four years and Western recession will play a decreasing role in this. The main cause will be the investment needs of growth. [Merenyi] This has never been questioned by anyone. At the same time, the statistical data give the impression that the decisive section of imports is used for stocking up raw materials and for consumer goods. Some of the foreign resources cover public consumption. [Szabo] It is undoubtedly true that public consumption has increased to a certain extent. However, this was not decisive in 1993, either. If I disregard the fighter planes bought from Russia in exchange for the Soviet state debt, then half of the remaining amount consisted of engineering imports. Half of the consumer goods imports consists of pharmaceutical products which again is not in the luxury category. Therefore, the proportions are increasingly shifting toward investments that are the basis of growth. I admit that stockpiling in the enterprises is an existing phenomenon, however, the 4.3 percent industrial growth consumes this: The industrial sphere began to grow already in 1993 and the agricultural sphere will do this in 1994. The GDP may rise by as much as 1.5 percent. This will not, of course, be an even growth, but it is certain that we are over the worst. It is possible that the point is that the state of the economy is better than can be shown by statistics. [Merenyi] The balance of payments deficit ultimately means the import of foreign resources because it is only partially covered by the inflow of working capital. In other words, the debt is increasing. For how long? [Szabo] We also have to add here that the repayment of debts means a huge withdrawal of resources from the Hungarian economy. Therefore, the real question in my view is if the incoming resources do actually serve economic growth. In other words, whether there will be some gain from it or will it only help to finance the budget deficit. In 1991, the budget situation was much better, perhaps we should have taken on more loans for modernization at that time. However, at that time, everyone was very cautious about increasing the foreign debt. [Merenyi] And mainly the Hungarian Democratic Forum was cautious. [Szabo] Not only. The attitude that the requirements of the balance have to be placed above growth was generally accepted in financial circles. This was partly justified by the need to suppress inflation. Nevertheless, it might have been worthwhile increasing the debt by a few billion U.S. dollars at that time. [Merenyi] Has the government decided on any measures that will improve the balance? [Szabo] The cabinet is very seriously dealing with the issue that once we managed to induce some growth, it should not be quashed by a general suppression of consumption which also cools off investments. We have to find methods to curb the population's consumption, especially the luxury consumption. [Merenyi] Is it not shortsighted that in December 1993, at the Finance Ministry's initiative, the limit that defined to what extent the Hungarian National Bank [MNB] can finance the budget deficit was lifted? [Szabo] In my view, the formulation of the central bank law proved shortsightedness because it did not detect the negative processes in the economy, and it remained insensitive to the budget difficulties. Raising the former 4-percent financing limit to 80 billion forints meant that economic reality was taken into consideration. Naturally, in the long run, it is best if the central bank simply does not participate in financing the budget. I am now expecting a quiet breakthrough on this. The central bank as a foreign currency authority has just given permission to the Finance Ministry to issue forint bonds to people classed as foreigners under the Foreign Exchanges Act. This is the first step. [Merenyi] Has the Finance Ministry's relationship with the MNB improved since the bank started to conduct a less strict financial policy and personnel changes were also implemented? [Szabo] This is not an issue of personnel. All institutions protect rock solidly their power positions. The central bank, for example, protected its foreign exchange monopoly while the commercial banks began to issue bonds on the international capital and money markets. However, at the time, the MNB did not give permission to the state to do this. [Merenyi] The debate on the forint devaluation also accompanied the government's operation. What are your views on this now? [Szabo] If the pressure of wage increases above the level of inflation is not removed through a social agreement, devaluation only has a short-term benefit and much rather helps the prices than exports to increase. [Merenyi] Among the many contradictory indicators, there is a clear one: The budget deficit is at the planned level. This has not happened before. What is the reason? [Szabo] Although occasional "blows" exist on both the revenue and expenditure sides, we managed to keep them in balance. In addition to this, we have also had a change of attitude: When we calculated the 330-billion-forint deficit, we tried to produce a realistic figure. We have also achieved positive results in the area of tax discipline. In addition to this, for the first time this year, the issuance of bonds is scheduled which eliminates the liquidity problems of the central budget. [Merenyi] So the taxpayers are better at paying. Has the management of publicly financed institutions become stricter? [Szabo] This is a question of the reform of state finances. We are not working on an overall program, rather, we are examining the duties of the central sphere. We will be able to include the results of this in next year's budget. The discipline of management has to be strengthened and has to be newly regulated in laws. From financing in proportion to time, we have to progress toward financing that is linked to performance. It is important to regulate anew the management of treasury assets, and to accept the law on public purchases; we will hand over the draft bill on this to the next government. It is also unavoidable to reduce the number of special funds, at least to the level that is used in the European Union. [Merenyi] These are obvious facts for experts. Why have these measures not been taken in the past years? [Szabo] Measures have certainly been taken. However, they are very difficult to implement. The deficit of state finances is so big now that necessity will force the implementation of these measures.... [Merenyi] Why is the government's decision being delayed on the second step of bank consolidation? [Szabo] The government decided in 1993 that the capital injections have to be completed by 31 May. Concrete technical preparations are in progress, and this does not require further government decisions. The government will receive reports after the general meetings. [Merenyi] At what stage is the report that you will hand over to your successor on the work of the Finance Ministry? [Szabo] The report on the Finance Ministry's personnel and structural situation will be completed by the end of May. In addition to this, we are preparing an overall report on the processes that have been completed and the ones that are at the preparation stage. I am convinced that my successor will receive a well-arranged and clear report whichever party he should represent. I would have been very happy if I had been able to take over the leadership of finance in the same way. Unfortunately, I found nothing but empty drawers. I did not receive anything from my predecessor. I learned from this and I know how inconvenient it was. [Merenyi] Will this summary include the list of guarantees taken on by the government? [Szabo] On the basis of end-of-March data I can say that we are maintaining 48 guarantees based on individual government decisions and these amount to 122 billion forints. At the most, some 22 billion forints will apply to 1994, however, it is unlikely that the whole amount will be drawn. The final scheduling of the guarantees will be contained in the bank contracts, and a significant amount of them can only be drawn after a five- to 10-year wait. Therefore, I believe that if we adhere to the 3-percent limit defined in the law on state finances then we are not taking on a big risk. At the same time, we are helping the development of industrial capacities suitable for export production for which it is justified to give guarantees.
