It amounted to an unwarranted and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of the country. Advani reacted to Clinton's recent statements which were earlier criticised bv BJP spokespersons and its external affairs cell with a view to put the Kashmir issue into focus on the national agenda. The observations made by Clinton while accepting credentials of the Pakistani ambassador were totally against diplomatic norms as such occasions were never used to attack a third country, Advani said. He reiterated that Kashmir was an integral part of India and the Indian people were confident of safeguarding its territory. He said the present US stand on Kashmir was against its earlier view in which it had recognised Kashmir as an integral part of India. [passage omitted] *
