If one were to believe the chiefs of governments, the visit's most important goal was achieved: Problems that are obstacles to economic cooperation were defined with precision, while individual ministers were obliged to come up with proposals for solutions by May of this year. The prime ministers for both countries will meet again in two months--it is very likely that this time the meeting will take place in Warsaw--in order to sign the necessary agreements. It seems that both politicians were interested in breaking the impediments that have been in effect for many months now, in economic relations between Poland and Russia. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the situation requires a speeding up of work on putting financial problems in order, on working out new payment mechanisms, and on regulating the issue of mutual indebtedness. Prime Minister Pawlak was also full of optimism. In his view, thanks to the cooperation between the two governments, a prospect for signing trade agreements for years to come is realistic, including signing a trade protocol before the end of this year. The most important issue, said the Polish government's chief during a short meeting with journalists, is that the declarations and agreements signed earlier actually be implemented. That is indeed the essence of a "Partnership for Development" concept proposed by the Polish Government. The point is to create conditions that would make it possible to establish practical cooperation among countries and nations. While responding to a question pertaining to the resolution of a key issue within Polish-Russian economic cooperation--that is, the issue of indebtedness--Prime Minister Pawlak said the issue will be further debated by experts. Old debts should in no way be an obstacle to current cooperation. Viktor Chernomyrdin shared that view. Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin was more skeptical. According to him, solving the problem of mutual indebtedness requires a political decision at the level of prime ministers or perhaps even at the level of presidents. After negotiations with the two previous Polish cabinets, which lasted years, a few more compromise solutions must be worked out, to be able to eventually "finalize the issue." Henryk Chmielak, secretary of state in the Finance Ministry, said that both sides have agreed to apply the payment mechanism used in talks with the Paris Club. At the end of the Polish-Russian talks, which were conducted in the rebuilt wing of the "White House" (old headquarters of the Supreme Council), where Chernomyrdin's Cabinet has moved, both prime ministers signed two agreements: regarding employing Russians in Poland and employing Poles in Russia, and an agreement on cooperation regarding antitrust policies. An agreement on agriculture was also signed. During the meeting between the prime ministers in May, the following agreements may be signed: regarding military and technical cooperation (this allegedly is supposed to be on cooperation among arms factories, with third markets in mind), on joint transportation ventures (Berlin-Warsaw-Moscow highway and railway), and on a Russia-Europe natural gas pipeline. * * * After his return from Moscow, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that President Lech Walesa will be the first to hear from him regarding the results of Pawlak's conversations with Russian politicians. According to the government's chief, the most important part of the visit was about determining a time frame for subsequent contacts aimed at signing an agreement on supplies of strategic raw materials that would last for many years. According to Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade, there is a chance for signing an agreement concerning pipeline construction. That venture would be financed exclusively by Polish and Russian companies. --by M. W.
