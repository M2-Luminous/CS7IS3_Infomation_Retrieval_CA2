After the talks, Geza Jeszenszky said that he was glad to learn that the Serbs in Hungary do not have complaints that could hinder long-term Hungarian-Serbian cooperation. They agreed that settling the Yugoslav crisis is in the interest of both countries. Jeszenszky expressed the hope that the obstacles hindering Hungarian-Serbian relations would disappear. He said it was important that the Serbs in Hungary had no problems in having contacts with the mother country despite the international embargo on Rump Yugoslavia. According to Jeszenszky, lifting the sanctions is in the interest of both Hungarians and the international community. Hungary has always urged peace and a just solution. Answering a question put by NEPSZABADSAG, Geza Jeszenszky expressed his hope that his visit in Belgrade could contribute to easing the rather cold Hungarian-Serbian relations of recent years and to moving away from the deadlock. Jeszenszky hopes that, after the visit, the Serbian press will present an image of Hungarian politics that is closer to reality and is able to dissipate the prejudices and misconceptions.
