FR940406-0-00175 FR940406-0-00012 1. GM As indicated above, GM currently projects its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE level at 20.5 mpg. It has also identified certain risks related to technology and mix which it says could reduce its CAFE level by as much as 0.5 mpg in MY 1996 and 0.3 mpg in MY 1997. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, however, the agency has analyzed these potential risks and believes that they are unlikely to have as large an effect as GM believes. In addition, GM has identified an additional product action it is considering which could also reduce its CAFE. However, NHTSA believes the issues of whether GM will actually take the product action, and if so, what the fleet penetration would be for MYs 1996&hyph;97, are too speculative to justify an adjustment to GM's CAFE capability. NHTSA notes that it is not identifying the product action because it is confidential business information. After carefully evaluating GM's product plan, NHTSA believes that company is capable of achieving a light truck CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both MYs 1996 and 1997. The factors explaining the difference between GM's projection and the agency's estimate of its capability are discussed below. First, as discussed in the NPRM, GM projects that a much larger portion of its MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet will have four-wheel drive (4WD) than it has had in recent years, or than its competitors are projecting. The agency stated in the NPRM that it is not aware of any reason to expect that the 4WD market will continue to increase. NHTSA also stated that it believes there are alternatives to 4WD, including traction control. GM commented that it believes its forecast of MYs 1996&hyph;97 4WD penetration is realistic, stating that competitors' actions in the 4WD segments, the use of all-wheel drive configurations and market data for future years support its projections. GM also argued that traction control is not an alternative to 4WD trucks since it has little benefit for off-road applications. The agency continues to believe that it is unlikely that the 4WD market share will increase appreciably for the fleet in general, or for GM in particular, over the timeframe between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97. Since the mid-1980's, the 4WD share of total light truck sales for each model year has consistently been within the range of 32&hyph;35 percent. No data have been presented to the agency which demonstrate that this share will significantly change by MYs 1996&hyph;97. The agency notes that, while it agrees that traction control isn't an alternative to 4WD for off-road applications, it would be a reasonable alternative for on-road use for many consumers. No evidence has been presented to the agency which shows that there will be increased need or demand for more 4WD or off-road vehicles. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, since NHTSA believes that GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans overstate the percentage of 4WD vehicles that it will sell, the agency has adjusted that company's CAFE projections to reflect what it believes is a more realistic share. In making this adjustment, the agency assumed that GM's 4WD percentage for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will be the same as for MY 1993, the model year in which GM had its highest 4WD share ever. NHTSA also refined the analysis presented in the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) to more accurately reflect the particular vehicles that GM is likely to sell more of and less of. With this adjustment, and assuming that the 4WD share of GM's light truck fleet for MYs 1996&hyph;97 is consistent with both that company's and its competitors' historical levels, its CAFE would be more than 0.1 mpg higher in MY 1996, although it would be less than half that amount higher in MY 1997. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that the GM fleet leads the other manufacturers in every engine performance calculation carried out by the agency and that GM's performance levels are detrimental to its fuel economy performance. The agency indicated, for example, that if GM's light truck fleet for MY 1995 were closer to the values achieved by other manufacturers for the various performance measurements, GM's CAFE values in that model year might be improved by between 0.3 and 0.4 mpg. GM commented that it disagrees with the agency's assessment in the NPRM that GM's CAFE could be boosted 0.4 mpg by lowering engine performance. That company stated that it believes that NHTSA's performance adjustment was based on an incorrect sales weighted analysis of GM's performance levels compared to its competitors. GM stated that a manufacturer's average performance level, like many other vehicle attributes such as average weight or engine displacement, is a function of the mix it sells. That company stated that when its mix is compared to its competitors' mix, GM's performance levels do not appear to be out of line with other manufacturers. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the agency has evaluated GM's comment concerning comparative performance levels. NHTSA has also reviewed revised MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet projections submitted by GM and Ford, which resulted in reduced fleet average values for almost all performance measures. In light of these adjustments, NHTSA has concluded that the performance level of the GM fleet is only slightly greater than its competitors and that GM can make a small improvement in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE by bringing its performance levels more in line with its competitors. The value of a CAFE adjustment if GM were to reach comparable levels of performance would be nearly 0.2 mpg in both MYs 1996 and 1997. NHTSA believes that there are few other opportunities available to GM to make small improvements in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE. There is little time left before the start of the MY 1996 production in, roughly, July 1995. It is unlikely that GM can make any significant technological change to its products to increase its average fuel economy in this period, and the agency is unable to discern any technology plans for MY 1997 that might be pulled ahead for earlier introduction in MY 1996. The additional leadtime before MY 1997 production begins may allow for some minor technological improvements. The agency estimates that these could increase GM's CAFE by up to 0.1 mpg in MY 1997.
