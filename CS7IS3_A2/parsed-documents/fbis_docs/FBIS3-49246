This is how Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], reacted to the Slovak president's New Year address, which was broadcast on radio and television on Saturday [1 January]. Slovakia does indeed need a broad coalition, the KDH chairman continued, and our movement is ready to form such a coalition along with those parties or parts of parties whose programs are compatible with our program in the sense that at least a compromise is possible. Other politicians, too, voiced their opinions on the contents of the Slovak president's New Year address. "The idea of a broad coalition is not new. The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] endorsed it before and after the elections. We have never claimed that we have five experts for every ministerial post [allusion to Prime Minister Meciar's statement] and that we could accomplish everything on our own," SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said. "The SDL was ready to cooperate, but the idea of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was such that it would share not power but only responsibility for the execution of power. Saying `join us' represents no platform for cooperation. A broad coalition is not possible with the HZDS as a whole, but only with that part of the HZDS that is willing and able to draw moral and political conclusions from the mistakes committed by the ruling movement," the SDL chairman added. Milan Secansky (HZDS): "What I appreciated in the president's New Year address were his words about Slovakia's prosperity, which, as he stressed, can be achieved only through unity. I consider the unification of the politically fragmented forces in Slovakia the only way to achieve prosperity." Vojtech Bugar (Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement): "The president realistically assessed the possibilities for the emergence of a broad coalition, which should stabilize the political situation in Slovakia. Current problems must not be brought to a head but tackled. I cannot help but agree with this view. And I can even agree with the view that, without the HZDS, it is impossible to form a broad coalition. However, I am convinced that it is possible to form such a coalition without Mr. Meciar."
