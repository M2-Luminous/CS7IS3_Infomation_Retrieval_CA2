However, he maintained: "This is not disturbing, because civil society has become increasingly organized, and will not allow them to have their way." This was his comment on the statements made by the director of the Almoloya de Juarez prison, Juan Pablo de Tavira, who charged that drug traffickers, through agencies of that type, are attempting to have the country's high security jails eliminated. He declared: "It is obvious that, in places such as the Federal District and Mexico State, the drug trafficking Mafia has manipulated presumed human rights defenders, to plead in cases of persons arrested for crimes against health, or to call for the repeal of measures such as the establishment of high security prisons." However, he added: "They have no prospect of attaining their goals." He also indicated that the state Congress might possibly confirm him in his position for another three years. Otherwise, he would accept the vice presidency of the Mexican Academy of Human Rights. He indicated: "There is a large number of drug traffickers in custody, accounting for 30 percent of the prison population in the entire state."
