"I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the prime minister told a hastily convened news conference at his official residence. Hata, 58, said his decision to give up the premiership is based on his firm belief that a "political vacuum" should be avoided as Japan faces a host of domestic and international challenges. The resignation of the Hata Cabinet was to be approved at an emergency cabinet meeting which got under way immediately following the announcement. The decision to disband the two-month-old minority coalition government was taken just hours before the House of Representatives was to convene a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion submitted by the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the Diet," Hata told the press conference. "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means." The decision on resignation en bloc was made at a meeting of coalition leaders earlier in the day and it was agreed to allow the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), both in the opposition camp, to form a new government, coalition sources said. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was what his party has demanded, adding it will seek to forge a third coalition government. Coalition and SDP leaders failed to bridge their policy gap in two days of on-and-off realliance talks. The Hata government was formed in April after its predecessor, headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, collapsed in a dispute over the former prime minister's alleged shady financial dealings. The SDP, partner in the Hosokawa coalition that ousted the LDP from power after 38 years of uninterrupted rule, left the ruling alliance after Hosokawa quit. The no-confidence motion that was threatening to scuttle the Hata administration was widely expected to clear the 511-seat lower house with the backing of the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party, which jointly command a parliamentary strength of 221 votes, and some other parties.
