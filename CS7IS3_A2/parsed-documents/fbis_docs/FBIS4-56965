According to Police Inspector Mauro Sposito, superintendent of the Amazonas State PF, the traffickers use fish to smuggle the drugs. Sposito said that it has been learned that cocaine trafficking from Colombia to the United States is controlled by two Colombian brothers known as Evaristo and Henri. They own two fish packing plants that are used in the laundering of drug trafficking money. A supervisor at the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, who did not want to identify himself, suspects that the Colombian boats that come to Brazil to fetch fish are loaded with cocaine.
