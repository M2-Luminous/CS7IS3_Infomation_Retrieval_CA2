FR940610-0-00023 FR940610-0-00011 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;7] Amendment to Class E Airspace; Kalispell, MT AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Kalispell, Montana, Class E airspace. This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal areas in western Montana. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Riley, ANM&hyph;537, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;7, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Kalispell, Montana, Class E airspace area (59 FR 13263). This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal area in western Montana. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are now Class E airspace areas. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Kalispell, Montana. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
