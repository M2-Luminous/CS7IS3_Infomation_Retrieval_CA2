We should state though that the chief expert of the St. Petersburg Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, Oleg Parkov, denied in an interview with the NK-Press Agency rumors about an epidemic allegedly breaking out in the city. At the same time, he stated that in July 1993 alone, 333 scabies patients were recorded in the city. Of these, 74 are children under the age of 14. The situation is further complicated in that there is a catastrophic shortage of drugs in the city. As for diphtheria, St. Petersburg is ahead in the number of patients and morbidity among Russian cities. In July alone, 158 cases of diphtheria were recorded; of these, eight patients have died. The first cases of diphtheria were recorded in Lithuania this year. A mother and daughter from Kaunas became ill on 2 Aug but sought a physician's help only four days later. The girl who is in a critical condition is in the resuscitation department. There are speculations that she was infected by relatives from St. Petersburg.
