According to the document, Russian troops' weapons, fighting equipment and other military property are declared the property of Tiraspol. A statement by the Army Military Council issued today says that the Dniester authorities have demonstrated utter contempt of the Russian Federation and its efforts to uphold peace in the region. Announcing that Tiraspol "is at state level encouraging the seizure of the 14th Army's sites, armaments and hardware," the military council of the Russian amalgamation of guards has lodged a strong protest with the Dniester authorities and demand that the law in question be repealed.
