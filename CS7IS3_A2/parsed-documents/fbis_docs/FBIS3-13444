Kozyrev had earlier held talks with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat with regard to giving a boost to the Middle East peace process. This was also the chief topic of a meeting between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and President 'Arafat. The Palestinian president held a dinner banquet in honor of the Russian foreign minister, to which Foreign Minister Ben Yahia was invited. After the dinner talks were held between the Palestinian and Russian delegations. Mr. Ben Yahia also attended the discussions. After the two-hour working session with President 'Arafat and his aides, which was attended by Mr. Ben Yahia, the Russian foreign minister announced in Tunis that the PLO chairman is ready to resume the negotiations with Israel. He told journalists, in President 'Arafat's presence, that he was very pleased to announce that President 'Arafat had made a most important and brave political decision by promising to resume the negotiations and continue the peace process. President 'Arafat, who avoided talking about the resumption of negotiations with Israel, confined himself to saying that he remains committed to the peace process despite the tragedy and the massacre. The Russian foreign minister stressed the brave character of President 'Arafat's decision and pointed out his great contribution to establishing an era of comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. He added that he had given President 'Arafat an invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Moscow, without specifying a date. President 'Arafat declared that the Palestinian leadership is expecting guarantees from the peace co-sponsors -- that is, the United States and Russia -- for the protection of the Palestinian people and their holy places. He said also that it is expecting Israel to carry out confidence-building measures for the continuation of the peace process. The Russian foreign minister stated that what is required is to work first and specifically for reaching an agreement on Gaza and Jericho as soon as possible. He stressed that his country will work with all determination for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September between the PLO and Israel. He then emphasized that the United States and Russia had pledged, in their capacity as co-sponsors of the peace process, to watch over the full implementation of the resolution which will be adopted by the UN Security Council on the Hebron massacre. He also said that he will hold specific and serious talks with his U.S. counterpart at their meeting on Monday, regarding the elements of the resumption of peace and on the guarantees that the peace co-sponsors must provide in order to guarantee continuous progress for these negotiations. On his arrival in Tunis for a brief visit, the Russian foreign minister said that Tunisia's role is essential within the framework of the efforts for the resumption of the Middle East peace process. He said that he had come to meet Foreign Minister Ben Yahia and President 'Arafat; he wished, he said, to express to President 'Arafat Russia's support for his brave leadership, his efforts to establish peace in the region, and his determination to prevent the enemies of peace from impeding its course. He added that he would hold thoroughgoing talks with President 'Arafat on the current situation in the region and ways to push forward the peace process. Asked whether he had any proposals, he said: We have some ideas but we rely on the wisdom of President 'Arafat and his aides for progressing along the course of peace. He then pointed out that he had an important message from President Boris Yeltsin to President 'Arafat. With regard to the Russian proposal concerning a call for a new international peace conference on the Middle East, Mr. Kozyrev said that that proposal remains open and what is certain now is the need to focus on seeking the means to rescue the peace process.
