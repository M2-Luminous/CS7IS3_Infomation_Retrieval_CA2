But we hope that that time will come soon. For three years now, we have been treading water. I think that everyone is fed up with the crisis, and it is time we end it. Maybe some people take pleasure in this crisis, just to keep a myth or an illusion alive. But for us, the Allied Forces, that is too much indeed. The Zairian people have become an object. A politician cannot try to reign over skeletons or dead bodies. We engage in politics to lead human beings who are alive. The Allied Forces are proud, really proud, and we showed it in front of the cameras. We are proud to have done what we did. When things return to normal, history will someday remember that a handful of men, who are not much talked about in this country and who did not have the ambition of obtaining the divine right of dominating others, freely and defying all dangers decided to write another page of this country's history. The Allied Forces are not asking to be worshiped, because they are not God, but only poor mortals such as yourselves. They are only asking to be judged objectively and impartially. We are not asking the media to praise us. We did what we did to the best of our knowledge and belief, before God, the nation, and history. The day will come when--as is often said--this joke will be over, and we will go to the polls to see who really leads a change-supporting camp and who does not. Leaders of a change-supporting camp are competent leaders who want progress -- they are good leaders. Those who want no change belong to a bad camp. In any case we, the Allied Forces, are aware that we have sincere friends who support us. They are not our slaves. They are our equals [words indistinct] political leaders not to be considered superior to the others, (?Because we are like the others). We are working in this spirit of truth, knowing that the people's confidence is not eternal. At a given time, the people will wake up and see whether their leaders are ruling (?as due) [words indistinct]. For us, true change comes in various phases. There is a change of men, in leadership, in institutions, and in management systems. Today, we can change our leaders, as is done normally in a democratic country, through the election process. [passage in local dialect] nothing will change. This means that the Third Republic might be the same as the second one if the people choose incompetent leaders. If the people do not put in place institutions adapted to current requirements and if these leaders chosen by the people continue to manage the country, as was the case during the Second Republic, nothing will change.
