He told Interfax in an exclusive interview on the eve of the inauguration ceremony that the Komi leaders had turned down the idea of instituting the post of president in their republic. "We are an inalienable part of the Russian Federation," he said. "Even if the leaders of the republics and regions are elected by the people, they must not be called presidents, he added. To quote Spiridonov, the Constitution of the Komi Republic provides the local parliament with sufficient rights to control the head of the government. "A president does not head either the legislative or the executive bodies. He is above both, so it is not the president that we are electing. The head of the Komi Republic directly runs the government, the responsibility he bears is much greater than that of the president of any republic," he said. He expressed regret that the new Russian Constitution does not contain the Federation Treaty. This makes the Center and the constituent entities conclude a bilateral agreement in each particular instance, said Spiridonov.
