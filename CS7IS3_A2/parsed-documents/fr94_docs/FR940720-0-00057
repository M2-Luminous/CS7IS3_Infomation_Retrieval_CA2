FR940720-0-00057 FR940720-0-00005 The State's proposed rules are essentially the same as the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii). In addition to meeting one of the three basic tests, the State's proposed rules also require the applicant to have a tangible net worth that is six times its total self-bonds in Pennsylvania and that amounts to 90 percent of its total assets. This requirement is similar to a financial assurance requirement of the EPA's regulations for hazardous waste facilities (47 FR 15032, April 7, 1982). In it preamble, EPA stated that ``This requirement was included to help ensure accessibility to funds in the event of bankruptcy or other default.'' There is no counterpart Federal requirement for these additional tangible net worth components of the basic financial tests in OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b). However, this rule implements the Pennsylvania statute requiring the same. The rules add the assurance of the financial stability of the applicant. Therefore, the State's proposed rules at subsection (f) are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii). d. Section 86.159(b)(4). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (b)(4) that, in the past 36 months, the applicant has not defaulted on any payments of dividend or sinking fund installments, lease rentals and reclamation fees. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. e. Section 86.159(d). The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(f) allow the regulatory authority to request update information from the applicant within 90 days after the close of each fiscal year following the issuance of the self-bond or corporate guarantee. This was intended to give the regulatory authority flexibility to require additional information if it believed it was necessary. Pennsylvania has submitted a similar requirement at subsection (d) requesting some of the financial information specified in the Federal rule. Since this is discretionary on the part of the regulatory authority, the Director finds that the proposed rule is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(f). f. Section 86.159(e). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (e) that if the applicant or the CPA submits false information the application will be disallowed and render the applicant ineligible to self-bond. In addition, this section subjects the applicant and the CPA to criminal penalties for false swearing. There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the Federal rules envision that an applicant will answer truthfully. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. g. Section 86.159(g). The State's proposed rule at subsection (g) is similar to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4)(i) which require submittal of an accountant's audit opinion or review opinion on the financial statements with no adverse opinion. However, the State has expanded its rule at this section to disqualify an applicant on the basis of both an adverse opinion and a disclaimer opinion by an accountant. In addition, an applicant may be determined to be ineligible to self-bond on the basis of other qualifications in the opinion expressed by the CPA. The Director finds that the proposed rule is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4)(i). h. Section 86.159(h). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (h) that the total value of outstanding plus proposed self-bonds for coal mining activities may not exceed 25 percent of the applicant's tangible net worth in the United States. This is similar to the counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.23(d). However, the Federal rule also requires for corporate guarantees that the total amount of the parent corporation guarantor's present and proposed self-bonds and guaranteed self-bonds for coal mining activities shall not exceed 25 percent of the guarantor's net worth in the United States. Under the proposed Pennsylvania self-bonding rules, the parent corporation is always a party to the self-bond and is established as a co-indemnitor under the self-bond. In applying the proposed Pennsylvania rule, an applicant may rely on its parent's qualifications to be accepted under the self-bonding rules. If this is so, the parent is thus subject to the 25 percent requirements. The Director finds the proposed rule is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(d). i. Section 86.159(i). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (i) that the period of liability under a self-bond is determined in accordance with the existing bonding regulations. Similarly, the release of a self-bond is to be governed by the existing regulations. Pennsylvania also proposes that the liability under a self-bond is terminated upon the Department's approval of alternative bonding submitted by the applicant. The Director finds the cross-references to other rules is consistent with the Federal bonding regulations at 30 CFR 800.13 and 800.40 and its replacement provision is similar to and no less effective than the counterpart Federal provision at 30 CFR 800.30.
