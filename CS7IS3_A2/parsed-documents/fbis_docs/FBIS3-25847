The region's imports and exports in 1993 reached US$52.06 million, of which imports were $51.2 million and exports were $868,000. The total increased 32 percent over the previous year. The net amount of import tax delivered to the state was 64.06 million yuan. Reporters learned this from the regional foreign trade import-export company's 11 January work conference. Under the situation in which an import market has not been formed and the consumer market is still relatively narrow in this region, the regional foreign trade company actively cooperated with enterprises in other localities of the country to expand trade and other business operations. In 1993, the regional foreign trade department strived to expand trade with neighboring countries. The foreign trade company and a Nepalese business concern jointly set up a carpet plant in Lhasa. The Nepalese company's investment was $100,000 and the foreign trade company's was 2.2 million renminbi [yuan]. The plant was formally put into operation in July, and the plant produced over 600 square meters of handmade Tibetan carpets as of the end of last year. In 1993, the plant exported items with a total value of $388,000 and imported items with a total of $160,000 through border trade. Various departments and branch offices of the regional foreign trade company have been bold in exploring new business opportunities. Two new enterprises were set up with good results as of the end of last year, and five other ventures are being studied. In 1993, the autonomous region's foreign trade center used more than 600,000 yuan of long-stocked funds and realized a total profit of 10 million yuan. It changed the situation of suffering losses in previous years. The foreign trade company also acts as an agent to handle import business for units in various areas of the region. It has signed contracts with foreign companies totalling $3.696 million, of which the Yanghu Power Station accounted for $2.07 million, and $2.087 million have been utilized.
