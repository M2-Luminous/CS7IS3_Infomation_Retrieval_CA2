Responding to a question on the election of a new president, KKE Honorary Chairman Kharilaos Florakis said yesterday in Larissa: "Is it in the country's best interest to have elections? If a political party believes that it is, it will move toward elections regardless of the nominee. However, if a political party believes that there is no need for elections now, it is the candidate's name that will determine the party's stance. If you ask whether we will vote for Papandreou, I answer: We will not vote for him. Don't you see his policy? How is it different from the policy of New Democracy? The basic goals of their policy are the same. Their difference is that one was in love with the Germans, and the other in love with the Americans."
