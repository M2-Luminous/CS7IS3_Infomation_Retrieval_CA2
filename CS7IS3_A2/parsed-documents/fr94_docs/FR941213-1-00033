FR941213-1-00033 FR941213-1-00009 Many commuter airlines already train their cockpit crew at a level comparable to part 121 operators. Primarily, this group consists of those airlines where the carrier operates aircraft under both parts 121 and 135. The FAA estimates that the proposed rule would affect 3,400 employees: 1,100 pilots-in-command (PICs), 1,400 second-in-command officers (SICs), and 900 flight attendants who work for strictly part 135 operators. The hourly wage rate (including benefits) equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $23 for flight attendants who work for the regional airlines. Travel and per diem expenses equal $250 per round trip and training expense totals $90 a day. For 1995, initial and transitional training costs for part 135 crewmembers would increase by about $1.9 million; first year recurrent cost of training (expected to be more extensive than later recurrent training) would increase by $3.0 million. Recurrent training cost after the first year would increase by $2.1 million. For the period 1994 through 2003, the discounted incremental cost to part 135 operators ranges from $27.1 (10 percent new-hire rate) to $35.7 million (20 percent new-hire rate). CRM Training The NPRM would require parts 121 and 135 operators affected by the proposal to train all crewmembers in cockpit resource management (CRM). Although the proposed rule would provide some flexibility in curricula design, an FAA-approved CRM training program would include: (1) Awareness of CRM issues where aspects of the problem are discussed; (2) practice and feedback where crewmembers learn CRM techniques; and (3) reinforcement where CRM principles are strengthened. Part 121 CRM Training Costs The FAA estimates that part 121 personnel requiring CRM equals about 32,600 pilots-in-command; 33,900 copilots, 10,000 flight engineers, 84,000 flight attendants; and 1,100 dispatchers. Under the proposed rule, the FAA projects that PICs, SICs, and flight engineers would receive 12 hours of CRM awareness training and 4 hours annually of CRM refresher training. Flight attendants and dispatchers would receive 8 hours initial and 2 hours of recurrent training. For PICs, SICs, and flight engineers, the proposal would require CRM awareness training within two years of the effective date of the proposed rule; for flight attendants and dispatchers, it would require completion within three years. All crewmembers would receive recurrent CRM training annually. The number of pilots undergoing initial training in the two-year phase-in equals the total number of pilots plus new hires. The hourly wage rate (including benefits) used in this analysis equals $55 for PICs, $38 for SICs, $38 for flight engineers, $27 for flight attendants, and $18 for dispatchers. The initial training during the first two years would cost approximately $55 million each year. Initial training would amount to about $10 million annually after the two-year phase-in period. Recurrent training would total about $32 million annually. Initial training for flight attendants and dispatchers over the three-year phase-in period would total $17 million. Initial and recurrent training for flight attendants and dispatchers after the third year would be $4 million and $17 million, respectively Over the period 1995 through 2004, the discounted cost for part 121 CRM training ranges from $473 (10 percent new hire rate) to $569 million (20 percent new hire rate). Part 135␣CRM Training The FAA estimates that the NPRM would require CRM for 3,360 commuter airline flight crewmembers. CRM awareness training would cost $300 for 12 hours of PIC and SIC training and $200 for 8 hours of flight attendant training. As in the case of the part 121 CRM training, the proposed rule would require CRM awareness flight crew training within two years of the effective date of the rule; for flight attendants, the proposed rule would require completion within three years. All crewmembers would receive annual recurrent CRM training. The hourly wage rate (including benefits) used in this analysis equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $14 for flight attendants. Part 135 CRM awareness training for the two-year phase-in period under the NPRM would cost $1.6 million, and after the second year the training would cost $0.5 million annually. Recurrent CRM commuter pilot instruction would cost $0.7 million annually. CRM awareness training for part 135 flight attendants would cost $0.4 million annually for the three-year phase-in period. The cost would total $64,000 per year, thereafter. Recurrent training would cost approximately $137,000 annually. Over the decade, CRM training would the industry cost would range from $9.5 (10 percent new hire rate) to $11.8 million (20 percent new hire rate). Total Costs The total discounted cost of the proposed rule would range from $510 to $616 million over the next 10 years. The cost of CRM for part 121 personnel makes up the largest portion of the cost estimate ranges from $473 to $569 million. The discounted 10-year cost for commuter personnel CRM would vary from $9 to $12 million. The training upgrade for large commuter aircraft would range from $27 to $36 million. Benefits The proposed rule would improve aviation safety by upgrading training standards for pilots flying part 135 aircraft either certified for two pilots or having 10 or more passenger seats. Also, the NPRM would instruct air carrier (part 121) and commuter (part 135) crews in CRM techniques. This summarizes the analysis of benefits from this training. Part 135 Pilot Training Upgrade During 1982 through 1992, pilot error was a probable cause in 39 accidents involving part 135 aircraft of the type affected by this proposal. These accidents caused 93 fatalities and 55 serious injuries. During this same period, commuter operators flew 41.15 million flights resulting in a commuter accident rate due to pilot error of .9478 accidents per million commuter flights. Projected benefits equal the product of the accident rate times projected flights times the average cost of pilot-error accidents. For instance, in 1994 the estimated value of benefits equals: [.9478 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS]×[5.0 MILLION FLIGHTS]×[$7.838 MILLION]=$37.144 MILLION If the proposed rule could reduce the pilot-error accident rate to zero, the total value over the period 1995 through 2004 would total $418 million. The discounted value of these benefits equals $289 million. However, at most the rule would reduce the part 135 pilot-error accident rate down to the rate sustained by part 121 operators.
