Addressing the Japan Federation of Economic Organization (Keidanren) here today, Donald Tsing, secretary for the Treasury, said big investment will also be launched to meet the everyday needs of the population. A major expansion of the Lowu station would be completed early next year, and the government was considering the feasibility of a new railway to the border through the northwest New Territories to link up with the Chinese national rail system, he said. He added that planning for more container terminals is under way. He said the government was particularly satisfied that many Japanese construction firms had participated in the government funded core program projects of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok and helped contribute towards the remarkable progress to-date. Opportunities are plenty for private sector participation in Hong Kong's major infrastructural projects for the coming years, the secretary said. "Hong Kong will continue to prosper as we embark on our ambitious but essential works programs to build for the future," he said.
