The president is expected to send a letter to the Sejm speaker. The president told PAP on Tuesday that he considered the Sejm's rejection last Friday of the presidential constitutional drafts as a no-confidence vote in these drafts. "It was the parliament that rejected the possibility of cooperation on the constitution and not myself, I was trying to cooperate," Walesa stressed. "I am not taking away the right of parliament to work on the constitution because I have respect for democracy. But I must stress that the majority of the nation is outside parliament, and that even the best constitution which may be drawn up by this parliament, should be accepted by the majority of the nation. As president I wanted to have such a majority and win such an approval," Lech Walesa said. Next, the president declared he would not discuss the constitution with the present parliament and added he was not sure whether he would discuss any other issues, either. This does not mean a "war at the top," the president stressed, adding that this reflects "lack of consent to methods and a warning: Postcommunists are returning to old methods and the president cannot accept this." Answering a question whether it was true that he intended to hold meetings all over Poland, the president recalled that he was trying to cooperate with the ruling bloc and stressed that now, when the postcommunists were feeling stronger he was going to "take them down a peg or two." "That is why I will be travelling a lot to show that Poland needs peace and agreement, but not the silence of the graveyard," Walesa said, adding that "one should watch every day so that the communists or postcommunists do not take over everything, as they are willing to do so." Walesa did not rule out that these meetings might result in a conflict with the "postcommunists of today" as he described them. "If they want such a conflict, I am ready," the president said but stressed that he was aiming at agreement and a position of a minority group for the communists as they "are a minority and must remain as such." "When they are becoming a majority, they are growing dangerous. Such is the truth we have experienced. And I am going to speak about all this during my meetings all over Poland," the president added. Asked whether during these meetings he was going to set up an organization supporting him, the president said: "If it is necessary, if the communists are growing too dangerous and there will be no force to oppose such tendencies, I will have to do it myself and complete both the vetting and decommunization at last."
