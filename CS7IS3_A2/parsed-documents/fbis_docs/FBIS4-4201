The co-sponsored symposium covered subjects including sustained agricultural growth, the development of the rural workforce, China's strategy on agro-science and technologies, Sino-Japanese agricultural trade, global grain supply and demand in the 21st century and world environment and resources. Lu Liangshu, director of the China Agriculture Society, said that the seminar was of great value for the two governments in macro policy-making, as well as in bolstering China's efforts to develop high-yield, good-quality and highly-efficient agriculture and for promoting sustained growth of Japan's agriculture. Deputy director of the society Xiang Chongyang said that agriculture is the basis for China's economic progress, social stability and national self-independence. Xiang, who is a former vice-minister in agriculture, noted that the Chinese Government has always attached great importance to agriculture and has always put agriculture in the first place of all economic work, adding that agriculture will maintain its position in the national economy in the next century. He cited that one of China's agricultural development objectives is that by the year 2000 the country will be able to produce 500 million tons of grain and 5.25 million tons of cotton, the per capita net income for farmers will reach 1,200 yuan and the food shortages in poverty-ridden rural areas can be resolved. The symposium is expected to play a very positive role in promoting Sino-Japanese agricultural cooperation and agro-produce trade, Xiang said.
