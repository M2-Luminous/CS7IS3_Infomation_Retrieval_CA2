V. Lebedev, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Cybernetics Institute; UDC 629.7.05] [Abstract] The Problem of Error Accumulation in dynamic systems because of the effect of Internal Parametric Perturbations is examined in this article. The obtained estimates of the accumulated perturbations are used for determining the frequency of attracting the sources of ``extraneous'' information about the system motion in order to reduce its sensitivity to the parameter variations. The capacities of the proposed approach are illustrated by an example of estimating the correction periodicity of an platformles inertial navigational system located on an aircraft flying along a great-circle-track. The aircraft dynamics are described and the equations of a platformlessinertial navigation system are derived. The sensitivity functions were computed by the statistical testing method. Their mathematical expectation as a function of the correction periodicity and the rms deviations from these values are provided in tables. Tables 2, references 6 Russian
