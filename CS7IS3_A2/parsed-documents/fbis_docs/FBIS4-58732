The ICO secretary general praised the efforts made by all parties to the peace process that contributed toward achieving this agreement, particularly the efforts made by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in this regard as well as the peace process cosponsors, the United States and Russia. He called on them to continue their efforts in order to achieve tangible progress on all other Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese peace tracks in a way that will guarantee a full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of international legitimacy.
