FR940419-1-00032 FR940419-1-00007 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 1837 and 1852 Revision to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Pension Portability AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to amend the regulation on pension portability under NASA contracts. Questions from NASA personnel and industry identified a need for consistency regarding the vesting period requirements, flowdown to subcontractors, and how to determine when pension portability would be appropriate. The rule proposes more consistent treatment of those issues. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Mr. Joseph Le Cren, Contract Pricing and Finance Division (Code HC), Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joseph Le Cren, (202) 358&hyph;0444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Questions were raised by both industry and within NASA regarding certain aspects of the coverage on pension portability. The majority of the questions concerned the lack of consistency of NASA's installations regarding the vesting period requirements and whether the pension portability requirements should apply to subcontracts. The purpose of this change is to address those issues. The rule also requires the use of the clause at 48 CFR 1852.237&hyph;71 rather than allowing a clause substantially the same as that one. It also adds a condition for determining when pension portability would be appropriate. Furthermore, the rule replaces the requirement that a copy of each written determination by the procurement officer to use pension portability be sent to the Associate Administrator for Procurement with one that the procurement officer only need keep a record of all such determinations. Impact NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This rule does not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1837 and 1852 Government procurement. Deidre A.
