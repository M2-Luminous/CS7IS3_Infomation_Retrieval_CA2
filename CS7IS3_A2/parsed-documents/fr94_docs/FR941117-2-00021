In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated November 3, 1994, the Governments of the United States and Malaysia agreed, among other things, to amend the current base level for Category 326 in the Fabric Group. In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to increase the current limit for Category 326. Also, Category 225 is being reduced to account for additional flexibility which was applied to Category 326 as a result of the increase.
