We now should show more optimism because everything that is ahead of us will certainly be better and nicer", President Lech Walesa said in Vilnius on Wednesday. Appearing during a joint press conference the presidents of Poland, Lech Walesa, and of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas stressed that the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has created foundations for further cooperation and it will depend on societies of the two countries how these opportunities will be utilized. "It seems that the treaty has in a way closed the past. Now we are facing the tasks of construction, of the future. Poland is prepared for this," President Walesa said. Replying to a question asked by one of the journalists concerning the consequences of Lithuania's stand claiming that Vilnius and the Vilnius region had illegally belonged to Poland in the period between the two world wars, President Brazauskas stated: "It is difficult to speak of any consequences after fifty years. All the inhabitants of that area are Lithuanian citizens and all have to respect the same laws." Walesa confirmed that he is sceptical about the "Partnership for Peace" programme and the plan is unsettled and dependent on how much will be jointly done. "Poland will encourage other countries, including Lithuania, to turn "Partnership for Peace" into joint, big and important security for whole Europe" Walesa said adding that there is no free Poland without free Lithuania. Asked to comment on the Lithuanian president-voiced proposal for a joint meeting of the Baltic states and Visegrad Group leaders, Walesa said he is ready for such a meeting. "If nations expect us to meet, then the meeting would be advisable. If this is Lithuania's wish, I will prompt it to Visegrad Group." The presidents agreed that the issues of Kaliningrad district and transit through Poland or Lithuania have to be settled. The Polish president emphasized that Poland and Lithuania will seek the transit provided that it is economic, profitable and controlled." "Geographically, from the economic and not military point of view Kaliningrad is a very good location. We have not heard that Poland or Lithuania are willing to invade Russia. From what we hear, but in a little bit silent way, Russia is not going to invade Poland or Lithuania, either. One has to turn the tanks and other hardware into ploughshares. Then transit will be profitable for all," Walesa said. Brazauskas told newsmen that Russia should not complain about transit through his country as it is conducted in compliance with international standards.
