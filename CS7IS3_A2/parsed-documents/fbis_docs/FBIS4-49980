An informed source has disclosed that if an agreement can be reached on Friday, the Sino-British Airport Authority is likely to resume its meeting on 17 May, a date proposed by the British side, to resolve the pending new airport financial arrangements. At the ongoing meeting of the expert group, Chinese and British representatives are holding discussions and hoping to reach an agreement. As the main issues have been straightened out, both sides are discussing the wording of the agreement. Since early April this year, several groups of important mainland People's Liberation Army [PLA] officials, including representatives from the General Staff Department, the Navy, and the 42d Group Army of the ground forces, have visited Hong Kong to secretly inspect British military sites and gather information first hand. In late April, the CPC Central Military Commission held a meeting to discuss stationing troops in the territory, to listen to a report by an inspecting team from Hong Kong, and to ratify the use of military sites. The British side also received hints from the Chinese side that it would be more flexible on the question of military sites to resolve the resumption of the Airport Authority talks and the fourth financial arrangements. At the current meeting, both sides have narrowed their differences mainly because the Chinese side has agreed to accept 14 major military sites for PLA use. In addition, another 25 military sites will be delivered to the special administrative region [SAR] government for development. The earnings are estimated to be HK$100 billion. Thus, the SAR Government will have tangible financial reserves. The British side has promised to repair and improve military facilities for use by the PLA. Prior to this, the Chinese side had already indicated to the British side that if the military sites issue could be smoothly resolved, the Airport Authority could set the date for a meeting. If such is the case, at a formal panel of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the end of this month both sides can finalize the decisions of the Airport Authority and the expert group concerning the new airport issue and military sites. The Chinese side wishes to resolve the military sites issue as soon as possible, mainly because of heavy pressure from the mainland military. With proper consolation provided for the mainland military, the Chinese side will be able to take care of pressure from the outside and resolve the new airport issue. Because the new airport project has entered an important stage, some franchised contracts have to be ratified. If China and Britain cannot reach an agreement on the new airport financial arrangements this will produce a major impact on the new airport project. It is learned that the Chinese side intends to discuss and resolve the financial arrangements together with the draft regulations for the new airport corporation, showing flexibility on the former for the purpose of the British side's concessions on the latter.
