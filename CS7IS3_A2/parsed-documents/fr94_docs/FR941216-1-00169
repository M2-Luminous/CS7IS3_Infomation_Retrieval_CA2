FR941216-1-00169 FR941216-1-00015 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Under section 107(d)(1)(C), EPA designated Boyd County of the Ashland-Huntington area as nonattainment by operation of law with respect to O 3 because the area was designated nonattainment immediately before November 15, 1990. The nonattainment area was expanded to include portions of Greenup County per section 107(d)(1)(A)(i) (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.318.) The area was classified as moderate. The moderate nonattainment area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O 3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), during the period from 1991 through 1993. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 12, 1993, the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted for parallel processing an O 3 maintenance plan and requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the O 3 NAAQS and EPA found the request complete. On July 21, 1994, the Commonwealth revised the maintenance plan to address public comments, and EPA comments dated December 16, 1993, and May 5, 1994. On February 7, 1994, Region 4 determined that the information received from the Cabinet constituted a complete redesignation request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify when the Cabinet first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the amended CAA, including redesignation submittals, would not be determined complete. See ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines,'' Memorandum from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X, dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for mandatory submittals. ( See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory submittals under the CAA, EPA changed its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to conform to the existing completeness criteria. Therefore, EPA believes the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception ( See 58 FR 38108 ``Approval and Promulgation of Maintenance Plan and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes for Carbon Monoxide, State of New York'' published July 15, 1993, and ``State Implementation Plans (SIP) Actions submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (CAA) Deadlines,'' Memorandum from John Calcagni to Air Program Directors, Region I-X, dated October 28, 1992). The Kentucky redesignation request for the Ashland moderate O 3 nonattainment area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the Commonwealth of Kentucky has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. 1. The Area Must Have Attained the O 3 NAAQS The Commonwealth of Kentucky's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Most recent ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar year 1991 through calendar year 1993 show an expected exceedance rate of less than 1.0 per year of the O 3 NAAQS in the nonattainment area ( See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H). The area has continued to demonstrate attainment to date. Because the nonattainment area has complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the area has met the first component of attainment of the O 3 NAAQS. The Commonwealth of Kentucky has also met the second component of attainment of the O 3 NAAQS by committing to continue monitoring the moderate nonattainment area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. 2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the CAA On January 25, 1980, August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981, November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46 FR 58080, and 48 FR 13168). The approved control strategy did not result in attainment of NAAQS for O 3 . Additionally, the amended CAA revised section 182(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the Kentucky SIP and ensures that it contains all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted its redesignation request. A. Section 110 Requirements Although section 110 was amended by the CAA, the Kentucky SIP for the moderate nonattainment area meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).
