He also said: "Objectively speaking, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura was the one who created the cabinet reshuffle problem." He indicated the cabinet reshuffle issue had nothing to do with a realignment of the political world, but was caused by Takemura's inappropriate behavior as chief cabinet secretary. Commenting on Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Secretary General Wataru Kubo's view that the future administration should be a coalition under a "trilateral structure" consisting of the "new conservative forces," "new reformist forces," and Liberal Democratic Party, Ichikawa said: "Such a setup will not be suitable under the heiritsu system [electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation]." Commenting further on a suggestion by the SDPJ and Chairman Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] that "social democracy" or "liberalism" should serve as the unifying force of the political regime, Ichikawa said: "That is a question for the distant future. We should unite and fight in the election as an extension of cooperation in reform efforts (such as Diet reform and deregulation)." He expressed his belief that the present coalition framework should develop into a new-new party. He maintained: "It is the SDPJ which should undertake self-reform first in the areas of foreign policy, defense, energy, and taxation, to make itself a proper key component of the political regime."
