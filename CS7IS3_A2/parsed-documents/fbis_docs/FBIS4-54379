This is a provocative outburst intended to create obstacles to a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and bring the situation further to a phase of crisis. Judging from the U.S. hardline conservative force's open remarks that it is dangerous to resume the talks with the DPRK, one can see clearly that they are not interested in a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue but are scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK with strength. The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula today shows that the DPRK's negotiation proposal to establish a durable peace arrangement which will replace the military armistice body in Korea is just and timely, and it urgently requires that the proposal be carried into effect at an early date. The United States must realize that to respond to the DPRK's peace initiative, instead of clinging to adventurous military action against it, is a reasonable view either in view of the interests of the United States itself or in view of the guarantee of regional peace. The United States must opt a package solution to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and normalize relations with the DPRK, true to its declaration before the world through the DPRK- U.S. joint statement.
