Djamel Benzaghou, a journalist for a number of years with the pro-government El Moudajhid and Horizons newspapers, was killed early Wednesday in the Bab El Oued district where he lived. Although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the killing, Islamic extremists have targeted journalists during their insurgency against the secular, military-backed authorities.
