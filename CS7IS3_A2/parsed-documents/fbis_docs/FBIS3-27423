The visit, on February 28, "follows a suggestion made by the President last year after learning that the prime minister's father and grandfather had lived and worked in the Pittsburgh area," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. Following a "working evening and dinner" in the Pennsylvania city, northwest of Washington, the two leaders will return to the White House, where Major will spend the night as Clinton's guest. It marks the first time Clinton has travelled outside Washington with foreign head of state and the first time he has invited a foreign leader to sleep at the White House. Major will leave for a four-day visit to Washington on February 27. He met Clinton in Washington last February shortly after Clinton took office. However, the traditional "special relationship" between the United States and Britain has become cool after Major's conservative government support Former President George Bush during 1992 presidential campaign. Last month, Clinton offended Britain by allowing the leader of the IRA's [Irish Republican Army] political wing Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, to enter America for the first time in the past 20 years. There was still differences between the two countries on Bosnia as London urged Washington to play a more active role in the peace process and contribute troops to the U.N. peacekeeping operations.
