FR941103-0-00056 FR941103-0-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [ME13&hyph;1&hyph;6645; A&hyph;1&hyph;FRL&hyph;5076&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maine; Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance in Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York Counties AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, EPA is conditionally approving a revision to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Inspection and Maintenance (I/M). This SIP revision was originally submitted to EPA for approval on November 1, 1993. This submittal was supplemented by a letter from the Commissioner of DEP dated May 26, 1994 describing additional changes Maine is making to the I/M program, and a commitment to provide additional material by July 22, 1994 and to address issues relating to the low mileage waiver by specified dates. On July 21, 1994, the State of Maine submitted a revised SIP submittal. The SIP revision includes Chapter 128 of an amended State rule entitled ``Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection Program,'' and additional supporting material including authorizing legislation, administrative items, and a description of the program being implemented. EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revision on I/M, under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, based on commitments made by Maine in its May 26, 1994 letter and reiterated in the July 21, 1994 submittal. Maine's commitments pertain to the ``low mileage'' waiver described in III.F below as well as the owner-performed repair issue described in III.J below. Section 110(k)(4) provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitments by a date certain, but no later than one year after EPA approval, EPA's conditional approval will convert to a disapproval. The content of the May 26, 1994 letter, and the July 21, 1994 revised SIP submission are described in detail in this notice. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., (LE&hyph;131), Washington, DC; and the Bureau of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, 71 Hospital Street, Augusta, ME 04333. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Judge, (617) 565&hyph;3233. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35072), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maine. The NPR proposed conditional approval or, in the alternative, disapproval of Maine's enhanced inspection and maintenance program in Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York Counties. This SIP revision was originally submitted to EPA for approval on November 1, 1993.
