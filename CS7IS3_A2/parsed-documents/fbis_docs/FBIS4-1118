Nathan-Audance Nibaruta was killed in Kamenge, an area where armed residents have engaged the army in gunbattles that continued Thursday. It was not clear how he died. Some sources said he was caught in a crossfire, while other sources within the military said he had taken the side of the armed civilians and opened fire on soldiers. The presidents of Burundi and Rwanda were killed in a plane crash on April 6. Rwanda exploded in ethnic bloodletting, but Burundi has remained largely calm despite having the same rivalry between the same two tribes. The interim Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya met with civil and military authorities to discuss how to end the violence in Kamenge. "All the rest of the country is calm," he said.
