He would not talk to the police. The chief of narcotics thinks he can be held for abuse. A Colombian drug gangster was able to be sentenced in Denmark under a false name. Yesterday, as the fingered leader of a recently detected cocaine gang, he was again brought before Copenhagen's magistrate court. Gustavo Hernando Barrero Rubiano is what he called himself when he was arrested in February 1992 in a hotel room where a pistol with live ammunition was hidden together with a stash of cocaine. This name also stands on his magistrate court sentence of three years in prison from 2 September 1992. Yesterday, when he came before the judge and was jailed for being behind the smuggling and the attempted smuggling of at least 45 kilos of cocaine, he was called Guillermo Rojas Ferro. He directed the operation from the prison in Vridslose, where he also hired a few of his couriers. BERLINGSKE TIDENDE learned that he consistently called himself "Gustavo," and both his fellow prisoners and the members of the gang know him as "Gestapo." He refuses to talk to the police about the charges in what is up to now Denmark's largest cocaine case involving smuggling into the country in bowling balls, computer monitors, and hollowed-out books and ropes. A 34-year-old Chilean-born woman was also arrested yesterday, charged with having brought messages to and from the prison while a 27-year-old man was being released. Twelve persons have now been arrested in the case, which would hardly have gotten this far if Ferro had not been able to communicate so freely in a Danish prison. Narcotics Chief Erik Bjorn has no patent solution for the problem. But about the struggle against narcotics he says: "It is time for a debate on the failed narcotics policy. We work to catch as many drug dealers and smugglers as possible. The country must make a collective preventative effort, among other things, by working in schools and clubs to prevent young people from becoming drug addicts. And then the treatment system must take over the present addicts. They must be transferred so that they will immediately get effective treatment. If this happens, then I think that with everyone's help we can stop the abuse and the extensive resulting crime."
