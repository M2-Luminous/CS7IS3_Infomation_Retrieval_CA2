The Javornik Community Council has therefore rejected the recent agreement between the Czech and Slovak interior ministers, under which the "U Sabotu" hamlet and the Javornik railway station (altogether 140 hectares of Czech territory and 37 houses) are to be ceded to the Slovak Republic. As Javornik Mayor Martin Kruzica told SME, the situation is rather tense, in his opinion. He would not yet want to characterize the situation as dramatic [vyhrocena], although verbal assaults are not a rarity. Their main target are the 20 locals who applied for Czech citizenship, thereby exposing themselves to ridicule from the Slovak side, especially in the local pub. The agreement reached by the interior ministers was based on a petition asking for the territory to be annexed to Slovakia. However, the petition was signed by only 46 of the 126 residents of the hamlet. By means of a different petition, 300 Javornik residents communicated to the Ministry of Interior and border commission the complete reverse position, however. As Martin Kruzica told us, the Community Council is now studying the possibility and effectiveness of a referendum that would involve all 860 Javornik residents. If everything goes smoothly, the referendum could be held as early as next week. "I expect the outcome to be nearly 50-50, but more than one-half could in fact opt for annexation to Slovakia," the Javornik mayor added. On the one hand, Martin Kruzica understands the problems of Slovak citizens who commute from the hamlet to Slovakia for work and school. The motives of the protests against surrendering the area to the Slovak Republic are, however, just as serious, in his opinion. Many private plots would find themselves on the territory of another state, which would complicate access for their owners. Overall, the border change would render impossible access to 45 hectares of meadows and 209 hectares of forests. A protest over a possible modification of the border has also been submitted by 150 Czech owners of land from Velka nad Velickou. According to Jiri Psurny, mayor of this community, their protest has been addressed to the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies, President Vaclav Havel, and government representatives. Other problems that must not be neglected concern timber cutting and harvesting, for which the border would have to be crossed. The question of all kinds of fees and tax conditions would also inevitably arise in this context. The Czech and Slovak interior ministers will recommend their solution to the governments, but it must be approved by the parliaments of both countries. "We have contacted deputies representing southern Moravia and would like to assert through them our present interests. The issue of small border traffic, in particular, should be resolved at long last. I am seriously worried that otherwise, the verbal clashes might evolve into something we do not want," the mayor of Javornik conceded in his interview for SME. "We have in our community written records that are 200 years old. The borders in these records are virtually identical to the present borders. There is no need to deal with the problem of the border, it is people's problems that require solutions."
