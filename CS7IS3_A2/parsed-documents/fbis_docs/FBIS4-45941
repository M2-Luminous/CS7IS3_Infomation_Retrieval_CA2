These are some of the findings of an opinion poll conducted over Tuesday and Wednesday among informed, regular readers of newspapers in New Delhi by MRAS-Burke on behalf of THE PIONEER. Asked whether in their view the USA is pro-Pakistan, pro-India or neutral, a whopping 91 per cent of the respondents declared that America is pro-Pakistan. More men than women feel strongly about this. An insignificant three per cent of the respondents said that the USA is pro-lndia and an equally small number, four per cent, said that it is neutral. More than four-fifths of the respondents, 84 per cent, said that India should go ahead and make the nuclear bomb. The number of people opposed to the bomb is just above a tenth of the respondents. Once again, a greater proportion of men (88 per cent) want the bomb, compared to women (74 per cent). The poll also shows that 85 per cent of the respondents believe that America is fuelling an arms race on the sub-continent by supplying Pakistan with the F-16 air craft. Those who differ with this view comprise a minuscule 11 per cent. As for America's attempts to force India into abandoning its missile programme, 82 per cent of the respondents said that New Delhi should stand up and oppose Washington. Less than a fifth of them felt that India should give in to American pressure. While the majority of the respondents felt that India was standing up to American pressures on nuclear and Kashmir related issues, they were not that sure about New Delhi resisting Washington's line on economic affairs. For instance, while 64 per cent of the respondents said that India was standing up to America on nuclear issues, less than 50 per cent were willing to say the same about economic affairs. In fact as many as 45 per cent of the respondents felt that India has not resisted American pressures on the economic front. The support for the Government's stand on Kashmir vis-a-vis American pressure is less than that for its stand on nuclear issues. While 58 per cent of the respondents said that New Delhi has resisted Washington's pressure tactics on Kashmir more than a third rejected this view. Interestingly. the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State. Ms Robin Raphel's comments on Kashmir are seen as the single biggest contributor towards upsetting Indo-American relations. Next on the list is the U.S.-inspired dispute over India's missile programme. followed by America's attempt to arm-twist India at the secret London talks. But despite their view that America is pro-Pakistan, that it is fuelling an arms race on the subcontinent and that India should resist all pressures and make the nuclear bomb, a vast majority or the respondents said that Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao should visit the U.S. Mr Narasimha Rao's upcoming visit was endorsed by as many as 81 per cent of the respondents, compared to 17 per cent who said that he should abandon the trip. Interestingly, more women (88 per cent) endorsed the visit than men (77 per cent). These findings are based on personal interviews with 307 men and women conducted in office complexes and residential areas, ensuring geographical spread. It was also ensured that the respondents have a monthly household income of more than Rs [rupees] 2,000 and read newspapers at least five days a week. Quotas were maintained for age, sex and income to represent all categories of people in the Capital.
