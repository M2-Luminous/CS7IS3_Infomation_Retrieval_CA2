The proposals centre on the establishment of a special committee which will have two tasks: securing a compromise agreement between the factions, and organising a Loya Jirga, or grand assembly, to elect a new president and cabinet. A four-day ceasefire, which ended Friday, followed 45 days of nonstop fighting in the capital, but this ceasefire has yet to be extended to formalise the uneasy and unofficial truce currently enjoyed in Kabul. The proposal for a Loya Jirga is a throwback to December 1992 when President Borhanoddin Rabbani was elected in a controversial assembly called the Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the legality of which was challenged by some rival factions. Whether called a Loyal Jirga or Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the idea is for a group to vote for the nation's leader. The cabinet commission proposes that the Loya Jirga be convened within the next five months, that is, by the end of Rabbani's current tenure as president. Delegates elected to the Loya Jirga are to be respected personalities, including Muslim theologians, and political and social experts. Whether former communists will be eligible to participate was not explained. Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar is allied with the ex- communist forces of Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who tried unsuccessfully to unseat Rabbani in the coup of January 1994. Hekmatyar's successful military challenge to Rabbani's 1992 election as president won him the prime ministerial nomination in March 1993. Rabbani's declaration of a holy war against Dostam may prove to be a sticking point for acceptance of the cabinet peace package if it means Dostam will be excluded. The four-day Kabul ceasefire was similarly flawed by the exclusion of Dostam's forces, giving all factions a convenient excuse to blame daily violations on the Uzbeks. Saturday night's two- to three-hour exchange of heavy artillery and light weapons' fire was an indication of the latent tension between the warring factions, regardless of their willingness to extend the expired ceasefire. Up to 20 heavy calibre shells crashed into the former diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan shortly after midday Sunday, underscoring the fragile nature of security in the Afghan capital.
