Since the beginning of this year, these departments have cracked 48 cases on illegal production and sales of gold and have confiscated 885 grams of gold, 1,500 grams of silver, 83 tonnes of gold ore, 67 tonnes of gold concentrate, and 395 gold ornaments molds. Zhaoyuan city is well known throughout the country for abounding in gold. Over the past few years, along with the increasingly more gold mining activities, such unlawful activities as illegally producing, processing, and selling gold have become relatively serious. For this reason, industrial, commercial, tax, and public security departments in Zhaoyuan city have gone into concerted actions to deal severe blows to gold dealers. They have specially established a gold instruments inspection station and also set up six inspection posts in key gold townships and towns in order to investigate and deal with cases right after they are discovered. In addition, they have established a gold production rectification group in close coordination with other departments concerned and formulated the decision on protective gold mining. For the newly initiated enterprises, their quality has been put under strict control. Those false collectives and those enterprises which were unable to mine and dress gold ore in a connected sequence have all been banned. At the same time, specific regulations have been promulgated to punish illegal gold producers. Those who violated these regulations have had their illegal materials and money confiscated and have been punished by imposing fines. From January to March this year, some 300 enterprises and individuals have been punished for illegally extracting finished gold. Now, the city's gold mining has embarked on the path of regularization, legalization, and standardization.
