ACTION: Final Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement 94&hyph;1_Chartering and Field of Membership Policy (IRPS 94&hyph;1). SUMMARY: This final interpretive ruling and policy statement (``IRPS'') is the result of NCUA's policy of reevaluating all its regulations periodically to determine whether change is warranted. The NCUA Board approved publication of a proposed IRPS on chartering and field of membership after its July 15, 1993 open meeting; the public ultimately was given 180 days to submit comments. This final IRPS 94&hyph;1 reflects a full evaluation of those comments; substantial changes as outlined below were made to the proposal. This IRPS 94&hyph;1 replaces IRPS 89&hyph;1. The NCUA is also issuing a final amendment to update Part 701.1 of its Rules and Regulations entitled ``Organization and Operations of Federal Credit Unions''. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;3428. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: H. Allen Carver, Regional Director, National Credit Union Administration, (404) 396&hyph;4042, 7000 Central Parkway, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia 30328. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background I. The Proposed IRPS On July 28, 1993, the NCUA Board published a proposed interpretive rule and policy statement (IRPS) updating chartering and field of membership policies, and also published a proposed amendment to Section 701.1 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (12 CFR 701.1), to reference the updated IRPS. The proposal was issued with a 90 day comment period that was extended by the NCUA Board for an additional 90 days due to a public request. The proposed IRPS was designed: (1) To update policies on low-income credit unions; (2) to streamline the charter application process; (3) to address credit unions undergoing corporate and military unit restructuring; (4) to clarify NCUA policy on the ``operational area'' requirement for select group expansions; and (5) to make certain other minor or technical changes to modify or clarify NCUA policy. The Board also requested specific comment on the following issues: (1) Whether NCUA should permit credit union chartering and field of membership expansions based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons, such as is now permitted for existing credit unions seeking to extend service to senior citizens; (2) Whether NCUA should permit occupational, associational, and multiple group federal credit unions to add to their fields of membership communities satisfying the ``low-income credit union'' definition found in Part 701.32 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations; (3) Whether there should be special procedures for permitting select group expansions ``in the public interest;'' and (4) Whether NCUA should establish a streamlining ``file and serve'' procedure for select group expansions of fewer than 50 potential members.
