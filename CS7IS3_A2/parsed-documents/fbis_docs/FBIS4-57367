A meeting was held behind closed doors at the Interior Ministry between representatives of the government and secondary and higher education students. Reporters had to wait outside the Ministry to learn the results of this meeting. The interior, education, and transport and communications ministers, and the Federal District governor were questioned by the secondary and higher education students regarding the violence in recent days in Caracas and the rest of the country. The first to leave the meeting was a secondary school student from the Fermin Toro secondary school who expressed his discontent. He indicated that no definite solution was found at the meeting. [Begin unidentified student recording] They defended themselves [words indistinct] that President Caldera would come out to say that it was a lie, that the [word indistinct] did not agree with that document. This is just political chicanery. [end recording] The first questions Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom had to answer concerned the remarks by the prosecutor general who justified the use of firearms by police during student demonstrations. [Begin Escovar Salom recording] They have regulation weapons and their use is regulated. Therefore, I do not know in what sense the prosecutor general expressed his opinion, but I imagine that it is legally well-grounded. [end recording] No concrete solution to the recent student problems came out of the meeting. In any case, the students reiterated that the violence will not stop until the transport and communications minister publicly states that the student fare, which is scheduled to be eliminated on 31 July, will continue to be valid.
