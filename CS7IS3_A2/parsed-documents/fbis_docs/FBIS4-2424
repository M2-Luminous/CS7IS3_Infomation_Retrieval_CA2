FBIS4-2424 "drchi069_v_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Premier: PRC Handling of Qiandao Tragedy `Inhuman' Premier: PRC Handling of Qiandao Tragedy `Inhuman' MAC Chairman Lists Questions OW0904150494 Taipei CNA in English 1419 GMT 9 Apr 94 OW0904150494 Taipei CNA English BFN [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Chairman Huang Kun-hui of the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] on Saturday blasted Beijing as "irresponsible, unresonable, and having no basic respect of human rights" or its handling of the Lake Qiandao disaster, in which the charred bodies of 24 Taiwan tourist and eight mainland crew members and guides were found aboard a tour boat. "There are so many doubts that have yet to be cleared up about the disaster," Huang said in a press briefing held at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The briefing was attended by some 150 foreign and local reporters, as well as relatives of the Taiwan victims. The deaths occurred March 31 on Lake Qiandao, or Thousand Island lake, in the coastal Province of Zhejiang. The bodies were found one piled on top of another, most of them burned beyond recognition, in the lower-deck cabin of a cruise boat. Huang listed several challenges to Beijing's claim that the deaths are accidental, and not the result of a robbery. --The cruise was first reported missing at 5 p.m. on March 31 and was found on fire at 8 a.m. the next day. How could the searchers fail for 15 hours to find the burning boat, and how could the fire last for so long? -- Why were the 32 victims found in the lower-deck cabin? Why didn't the four crew members, reported to be excellent swimmers, or any on the other victims jump off the boat to escape the fire? -- Why were only the upper parts of the bodies charred while their lower parts remained roughly intact? -- Why were only a few personal belongings of the victims found, and not all the belongings they were known to be carrying? -- Why were autopsies performed on the bodies without the prior approval of the relatives? -- Why did Beijing bar the relatives from taking pictures of the ship and reject their request to take the bodies back to Taiwan? -- Why didn't the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, which is authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan, immediately inform its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation, about the incident? Why did Beijing refuse to allow the SEF to provide humanitarian assistance to the relatives on the mainland? -- Why did Beijing bar reporters from approaching the site and from interviewing the relatives? While calling on international human rights organizations to show more concern about the incident, Huang said that Beijing's failure to clear up doubts about it would be tantamount to confessing its disregard for human life. He said that Taiwan will change its policy towards the mainland, pending the results of Beijing's investigation. Huang also noted that the fifth round of cross-strait technical talks, scheduled to be held later this month in Taipei, will be postponed until the Lake Qiandao tragedy is properly resolved.
