Maria Gabriela dos Remedios Cesar, director of the Macao Government's economic department, was quoted by local newspapers as saying that the continuity of China's MFN status was a good news for businessmen and also was favourable for steady development of Sino- U.S. trade relations. In another development, chairman of the Macao Export and Import Association Victor Ng said it was a sensible act of the U.S. Government to continue China's MFN status, for it is good for economic development of both sides. He also said that it was a good thing that the U.S. Government has ever done to separate human rights from MFN issue. However, he added, it is hard to understand that the U.S. Government use munitions as a condition for continuity of China's MFN status.
