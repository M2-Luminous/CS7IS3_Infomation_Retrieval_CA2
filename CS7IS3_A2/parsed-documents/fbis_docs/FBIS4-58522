Chains, sharp instruments, bricks, and sticks were all used as weapons. The brawl took place against the backdrop of differences that have built up over the past year and a half. The Society of Repudiation and Renunciation activists sought to settle a score with the Brotherhood members after the evening prayers at the mosque. Eyewitnesses of the melee, which began inside the mosque and then continued outside, said a member of the Society of Repudiation and Renunciation set upon a member of the Brotherhood as he performed the evening prayers. The latter carried on with his prayers, but once they were completed, a verbal clash developed and degenerated into a scuffle between the two. Members from the two sides were then drawn into the battle, with the Society of Redemption and Renunciation men employing knives, daggers, and sticks. [passage omitted] By all accounts, it was the Redemption group that triggered the fight and heightened the tension. Witnesses add that their hostile behavior was premeditated. There was widespread resentment of the way the Society of Redemption and Renunciation adherents sought to rectify the morals of the camp residents whom they accuse of being infidels for their failure to abide by the precepts of the Koran. [passage omitted] A pious, enlightened young man traced the disagreements between the two sides back a year and a half, to when the Repudiation and Renunciation Society formed in Irbid. The group's members, he said, think the Brotherhood's ideas are moderate and their attitude toward people is too soft. They want the Brotherhood to adopt a sterner attitude toward the government and society. Its adherents have more than once vilified the mufti of Irbid and a number of the city's shaykhs. The young man maintained that the group was modelled on the faction of the same name that originated in Egypt. They tend to view most people as blasphemous, contending that they do not act by the rules laid down in the Koran. A Muslim who does not abide fully by the Sunnah is, in their eyes, a blasphemer. They routinely hassle revelers at wedding parties, sometimes disrupting such functions. They are also said to be opposed to people wearing wrist watches, and necklaces, as well as trousers and various other articles of clothing. Meanwhile, security sources speaking to AL-BILAD attributed the mosque brawl to personal reasons. Witnesses, however, report that differences center on rival interpretations of prayers from the perspective of the Koran and Sunnism. The Redemption and Renunciation Society is said by other sources to be scaring children off religious lessons given by Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement. Police have apprehended an entire family suspected of membership in Hamas. Abu-'Adnan, the man who does the calls to prayers for the Hittin Mosque, told AL-BILAD he witnessed the scuffle at close range. It began as verbal abuse before it developed into a clash in which chains, knives and daggers were used. The attack, he maintains, was several days in the making because the chains had been in the mosque before the scuffle happened. Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ulaymat, the Irbid Police Commissioner, dismissed ideological differences as the cause of the violence, blaming personal differences instead. 'Ulaymat noted that during questioning, the suspects disclaimed affiliation to any Islamic group. The matter is so minor it does not merit a mention in the press, Col. 'Ulaymat asserted.
