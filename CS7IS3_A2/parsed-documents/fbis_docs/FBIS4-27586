Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was a rare opportunity to enrich Sino-Korean relations that entered a higher realm following President Kim Yong-sam's official trip to Beijing last March. Mun's six-day tour was scrutinized even more closely because it was the first high-level personnel exchange between the ruling parties of the two countries. His visit could mean that bilateral relations, which had in the past been limited somewhat to exchanges of government officials and businessmen, have developed to the point of ruling party-level exchanges. Party-to-party exchanges with the Chinese are especially significant because in China the ruling Communist Party stands above the administration in terms of real power. Naturally, Rep. Mun met key figures from the Chinese Communist Party to swap opinions on matters of mutual concern, such as promotion of bilateral ties and coping with the North Korean nuclear issue. It was through these contacts that the Chinese leadership was found to feel an acute need to resolve the nuclear question and play a positive mediatory role. "Even for our economic development, for which we exert all available efforts, a stable and peaceful international situation is needed," said Hu Jintao, a member of the powerful Communist Party Secretariat who is regarded as one of China's next-generation leaders. Hu, who in effect oversees party affairs on behalf of President Jiang Zemin, told Mun that China is trying to help settle the nuclear dispute. Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan conferred with Mun in an unscheduled meeting, confiding that his country had been advising Pyongyang to resolve the issue through dialogue and compromise. "We have already informed the United States and South Korea that North Korea, too, is interested in a peaceful resolution," Tang said. Though no conclusive assurance was obtained, the two parties seem to have reached a tentative agreement on exchanging top party leaders in the foreseeable future. "Since the two countries' relations are very good, I personally expect one of our senior leaders could visit Seoul before the end of this year," said Li Shuzheng, head of the Chinese Party's International Liaison Department. Li made the remarks in the presence of Mun while seeing him off for Xian at the Beijing Airport. He is said to have conferred with Kim Il-song during a visit to Pyongyang last February. If a high-ranking leader actually visits Seoul, it could be either President Jiang, Premier Li Peng or a Party Standing Committee member, Li said. South Korea's DLP originally hoped that a leading Chinese party official would reciprocate Mun's visit, followed by DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil's trip to Beijing toward the end of the year. But the Chinese party has been circumspect about the matter, apparently in view of its half-century of amicable relations with the Workers' (Communist) Party of North Korea. Mun's visit also showed that China attaches greater significance than Korea thought to the Seoul-Beijing summit last March. "We could confirm that with the summit as momentum, the Seoul-Beijing distance has narrowed significantly while Pyongyang's weight in Chinese foreign relations has been dwindling," said an official who accompanied Mun to Beijing.
