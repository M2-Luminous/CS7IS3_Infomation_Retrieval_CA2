The presidents of the two countries will meet in Moscow tomorrow to sign the agreement. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Correspondent Goeran Skaansberg] The Swedish Government has offered 16 million Swedish crowns to Latvia toward dismantling the Skrunda radar station and the cost of Russian pensioners moving back to Russia. Prime Minister Carl Bildt, why did Sweden make this offer right now? [Bildt] To make it easier for Latvia and to make possible an agreement that means the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from Latvia. In part, it is aid to start the dismantling of the modern part of the big radar station in Skrunda as soon as possible, and in part it is aid to the supplementary protocol on which I hope there will be agreement in Moscow tomorrow, whereby we can give some support to Russian retired officers who want to move back to Russia from Latvia. [Skaansberg] There has been [word indistinct] in this connection, many Latvians are opposed to this agreement exactly because it gives the retired Russian officers the possibility of remaining in Latvia. Do you believe this money will make it easier to get them to move back to Russia? [Bildt] I believe one should look at this agreement very much like a social question. I can understand the feelings that exist both on the Russian and the Latvian side in this matter, but this is a matter of taking into account each individual. What we want to do here is to create maybe slightly better conditions for those who would like to move--Russian officers and pensioners-- to move from Latvia to their original homeland. That will now be slightly easier and I believe this can be a benefit. [end recording] [Announcer] This was Prime Minister Carl Bildt on Swedish aid to Latvia and the reporter was Goeran Skaansberg.
