Gasparyan; place and date not given: "Vladimir Resin: `Moscow Reflects Both the Magnificence and the Misery of Present-Day Russia'"] [Text] [Gasparyan] Vladimir Iosifovich, I would put my first question this way. Just what is the image of Moscow? How do you personally imagine it? [Resin] I think that very many things go into this concept. Beginning with the architecture of the historical part of the capital and ending with the lifestyle of the ordinary microrayon. Everything that surrounds us goes into the concept of the "city's image." And, of course, the quality of the functioning of the whole city's environment. I will begin with the fact that Moscow is the capital of an enormous, wealthy, and mighty state. But the paradox is that under normal conditions there cannot be a rich state with a people whose standard of living, to put it mildly, is not the very highest. But, you see, this has happened here. We are a mighty state! And Moscow is the capital of this state, its face, which reflects the magnificence and the misery of the whole country. You and I have such creations as the Kremlin and the Bolshoi Theater...and here right alongside we have 20 million square meters of 5-storied buildings. But if these 5-storied buildings are pulled down and modern buildings are built to replace them--this will be far more expensive than the construction itself. The question arises: What kind of a fool built them? No, not a fool. This was a correct resolution of the housing problem at that time. We brought people out of basements and semi-basements. [Gasparyan] How is the situation to be corrected now? [Resin] There is a program that is directed at this. We built 9 million square meters of housing in three years. Moreover, not the same kind as before, but with the entire social and engineering infrastructure. Can you imagine for yourself that now in Butovo, for example, not all of the built kindergartens are full? There are schools in Mitino that are not yet filled with pupils. Do you recall how children were bused to neighboring schools? This happened. This no longer exists. [Gasparyan] But housing, nevertheless, is the main thing. Today, not just long lines remain. The situation has changed. A person stood in line for an apartment under socialism, but today he has ended up in others, under market and capitalistic conditions... [Resin] I understood your question. Indeed, today we live according to the principle of a bit from socialism, and a bit from capitalism. At the same time, many want to work as if under socialism, but to live as under capitalism. And what does this lead to? All of us want to have a good apartment and to receive it free of charge. Without giving anything to society. But, nevertheless, the Moscow government did not abolish the lines, because there would be social injustice. We retained them, while in Kazakhstan and Ukraine housing lines have been abolished. Last year, we provided housing for people in the 1981 waiting line for housing. This year we want to take care of people in the 1982 waiting line. But the line became stratified, like society itself. People appeared who can buy an apartment, and they are buying it. A housing market has emerged in our country. We gave, are giving, and will continue to give to those who cannot buy. To put it briefly, we do not want to discard that which was good under socialism. And let us look truth straight in the eyes. We are all people of that time. Maybe our children and grandchildren, as they say, will absolutely be market people. I cannot pass by when I see that a person is in need. Even if he is pretending. But next to me is a stranger who does not even look in the direction of a beggar, because he is brought up on different principles. [Gasparyan] Nevertheless, it seems to me that the image of Moscow has started to disappear and become obliterated. Today, the capital is not what it was before. [Resin] Of course, during the years of Soviet authority Moscow lost a big part of its individuality, you are right on this. But we have been doing a lot in the last three to four years to return the former features of the capital. Have you noticed that the center is being repaired and restored? The Tretyakovskaya Gallery will be opened this year. The Malyy Theater has been put in shape. The Metropole... We will open the National this year. But take a look at how carefully every building is being treated that is being reconstructed. [Gasparyan] Incidentally, many are saying that the appearance of Moscow is also getting worse, because many Western companies are making everything in their own fashion. Is this being monitored somehow? [Resin] Nothing is done in Moscow without the permission of the city planning council and the chief architect of the city. The concept is based on an approved city plan foe Moscow reconstruction. And none of the foreigners are permitted to build if it does not coincide with the general plan of reconstruction of the capital. [Gasparyan] Nonetheless, many think that Moscow is basically being sold to foreigners. [Resin] First, this is not true. Second, have Americans become impoverished because a big part of the buildings in Manhattan has been sold to entrepreneurs of various countries? But we have not sold anything. Indeed, individual stores and buildings have been leased by Western firms or by joint enterprises. Foreigners have started to pay taxes and have put these premises in order, so that nothing damaging to Moscow has occurred. But a market is a market. So, we will also have to trade. But stability--both political and economic is needed so that someone would buy something from us. You and I cannot brag about this at the present time. [Gasparyan] As the manager of the building department, are you satisfied with the results of the work? [Resin] The one who is satisfied with himself is a person who is lost to the economy. But in some things, yes. In the past year we put into operation the Moscow City Palace of Justice, the Moscow Art School under the Institute imeni Surikov, maternity hospitals, a bridge crossing for the Moscow Zoo, such unique structures as the Palace Hotel on Tverskaya Street, the theater on Pokrovka, the exposition of private collections of the Museum of Fine Arts imeni Pushkin, and the VTU [Higher Technical School] imeni Shchukin on Vakhtanov Street. A number of facilities of a cultural nature have been restored--the Cathedral of the Icon of the Mother of God of Kazan, the Temple of Saints Faith, Hope, and Love and Their Mother Sofia, and the mosque on Zemlyachka Street. However, despite the efforts being undertaken, it is still difficult to call the situation with the reconstruction of the center of the city satisfactory. Questions of engineering support are being resolved with difficulty. Dates have been postponed for the withdrawal of production enterprises and lessees, the resettlement of tenants, and the formulation of contractual relations of the prefectures of the Central Administrative District with investors. Up to the present time, 26 parcels under the new housing construction program of work of the past year have not been released. Also being unsatisfactorily implemented is the release of structures included in the reconstruction program from residents and lease holders. A number of investors are not fulfilling their contractual obligations. There continue to be cases of long delays in assimilating released land parcels by involved organizations. A significant volume of work arose at the end of last year in connection with the tragic events of 3-4 October 1993, which entailed partial destruction of the White House buildings, the mayor's office, the Ostankino television center, and Hotel Mir. During two months, 110,000 square meters were restored, and the stylobate part of the White House was put into operation. Work was started in the buildings of the Moscow's mayor's office and Hotel Mir, and repair-restoration work was accomplished in the Ostankino television center. Last year, the practical implementation of the program of low-story and cottage construction was started in the Ramenskoye, Dmitrovskiy, Domodedogo, and Solnechnogorsk Rayons. Cottages of a total area of about 60,000 square meters were built and put into operation during 1993. [Gasparyan] Of the transportation problems, obviously the metro is closer to you, since this is associated with construction... [Resin] Indeed, it was and will continue to be necessary for me to build the metro. And I must say that to build the metro as we did up to the war, or in the first years of the war, is simply impossible from the standpoint of costs. Why should we establish a museum under ground? What does this give us other than making travel on the metro more expensive? Therefore, they have now started to build good quality--as was built before--but at the same time also without any extravagances. The metro in Moscow remains the most reliable, profitable, and quickest form of transportation. Therefore, despite all of the difficulties, we are continuing to build it, extending branches into all new microrayons. We will now introduce new housing complexes in Lyublin, and we are immediately providing for the metro as well. Of course, the outward appearance of surface transportation also reflects on the image of Moscow. Our trolley buses and streetcars, of course, have become worn out. As a result of the breakup of the Union, the renewal of the fleet is moving along much more poorly. We are now compelled to organize the production of buses at the ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant). Now about roads. The volume of repair work increased sharply in recent years. The asphalt has become better and, accordingly, the roads have become better. But, in general, the transportation problem in Moscow has not been resolved yet. I think that we made a serious mistake in yielding to the pressure of "public opinion," which in the 1980's prohibited the building of a third beltway. And, after all, large sums of money were spent. We have now once again undertaken to build a third beltway and, I think, the situation will improve with the completion of its construction. [Gasparyan] There are still other facilities from which the appearance of the city is formed. These are the railroad stations... [Resin] I agree. Let us first look at the outward appearance of Moscow's railroad stations. The Kiev railroad station has already been put into shape, it was renovated, and it is an excellent structure. The Paveletskiy is on the whole an adornment of Moscow, and it also was put into shape. The Kursk railroad station has been rebuilt, and it is one of the best buildings in Moscow, both from the standpoint of architecture and city planning. Work is being done on the Kazan railroad station. The Leningrad railroad station has been recovered and put into order. As, moreover, has the Savelovskiy. Therefore, if we are talking about the material status of the railroad stations, they are all in good condition. The situation at the railroad stations is another matter. But this does not depend on the architecture. Everyone has to work on this. Both the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Well, and of course, we are not being idle--we are taking all measures to bring order there. The successes are not significant, but, nevertheless, a drop in the increase in crime at the railroads has been noted. But it must be admitted that Moscow has turned out to be an unprotected city. However, in bringing order, we cannot sacrifice basic human rights. It would be easiest of all to close Moscow, to adopt harsh measures, etc. Muscovites would be satisfied. But we cannot do this. There is always more order under a totalitarian regime than under a democracy. But since we have already chosen the path of democracy, then it is necessary to understand what the costs will be here. We are paying a lot of attention now to reinforcing the Moscow militia. Not in words, but in deeds. The mayor is personally looking into these questions. Large resources have been allocated to raise the prestige of workers in the militia and to improve its physical facilities. Last year, 25 modern, new local militia stations were built. Instead of the two or three that were built previously each year. And no fewer will be built this year. These are militia stations with garages, with shooting ranges, and with recreation rooms. Briefly, everything that is necessary today for such a station. Moreover, we built everything using the most beautiful decorative materials. The leadership of the militia has also been strengthened. Lieutenant General Vladimir Iosifovich Pankrat is a highly professional manager, a person who knows his business. [Gasparyan] Concern for the militia is extremely important. But what about the social protection of the poor? [Resin] Of course, as the manager of the department, I should think about the builders first of all. The housing question continues to be the most acute for the builders themselves as well. Last year, it was proposed to improve the housing conditions of more than 4,000 builders' families, with an allocation for this on the order of 200,000 square meters. By the beginning of the year, 60 percent of what was planned was taken care of. At the present time, orders for the remaining volume of housing area are being formulated. The problem of social protection for the poor workers of the branch is also not alien to us. Ten charitable actions in the sum of about a billion rubles [R] have been conducted for veterans, participants in the Great Patriotic War, and for large worker families. Incidentally, the construction complex was the only branch in the city economy of Moscow that maintained children's health improvement camps. Thirteen such camps, in which 10,000 children rested, were opened in the summer period. [Gasparyan] And what can you say about places of leisure for Muscovites? In my opinion, there are fewer areas like this now... [Resin] We are building them. Victory Park on Poklonnaya Hill, for example. Last year, we put the initial complex of a building park into operation, and just before 9 May the opening of the first line of this memorial was held. Construction has started on a Disneyland kind of children's park in Mnevniki. I think that we will build it in the course of 10 years. Moreover, Russia does not yet have this kind of a park. Meanwhile, Gorkiy Park is operating, and it is not in bad condition. But, then, the VDNKh [Exhibit of Achievements in the National Economy] has really been transformed into something that is not comprehensible. [Gasparyan] The mutual relations of Moscow and Moscow Oblast. There are also a lot of disputes about this. Some are for unification, and others, for separation. What is your viewpoint on this problem? [Resin] Personally, I think that Moscow and the oblast are, of course, a single region, and they cannot develop without each other. And for all practical purposes, we are developing together. This separation has been artificial, according to the party-communist principle. There were obkoms [oblast party committees] and gorkoms [city party committees]. But at the present time, the basis for unification has been lost. Many residents of Moscow Oblast are not in the mood for this. It seems to them that Muscovites will make life in the Moscow suburbs worse. As long as our friends from Moscow Oblast do not change their views, it is impossible to talk about any kind of unification. [Gasparyan] Do you, Vladimir Iosifovich, believe in the reorganization of Moscow into a true capital of Russia with its own inimitable image? [Resin] Moscow today is already the most beautiful city in the world. And we do not plan to change it architecturally. We will adhere to that concept that evolved back in the 19th Century. We will restore what was destroyed and what has become dilapidated. But in no case will we destroy that appearance of the city that was left to us by our fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers. This is unequivocal. For example, we will very likely lower the building of the Intourist Hotel on Tverskaya Street, and it will correspond to the style of Tverskaya Street. I call on Muscovites to come to the city planning exhibit, which was visited by the Russian president, to look it over, and to express your opinion. We will try to take all interesting opinions and proposals into account. After all, Moscow is our common home.
