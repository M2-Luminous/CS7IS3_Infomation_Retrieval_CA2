The conference summed up the province's anticorruption work over the past year and made anticorruption work arrangements for this year. Chen Shineng, provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial governor, presided over the conference. Xia Guohua, provincial party committee standing committee member and discipline inspection commission secretary, relayed General Secretary Jiang emin's address to the recently concluded Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee. Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a speech in which he put forth the following four requirements on the ongoing anticorruption struggle across the province: 1. To correctly view the ongoing anticorruption struggle across the province. Secretary Liu Fangren stated: Guizhou has scored marked results in fighting corruption over the past year. Nevertheless, the province's anticorruption struggle has been plagued by unbalanced growth, unsustained progress, and some other problems. We should know that corrupt phenomena have now multiplied to a serious extent, posing a real threat to Guizhou. Therefore, we should be fully aware of the arduousness and protractedness of the ongoing anticorruption struggle. 2. The main tasks of and principles for the province's anticorruption struggle in 1994. Secretary Liu Fangren noted: This year, Guizhou's anticorruption struggle should be continually focused on party and government leaders at and above the county or provincial department section level. To this end, we should see to it that all party and government cadres at and above county or provincial department section level remain honest in performing official duties and abide by the party and government disciplines. We should work hard and strive for more progress in this regard. Moreover, we should make redoubled efforts to investigate and handle all major and serious cases, strictly enforce party discipline and state laws, straighten out departmental or professional malpractices in real earnest, and strive to make the province's anticorruption struggle submit to and serve the CPC's overall interests. 3. The party committees and governments at all levels across the province should strengthen leadership over the ongoing anticorruption struggle. 4. To forge and maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the broad masses of people and strengthen the effectiveness of the anticorruption struggle. Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: The mass viewpoint and mass line have remained the CPC's cherished traditions, they are the basis upon which the party and government can survive, and are the source of force with which we can overcome all sorts of hardships and difficulties. Improving party style and building a clean government are, in a nutshell, aimed at maintaining long-term flesh-and-blood ties between the party and government on the one hand and the broad masses of people on the other. We should always bear this point in mind. The conference was attended by provincial leaders, including Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui, Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, and Huang Yao; retired veteran leaders at and above deputy provincial level; leading cadres at the deputy provincial department director level; provincial discipline inspection commission members; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, city, and county discipline inspection commissions secretaries; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, city, and county supervision bureaus chiefs; as well as discipline inspection groups leaders and supervision offices directors from various provincial departments.
