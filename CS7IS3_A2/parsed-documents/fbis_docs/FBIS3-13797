['Arafat] There is no doubt that this resolution is very important: It reflects the international consensus on this horrible crime. At the same time it is a major step because it makes provision for international protection for our people by a "temporary international presence." In addition, the responsibility of the two sponsors of the peace process -- the United States and Russia -- is stipulated with regard to the implementation of the resolution. Furthermore, we intend to have discussions with the sponsors, the Europeans and others, on how to implement it on the ground. The sooner the better! Having said that, the explanations given by the United States with regard to their relative abstention from two paragraphs of the resolution on the occupied Palestinian territories and on Jerusalem have been received negatively by the Palestinians, the Arabs, the Muslims, and the Christians. Especially in view of the fact that a memorandum on policy in the Near East sent by the U.S. administration to Congress on 1 February specified, and I quote: "Israeli-occupied lands known as occupied territories: the West Bank, the Gaza strip, Golan, and...East Jerusalem." Moreover that was the practical position of all U.S. administrations. [Loos] Will you wait for the resolution to be implemented on the ground before returning to the negotiating table with the Israelis? ['Arafat] I have not ended the negotiations with them. I had a very important telephone conversation with Prime Minister Rabin on Friday, and before that with Foreign Minister Peres. This Sunday afternoon Israeli special envoys will have discussions with us. One of the subjects will be the implementation of this resolution. I cannot yet say what specific problems we will encounter. [Loos] What do you expect on the highly sensitive questions of the settlers in downtown Hebron? ['Arafat] There are 43 families and 160 students. They can be moved. [Loos] Do you think that that is included in the resolution? ['Arafat] It is mentioned when the resolution calls for "the occupying power to continue to adopt and implement measures, including the confiscation of arms, to prevent illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers." [Loos] The removal of the settlers is not specifically mentioned... ['Arafat] Even Rabin has said that installing those settlers in Hebron was "a stupid plan" and he was opposed to it when he was prime minister in the seventies. Nine ministers in his cabinet support their removal. Where to? They can be installed in Qiryat Arba', the colony situated just outside Hebron. We must prevent an explosion. [Loos] What do you expect from the Europeans in the short term? ['Arafat] I am in constant contact with them at several levels, even in the context of the implementation of the resolution which has all the more support from them because three of the text's authors are European -- Spain, France, and Britain. [Loos] Do they think that the international presence should be an armed presence? ['Arafat] The form of the international presence still has to be negotiated with the Israelis and the two sponsors of the peace process. But we stress: Who can imagine unarmed forces sent to highly tense places being effective in protecting the Palestinian population and the holy places? We are not asking for tanks and helicopters, just for light weapons. [Loos] Should Hebron be the main target of this force? ['Arafat] We hope so! It is these populations which have most need of security and peace. Do not forget that part of the Israeli Army was involved in the Hebron events. Some of their soldiers fired outside the mosque, according to the Israeli investigation. And, over the past 22 days, another massacre has taken place: 41 dead, 470 injured, 1,500 arrested... [Loos] Do you still think that the Israelis will honor the 13 April deadline (stipulated in the Declaration of Principle signed in Washington) for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? ['Arafat] If the will is there, it is there! When they withdrew from Gaza in 1956, it took them six hours. And their own experts now assess the necessary time to be six days. Moreover, our security forces are ready to replace them. It will be a crucial test of their goodwill. When Rabin says there "are no sacrosanct dates," I must contradict: There are sacrosanct dates otherwise there is no longer a sacrosanct agreement! [Loos] What do you say to the Palestinians who think that the main mistake was not to deal with the fate of the Jewish settlements in the Washington agreement? ['Arafat] It was not a mistake. We know that it is a very important problem. Any agreement is a compromise, but it takes goodwill on both sides. That is why we say: Let us discuss it as soon as possible, let us not necessarily wait for the start of the third year of the process started in Washington. Nobody seriously thinks that the Jewish settlers will leave the occupied territories in a week or a month. We must therefore start to discuss this question without delay. [Loos] Do you have any indication of the Israeli intentions in this connection? ['Arafat] If they want to implement the (Washington) agreement with accuracy and honesty, they must put this question on the agenda. I cannot say any more at this stage. [Loos] Many Palestinians thought that the agreement which you signed on 11 February in Cairo with Mr. Peres on the security issue is a complete Israeli victory to the extent that you have made all the concessions unilaterally... ['Arafat] This idea was put about after Peres, defending the agreement signed in Cairo in the Knesset, said that it represented a "great victory." I do not know what victory he was talking about. Unless he was referring to the fact that the deadlock had finally been broken in the negotiations. The victory was therefore on both sides and also on the side of peace. But, after the Hebron massacre, the whole peace process lost its credibility. [Loos] What is your reaction when Palestinian crowds deride you? ['Arafat] That is not true. They are deriding the peace process which has not produced any practical results in seven months! And they have no confidence in the Israeli authorities' ability to implement the Washington Declaration of Principles.
