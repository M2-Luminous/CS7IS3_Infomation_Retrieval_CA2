Secession is impossible, he said. In statements following his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majd today, Basindwah said that as a condition for ending the fighting between Sanaa and Aden, legitimacy and the Constitution must be the standards. He stressed that all Yemenis defend unity and reject separation. On 'Ali Salim al-Bid's request that south Yemen's Arab League membership be restored, Basindwah said the Arab League secretary general stressed to him that the request has no standing. The Yemeni foreign minister denied that Iraqi or Sudanese forces are fighting alongside the Yemeni forces in the north. He said the southern allegations in this respect are false. Sanaa does not need fighters; it is Aden that needs additional forces, he said. Basindwah said he informed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid of the latest developments in Yemen. He said events in Yemen prove that the "secessionists" cannot establish "their alleged state". He said the head of the alleged state has fled to Hadhramaut, and will flee abroad from there. He accused the southerners of providing shelter to world terrorist leaders, notably Marcos [name as received] and Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]. Asked what Sanaa's position will be if the UN Security Council passes a resolution on the Yemeni crisis, Basindwah said: We oppose any interference in the crisis by the Security Council because this is an internal affair. If the Security Council issues a resolution, he said, then we will react according to the situation.
