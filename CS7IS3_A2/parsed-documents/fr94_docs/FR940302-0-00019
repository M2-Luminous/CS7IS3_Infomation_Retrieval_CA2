FR940302-0-00019 FR940302-0-00007 The PBGC's regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability (29 CFR part 2647; see also 29 CFR 2640.6) provides rules requiring pension plans to reduce or waive complete withdrawal liability under ERISA section 4207(a). However, the regulation has not heretofore provided a procedure for pension plans to adopt alternative rules for reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under ERISA section 4207(b). When the PBGC originally proposed the regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, the PBGC was not prepared to propose rules under section 4207(b). The PBGC believed at that time, however, that ``it is important to provide the relief contemplated under section 4207(a).'' (49 FR 8036.) Consequently, the PBGC decided to propose and issue rules under section 4207(a) at that time and to promulgate rules under section 4207(b) at a later date. On October 23, 1992, the PBGC published (at 57 FR 48348) a proposed amendment to the regulation on Reduction or Waiver Of Complete Withdrawal Liability. The provisions of the proposed amendment included a procedure for pension plans to adopt alternative rules for reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, requirements for a plan sponsor to submit a written request for PBGC approval of a plan amendment adopting rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, a description of the information to be submitted to the PBGC for its review of the request, the standards for PBGC approval of the request, a safe harbor period of at least fifteen days from the date of resuming covered operations for an employer resuming covered operations to file its application for abatement of complete withdrawal liability, and an editorial change to expand the purpose of part 2647 to cover both section 4207(a) and section 4207(b) of ERISA. All of these provisions were discussed in the preamble to the proposed amendment. No written comments were received on the proposal, and the PBGC is adopting the amendment as proposed. Compliance With Rulemaking Guidelines The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PBGC certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pension plans with fewer than 100 participants have traditionally been treated as small plans. This rule affects only multiemployer plans covered by the PBGC. Defining ``small plans'' as those with under 100 participants, they represent less than 6 percent of all multiemployer plans covered by the PBGC (118 out of 2000). Approximately 500,000 employers contribute to multiemployer plans, most of them small employers (under 100 employees). The PBGC estimates that fewer than 10,000 (2 percent) of these employers are required to pay complete withdrawal liability in any year, and an even smaller percentage subsequently resume their participation under a plan and thereby become subject to these rules. Therefore, the PBGC waives compliance with sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information requirements contained in this rule (viz., in §2647.9) have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 under control number 1212&hyph;0044. The PBGC estimates that not more than ten plans per year will make submissions under §2647.9 and that each submission will take one-quarter hour to prepare and submit. The total estimated annual burden resulting from this collection of information is thus not more than two and one-half hours. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation at the address set forth above and to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Desk Officer for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Washington, DC 20503.
