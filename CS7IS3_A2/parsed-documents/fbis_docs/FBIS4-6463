In a letter titled "Let Us Effect a New Leap in the Movement of Youth and Students" Hanminjon said for the present the South Korean youth and students must draw the masses into the movement "To Defend Our Rice," activate the struggle for a stop to the introduction of Patriot missiles and against the pressure on the North over nuclear inspection and against nuclear war exercises and expand this struggle to a struggle for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons and U.S. troops. "The youth and students must attach primary importance to the struggle for the abolition of the `National Security Law' and disbandment of repressive tools and, at the same time, staunchly wage the anti-fascist, anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle to frustrate parliamentary approval of the enforcement schedule of the Uruguay Round accord," said the letter.
