In an interview with Amy Rhodes, Shahal said the move can be implemented immediately, and he hopes it will promote understanding between Israelis and the Palestinians. [Begin recording] [Shahal] This was needed to give a feeling of security to the Palestinians living in Hebron after what happened on 25 February. The major issue, and the most important one is to have progress in the peace process. [Rhodes] According to the compromise, there will be some 100 Palestinian policemen in Hebron. How will it work? [Shahal] Well, first of all, the Palestinian police who are members of this police force....[pauses] It's going to be a municipality police force. They are going to be responsible for the institutions of the Palestinians in Hebron, they are going to be responsible for the Palestinian inhabitants. They will have joint patrols together with Israeli security forces, including Israel Police officers. They will be entitled to have light arms -- the same that the Israel Police forces have, and those arms are going to be for self-defense of the police officers, and only when they are on duty. So, I think that it is very clearly defined what are the limitations, what is the jurisdiction. I hope it will promote understanding between the Israeli security forces and the future Palestinian police force. [Rhodes] How soon until something like this can be implemented? [Shahal] Immediately.
