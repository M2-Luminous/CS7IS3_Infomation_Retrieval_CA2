A. Moldovyan, N. A. Moldovyan; UDC 681.3] [Abstract] A two-stage cryptographic transformation system with probabilistic selection of pseudo-randomly-long key sequences from several initial secret keys is described. This system exhibits a resitance to cryptoanalysis, based on the known initial text and the corresponding cipher, which is sufficient for any practical applications. The first stage consists of preliminary preparations when the specific transformation mechanism is rearranged, depending on the user selected password, and the second stage is the actual coding. A programmable three- key cryptomodule was developed, with a 2M bit/s coding rate and 16 MHz clock frequency for applications with IBM PC/AT type computers. With this module, it was possible to convert any initial text into a pseudo-random train of characters with code representation by binary numbers from 0 to 255. The frequency distribution of characters in the code was nearly uniform, and the rms deviation was from 1 to 10% for different texts. This implies that statistical methods of cryptoanalysis for deciphering such codes are not effective. It is pointed out that in systems with a special type of addressing to the on-line memory this method can provide much greater coding rates. Figure 1, references: 2 Russian
