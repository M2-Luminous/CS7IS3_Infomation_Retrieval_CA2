After a general review of additional proposals, the commission completed work on changes and additions to the draft of the Constitution based on proposals from the working group which had reviewed and studied international experience in this area. As a result of the work accomplished, there has been considerable improvement in the document with regard to international law, the provisions on basic rights of citizens and the definition of the principle of separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers. The flexible principle of state administration which has been developed will allow the state to avoid possible internal political crises and to eliminate anarchy in the republic as a whole as well as in its individual rayons. The formulations and definitions of many of the articles have also been revised. The revised and amended draft Constitution will be published in the press.
