Mr. Demaci writes that the Serbian and Montenegrins think that in this way they can gain the favour of being the stronger side in any negotiations mediated by the international factor. "During the period of February-March 19, 1994, 2,500 Albanians have been cruelly mistreated in their homes, in front of their families and in public places, 47 Albanians have been sentenced with one to 10 years imprisonments by staged judicial processes, 41 Albanian families have been expelled from their homes and 2 innocent Albanians have been killed by the Serbian police and army", Mr. Demaci points out. The council give evidence of the tortures exercised on 13,400 Albanians, the rise of the number of Albanians forcibly recruited in the Serbian Montenegrin Army as well the open threat to the Albanians emigrants not to return to Kosova. Mr. Demaci also protests in the name of the council against the Serbian attack on the Albanian culture, such as the violent closing of the Academy of Arts and Sciences and Arts in Kosova and occupation of the Albanology Institute in Pristina.
