It is one of our country's international land border gates. Attending the grand opening ceremony were leading officials from the Vietnamese provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Quang Nam-Da Nang, and Savannakhet Province in Laos. Also on hand was the acting Lao consul general in Da Nang. The upgrade of the Lao Bao-Ban Den Savan border gate to an international border gate comes in response to the aspirations of the two peoples, especially the residents of Quang Tri and Savannkhet Provinces. This move will create many favorable conditions for communication along Highway 9. The new international border gate will also play an important role in promoting economic development based on the advantages of Highway 9.
