Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Issuance of Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, has issued a Director's Decision concerning a Petition dated October 23,1992, filed by Thomas J. Saporito, Jr., under ยง2.206 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 2.206). The petition contained statements and allegations regarding the main steam and pressurizer safety valves and other matters regarding the operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (Palo Verde). The Petition requested that the three Palo Verde units be immediately shut down until such time as a safety evaluation can be performed on the safety valves at Palo Verde. The Petition also requested that the NRC initiate a proceeding to show cause why the operating licenses for the Palo Verde units should not be modified, suspended, or revoked. In a supplement to the Petition dated January 4, 1993, Petitioner also requested that the NRC take appropriate enforcement action against Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee) and deny the license amendment application dated November 13, 1990, regarding revised setpoint tolerances for the main steam and pressurizer safety valves. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation has determined that the requests should be denied for the reasons stated in the ``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;04), which is available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. A copy of the decision has been filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance with 10 CFR 2.206(c). As provided therein, this decision will become the final action of the Commission 25 days after issuance unless the Commission, on its own motion, institutes review of the decision within that time. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 16th day of May 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
