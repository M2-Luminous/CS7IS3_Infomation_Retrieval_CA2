FR940627-0-00205 FR940627-0-00019 (1) Fuel Families. Each of the following six fuel families (Table F94&hyph;7, columns A&hyph;F) includes fuels of the type referenced in the name of the family as well as bulk and aftermarket additives which are intended for use in those fuels. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to §79.51(h)(1). One or more base fuel formulations are specified for each fuel family pursuant to §79.55. (i) The Gasoline Family includes fuels composed of more than 50 percent gasoline by volume and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is specified in §79.55(b). (ii) The Diesel Family includes fuels composed of more than 50 percent diesel fuel by volume and their associated fuel additives. The Diesel fuel family includes both Diesel # 1 and Diesel # 2 formulations. The base fuel for this family is specified in §79.55(c). (iii) The Methanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent methanol by volume and their associated fuel additives. The M100 and M85 base fuels are specified in §79.55(d). (iv) The Ethanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent ethanol by volume and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is E85 as specified in §79.55(e). (v) The Methane Family includes compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuels containing at least 50 mole percent methane and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for the family is a CNG formulation specified in §79.55(f). (vi) The Propane Family includes propane fuels containing at least 50 percent propane by volume and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as specified in §79.55(g). (vii) A manufacturer seeking registration for formulation(s) which do not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of the fuel families described in this section shall contact EPA at the address in §79.59(a)(1) for further guidance in classifying and testing such formulation(s). (2) Fuel/Additive Categories. Fuel/additive categories (Table F94&hyph;7, rows 1&hyph;3) are subdivisions of fuel families which represent the degree to which fuels and fuel additives in the family resemble the base fuel(s) designated for the family. Three general category types are defined in this section. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to §79.51(h)(1). (i) Baseline categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family and conform to specified limitations on the amounts of certain components or characteristics applicable to that fuel family. (ii) Non-Baseline Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family, but which exceed one or more of the limitations for certain specified components or characteristics applicable to baseline formulations in that fuel family. (iii) Atypical Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain elements or classes of compounds other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family or which otherwise do not meet the criteria for either baseline or non-baseline formulations in that fuel family. A fuel or fuel additive product having both non-baseline and atypical characteristics pursuant to §79.56(e)(3), shall be considered to be an atypical product. (3) This section defines the specific categories applicable to each fuel family. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to §79.51(h)(1). (i) Gasoline Categories. (A) The Baseline Gasoline category contains gasoline fuels and associated additives which satisfy all of the following criteria: ( 1 ) Contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. ( 2 ) Contain less than 1.5 percent oxygen by weight. ( 3 ) Sulfur concentration is limited to 1000 ppm per the specifications cited in the following paragraph. ( 4 ) Possess the physical and chemical characteristics of unleaded gasoline as specified by ASTM standard D 4814&hyph;93a (incorporated by reference, pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section), in at least one Seasonal and Geographical Volatility Class. ( 5 ) Derived from conventional petroleum sources only. (B) The Non-Baseline Gasoline category is comprised of gasoline fuels and associated additives which conform to the specifications in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section for the Baseline Gasoline category except that they contain 1.5 percent or more oxygen by weight and/or may be derived from synthetic crudes, such as those prepared from coal, shale and tar sands, heavy oil deposits, and other non-conventional petroleum sources.
