Speaking during a seminar on child prostitution, Wu said child prostitution not only harms social morals but also infringes on people's human rights. Wu said the Interior Ministry has recently completed a child prostitution prevention plan which seeks to pool the efforts of all sectors of society to crack down on the crime. Under the plan, Wu said, the ministry will offer cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pimps who control and live off the money earned by child prostitutes. Chen Hui-chi, an executive at the Taipei's Women's Rescue Foundation, said besides imposing severe penalties on those who frequent child prostitutes, the names of the "Johns" should be publicized to help stamp out the crime. Shen Mei-chen, a lawyer familiar with child prostitution offenses, said that the government will have to revise its laws if it intends to eliminate the "shame of society." Shen said current laws make it difficult for police to deal with men who seek the services of child prostitutes. The laws say that the men can only be prosecuted for the offense if a complaint is filed. Shen called for revisions to anti-prostitution laws which would make seeking a child prostitute a criminal offense. It was estimated last year that more than 10,000 children or teenagers were involved in the sex industry. Of them, only some 2,000 have been arrested by the police.
