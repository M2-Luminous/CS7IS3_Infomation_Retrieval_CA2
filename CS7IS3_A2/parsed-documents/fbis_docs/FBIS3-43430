Major Safari, in charge of security in Bujumbura, gives us the details. He is interviewed by our colleague, (Gregoire Nijimbere). [Begin recording] [Safari] We do not yet know why barricades were set up in Bujumbra. At around 0300 our security forces discovered that barricades had been erected on the following axes: National Road No. 1, Boulevard 28 November, in Nyakabiga and on University Avenue. Security forces have already removed these barricades. [(Nijimbere)] Do we know who did this? [Safari] We still do not know who erected the barricades. But we believe that it was done because of rumors which were circulating last night. But we have not yet proved it. [sentence as heard] A rumor has been circulating which says that Bujumbra would become a ghost town, and that some elements -- not yet identified -- would stop civil servants from going to work. [(Nijimbere)] So, currently everything is back to normal? [Safari] We have removed all the barricades and we invite the population of Bujumbura to carry out their usual duties. [end recording]
