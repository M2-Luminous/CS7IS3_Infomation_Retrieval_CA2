Questions about how the Abkhaz leader evaluates the decree adopted a few days ago by the Georgian parliament on the dissolution of the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet, and the extent to which this action will reflect on the progress of already difficult talks on a peaceful settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, became the focus of attention immediately. In this connection V. Ardzinba read out a statement from the republic Supreme Soviet conclusively emphasizing the total political and legal bankruptcy of the Georgian parliament's action. Sukhumi believes, moreover, that this action is a blatant provocation aimed at sabotaging the talks and returning to attempts at a forcible solution to the conflict. How else can it be interpreted, if the decree adopted in Tbilisi not only abolishes the parliament of a sovereign state but also provides for the criminal prosecution of the parliamentarians themselves? With just whom exactly does the Georgian side intend to continue talks after this? With an "abolished" authority? With "the defendants"? And you know, the quest for a peaceful solution, which has been going on since last November, was close to success. As a result of three rounds of talks conducted under the UN aegis in Geneva and New York the sides had in point of fact reached agreement both on stationing peacemaking forces on the Inguri river and on restoring interstate relations. Nor did the Abkhaz side object to the return of Georgian refugees, with the exception of those who had participated directly in military operations against Abkhazia and carried out military and criminal acts on its territory. It is not impossible that it was the close prospect of a peaceful solution that alarmed the Georgian authorities. After all, legal documents can hinder aggression. In this connection V. Ardzinba sharply criticized Shevardnadze's efforts to turn world public opinion against Abkhazia and his statements during a U.S. visit maliciously distorting the facts. Take, for instance, the blatant lies about genocide in the republic and about the number of Georgian refugees. Shevardnadze brazenly cited the figure of 300,000 as the number of Georgians who had allegedly fled from Abkhazia and repression at a time when the total number of Georgian inhabitants on the republic's territory never exceeded 220,000-240,000 people, a significant proportion of whom, incidentally, remain in the country even today. All the actions of Shevardnadze, who came to power as a result of a forcible coup, the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet chairman noted, bear the hallmarks of an international political adventurer. He already sees NATO "peacemaking" forces on the southern Russian border along the Psou river, with himself under their cover as the full-fledged master on Abkhaz soil. But adventures, as we know, end in failure sooner or later. The people of Abkhazia will never yield to coercion. They seek peace and tranquility, they thirst for a speedier revival of their war-torn and occupied country, and they are entitled to expect world understanding and support in this.
