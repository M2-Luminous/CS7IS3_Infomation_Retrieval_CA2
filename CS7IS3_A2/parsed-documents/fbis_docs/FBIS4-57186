The amount represents a "rental payment" that covers from January to 31 October this year, based on the terms of the peace accord. The sum will serve as compensation for the effects of the armed rebellion without involving a sale of land. This measure, it was said, responds to proposals made by Chiapas livestock producers. The agreement signed this evening between the cattlemen's leaders and Governor Javier Lopez Moreno includes private land and ejidos and deals with damages to the land so far. They agreed that the arrangement will be reviewed upon its conclusion from the perspective of the peace accord that is currently under negotiation. Following a march by cattlemen from Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Ocosingo Municipalities to demand that state and federal authorities comply with the agreements signed 20 days ago in the presence of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Governor Lopez Moreno decided to meet the protesters' demands with an allotment from the state's own funds. The state official signed the agreement with cattlemen leaders Jorge Constantino Kanter and Jose Francisco Lopez Ardines, who agreed that landowners will receive 4,500 new pesos for land that cannot be tilled because it is within the area involved in the conflict. The figure will be multiplied by 12 percent annually for the 225 estates fully registered in the area. The payment to these estates "is like a rental payment for those affected between 1 January and today and for subsequent months." Fidel Culebro Trejo, president of the state's Rural Producers Federation, said the agreement does not involve any land sales. He added: "It is like a rental payment on the land's value." The following individuals signed the agreement on the state government's behalf: Jaime Mantecon Solis of the Rural Development and Ecology Secretariat; Rodolfo Ulloa Flores, general government secretary; Nestor Aguirre of the Agrarian Reform Secretariat; and Carlos Arroyo Rincon, assistant Agricultural and Water Resources Secretariat delegate, among other authorities. To implement the agreement, the state government pledged to establish offices in the municipal capitals of Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. The offices will register each of the estates located within the zone involved in the conflict once the requested stipulations have been met. Rural producers must submit requests to the governor for inclusion in the program, which begins tomorrow, at offices that will accept applications between 11 and 31 May. These offices will only register affected estates in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas Municipalities. State authorities will forgive, through the Finance Secretariat and on this occasion and for this zone only, taxes levied on the issuance of a tax clearance certificate. State officials will perform the appropriate analysis as soon as the requested documents arrive so they can immediately proceed with the payment. The Rural Development and Ecology Secretariat will be responsible for establishing the aforementioned registry offices. Enrique Moscoso Thomas, who has been named the program coordinator, will verify that the work is carried out expeditiously and without creating problems for owners and state officials. Referring to land occupations, the agreement states that "we will abide by the 60-day deadline specified in the agreement made with the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) in Mexico City." Once occupied lands are recovered, evaluations will be made to see that damages are repaired within the state government's normal programs. Once an agreement is signed between the parties, rural cattlemen and producers will reportedly vacate the city's civic square and downtown area, which they closed off throughout the day. The demonstrators will reportedly return to their communities this evening.
