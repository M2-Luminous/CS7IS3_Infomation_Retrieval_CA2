According to report made available to ANTARA here over the weekend, the import increase is lower than 20.96 percent of increase registered for 1988-1992. Indonesia's imports in December totalled 2.821 billion U.S. dollars, while in December 1992 the figure stood at 2.785 billion U.S. dollars. During January-December 1993 period, the total imports rose to 28.3 billion U.S. dollars from 27.3 billion U.S. dollars recorded in the previous year. The report also said that the increase of import value in 1993 was low in comparison with that of 1992 because of the low growth in the import value of non-oil/gas commodities, which in its turn was attributed to the low growth registered in the import of capital goods and auxiliary raw materials. All this, the report continued, illustrates that in 1993 domestic investments, either new investments or expansion of existing investments, did not develop well. Likewise, the report noted production activities did not go on at a pace as rapid as that during 1988-1992. However, it is interesting to note, the report continued, that compared with the value recorded for 1992, imports of consumer goods decreased in value in 1993, adding that this decrease was related to the decline in the imports of beverages and processed foods for households and durable consumer goods. The report revealed that the imports of consumer goods in 1993 went down by 5.95 percent, viz. from 1.176 billion U.S. dollars registered in 1992 to 1.106 billion U.S. dollars.
