A KMTA report said that in the fishing grounds of New Zealand, Tahiti and Australia, former Soviet fishermen are making inroads into major areas and selling their catch at half the price charged by their Korean counterparts thanks to low labor costs. Fishermen from the former communist bloc earn less than 100 U.S. dollars a month, under one-14th the starting salary of 1,400 dollars for Koreans. Captains from the former Soviet Union are paid no more than 150 dollars, even less than the montly 500-dollar pay of Indonesian fishermen. In order to increase their catch and save costs, Korean fishing boats have decided not to return to port unless bad weather or ship problems arise. To save docking time, they are being supplied with food and drink by freight boats, a KMTA official said. Adding to their problems, Korean fishing vessels will likely find it difficult to gain longer periods at sea from bases like New Zealand, which are demanding that their nationals be employed as sailors. Koreans prefer not to employ them, however, as they refuse to work longer hours. Four Korean fishing companies operate in New Zealand and 10 in tahiti. Industry sources predict encroachment by fishermen from the former Soviet Union in other areas like Spain as well. Japanese fishermen, hit by declining profitability caused by high labor costs, are selling their ships and returning home.
