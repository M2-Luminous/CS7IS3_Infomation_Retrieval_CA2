At a press conference held shortly after his return from the United States and Canada, Kolodziejczyk hinted that the coalition itself is to be blamed for the lack of his deputy. He confirmed that before he left for the United States he had chosen one candidate from among four forwarded to him by the coalition but this candidate had not been formally approved. "After my return I encountered totally different situation when the entire coalition pronounced itself against the interest of the state while voting for the budget," Kolodziejczyk said referring to the Defence Ministry budget which, in the ministry opinion's, is unfavourable. He said that he wanted to meet President Lech Walesa as soon as possible to discuss the matter. In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, the parliament decision to assign 300 billion zlotys (around 13.6 million dollars) from the Defence Ministry budget for the purchase of "Iryda" planes does not serve the defence interest of the state, does harm to other arms industry plants and may delay the production of a Polish anti-aircraft short-range missile. Commenting upon his visit to the United States, the minister said that "the foreign policy of the United States has shifted towards Poland." "We are linked by strategic interests," he added. He explained that his talks in the U.S. focused on the U.S. technological assistance for the Polish Army and on assistance in financing "partnership for peace" programme. Kolodziejczyk said that Poland cannot count on receiving money at present as the matters related to the assistance are being discussed. Asked what he thinks about the concentration of Russian Army in the Kaliningrad District, he replied that this is groundless from the operational point of view. "Poland wants to have partnership relations with Russia but Russia is pretending to be a besieged stronghold. Our streched hand, as far as economic cooperation is concerned, usually is in vain, the minister said.
