FR940214-0-00028 FR940214-0-00004 FmHA response: In light of the difficulty in obtaining audited financial statements of individuals, FmHA will continue with the requirements currently in existence and has eliminated the word ``audited'' from this section. The Agency also feels that a proper analysis of a financial statement will provide a better understanding of an applicant's creditworthiness than would an individual's income tax statement. FmHA maintains the position that a financial statement not be more than 6 months old when the preapplication is filed. 48. Exhibit A&hyph;7 Paragraph I.H Respondents agreed with this section. 49. Exhibit A&hyph;7 Paragraph II.A Comment: One respondent recommended that FmHA establish a percentage of elderly homeowners that could be considered as potential tenants. Two respondents disagreed with the use of a checklist in evaluating market studies. A few respondents disagreed with limiting the area of consideration to 20 percent of the substandard rental units. Two respondents objected to the use of professional market studies in the analysis of need and suggested that personal contact with possible tenants, talking with other apartment owners, or conducting a newspaper questionnaire would provide a more credible means for determining need. One respondent suggested that we include a definition of ``substandard units.'' Also, that respondent pointed out that the same persons who reside in ``overcrowded'' units are being doublecounted, first from the substandard category and second from the new households category. One respondent agreed with this section. FmHA response: FmHA does not agree that elderly homeowners should be considered in the need for units. That is not to say these elderly homeowners cannot live in the FmHA-financed unit. We do not feel that the general market can absorb the sale of multiple homes at one time. Exhibit A&hyph;8 does state that if the economic conditions reflect normal selling times for homes in the market area, then elderly homeowners may be considered as a secondary market. FmHA has had in use a checklist for analyzing market studies for some time; this regulation now requires its use to enhance internal control over administration of the program. The purpose of the checklist is to enable the reviewer to determine if all segments of Exhibit A&hyph;8 have been addressed by the study. Market demand and feasibility is created by several factors. One of those factors is the demand created by persons who are living in substandard units and seeking decent, safe and sanitary housing which can be financed by FmHA. Currently, there is no limit on the percentage of substandard units which an analyst can project in determining market demand. For example, if there are 100 units of substandard housing in a given market, analysts can and have stated that 80, or any other arbitrary, percentage of the families living in these units create a portion of the demand. We have found that the percentage of units projected as a result of substandard housing varies significantly from study to study. In addition, without any boundaries, it provides the market analyst with a contingency to justify demand. The 20 percent limitation was offered based upon previous experience with market analysis. Without a threshold, FmHA is defenseless in challenging a professional market analyst. It is reasonable to set a limit since there is no objective methodology in which to actually determine how many people residing in substandard units will move to a newly completed Section 515 complex. The Agency will, however, allow a higher number if the analyst can clearly document that the occupants of more than 20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to relocate to the proposed housing. The documentation will be in the form of signed survey sheets prepared expressly to capture such information. The use of market studies does not prohibit anyone from doing more to assess the market, such as making local contacts. Placing a questionnaire in a newspaper does not ensure the return of any responses. A definition of substandard has been added.
