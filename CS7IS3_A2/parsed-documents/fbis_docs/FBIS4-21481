The president of Ecology Generation thinks that the problems of the French civilian nuclear industry are only just beginning, but that the real urgency lies in Eastern Europe. Hubert: How do you interpret the Cadarache accident? Lalonde: I think we are busy experiencing what happened in the United States. Our sites are beginning to age, and age badly. This is a problem for which we are not prepared. I think that with regard to Rapsodie, the risks were underestimated. Hubert: Can or should this accident call into question the restarting of the Superphenix? Lalonde: I do not think that the two events should be linked. The only common point is that the Cadarache accident is due to sodium, which is found in very large quantities in Superphenix. But Superphenix is an installation which bears no resemblance to the Cadarache installation. Rapsodie was out of use and I have the impression that this tank was cleaned in a rather slipshod way. Whereas all the fairies are watching over Superphenix and protecting it. Superphenix had to be shut down less because of a possible danger -- which exists -- than because its design was fundamentally a mistake and it became a financial drain. It will one day be necessary to admit that this story of converting it into an incinerator is a total lie. Hubert: What is therefore now the order of priorities in France? Lalonde: The first problem is Phenix, which strikes me as more of a weak link than Superphenix. We have just had a problem with the first of the line, the ``grandfather,'' namely Rapsodie, in the dismantling of this reactor which no longer serves any purpose and the dangers of which were underestimated. We still have the Phenix, the ``father,'' which ought to be shut down. Superphenix shuts down every five minutes because of alarms. The risk would lie in switching off the alarms so that they could no longer be heard. But if I was in government, I would ask for a report on Phenix. Hubert: Could safety be more effectively guaranteed in the French civilian nuclear industry? Lalonde: Of course. At present, we have a risk factor of one in 100 per year and per installation of an accident producing radioactive emissions. We ought to increase that to one in 1,000. Our engineers ought to be asked to improve this probability. They can do so, but they are not doing so because nobody has asked them to. In this country, there is a routine, there are habits, factions which continue their business, and politicians who do not know what orders to give. In short, there is no nuclear policy. Hubert: You have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Eastern Europe. Does what you saw there present a nuclear threat to Europe? Lalonde: Yes, there is a real abyss in Ukraine and Russia. That is where things will collapse first. The situation is deteriorating, especially because of Russian nationalism and the prevailing chaos. In Chernobyl, the population was moved. Almost 5,000 people were mobilized to clean up, they were ordered to do so because of the nature of the Communist regime still in place at the time. It would now be absolutely impossible to do that. The mechanisms of alternative democratic, administrative, and economic authorities have not been established. Russian nationalism proclaims that its power stations are the best in the world and that the Western countries have no role to play in them. Ukraine, for its part, depends almost 100 percent on Russians for its engineers and its spare parts. Anything which affects safety in Russia and in Ukraine comes second to production. Hubert: So there is a risk of a second Chernobyl or worse? Lalonde: Yes, and I am not sure that it is just a risk, I think it is a certainty, and at any time. Moreover, this is a very strange failure by our Western democracies. It is rather like Bosnia: We know, we watch, but we do nothing, or not much. Hubert: Does nuclear power still represent the future in the energy sphere? Lalonde: It is not certain. It is one technology. The future rests more with renewable energy sources. The nuclear industry presupposes a great deal of virtue. At present it is like being on a road on which our engineers responsible for nuclear safety are driving while telling us: ``You see, I don't have accidents! I'm driving at 110 km per hour and controlling my car.'' They forget one thing: There are other drivers who drive very badly. Hubert: You are very pessimistic... Lalonde: I am a realist. I realize to what extent this world is becoming a little more radioactive every day.
