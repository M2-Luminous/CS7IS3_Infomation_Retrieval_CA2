We will deal with this problem in the coming period, and we have said that the problem of the republic of Serbian Krajina must be returned to the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia since it is well known that we have not been present there for some time now. The Krajina is being discussed without the presence of the Krajina representatives. Therefore, I believe that in the near future, the Krajina will have its place at the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, where this issue will be reviewed. However, generally, the issue of the Krajina will be solved on the principle of self-determination, something that has been guaranteed to all other peoples; we shall fight so that we in the republic of Serbian Krajina can also have this right. [Unidentified correspondent] How did Mr. Churkin react to this? [Martic] Well, quite correctly, and he supported the initiative to have our problem solved within the framework of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martic, has there been pressure for the Krajina to join the Muslim-Croat federation? [Martic] There has been no pressure so far. Probably most of the pressures are now concentrated on that part of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I suppose that there will be [pressure]. However, nothing in the Krajina can be solved without the people of the republic of Serbian Krajina, without the legitimately elected institutions -- the parliament, government, president; we shall decide the future of the republic of Serbian Krajina within this framework. Moreover, I believe that the fate will be decided in a [word indistinct] new referendum before the international public, once we in the republic of Serbian Krajina are granted this right, the right to self-determination. [Unidentified correspondent] In what phase are the negotiations, the direct negotiations, between the Krajina and Croatia? [Martic] Well, for a long time we did not hold any negotiations for well-known reasons, because Croatia simply did not respect any peace agreements and continued with provocations, infiltrating terrorist groups like the one recently infiltrated into Lika where the Vojnic territory was taken back -- this is known -- then again recently, the infiltration of groups into the area of Banija, or more precisely, around Glina, where we have noticed a constant duality of the Croatian side [sentence as heard]; on one hand they are stressing peace, promoting peace in the world, yet on the other hand they are constantly provoking. [Words indistinct] as we have agreed today to negotiate a cessation of hostilities, to establish peace, which certainly does not mean a political solution for either the Krajina or Croatia. [Unidentified correspondent] What were your conditions for going to Zagreb? [Martic] We certainly stressed that it has got to be known that this is not the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that this is extraterritorial since it is the Russian Embassy, and with maximum security -- which we do not doubt -- and which will be taken care of by Russia, by its representatives, that is, so that our delegation can feel they are on neutral ground and that they can negotiate on completely equal terms. [Unidentified correspondent] Who will be in your delegation? [Martic] Well, we will elect a delegation, probably comprising the defense minister, the foreign minister, we shall see, we shall come to a decision in a couple of days. [Unidentified correspondent] Were you pressured by Belgrade to accept this agreement? [Martic] No, no. We held correct talks with Belgrade and the official authorities, but we have been given the initiative to decide our own fate; of course, we can accept well-intentioned suggestions from anyone, particularly suggestions that are well-intentioned -- and that has always been the case so far -- and we accept the suggestions of the ruling cadre of the Republic of Serbia. However, we were not pressured. [Unidentified correspondent] (?Will you be meeting with Milosevic)? [Martic] I probably will. This cooperation is simply necessary and it was never discontinued.
