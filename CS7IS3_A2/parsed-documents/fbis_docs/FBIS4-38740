The presidential elections in Belarus will take place on 23 June. A total of six candidates for presidency have been officially registered, including Kebich, Belarusian parliament's ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian opposition People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak and Communist leader Vasili Novikov. Kebich said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX that, if elected the president, he would carry out the agreement on the merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. Kebich is considered one of the most likely winners of the presidential race. However, he emphasized that the budgets of the two countries would not be merged. Kebich said that only two budget items would be coordinated -- the deficit and the amount of money issued. Speaking about his contenders, Kebich feared that Zenon Poznyak might win the presidential elections. Kebich suggested that if Poznyak be elected, Belarus would face war, bloodshed and elimination of human rights and liberties. He added that if the People's Front won the elections, this would mean a catastrophe for the whole Belarusian people. Kebich confirmed his suggestion by referring to the recent statement by Poznyak in the media. Poznyak had put forward territorial claims to Russia, Lithuania and Poland. Kebich said this was a dangerous policy which would lead to bloodshed.
