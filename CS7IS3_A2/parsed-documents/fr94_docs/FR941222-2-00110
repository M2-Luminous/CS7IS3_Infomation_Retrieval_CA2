FR941222-2-00110 FR941222-2-00092 6. Applicants further assert that, in view of the limited function of the Sub-Advisers and the fact that no more than approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets will be affected by any one Sub-Adviser change, addition or continuation, the Trust's shareholders are significantly less dependent on any one Sub-Adviser than are the shareholders of a conventionally structured single manager fund. As a result, the need for the protection provided by the shareholder approval requirement of section 15(a) is correspondingly less. 7. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the SEC to exempt persons or transactions from the provisions of the Act to the extent that such exemptions are necessary or approximate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by he policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the requested exemptive relief from section 15(a) would be consistent with the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act and would be in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each new sub-advisory agreement will be submitted for ratification and approval to the vote of the Trust's shareholders no later than at the regularly scheduled annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust next following the effective date of the new sub-advisory agreement, and its continuance after such meeting will be conditioned on approval by the required majority vote of such shareholders. 2. The Trust will continue to hold annual meetings of its shareholders, whether or not required to do so by the rules of the NYSE or otherwise. 3. The directors of the Trust, in addition to approving the new sub-advisory agreement in accordance with the requirements of section 15(c) of the Act, will specifically determine that entering into the new sub-advisory agreement in advance of the next regular annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust and without prior shareholder approval is in furtherance of the multi-manager methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets and is in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders. 4. The new sub-advisory agreement involved will, when entered into, affect no more than approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets. 5. The new Sub-Adviser will have no affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser, and will have no duties or responsibilities with respect to the Trust beyond the investment management of the portion of the Multi-Managed Assets allocated to it by LAMCO from time to time and related record keeping and reporting. 6. The new sub-advisory agreement will provide for a portfolio management fee no higher than that provided in the Trust's existing sub-advisory agreements with respect to the Multi-Managed Assets, and, except for the provisions relating to shareholder approval referred to in condition 1 above, will be on substantially the same other terms and conditions as such existing agreements. In the event that the new sub-advisory agreement provides for sub-advisory fees at rates less than those provided in the existing sub-advisory agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust and its shareholders through a corresponding voluntary reduction in the fund agreement fee payable by the Trust to LAMCO. 7. The appointment of the new or successor Sub-Adviser will be announced by press release promptly following the directors' action referred to in condition 3 above, and a notice of the new sub-advisory agreement, together with a description of the new or successor Sub-Adviser, will be included in the Trust's next report to shareholders. 8. LAMCO will provide overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Multi-Manager Assets, subject to the Trust's investment objectives and policies and any directions of the Trust's directors. In particular, LAMCO will (i) provide overall investment programs and strategies for the Multi-Managed Assets, (ii) recommend to the Trust's directors investment management firms for appointment or replacement as Sub-Advisers for the Multi-Managed Assets, (iii) allocate and reallocate the Multi-Managed Assets among the Sub-Advisers, and (iv) monitor and evaluate the investment performance of the Sub-Advisers, including their compliance with the Trust's investment objectives, policies and restrictions. 9. In the case of a new sub-advisory agreement with an existing Sub-Adviser or its successor following an ``assignment,'' as that term is defined in the Act and the rules thereunder, of the Trust's sub-advisory agreement with that Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser (or its successor) or LAMCO will pay the incremental cost of including the proposal to approve or disapprove ratification of the new sub-advisory agreement in the proxy material for the Trust's next annual meeting of shareholders. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
