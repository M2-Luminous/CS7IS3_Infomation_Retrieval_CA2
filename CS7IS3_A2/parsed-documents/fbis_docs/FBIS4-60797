Nazran and Vladikavkaz Dissatisfied"] [Text] The closed session of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, whose work schedule included the question of confirming the Russian president's edict on extending the state of emergency in the zone of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict, was preceded by a meeting of Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and the presidents of Ossetia and Ingushetia with Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security aide. The fourth man, as is rumored, was Sergey Filatov, the president's chief of staff. The interlocutors, as an informed source has confirmed, agreed that the amendments to the well-known edict of 4 April made by the Russian Federation president should be confirmed by the Federation Council. The edict excluded the Republic of North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon population centers of Oktyabrskoye, Kambileyevskoye, Sunzha, and Sputnik, which geographically divide the state of emergency zone into two parts, from the list of villages whose territories were affected by the state of emergency rule. The "amendment" to President Yeltsin's edict that followed in the wake of the Ingush citizens convoy attacked in Vladikavkaz on 12 April introduced a measure of logic in the operation of the state of emergency rule on the territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon: all four villages have been again "returned" to the state of emergency zone. This Federation Council decision brought no satisfaction to the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of Akhsarbek Galazov, the edict extending the state of emergency rule brings about no serious change in the situation in the conflict zone. He is echoed by Yuriy Biragov, North Ossetia's Supreme Soviet chairman, who also thinks the Federation Council should have taken into consideration the proposal of the Provisional Administration, headed by Vladimir Lozovoy, that the State of Emergency zone be extended by including in it the Ingush territories. The Ingush villages of Galashki, Muzhichi, and Ali-Yurt, contiguous on North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon, would have created, Biragov thinks, a real security zone on the borders of the two republics. Vladikavkaz representatives also disagree with the opinion prevailing in Moscow and in the Provisional Administration that the republican law and order organs are unable to be on top of the situation on the territory entrusted to them. Owing to this, Vladikavkaz cannot recognize the primacy of the Provisional Administration's powers in the State of Emergency zone over those of the regional administration organs. Neither is Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev quite satisfied with the extension of the State of Emergency zone. His final objective -- the introduction of federal rule in the State of Emergency zone -- remains, as before, unrealized. Ingushetia's Nazran and Malgobek rayons, which are part of the State of Emergency zone, have been once again thus wrongly included, Aushev thinks, because their population poses no threat to neighboring Ossetia. The Federation Council's confirmation of the edict on the conflict zone, in the opinion of the president from Nazran, merely corrects the mistake made in the 4 April edict. In the meantime, on 27 April Russian Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a Russian Government decree expanding the powers of Provisional Administration head Vladimir Lozovoy on the territory of Mozdok, Prigorodnyy (Republic of North Ossetia), Malgobek, and Nazran rayons (Republic of Ingushetia). Under the decree, orders and directives of the Provisional Administration head are mandatory for federal organs of power of the Russian Federation, as well as for the executive organs of state power of federation components.
