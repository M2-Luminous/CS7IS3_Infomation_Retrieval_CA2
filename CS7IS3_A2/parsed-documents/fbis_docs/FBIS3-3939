Prices of spiral steel, sheet steel, and channel iron have increased by 150 yuan per tonne. The demand on wire rods is the greatest and some steel works have raised their producer prices by 300 yuan at one go. The price of wire rods in some futures markets for for transactions to be completed in June this year has risen to 3,960 yuan per tonne, and has even exceeded 4,000 yuan per tonne. Compared with the price of 3,000 yuan per tonne at the beginning of this year, this sharp increase is over 30 percent. This reporter has been "running round" iron and steel enterprises for some time and has recently been asked frequently by people: Is it normal or abnormal for prices of construction steels to soar at present? My answer can only be regarded as my personal view: Viewed from the law of value and from the supply and demand relationship, there is no reason for prices of construction steels to soar at present or this year. Are soaring prices caused by short supply on the market, demand being greater than supply, or a drastic fall in stocks? Evidently not. According to an analysis by Wu Xichun, vice minister and information spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, this year, forecasted according to the scale of social investment in fixed assets and the scale of credit arranged to meet the target of an increase in GNP of 9-10 percent compared with last year, the increase in the total volume of steel consumed for the whole year will be 5.4 to 7.5 percent over the actual volume consumed last year. The estimated total volume of steel resources for the whole year is: 81 million tonnes produced in China, 9 million tonnes of stocks in society, and some steels which are in short supply will be imported. This means that so long as domestic steel production remains normal and the use of 9 million tonnes in stock in society is ensured, the supply-demand relationship in the steel market this year will be more or less in balance and price rises caused by a shortage of supply will not occur. Some people may ask: Will the 9 million tonnes of steels in stock in society become the plums one "thinks of in an attempt to quench a thirst" or the cake "drawn to allay hunger?" It seems quite certain that the answer is also no. Last year, China imported a total of 30.26 million tonnes of steel, and more than half of that arrived after the State Council strengthened macro regulation and control over the economy in July, and 4.45 million tonnes arrived in December. According to calculations based on the rate of steel consumption during that period, it was totally impossible for China's construction, machine-building, and electrical industries to have consumed more than 20 million tonnes of steel in less than half a year. According to statistics from the State Statistics Bureau, steel stored by state-owned enterprises at the end of last year was about 19 percent more than at the beginning of last year. Besides, stocks at various iron and steel works at the end of last year were over 150 percent more than at the beginning of last year. The above shows that there is a big margin of safety in the plan to use 9 million tons of steel stocks in society this year. Is will be difficult to turn out 81 million tonnes of steel this year since the internal and external conditions for the production of iron and steel are not good? They are not. As early as the first half of last year, average daily steel output for three months was 220,000 tonnes, equivalent to an annual output of 80.3 million tonnes. Moreover, in the second half of last year and this year, a number of new, renovated, or expanded projects were put into operation. The production situation since January this year is even better: Compared with the same period of 1993, iron output has increased by 369,000 tonnes, or 5.66 percent; steel output by 558,000 tonnes, or 8.15 percent; and output of special steels by 729,800 tonnes or 13.08 percent. The range of increase for special steels was wider than that for basic steel, which was wider than for iron. This is precisely what people engaged in the metallurgical industry want. Is this a chain reaction in the domestic market caused by a rise in the price of steel on the international market? It is not. The price of steel on the international market inevitably becomes an objective standard for the rise and fall of the price of steels in the domestic market following the institution of the socialist market economy structure. However, the relevant data show that the $15 rise for each tonne of hot-rolled sheet steel and coated sheet steel on the U.S. market at the beginning of this year was caused by anti-dumping policies against steel imports implemented by the United States last year, which held back imports, and by rising labor costs in domestic steel works, whose output could not meet market demand. In Europe, on the one hand, low-price Russian steel are being sold on the market, and, on the other hand, each country's steel works are finding it difficult to realize their wish to raise prices because of a slow economic recovery. In Japan, the six major iron and steel corporations are suffering losses. They of course want to raise prices to some extent, but in the first half of this year, since the economic recession had not yet ended and steel exports to China had dropped by a big margin, the objective environment did not permit rising prices. Viewed then from the major steel-producing countries round the world, no considerable rise in the price of steel has occurred. Therefore, there are no grounds for a big rise in the price of steel in China. Has seasonal demand for steel led to a rise in the price of steels? Evidently not! It was extremely cold in January and February, and many capital construction projects north of the Chang Jiang had to be suspended or slow down their construction progress because of the climate. On construction sites south of the Chang Jiang, most workers come from other localities, and they made use of the New Year-Spring Festival period to go home and see their relatives. This objectively led to a "lax season" in the use of steel. This can be seen from steel prices in some futures markets: prices were not high for January and February, and the highest prices are found in June and July. Have readjustments in coal, electricity, and transportation prices raised producer price of steel leading to a rise in futures prices? Much less is the case! On the whole, producer prices of wire rods from various steel works at present have recovered slightly compared with the fourth quarter, and it should be said that the shadow of an abrupt fall in prices last year has just gone. At present, various steel works are, in accordance with the demands of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and through the Metallurgical Product Price Coordination Committee, seriously summing up experiences and lessons of the major fluctuations in prices in 1993. They have formed a preliminary view: Steel works hope the price of steels will not go out of control. This is because letting things drift leads to abrupt rises and falls in the price of steel, which will not be conducive to the readjustment of the structure of the metallurgical industry, the formation of a competitive mechanism for the survival of the fittest among enterprises, the normal production and operational activities of enterprises, the healthy development of other sectors of the national economy, and the stability of the entire society. Last year, many small unlicensed workshops were set up to produce steel and large quantities of poor quality steel were found. Over 30 million tonnes of steel was unnecessarily imported, of which construction steel accounted for half the total. An important reason was that the price of steel was too high and immense profits could be reaped. All large and medium sized iron and steel works expressed their determination to seriously make good use of their rights to set product prices and to adhere to four principles in setting prices: ensuring reasonable profits for enterprises under normal production conditions, giving full consideration to market demand, using international market prices as reference, and paying attention to maintaining cooperation with major users and long-term users. "How should we look at the rise in construction steel prices at present after so much has been said?" In fact, my view is quite clear: There is no shortage of steel on the market, demand for steel is not excessive, the amount of steel in stock is not small, steel production is normal, and increases in the price of steel abroad are not big. If the price of steel is artificially raised by means of "speculation," such activities can only be called "blind activities." As Wu Xichun, vice minister and information spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, put it: The emergence of so-called "short supply and soaring prices" in the steel market is an abnormal phenomenon and a false market signal.
