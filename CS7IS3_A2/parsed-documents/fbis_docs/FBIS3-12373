The sources revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone yesterday that an Iranian delegation arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan last Tuesday and held talks with Kurdish officials. The talks resulted in the Iranian delegation recovering the helicopter, which suffered a technical fault while returning to Iranian territory -- which forced the pilot to conduct an emergency landing in the mountainous area of Azmar near the Iranian border. The sources expressed their belief that the helicopter has probably now returned to its Iranian base. [passage omitted] The KDP sources stressed that the Kurdish authorities refused to hand over to the Iranian delegation the Kurdish [as published] pilot whose application for asylum -- the first if its kind since the Kurdish government was established 20 months ago -- is still being considered by the relevant authorities. Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that leading bodies in the "Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan" have ratified the reconciliation agreement concluded on 17 February between its general guide Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. [passage omitted] At another level, KDP sources have said that Iraqi Interior Minister Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, half brother of Saddam Husayn, recently supervised the execution of 20 citizens from the Kurdish city of Karkuk, which is under the control of the central government in Baghdad. The sources added that bodies of the citizens, arrested in December on charges of opposing the Iraqi regime, were later handed to their families. The bodies were disfigured as a result of the torture they suffered during their interrogations. The sources mentioned the names of five victims: Mala Hakim Ghafur Hamah Rida, Mala Najm-al-Din Sayyid Rashid Banghuli, Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, Amanj Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, and 'Ali Dawudi. Their ages range between 13 and 50.
