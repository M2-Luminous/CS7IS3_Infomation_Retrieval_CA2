However, before it came under the control of the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA], the government Army, backed by Interahamwe Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] militias had taken care to exterminate the whole population of the region, especially members of the Tutsi ethnic group as is the case in other areas under their control. Several communal graves, which were carefully prepared in advance, have been discovered by RPF combatants. The natural (?cave) of (Vayanga) also contained a large number of corpses which were thrown there by men of the current government. And it is sad that neither French President Francois Mitterrand, nor UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, nor his staff member Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh on a mission in our country for Rwandans' sins, none of these three men [word indistinct] makes any comment on this sheer horror. On the contrary, the first one armed and trained the neo-Nazi killers who have just committed an irreparable act; the second, through the third one, withdrew UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] forces which were protecting the unfortunate people, giving the barbarous militias the freedom to kill. None of these three men cares about the crimes which the militias of the current government and the soldiers continue to perpetrate. You have no doubt listened to the words of Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo, puppet president of Rwanda, a statement which he made yesterday in Kibuye where he was on a visit to express satisfaction over the genocide which has just been committed in that prefecture. He thanked the killers before indicating that the troubles had ended because the people to be killed had indeed all been killed. Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh is in Rwanda and does not say a single word about these government crimes. On the contrary, the government is encouraged by the UN secretary general's representative and by French President Francois Mitterrand who is trying desperately to have this government recognized. This government is in a shaky state after having committed genocide unprecedented on this earth.
