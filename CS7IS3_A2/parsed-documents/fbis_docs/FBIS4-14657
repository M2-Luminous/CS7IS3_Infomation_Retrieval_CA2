"Fatherland and Freedom" has drafted this law in light of its belief that the final decision on the continued operation of the Skrunda radar station after 31 August 1994 should be made by the people of Latvia, and that the signing of the agreement with Russia should be delayed until the results of the referendum are calculated. The draft law presented by "Fatherland and Freedom" says that the referendum should be held on 29 May, at the same time as local government elections, and that all eligible Latvian citizens should participate. During the referendum, voters would answer the question: Do you agree or disagree with the continued operation of the Skrunda radar station after 31 August 1994? After the referendum, depending on the results, the Saeima will decide whether or not to conclude the agreement with Russia on the functioning of the Skrunda radar station, the draft law envisions. It also says that the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers on concluding the agreement with Russia, which provide for the Skrunda station to continue operations past 31 August 1994, are not valid. The faction asked to include this issue on the agenda of the next plenary session, but the Presidium of the Saeima decided to pass it in the usual procedure to the Juridical Commission, which will prepare the draft law for examination at the plenary session. On Thursday [24 March], the deputies will have to make a decision as to whether the draft law will be rejected or passed to the Juridical Commission. A special law is necessary because the Constitution does not provide for the holding of popular referendums on issues related to international agreements.
