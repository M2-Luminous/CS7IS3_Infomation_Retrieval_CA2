In the difficult years to come, only such a force will be able to guarantee a compromise between the various interests and, subsequently, social peace. Unless a liberal center government leads the country after 1994, I really fear that neither of the forces at the right or at the left of the political arena will recoil from making use of all the available means to topple the other's government. And this will hurt the entire country. I find it particularly dangerous that, in the case of such a political polarization, the basis of the bourgeois center could also slowly disintegrate, because a bourgeois middle class needs peace. If this center force disappears and if everyone has to belong to some camp in order to assert his interests, then we can give up our hopes of a bourgeois Hungary. [Pinter] In your opinion, does the concept of bourgeois center originate from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] exclusively? [Orban] The process that led to the signing of an agreement between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and later between the other two liberal parties started at our pressure. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Do you exclude the existence of liberal political parties that want to cooperation between liberals and leftists in principle? [Orban] Of course, there are leftist liberal forces, and no one should be ashamed of this, because the social-liberal trend is present in many areas in the world. However, for such a policy in Hungary today, we lack one of the the major conditions, namely a genuine and strong social democratic party with which the liberals could easily agree. As for us, in our policy, we would like to assert the idea that the liberal thought always failed on two issues that are still timely today; one of them is the national issue, to which the liberals have failed to give an efficient answer since the beginning of this century and have left this issue to the right-wing and often extremist forces. We know well what tragedies came in the wake of all this. Certain circles of the current government coalition followed this tradition when they called us a force "insensitive to vital national questions" and tried to make people believe that liberalism was an article of mass consumption brought from abroad. The Fidesz has faced this challenge in the past three years. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Could the elections in Hungary lead to results in the wake of which you revised your position about the undesirable aspect of a social liberal coalition? Gabor Fodor left the Fidesz and, as "second" on the national list of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], he said that a government coalition based on the liberal force and the center would be the most balanced one, and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and a conservative party, perhaps the Christian Democratic People's Party might also have a place in such a coalition. Is it possible to form a real political agreement? [Orban] I consider Gabor Fodor to be a full SZDSZ politician. Our personal relations cannot affect the cooperation between liberals. However, with a more clever policy, we could have postponed this issue until after the elections. This change of parties will hurt the SZDSZ, at least to the same extent it hurt the Fidesz. I fear that there will be no winner in this competition, and all of us will only lose. The "Fodor-affair" can always be heated up and used to question the cooperation between liberal parties; those who aim at this will do this. As for a social liberal coalition, I do not think that a situation could emerge in the wake of which I would change my opinion. I cannot know in advance whether a situation might emerge in which Hungary's interests require a cooperation between liberals and the socialists. In any case, I would be very glad if Hungary did not get into such a situation. My goal is to see Hungary led by a strong liberal center after May 1994. However, elections could lead to special situations. The Fidesz represents a principled position and, in a given case, surmounting party policy considerations, we could negotiate with every democratic party on cooperation. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Can you see the possibilities of cooperation with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] more clearly now that it again has a chairman? [Orban] No. But I can generally see much more clearly now compared to the time before [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall separated the radical right wing from his party. I find the prime minister's statement reassuring when he says that the chances of cooperation between the MDF and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party are the same as that between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the MSZP. I trust that the consolidation of the conservative forces will continue and this has to manifest itself, among other things, precisely in consistent distancing from the radical forces. This is desirable for all civic middle classes that are interested in politics. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Do you feel that you have prepared to comply with all aspects of the responsibility of governing? [Orban] The level of preparations can always be improved a little. However, it is a fact that, since 1992, large committees have been working on making the Fidesz suitable for government work. With this in mind, we expanded the Fidesz's expert basis, we formed our relations with other parties, employers, and -- with less success -- employee organizations in accordance with this, and we worked in foreign politics in the interest of this. We are ready, taking the possibilities into consideration, to prepare Hungary for an earliest possible European Union and NATO membership. In spite of the economic policy failures, the country is enjoying some kind of stability; we are ready to preserve this, to launch an economic program that favors enterprises and establishes the conditions for growth, and to implement a grand educational reform. We have prepared as far as our abilities allow us and we will face the electors with a clear conscience: Here we are, the choice is yours. [passage omitted]
