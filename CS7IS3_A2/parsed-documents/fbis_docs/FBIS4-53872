Sumitomo Metal Industries will provide technical assistance in the construction and operation of a steel bar plant which Birmingham Steel has planned for construction in the continental United States. Sumitomo Metal Industries hopes to further its knowledge concerning the operation of electric furnaces as part of its plan to build its own strategy for such furnaces by expanding its alliances with leading U.S. electric furnace operators. Birmingham Steel plans to double the production of steel bars to a level of 1.1 million tons at its AS&W plant in Ohio, a medium-size steel bar maker which it purchased last year. Total capital to be invested has been set at $70 million and a search is underway for the plant site with a target plant opening date of January 1996. Sumitomo Metal Industries will provide know how on the selection of equipment, plant layout and operations. It will dispatch technicians to the plant site who will provide on-site training to plant workers for an unspecified period after the plant commences operations. Sumitomo Metal Industries will also assist in the modernization of the AS&W plants currently in operation.
