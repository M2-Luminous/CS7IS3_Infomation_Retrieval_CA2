It is common knowledge that he is always at the scene of the most fierce shelling of Bosnian besieged towns. Consequently, he could now be somewhere near Gorazde. However, General Mladic no longer takes part in any negotiations. He cannot be seen on SRNA either, where he used to appear every couple of days playing the role of the main military strategist -- the one to approve every move. He was the crucial man when the self-styled Serbian assembly decided to reject the Geneva peace accord, when Milosevic, Cosic, and Mitsotakis returned from Pale and suffered a severe loss of face. The last media promotion of the Chetnik general in Belgrade was more than a month ago in NIN. In a long interview for this weekly magazine, he presented his vision of the war in Bosnia and said General Kukanjac was to blame for the failure in the operation of seizing Sarajevo. Mladic has not appeared in public since then. Several days ago, a Belgrade RFI correspondent reported that there were rumors about Mladic's dismissal, but that Karadzic still did not dare do it, for his most famous general "still has a good reputation on the front lines." A certain mysteriousness regarding the position of Mladic on Karadzic's hierarchical ranking is a choice bit of dirt for masters of speculative journalism. However, all things considered, this could be a matter for serious analysts as well. General Ratko Mladic is a war criminal -- that is a fact. The Helsinki Watch, leading international organization for monitoring the state of human rights, also holds that view. But that is not the reason behind Mladic's possible sinking, for Radovan Karadzic is also on the list of war criminals of the Helsinki Watch. The underlying cause of his conflict with Mladic is something completely different. Last summer, after the Igman operation, Mladic was at his peak. He intended to conquer Sarajevo and wanted to become a Serb Napoleon, so Milosevic's generals feared him. Even Karadzic feared him, but could not even dream of depriving himself of his services. After the battle for Teocak, where he was heavily defeated, Mladic's military glory started to fade. He did not do too well in the offensive against Olovo either, and was forced to withdraw from almost 20 km long front line near Maglaj. Mladic then set out to conquer Bihac, but did not manage to improve his rating there. Karadzic used the series of Mladic's failures -- surely not without Milosevic's blessing -- to move the pugnacious general as far away from himself as possible. Their final act of revenge is yet to come. For the time being, the conflict is just one of the signals that the Pale brethren are not even remotely as unanimous as they used to be. They ran out of cheap human material for continuing the war. True to its fascization of Serb patriotism, SRNA has recently broadcast a scene of recruitment of 18-year-olds. We saw confused and nervous young men whom Karadzic intended to send to war. And 13- or 14-year-olds will go next. Watching the program on SRNA, we were reminded of the famous picture of Hitler pinching the cheeks of German boys sending them to their deaths in the suburbs of Berlin, just a few days before he committed suicide in his bunker.
