FBIS4-52827 "dreas093_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 South Korea * Timing of Kim Chong-il Writings, Succession * Timing of Kim Chong-il Writings, Succession 942C0086A Seoul PUKHAN in Korean Feb 94 pp 50-59 942C0086A Seoul PUKHAN Korean CSO [By lecturer Kim Pyong-ro] [Excerpts] 1. The Publishing Begins It is asserted that the number of Kim Chong-il's writings presented and published up to now amount to a total of over 400 works. Of these, the titles have been revealed for over 230 works and the full text confirmed for over 170. Most of Kim Chong-il's writings of thesis size are published in single-volume booklet form. As for complete-works-type publications, at present only the two-volume Kim Chong-il Selected Works has been published. As of yet, they have not been systematized into a form such as the "Selected Works" or "Collection of Works" of Kim Il-song. It appears that most of Kim Chong-il's writings are statements he has made, such as working-level guidance, on-site guidance, and oral instructions, recorded by secretaries in charge of ideology and theory. These then pass through correction and supplementation and are published as addresses or conclusions. This is often seen when a work is first made public in NODONG SINMUN. Its contents are introduced without revealing its title; the title is presented at some later time. Writings by Kim Chong-il first appeared officially in 1982. The publication of his works has progressed systematically, closely connected with the construction of Kim Chong-il's succession. Establishing a broad principle, called the "character standard," and three rules, being founded in popular support, electing a figure from the new generation, and electing the next leader while the leader [Kim Il-song] lives, as the fundamental principles for electing a successor, North Korea [NK] has been highlighting Kim Chong-il as the person fitting these principles. Presenting three elements as characteristics the leader must have--extraordinary foresight, lofty moral character, and superior leadership ability--NK has especially attempted to create the image of Kim Chong-il as figure in which these three elements are combined. The publication and propagation of Kim Chong-il's writings are indispensable means of publicizing his "extraordinary foresight." NK has pursued the publication of Kim Chong-il's writings by calling him a "genius of ideological theory" and a "master of ideological theory," to make him into an ideological theoretician by stressing his intellectual side. Although publishing his works is fundamentally a means of publicizing his talent as an ideological theorist, because presentation of policy for each sector of society, such as combative slogans, literary guidance, economic-construction guidance, etc., is achieved through the publishing of these works, it also displays his "superior leadership ability." Furthermore, these writings on each sector of society, by showing Kim Chong-il's great concern, also publicize his "lofty moral character." That Kim Chong-il's works were first published in 1982 is not unrelated to his succession was firmly established at this time. Emerging as the heir to power in the October 1980 Sixth Party Congress, Kim Chong-il began concrete, working-level guidance in May 1981. He also tried to create opportunities to strengthen his power base in the political sector, such as becoming a representative of the Songnim District, North Hwanghae Province in the Seventh General Election of the Supreme People's Assembly held on February 28, 1982. We can take the view that the publication of his writings began in 1982 as a way to secure a political base by publicizing his talent for thinking as a successor. [passage omitted] 2. The Three Stages of Publication Publishing Kim Chong-il's writings was carried out in three stages, according to analysis. The first stage was from 1982 through 1984: works capable of being used as policy guides in each sector of NK society were presented and published. The second stage was the publishing conducted between 1985 and 1987. In this stage, a reconstruction of Kim Chong-il's past activities was attempted by finding past, unpublished writings and retroactively publishing them. The third stage began in 1988 and at present, in 1993, is ongoing. With Kim Chong-il's succession in mind, the transfer of the leader image of Kim Il-song, the creation of the legitimacy of his regime, and the concrete publication of his works are being carried out. A. Stage One: Publication of Basic Policy Platform and Expansion of Kim Chong-il's Power Base The publication of Kim Chong-il's writings beginning in 1982 saw the publication of his main writings, to be used as policy guides in each sector of society, by the end of 1984. This was the first stage of publication. That is, from 1982 through 1984 NK caused his political influence to be felt, from everyday life to the workplace, by replacing with Kim Chong-il's writings teachings necessarily quoted in each area of society, on Chuche Thought, party construction, the economy, youth activities, art, education, the military, etc., and by having these studied in each neighborhood unit, workplace and school, and by clarifying them through debates and rallies. In order to obtain authority as the successor to Kim Il-song in NK, more than anything else, he must secure the right to interpret with authority the official ideology of NK society, Chuche Thought. This is the first consideration for qualifying as the leader in this socialist society ruled by ideology. In this context, Kim Chong-il organized and systematized theory on Chuche Thought previously alluded to by Kim Il-song, presenting and publishing his thesis entitled, On Chuche Thought. Kim Chong-il's second thesis, The [Korean] Workers Party is a Chuche-Type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the Glorious "Down With Imperialism Union" Tradition , was published on three pages of the October 17, 1982 NODONG SINMUN. This was to display another quality he must have as a leader: an anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition and insight on party building. In an editorial four days later, NODONG SINMUN quoted it as one of Kim Chong-il's teachings. Using the name, "Party Center," seven times and "Kim Chong-il" seven times, it greatly emphasized his position. A thesis, On Further Improving the People's Lives published on 16 Feb 84 played a very important role in Kim Chong-il securing the legitimacy of his regime. Since it was published, all NK economic policies have come to quote this thesis and all economic policy success since then has been completely credited to him. His image was further strengthened with the report that the results of the "August 3rd People's Consumer-Goods Increased Production Movement" to improve the people's lives, the Kwangbok-kori and Tongil-kori construction to increase the number of housing complexes, etc., were achieved based on the teachings of this thesis. In July 1984, with the presentation and publication of On Further Strengthening Party Leadership of the Youth Enterprise and On Further Developing the Educational Enterprise, policy guidance was presented covering the whole of national education. Another work small in size but treated as important by the military was published in April 1984: The People's Armed Forces Must Defend with Their Lives Their Leader and Party, Their System and Fatherland. Although no works have been published on unification, The Leader Kim Chong-il, published in two volumes in 1984, not only depicts him as having deep interest in unification too, but it also publicizes that he has led the formation of various unification-related social organizations since the Koryo Federal System was proposed in 1980. Together with the publication of his writings, the process of Kim Chong-il's political position becoming secure from October 1982, when his writings began to be published, through 1984 can be confirmed through NODONG SINMUN. Kim Chong-il's name started to be introduced on NODONG SINMUN's front page with the October 22, 1982 issue. Beginning in 1983, the frequency of its appearance increased. By November 1984, it reached its present form, in which articles on Kim Chong-il's recent situation and the publication of his writings are headlined on page one of NODONG SINMUN. This signifies that stage one of the publication of his works begun in October 1982 came to a conclusion in 1984. In stage one, the work of highlighting Kim Chong-il's leadership image was carried out in parallel, by converting into the achievements of Kim Chong-il those for which the credit had formerly been given to Kim Il-song: the achievement of the various popular movements, such as the "Campaign To Create Examples of Loyalty Learned By Following Lathe Number 26," "Three Revolutions Red Flag Movement," "Three-Revolution Team Movement," "Production, Study, and Life--All in the Manner of the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas," etc. Also, in this process, the fact that a "semi-war state" was proclaimed in February 1983 has similar aspects with the "semi-war-state" proclamation made prior to Kim Chong-il's appointment as National Defense Committee Chairman in March 1993. This can be seen as a measure taken to help minimize internal side effects resulting from pushing his succession forward. B. Stage Two: Retroactive Publishing and the Creation of a Successor Image Stage two was the collection and retroactive publishing of Kim Chong-il's past writings. This is more closely related to the construction of the Kim Chong-il-succussion system. Of the total of over 400 writings by Kim Chong-il, the entire texts of 30-some works were contained in the DPRK Yearbook and NODONG SINMUN in the year of publication, so there is no question of their veracity. This is not even 10 percent of the total. That is, the remaining 90 percent of his writings can be seen as a retroactive publication of past works. This was to create Kim Chong-il's talent as a successor. Retroactive publishing was probably more important than anything else for highlighting his talent as a thinker. The publishing generally took place between 1985 and 1987. Published first was Kim Chong-il's college-graduation thesis, The Position and Role of the Military in the Construction of Socialism, from March 18, 1964. Then economics-related works were published: Let Us Strongly Carry Out the Three Revolutions, Causing a New Upsurge in Production (July 1, 1975), Let Us Strengthen Party Leadership of the Rural Economy, Causing a New Upsurge in this Year's Agricultural Production (February 6, 1976), On Further Developing Science and Technology (August 3, 1985), and On Observing Revolutionary Discipline within the Party and Further Strengthening Party Leadership of Socialist Economic Construction (July 13, 1978). These works, together with On Further Improving the People's Lives, are considered important writings of Kim Chong-il dealing with the economic sector. The reason economics-related works were published in a concentrated manner at this time was to create his image as an economic-policy theorist and secure the legitimacy of his regime. This was to be done by supporting the policy to improve the people's standard of living through a revolution in light industry he advocated beginning in 1984. In June 1985, the "June 1985 Machine Tool Multiplying Movement" was carried out. In early 1986, in connection with improvement of the people's standard of living, a blueprint was presented for pursuing the construction of Kwangbok-kori. The frequency of Kim Chong-il's working-level guidance increased in connection with these large-scale, economic-construction projects. Accordingly, it appears that the collection of his economics-related works took on important meaning. Meanwhile, at this time an attempt was made to establish his image as a leader by collecting and publishing On Several Problems in Developing Cinematic Art (March 1, 1978), To Further Develop Chuche Cultural Art (March 31, 1981), etc., works in the sociocultural field. A representative work on his literary theory, the entire text of Cinematic Art Theory was made public in For the Completion of the Chuche Revolutionary Great Task Volume II, and translated and published in various languages. Thus, his image as a "genius of literary art" was brought into relief. Also, publishing a pamphlet entitled Gifted One of Ideological Theory, the Korean Workers Party Publishers propagandized on his college writings and effectively used them in creating the myth of Kim Chong-il's genius. As background to the full-scale retroactive publishing in 1985, we can point to China's fulfillment of its promise of support for the Kim Chong-il system through his visit to China in June 1983, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yao-bang's visit to NK in May 1984, and Kim Il-song's visit to China in November 1984, and that it was influenced by the positive discussion of Kim Chong-il's succession during Kim Il-song's six-week tour of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during May and June, 1984. Not only this, but internally it appears to have started in the designs of Kang Song-san, elected prime minister in the third session of the Seventh Supreme Peoples Assembly in 1984, and others of the reformist forces to expand their own power by using the glory of Kim Chong-il in the course of actively pursuing Kim Chong-il's economic policies. C. Stage Three: Systematization of Publishing and Preparation for the Succession After the succession issue concerning Kim Chong-il was mentioned in Kim Il-song's official statement in May 1986, NK changed direction to publishing writings for the succession. In preparation for the succession, NK entered a new phase by conducting a publishing project for transferring the charisma of Kim Il-song to Kim Chong-il and for establishing the legitimacy of the Kim Chong-il regime. During the eight months from late September 1988 through early May 1989 as many as 13 Kim Chong-il writings were made public as preparation for this succession. First of all, NK started supplementing the area of the Kim Chong-il's leadership succession process in which he was the weakest: unification. He was made the center of lively activity in that area. As of yet, no independent Kim Chong-il works on unification have been published. However, NK started inserting sections on North-South unification in the last part of documents, beginning with the October 1988 The Present Time and the Duty of Youth and An Answer to the Question Posed by the Cuban newspaper GRANMA's Chairman in October 1989. NK is also highlighting Kim Chong-il's great influence on unification. Not only was it made official that he is playing a leading role in unification with his 1988 presentation of the so-called "Four Principles Guaranteeing Peace": orientation toward unification, withdrawal of U.S. forces, North-South arms reduction, and negotiation between the parties, but it gives Kim Chong-il all the credit for sending relief goods for flood-disaster victims in September 1984 and the mutual exchange of art teams and hometown-visitation groups realized in September 1985. Second, he did an overall organization of literary theory. Putting together a work on literary theory, Kim Chong-il started publishing with a book entitled, On the Literary Art of Chuche, and published five books by the end of 1990. [passage omitted] Apparently, writings on this field were systematized first, out of consideration for the fact that Kim Chong-il's talent as a thinker begins in literary theory and that even at present he is active as the leader of the literary field. Third, NK commenced full-scale systematization of Kim Chong-il's works by publishing on February 14, 1992 for the first time in a complete-works format, Kim Chong-il Selected Works Volume I, in commemoration for his 50th birthday. [passage omitted] These writings were praised in the extreme by NODONG SINMUN, which called them a strong guide to be held firmly in the construction of Socialism and Communism, an encyclopedia revealing the way by which the achievements of socialism can be defended and advanced through the realization Chuche Thought. Also, in the course stage-three publication for the succession, NK made a first attempt at dispersing the focus of praise concentrated on Kim Il-song. That is, by symbolizing Kim Il-song as a figure of the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle and highlighting Kim Chong-il as a capable leader of the present time, NK wanted him to inherit the leader's authority, monopolized by Kim Il-song during the construction of socialism in NK after liberation from Japan. Beginning in late 1987, NK had emphasized the history of the anti-Japanese struggle of Kim Il-song, through such things as the discovery of the so-called "Slogan Tree." The History of the Korean Workers Party, published in 1991, can be understood in the same context. Centered on Kim Il-song, The History of the Korean Workers Party (1979 Edition) was suddenly revised. With the exception of those portions related to the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle, most mentions of Kim Il-song were replaced with Kim Chong-il. In particular, NK in 1988 produced and showed the documentary film, 1974, The Year of the Great Turning Point, in which Kim Chong-il was depicted as if having already been made successor in 1974. This has led to the idolization of Kim Chong-il by creating symbols, such as the cultivation and propagation of the Kimjongillia [a flower named after Kim Chongil], Chong-il Pong (November 15, 1988), Hyangdo Pong (January 1991), and Mansu Mugangsu (February 9, 1991). Also, the fact that since 1987 the DPRK Yearbook has not been using his previous titles, "Leader," and, "Secretary," can be seen as preparation for the use of the title, "The Leader." 3. Conclusion The publication of his works has functioned as an indispensable element of the construction process of his succession. Through the third stage of publishing, the evaluation of his past activities and his image as a leader were reformed: his college years were mysticized, the successor issue was resolved early (in 1974), and his talent as a thinker and his abilities as a leader were demonstrated. We cannot overlook the propaganda activity contributed by overseas networks, such as the Chochongnyon [NK-sponsored union of Koreans living in Japan] and the African Chuche Thought Research Center, in the construction of Kim Chong-il's image. To put it another way, his being the heir and the leadership succession were brought up more directly through overseas organizations. By reporting this in domestic newspapers and broadcasts, NK built the people's image of Kim Chong-il. Also, titling his works using popular slogans appears to have greatly contributed to the elevation of his popular appeal within NK and the expansion of his influence. Viewed overall, his writings have not yet been developed comprehensively into a single work encompassing politics, economics, diplomacy, and unification, as is the case with Kim Il-song's writings. Concerning diplomatic and unification issues in particular, Kim Chong-il's writings are of little importance. Most teachings being carried out in NK's economic and literary fields are based on the writings of Kim Chong-il. In economics, in connection with the recent construction of Tongil-kori and the pursuit of a revolution in light industry, his On Further Improving the People's Lives is frequently quoted as a message from the ruler. Because they have systematized all the fields of cinema, music, dance, art, architecture, and literature, Kim Chong-il's writings are quoted as teachings concerning literary activities too. Since Kim Il-song's writings on Chuche Thought and the party organizational system, are indispensable for Kim Chong-il's succession, the frequency of quotations from Kim Chong-il's writings on these areas too is gradually increasing. In connection with the establishment of Kim Chong-il's image, the question of how to establish a relationship between Kim Chong-il's and Kim Il-song's writings will become important. NK will have to increase quotation of Kim Chong-il's writings in the mass media, etc., to establish his image and build his power base. Because of this, there is the possibility that conflict will occur with the writings of Kim Il-song over the quotation issue. Such problems in the establishment of a relationship between them will have to be resolved by classifying the two series of writings by time period. Kim Il-song's writings will be limited to the period before the advent of Kim Chong-il. Kim Chong-il's writings will be used for the period after he came on the stage. Since it is asserted that Kim Chong-il was already the successor in 1974, it is predicted that quotation of his writings published after 1974 will increase. For the present, however, since there are no Kim Chong-il writings before 1960, for this time at least, NK will have no choice but to depend on the writings of Kim Il-song. Thus, from a long-term standpoint, NK will have to unify the quotation issue by classifying the works of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il using 1960 or 1974 as a standard.
