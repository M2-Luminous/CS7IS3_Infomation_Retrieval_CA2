In the New Moscow Declaration, Russia will actively support our view on the North Korean nuclear issue, and reveal that it fully supports efforts to bring about peace on the Korean peninsula. It seems that a passage stating that all matters of concern and interest between the two countries will be closely maintained by dialogue and another one on readjusting the past history, such as the Korean Air shooting incident, will be included in the declaration. It will also include the human rights issue such as that of the North Korean loggers. This kind of joint declaration was not made when President Kim visited China and Japan. It is believed that this declaration has greater weight than the regular joint statements that sum up the results of summits. A diplomatic source said that a consultative protocol, which provides for the foreign ministers and vice foreign ministers to meet regularly, will be exchanged during President Kim's visit to Russia. It also revealed that an agreement on preventing maritime accidents, an environment cooperative agreement, and an agreement to protect migratory birds will be signed.
