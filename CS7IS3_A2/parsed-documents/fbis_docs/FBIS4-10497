This time through the disclosure in Washington of a report on Peruvian justice prepared by a commission of international jurists sponsored by the U.S. State Department. This reported was widely covered by the international media. An AFP report, for example, disseminated throughout the world states that according to that commission, "the reorganization of the Peruvian judicial branch carried out by President Alberto Fujimori since his self-inflicted coup has seriously eroded, if not eliminated, the independence of this branch in Peru." The report urges Peru "to eliminate anonymous judges, define with precision what the crime of betrayal of the fatherland entails, and review the decree law against terrorism." The damage this information causes Peru is obvious, especially taking into account that it does not reflect reality. It is no secret that the Peruvian judicial branch currently is undergoing a deep-rooted reform, ranging from the appointment--not by the executive branch but by the Disciplinary Board for Magistrates, which enjoys consensus--of worthy and capable judges to an efficient and modern administration of the institution and the implementation of new modern procedural codes. For the first time in the republican history of Peru, our Supreme Court members are selected after passing difficult tests and not due to political influences. These judges enjoy full independence because they owe nobody in the executive branch or Congress, except their own ability, for their posts. But neither the commission of jurists nor the State Department ever mentions this fact. To ignore this, especially under the circumstances Peru has experienced, represents a lie. The antiterrorist laws--harsh and of a summary nature in the beginning--have made it possible to severely punish terrorists who in the past almost always were freed, and at the same time give them a chance to repent. This formula has been an effective legal and psychological tool in the struggle against terrorism, which by far is the main threat not only to human rights, but also to the survival of the Peruvian nation. Moreover, these laws have become more flexible through the implementation of other measures approved last year before these pure and immaculate jurists finished their report. These laws will be made more flexible in a gradual and prudent manner. The Peruvian citizenry is not willing to run any risks.... Therefore, what is the U.S. State Department's purpose in giving the world a distorted image of Peru? Why isn't Peru judged the same way as countries such as the PRC and Mexico, whose judicial and electoral institutions are indeed pinpointed by the executive branch? The parameters used for Peru are so different and so shockingly incapable of taking into account--for many obvious reasons--the same considerations given other countries, that one wonders whether what really bothers the U.S. State Department is the fact that the Peruvian president is of Japanese descent and may thus represent, in the nightmares of U.S. officials, the spearhead of Japanese economic power pointing toward Brazil, where the largest Japanese colony in America resides and from where the soybean that the all of Asia consumes comes. If this were the case, which we believe is not, the State Department should say it aloud. It is no secret that during World War II niseis were persecuted in Peru with the support of the local authorities that ruled at that time and under the sponsorship of the also Democratic Washington administration at that time. We wonder whether the commercial war that is about to unleashed between these two powers also will be fought over our heads? Peru now is proud to have, in the midst of its poverty and most serious domestic decay, given intelligent and successful answers to win the internal war that already has resulted in so many deaths. Therefore, the fact that the State Department sponsors the international dissemination of a deceitful, superficial, and slanderous report drafted by four jurists, as the justice minister has rightly stated, after a stay of only three days in our country represents a lack of respect for our country.
