In a closed seminar marking the inauguration of the Atomic Energy Control Center held at the Plaza Hotel in Seoul on 24 June, Professor Kim Pyong-ku, chief of the reactor development team of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, noted that because the coating material Magnox is apt to erode in water, long-term preservation of Magnox-coated nuclear fuel in water -- North Korea uses this method -- may result in a leakage of radiation. He expressed his concerns about the problem as North Korea cannot but help reprocess the nuclear fuel rods within two years, and insisted that those nuclear fuel rods must be resealed and kept dry permanently or must be disposed of for good all under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
