He made these remarks at a recent rural Shanghai work meeting. Huang Ju said that in Shanghai's urban agricultural development, it is particularly important to pay attention to the "vegetable basket project" with emphasis being placed on growing green vegetables. According to him, the new project has the following major contents: While ensuring 150,000 mu of year-round vegetable crops, an additional investment of 250 million yuan shall be made to increase the area of greenhouse cultivation to 25,000 mu in three years and to bring the area of landscaping garden cultivation [as received] up to 15 to 20 percent of the total area of vegetable crops. The planned year-round vegetable and nonstaple food bases shall remain unchanged for 10 to 15 years. Huang Ju emphasized the need to seek new operational mechanisms for vegetable and nonstaple food production and marketing. He said that with the new mechanisms, the state-run food market should play the major role of stabilizing market prices while organizing and encouraging peasants to participate in commodity circulation. More and more importance is being attached to the urbanization of Shanghai's rural areas. Huang Ju told the meeting that Shanghai's suburban areas will be turned into "second-class cities" step by step over the next two or three years. He said: This concept means that the urbanization of Shanghai's rural areas will be greatly accelerated. An important precondition for the urbanization is to do a good, high-standard job of regional planning. The "second-class cities" should be accompanied by a number of urban centers, each with a population of 200,000 or so. In terms of planning, the urban centers should meet the standards of modern cities, and their building plans should include industrial-district construction, infrastructure construction, and the development of tertiary industry. In conclusion, Huang Ju said that Shanghai's suburban areas should make efforts to further deepen reforms and strive to make new breakthroughs this year. He pointed out several tasks: to actively carry out experiments on modern enterprises, to strive to establish 1,000 new cooperative shareholding companies this year, and to have 100 townships and towns complete inventories of their collective assets; to actively explore a new production and marketing system and to build a number of high-standard district markets for agricultural products; and to carry out an experimental reform of the agricultural land-use system and to separate ownership from the right to sign contracts and the right to manage.
