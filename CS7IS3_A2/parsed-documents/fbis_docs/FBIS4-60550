Shamir said these gestures should primarily include Israeli sanction of some sort of Palestinian national foothold in East Jerusalem. "I do not believe the Palestinians can be brought to end the conflict with us entirely unless they have a collective foothold in East Jerusalem," Shamir said. He added that the foothold could be in the form of national institutions, a functional partition of the united city, or the like. Unless the Palestinians are given some foothold in East Jerusalem, the Muslim world will declare a holy war (jihad) for the liberation of Israeli-held holy Muslim sites in Jerusalem, Prof. Shamir warned. He argued that granting the Palestinians some kind of dominion in East Jerusalem is one of the steps the Israeli Government must take to give the Palestinians a sense of having achieved a just arrangement attaining at least some of their national goals. Otherwise, the agreements which the Israeli Government and the Palestinians have signed or are expected to sign will be unstable and short lived. In the framework of these steps, Prof. Shamir said, the Government of Israel will have to accede to several other Palestinian demands: to withdraw from most of the West Bank and Gaza without leaving large settlement enclaves behind; to recognize in principle the diaspora Palestinians' right of return to the West Bank and Gaza territories in which a Palestinian entity will be eventually established; to permit the Palestinians to enjoy a sense of temporary sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza before they forge a confederative alliance with Jordan. Prof. Shamir said that these terms are difficult for Israel, but unless they are met, the conflict between us and the Palestinians will continue and become more extreme because in the meantime, the Palestinians will have acquired a political foothold in the territories, including security forces and a police, as well as international recognition as an "incipient state." Prof. Shamir said that in general, the present time offers Israel, the Arab states, and the Palestinians a genuine opportunity to reach peace agreements. The opportunity stems from the changes the Arab world has undergone in the last decade, the most prominent of which is the supportive approach of new technocratic pro-West elites, which seek to end the Israeli-Arab conflict in a bid to build a stable Middle East in which economic activities can be safely conducted. Yet the prospects of turning this opportunity into reality largely depends on the parties' willingness to pay the necessary price. Reserve Major General Shlomo Gazit said in his lecture that in his opinion, nuclear weapons will be introduced to the Arab Middle East in the near future. He asserted that a new strategic environment has emerged in the Middle East facilitating political negotiations and the attainment of peace accords between Israel and the Arabs. This situation evolved in the wake of several global and regional changes over the past few years, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the era of pan-Arab ideology in the region. He argued that the sides -- Israel and the Arabs -- should hurry to achieve peace arrangements lest the congenial strategic environment change again. Unless political arrangements are achieved soon, the militant Islamic stream may grow and possibly come to power and form the leadership of some Arab countries and in the Palestinian public. If that happens, the conflict will evolve into confrontation between Judaism and Islam and become far more radical. Gazit warned that a recurrence of the Hebron massacre at holy Muslim sites in East Jerusalem would provoke a jihad against Israel. According to him, the peace accords will on the one hand lower the Arabs' motivation to launch war, but on the other hand, the Arabs may be tempted to launch a surprise attack in the wake of the expected Israeli withdrawal from a considerable part of the territories. Gazit maintained that such a threat can be thwarted by reliable security arrangements that will strengthen, rather than weaken Israel following withdrawal. Prof. Shamir and Gen. Gazit made these observations during the annual symposium held by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University in memory of former Chief of Staff David El'azar.
