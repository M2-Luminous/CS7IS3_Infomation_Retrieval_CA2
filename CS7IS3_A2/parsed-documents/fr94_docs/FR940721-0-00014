SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62563), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The NPR proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on November 12, 1992. The revision included revisions to 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions, section 121.1 Definitions, and the additions of section 126.1 Oxygenate Content of Gasoline to 25 PA Code Chapter 126, Standards for Motor Fuels. These regulatory revisions were adopted by the Commonwealth on June 16, 1992 and became effective on August 29, 1992. On February 16, 1993, an amendment to the November 12, 1992 SIP revision was officially submitted to EPA. The amendment corrected a typographical error in 25 PA Code Chapter 121, section 121.1 in the definition of ``oxygenated gasoline''. The corrected version of the definition was effective on October 24, 1992. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal was prepared as part of the NPR action and is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) dated June 15, 1993, which is available from the Region III office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Public comments were received from one group on the NPR. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) submitted comments on December 29, 1993 which related to the attest engagement 1 requirements. A copy of the AICPA's comments can be found in the Pennsylvania oxygenated gasoline program SIP docket file which is available from the Region III office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. 1 Attestation engagements are performed by a certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants. Attestation engagements are a review of the regulated parties records to assure accuracy. It serves as a means of improving compliance with the oxygenated gasoline program by identifying problem areas to the regulated parties. The AICPA had four comments on the NPR which are summarized as follows: (1) The Pennsylvania regulations require the attest engagement report to be submitted within 60 days following the end of the control period and AICPA suggested that the filing deadline be extended to 120 days to be consistent with EPA guidelines; (2) Pennsylvania regulations require attest engagements for both averaging and per gallon information, AICPA believes this is inconsistent with EPA guidelines;
