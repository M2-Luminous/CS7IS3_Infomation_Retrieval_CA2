Kvasov, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North America Department: "Russian-American Economic Relations Geared toward Era of Open Markets"] [Text] Russian-American relations occupy a special place in the multipolar geometry of the world that has taken shape since the end of the Cold War. Looming larger and embracing more and more new spheres, economic collaboration between Russia and the United States has become a direct or indirect subject of discussion in our country. Discarding all the accretions, the main question here is: Why do we need economic relations with the United States? What is their role in Russian foreign economic policy? Objective analysis of the world economy and the trends in technical progress indicates that for the commercial development of the most advanced achievements -- "the technologies of tomorrow" -- which Russian science and in part the defense industry possess we cannot do without the American market. In the 20th Century no country, not even Japan, has been able to establish a major technical innovation of any description without passing the test of the American market. That market, by virtue of its readiness to accept any innovation and its unsurpassed size, can also serve as a springboard for Russian enterprises. Our economic collaboration will require more favorable conditions if this plan is to be realized. Russian-U.S. trade and economic ties have for many decades been subordinated to a considerable extent to considerations of a political nature. From this standpoint the meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in Vancouver in April 1993, which initiated the development of partnership relations between our countries, was a landmark. Even outwardly it was unusual in that for the first time discussion of economic problems took up a large part of the presidents' time. It was there that mutual understanding was achieved for the first time that the most effective way to help the Russian reforms is to give us the chance to earn the requisite foreign currency ourselves. The creation of an intergovernmental commission under the leadership of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore was an important decision made at the Vancouver summit. The commission was essentially charged with the task of "depoliticizing" trade and economic relations between our countries and rendering them such that they promote the development of Russian-American partnership. The commission's mandate is to remove all possible obstacles as quickly as possible and to launch specific bilateral cooperation projects, first and foremost in promising areas like power generation, including nuclear power generation, outer space, and other hi-tech sectors of the economy. The first session of the Russian-American Commission for Economic and Technical Cooperation was held in Washington at the start of September 1993. During the meeting a broader remit for the commission was agreed and an appropriate structure of working bodies, including committees for the development of business cooperation, energy policy, the conversion of the defense industry, outer space, the environment, and science and technology, was set up. The opening up of the American and world markets to Russian space equipment, technology, and services was the chief result of the committee's first session. Thus, under an agreement on commercial launches, Russia was granted a quota of 12 launches of spacecraft into orbit in the period 1996-2000, which could provide our aerospace enterprises with contracts worth up to $700 million. There was no issue, no problem, which Bill did not rush to tackle. Against the backdrop of his obsession with detail -- which prompted many political pundits to compare the President to a "head clerk" but not a leader -- Hillary, embarking on working out a strategy to reform medical insurance and the health care system in general, looked like someone who was really busy. An abrupt change came almost immediately after he went on vacation in August and spent an uninterrupted three weeks not only relaxing and taking it easy, but thinking about whether he was organizing his presidential life properly. As the well-informed UPI noted at the time, "the President has clearly taken a big step forward in ditching his devotion to detail and getting a clearer idea of where he wants to take the country." The switch to strategic goals does not mean, however, that smaller-scale problems have been totally removed from the President's attention, or that even when decrees and proclamations carry a computer-printed signature rather than that of Clinton himself, these decrees and proclamations are almost automatic candidates for revision, review, and repeal. I do not recall a single instance either in the Clinton presidency or during the Bush and Reagan era when a document in the name of the White House incumbent was repealed, altered, or simply ignored the next day. Indisputably, the President's staff deserves a great deal of credit in organizing this stability. And the fact that Clinton's guys -- whose average age is nearly 30, who are mostly provincial products of Arkansas, and whose experience in government is virtually zero -- have managed to avoid situations that are ever-present here in Russia is, of course, the result of the Americans' different political and administrative traditions. Starting with the Gorbachev era, high-ranking Kremlin groups -- led as a rule by the heads of presidential administrations or secretariats -- have been regularly sent to Washington for "proficiency enhancement" courses. Sergey Filatov recently visited their White House. The results of these trips are almost invisible. If the American experience had indeed been productive, the Kremlin would not have made frankly controversial and politically explosive decisions such as the decision not to allow the new Russian parliament into Moscow's White House. Even a 30-year-old rookie staffer from Arkansas would realize on joining the presidential staff that this kind of decision had to be avoided at all costs. It is an axiom of American political life and the basis of political stability that Congress must not be offended or humiliated. You can argue, shout till you're blue in the face, bang your fist, or even -- like Khrushchev -- your shoe, but in no circumstances must you wound, even by allusion, its comfortable sense of its own dignity and prestige. Alongside the meetings which Clinton will hold in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin and which will be interspersed only infrequently with relaxation (such as a nice tour of a chocolate factory or a kind of TV discussion between the U.S. President and Russian citizens invited to "Ostankino") I would include on the Moscow visit agenda -- apart from the mandatory and longstanding disarmament, economic, and trade issues -- the question of what should be done and in what way to parliament when it becomes recalcitrant or simply unattractive because of its actions. I think that Clinton could tell us a lot, both from his gubernatorial practice in Arkansas and from his presidential experience. By hook or by crook he has achieved and is achieving ratification of bills in which his administration has an interest and which Congress initially met without raucous acclaim or even mere condescending approbation. But, in general, if I were drawing up the program for Clinton's Moscow visit, I would expand the informal side of it as much as possible -- the U.S. President is a passed master at glad-handing, and has appeared far more often on the streets of Washington and other American towns and cities than many of his predecessors (or, to be blunt, more often than the Russian president has appeared on Russian streets of late). Bill Clinton first visited this country almost 25 years ago. He came to Moscow as a tourist from Oxford, where he was then studying. That trip played a lot on his nerves during the election campaign -- Republican opponents charged that in that far-off era it was impossible for ordinary people to visit Moscow, and that if they did, it was only with the knowledge, approval, and, consequently, complete control of the secret police. Now that Bill Clinton is coming again, the secret police as such no longer officially exists -- it is in the process of a prolonged reorganization. Have no worries about coming, Mr. President.
