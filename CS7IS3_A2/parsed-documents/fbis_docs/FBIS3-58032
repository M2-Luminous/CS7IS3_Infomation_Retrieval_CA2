An eagerly-awaited announcement on the future of the 1.8 billion pound state-backed scheme was unexpectedly postponed because of a split that could destroy the four-party coalition. The Centre Party, which opposes the project on environmental grounds, has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the coalition and bring down the government unless the plans are shelved. As several hundred antibridge demonstrators gathered outside the Swedish cabinet offices in Stockholm, Olof Johansson, the leader of the Centre Party and environment minister, held firm to his demand that the project should be dropped. Forced uncharacteristically on to the defensive, the prime minister, Carl Bildt, denied that the government was in crisis and rejected allegations that he was ready to horse-trade. Mr. Bildt said ministers needed more time to study the implications of the "very controversial" bridge. A decision is not expected for another week. Mr. Bildt acknowledged the Centre Party's opposition to the plans but said Sweden intended to respect an agreement signed with Denmark in 1991 to build a combined bridge and tunnel link across the Oresund Strait between Malmo and Copenhagen. "It is a principle of this government to respect the agreement with Denmark and carry out a tough environmental assessment," Mr. Bildt said. Mr. Bildt said the cabinet's views on the project and those of Mr. Johansson did not vary widely. "We are close to each other when it comes to the question of the Oresund bridge," he said. But the prime minister admitted there was "certain tension." He said the cabinet still needed to collect more material on public transport and air and water pollution. Should the Centre Party choose to leave the government, the coalition would be dissolved and the speaker would appoint a prime minister, probably Mr. Bildt, to set up a new government. Bertil Fiskesjo, a Centre Party member, said the party would stay in the government as long as certain conditions are met. "Our chances of influencing the continued assessment and development of the bridge would decrease if we left," he said. Rigorous environmental evaluations have indicated that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to build the bridge without disturbing the environment in the strait. The Centre Party, which has strong agrarian roots, believes any bridge will damage the environment above and below ground and impede salt water currents from the North Sea which replenish the Baltic's brackish waters. The salt-water flows are vital to the health of marine life in the Baltic. A panel of international marine experts hired recently by the Swedish government to investigate the plan's implications could give no guarantee that a bridge would not block the currents. "It is impossible to give guarantees for a zero solution (no environmental impact) on the water flow," a scientist on the committee told a Danish newspaper yesterday. Bridge opponents also assert that it will increase traffic emissions and make nonsense of Sweden and Denmark's commitment at the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1991 to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Ecologists believe the construction of a bridge across the Oresund Strait will damage the marine environment in an area well-known for its seabirds, seals and fish. But Claus Nowotny, of Swedab, the parent company behind the bridge consortium, said the plan was being used as an environmental whipping post. "It has become a kind of symbol for a concrete, car-oriented and large-scale society," he said. The combined bridge and tunnel connecting Copenhagen and Malmo would be the first physical link between Sweden and Denmark and is seen by both countries as an important emblem of their determination to boost trade in the Scandinavian and Baltic region. Backers of the project say it would cut transport costs and help tie Sweden more firmly to the European continent. After two centuries of remaining on the side lines in Europe, Sweden has applied to join the European Union. If Sweden pulls out, Denmark has threatened to take legal action. The continual wrangling over the project has strained diplomatic relations. Construction is scheduled to begin this autumn and work to be completed by mid-1999. On the Danish side, more than 200 houses have already been demolished to make way for entry roads. The Danish government has already spent 100 million pounds on a motorway connection between Copenhagen and the site of the bridge.
