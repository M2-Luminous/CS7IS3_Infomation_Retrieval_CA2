FBIS3-8396 "dreeu046__a94011" FBIS-EEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Hungary Dissolution of Far-Right Party Proposed AU0703175094 Budapest MTI in English 1029 GMT 7 Mar 94 AU0703175094 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 7 March (MTI) -- The Budapest Chief Public Prosecutor's Office proposed in a civil lawsuit starting last Friday [4 March] that the Budapest Metropolitan Court dissolve the far-right World National Popular Rule Party (VNP). According to the prosecutorial complaint, read out by Judge Mrs Csiky Julianna Szobacsi, the party's aims and deeds sharply violate constitutional provisions related to human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to human dignity, minority rights, the equality of citizens, and the freedom of learning. The party proposes university applicants should state their nationality, with Gypsies and Jews to be admitted according to their numerical proportion, in addition to ability. In its monthly, MAGYAR TUDAT (HUNGARIAN CONSCIOUSNESS), published on November 16, 1993, the VNP (registered on October 11, 1993) published an article entitled "Justice to Ferenc Szalasi", making the fascist takover in Hungary appear as a heroic deed. Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946), leader of the Hungarian fascist (Arrow-Cross) party, seized power on October 15, 1944 with Hitler's help and introduced a reign of terror to the country. He was condemned to death by the Hungarian people's court and executed as a war-criminal. At a meeting in Budapest's 13rd district on January 18, 1994, VNP activists incited hatred against Jews and Gypsies living in Hungary. The police investigated the case as representing a crime of incitement against a community and recently sent related documents and an accusation proposal to the court. Party Chairman Albert Szabo and his defender asked the court to dismiss the prosecution's complaint as unfounded and denied the charge of unconstitutional party operations. Szabo pointed out that newspaper reports on the VNP's January 18 meeting distorted the facts because they are not racists but would like to replace predatory capitalism by socialism based on national ideas. The trial will continue on April 13.
