FR941222-1-00015 FR941222-1-00007 2. Proposed Apportionment of Reserves to DAP Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the ``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date (§672.20(a)(2)(ii)). Consistent with §672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is proposing to apportion the 1995 reserves for each of the four species categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets for these species and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts so specified. Specifications of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves. 3. Proposed Apportionment of the Sablefish TACs to Users of Hook-and-Line and Trawl Gear Under §672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments of the proposed 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears.

Proposed Apportionments of Pollock TAC In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore components. Regulations at §672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. Regulations at §672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned 100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined during the fishing year. The proposed distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.
