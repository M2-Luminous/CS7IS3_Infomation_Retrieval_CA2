To be more precise, the extent to which the policy, which Vranislav Sinadinovski interpreted for us in an original manner, would have been carried out. And considering that the VMRO-DPMNE, or its shadow minister, in his media debut is already predicting a victory in the forthcoming election, I think that it is essential for us to analyze its positions and priorities with respect to the foreign policy that Macedonia will conduct if the most nationalistic and populist opposition wins. First of all, Sinadinovski said that "his party is the only one that has a platform about the conduct of foreign policy," and he personally had offered to rent an auditorium to read his book, which was not written by chance. Of course, the gentleman continued, "the government did not want to make good use of that platform," nor, by analogy, of his book. And just what is it that should be "made good use of" if not what he intended to read, which appears to be the following: When it was ascertained (by the untried minister or the VMRO-DPMNE) that "the current foreign policy is not scientifically planned," mainly because of "the lack of preparations by the government to organize a hearing for a critical analysis of foreign policy," and it is still "pro-Yugoslav," "in fact, it is not pro-Yugoslav, but has long been its slave," and "Yugoslavia is, for practical purposes, dead, and there is no chance for its revival"; the shadow minister also promoted his scientifically based foreign policy, saying: "The VMRO-DPMNE has prescribed the pursuit of an independent foreign policy." Immediately after that came a public acknowledgment that he is a realist and pragmatist, and then he suggested that "Macedonia should make itself into a true friend of the only remaining world superpower and some European superpowers" (?!). Afterwards, in a scientifically based way, he said that, "the VMRO-DPMNE clearly and firmly strives for a reconciliation with neighboring countries," and, to avoid ambiguity, he criticized the current government for being "insufficiently active with respect to strengthening relation with Greece and Serbia," and indeed, the government does not make good use of the opportunities to provide good services to those who recognize us, such as, for example, Bulgaria. What [he refers to here] corresponds well to the affronted feelings on the part of official Bulgaria (implied at the Bulgarian minister of defense's appearance at the assembly of the European Union's military alliance, where he said that, "Macedonia conducts a policy that is not exactly well-disposed toward Bulgaria"), but it [his criticism] is not [in keeping] with our policy, which has been endorsed in the Assembly, of [keeping] all four neighbors at an equal distance, a policy that guarantees life for us. The following is an analysis of the policy that a VMRO-DPMNE government would conduct with respect to international recognition and the definition of the status and the role of our country in the Balkans and in the world, beginning by establishing that "the government lied to the people when it said that Macedonia was a recognized state," when, in fact, he [probably President Gligorov], as a career diplomat, "knows that the establishment of relations at the level of consulates is not recognition," as was at first cited concerning the twelve European countries. Now, I am a little uncertain, perhaps because I am not privy to diplomatic secrets, but according to my own logic, that could also mean that Bulgaria and Russia did not recognize us because they have not opened any missions here as embassies, but that does not stop any criticism directed at the current government because it did not exploit possibilities to support itself more firmly through friendship with those countries in the representation of Macedonia's interests globally. In fact, the finding mentioned previously dovetails in no way with the preliminary disclosure by the same gentleman that: "Macedonia is recognized by many countries, and that fact should be exploited in the strengthening of the weak international position of our country." But my logic is obviously not scientifically based, and perhaps because of that, I did not succeed in understanding the following statement: namely, since it was already established that, "the government lied to the people about the external [situation]," what could be said about the domestic one? Sinadinovski reveals yet another ruse: "I beg you, to whom is the government lying when it says over and over again that Macedonia will get $230 million in financial aid?" Indeed, to whom is the government lying? Again, I think that it concerns the possible IMF credit, which is dependent upon Macedonia having its macroeconomic program for the coming year. The conditions in order for the money to be obtained are the introduction of certain laws for which the Assembly is responsible. And in the Assembly, the VMRO-DPMNE is also sitting, and God knows, independent, nationalist, and scientifically based. And Mr. Sinadinovski, as a man in the shadow [government], who says what he says in connection with that (he unveils the government's falsehood to the people), really should anticipate that that deceitfulness will be cruelly repudiated. Well, let it cost what it may, I mean "by the people, that is, the citizens who live in Macedonia," as defined by the new constitution according to Sinadinovski. However, on that occasion, the minister in the corpulent opposition shadow [government] brought in his "scientifically based opinions" with which he and his party would solve the problems with the immediate neighborhood and would raise [the level] of goodneighborly relations as soon as it wins the election. At the same time, it is said that they would penetrate the Balkans, or since, as they put it, "Macedonia's place and status in the new European construction should be defined." I must admit that I concentrated a little more here to listen to the alternative recipe for success, when it appeared that: "The goodneighborly relations with Greece and the greater initiative of the future Macedonian foreign policy, for example, will be raised in a way in which there will be no discussions about the name, the flag, and so forth." As if neither he nor his party knew that the problem with Greece is precisely the current foreign and domestic policy of Macedonia, which considers everything, but does not accept changing. As to Greece, Mr. Sinadinovski is getting ready "to present Greece with the problem of the Macedonian minority which lives in Greece." Thus, a nice shortcut. The Greeks could hardly wait for us to turn to them, but everything was already decided, and Greece was almost ready to sit down with the Macedonians to talk about the Macedonian minority, when it does not admit that it has a minority, and still less does it recognize that there is a Republic of Macedonia on its northern border. Actually, Sinadinovski, as a "real" politician, and above all, a "pragmatist," understood that the current Greek policy should be to respond by doing the same thing in Macedonia. What guarantee will lead to improving neighborly relations and to stabilizing the Balkans and exactly define the place of Macedonia in the future European structure? However, I live in hope that Mr. Sinadinovski will re-examine this theory, this time bearing in mind the fact that such a "scientifically based foreign policy" in the Greek, Serbian, and other Balkan cases, produces lethal results. Unless the world's information [sources] are lying .... Finally, in the name of the shadow government, its minister for relations with foreign countries convinced us that Macedonia did not have to enter the United Nations under the conditions it did. To the question from the journalist -- "What would have happened to Macedonia if it had stayed outside the mainstream of the world organizations" -- came the following answer: "And what did it gain by entering?" Well, you see, if it is not clear to a potential minister even after several months what all Macedonia gained with its admission to the UN (it was entirely clear to Greece) and with a thesis that "Macedonia must act more aggressively in the world," then shouldn't I come to the conclusion that the motherland requires that the gentleman in question be in foreign policy and on the political scene in general? With one reservation: that perhaps the foreign policy of this party can be understood as a street event, a meeting, a flag, and a song, and in this case, the above-mentioned [position] would be entirely logical.
