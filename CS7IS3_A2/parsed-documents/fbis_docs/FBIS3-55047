If one or all of the culprits is found guilty by that court, the execution of the sentence should be carried out by Moldova. Radio Rossii, which broadcast the news, mentioned that the Tiraspol authorities favor the CSCE suggestion, provided that Russia, a country that enjoys the confidence of the Dniester leaders, should vouch for the independence of the court. The CSCE Mission in Moldova has also warned against the perils of using the Ilascu case for political purposes. A commentary broadcast last night by BBC cites, among other things, a statement by Mr. Pavel Barbalat, the chairman of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, that he had not been briefed on the CSCE recommendations and that the Moldovan party would refuse such a formula. In this way [Dniester leader Grigore] Maracuta, Mr. Barbalat assessed, merely wishes to have the legality of his office confirmed, although he had assumed that office arbitrarily. The sole solution to the problem would be the unconditional transfer of the prisoners from Tiraspol to Chisinau, as otherwise there are no guarantees that in the future other separatist forces would not stage a new trial and then ask for a three-party trial of the case. Also according to the BBC, Mr. Dumitru Postovan, the chief prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, has also stated in turn that he has no knowledge about any such suggestion by the CSCE Mission.
