Sha'th said that for all intents and purposes both parties have already agreed on most of the issues: the timetable for the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal; the size of the Palestinian police force; security along the borders, on the roads, and inside the territories; and a safe passageway between the Gaza Strip and Jericho. In an interview with our correspondent Moti Amir, Nabil Sha'th said that there were still disagreements on the issues of Jericho and the border crossings, on the security zones around the settlements, and also with regard to the division of responsibilities between the Palestinian towns and the Jewish settlements on matters of mutual concern. As for the crisis in the Cairo talks, Sha'th says the whole affair was an unnecessary furor caused by premature announcements. Sha'th said that if the crisis had been put off for another week, the Palestinian and Israeli teams might have signed the agreement that they had already almost completed.
