FR940304-1-00177 FR940304-1-00014 Many of these issues are not unique to this proposed rule and some, such as discount rates and modifications of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturer Impact Model, have been raised in previous DOE public notice under the appliance conservation standards program or by public comments on these notices. Those issues and the possible expansion of DOE's economic analysis in several areas were raised in DOE's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Three Types of Consumer Products, published on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47326). DOE hopes that its conclusions in these areas for this rulemaking will serve as the basis for the development and promulgation of future appliance conservation standards, unless comments in future rulemakings make a persuasive case to the contrary.
