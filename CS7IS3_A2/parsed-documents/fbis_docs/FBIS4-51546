The agreement was made at an emergency meeting of ministers in charge of economic issues, held in the evening of the same day after the U.S. currency plunged to a record low 100.65 yen at one stage in New York on Friday after opening at 100.80 yen, lower than the former record of 100.85 yen Aug. 17, 1993. The U.S. currency recovered slightly to end the Friday trading at 101.55-65 yen, up from Thursday's late quote of 101.35-45 yen in the wake of repeated dollar-buying intervention by the Federal Reserve Board. The cabinet members concurred that Japan will take "appropriate measures at a right time" in a concerted action with the Group of Seven (G-7) nations including the United States to avoid volatile foreign exchange movements, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference after the hurriedly called cabinet gathering. The Bank of Japan will step into the world's currency markets in Hong Kong and Singapore together with New York, Frankfurt and London as the Tokyo market opens only Monday and Friday in the coming week for national holidays between Tuesday and Thursday, a financial industry source said. The source said the intervention volume by the Japanese central bank will swell to billions of dollars one day in the world's foreign exchanges to fight persistent market speculation that Hata's cabinet would fail to take effective and strong steps against the yen's surge because of its fragile political position as a minority coalition. "The yen's strengthening against the dollar above the 100 yen line will give a hard hit on the economy which began to show signs of recovery," the source said. At the emergency cabinet meeting, the ministers also agreed on the need to smoothly carry out a record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package unveiled in February and seek to pass the long- overdue fiscal 1994 national budget through the Diet as quickly as possible, Kumagai said. The top cabinet spokesman said the ministers confirmed that the government should come up with more concrete measures to further open its markets by the end of June on the basis of similar steps announced in March. The hastily arranged meeting brought together Hata, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency, and Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency. Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier Saturday to attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank to be held in Nice, France, from Tuesday through Thursday. The ministers shared the view that the government should spur the nation's sustainable growth led by domestic demand and cope with its massive trade surplus, especially with the United States, Kumagai said.
