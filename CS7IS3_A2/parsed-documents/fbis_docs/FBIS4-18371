The coordinating committee on the unilateral control of exports of high-technology weapons to the former East bloc countries will now be called the New Forum. Its structure has been slightly modified. The decision was made at the two-day conference in Wassenaar near The Hague. The Swiss delegation welcomes this arrangement. Rolf Jeker, a member of the Federal Office for Foreign Economic Affairs (OFAEE), said that this was a reasonable decision as far as security policy is concerned. Some transparency in the export of weapons is a good thing, the Swiss delegation head told ATS. Swiss Membership So far, Switzerland has cooperated with COCOM only on an independent basis. Following the example of Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and New Zealand, it became a fully fledged member of the New Forum, however. Last November, at the first "high-level meeting" [preceding three words in English], COCOM's 17 member countries (Japan, Australia as well as all NATO countries excluding Iceland) acknowledged that the organization had no more reason to exist given the end of the Cold War. At the second meeting in the Netherlands, the members decided definitively to disband it. Interim Period The disbandment of the organization will leave no international convention on military property and dual-purpose items (that also can be used for defense) during the interim period, until October, when the New Forum is set up. During this period the member states will have to reinforce the controls on their national exports. A working group will draw up a new list of products, while another will set up a information exchange system. The New Forum will have to expand as quickly as possible. Russia could be present at the next meeting in October. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are seen as important possible new members.
