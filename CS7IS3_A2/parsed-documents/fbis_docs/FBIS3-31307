Naturally, it is related to the ultimatum against the Bosnian Serbs that was recently adopted. Are the conditions of the ultimatum likely to be fulfilled, or will it become necessary for NATO to embark on its first combat actions since its establishment 45 years ago? If there should be some fighting, how are the military operations going to proceed? Should only air power be involved, or can we expect ground forces to intervene as well? If such an intervention should become necessary, which NATO member countries would agree to send their soldiers to a he Bosnian battlefield from which many would not return alive? The probable refusal of several countries, if not of all the NATO members, to send their boys to certain death would cause irreparable damage to the prestige of the organization, which was most widely propagated as a lever and source of stability in the world after the fall of communism? Is the loss of such prestige not likely to be a death sentence for NATO? With the approach of the ultimatum's deadline, such and other questions are being increasingly frequently asked within NATO's leading circles. It is strange but their answers should have been clear even as early as a few days ago while NATO was deciding what actions to take in Bosnia after the massacre on Sarajevo's market square. This is what a policy based on wisdom, rather than on emotions, should be all about. Let us hope that NATO's policy regarding the events in Bosnia is based on wisdom, rather than on emotions. In the opposite case, not only is NATO's future at stake, but many rather dangerous things are involved, which apply to the Balkan states in particular.
