BULGARIA COMMERCIAL BANKS REPORT 9 BILLION LEVA LOSS IN OCTOBER: According to figures published in the information bulletin of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), commercial banks reported profits of 497 million leva during October, but the banks' balance sheets still showed losses in excess of 9 billion leva, mainly arising from bad loans to loss-making enterprises. The banks' stability continues to the threatened because of the failure to settle the problem of enterprise bad debt, delays in privatization of the banking sector, and the holdup of the structural reform. The recorded losses stem chiefly from financial operations -- the banks' principal activity. Expenditures for wages, insurance, and allowances are also running at a high level, although these make up only a small proportion of the banks' costs. BNB experts are unanimous in declaring that the commercial banks' problems are primarily due to bad loans to enterprises. It is said that, because of this, one state bank will be unable to pay a dividend to shareholders this year.

Shell Bulgaria is a wholly owned subsidiary of the London-based company, Kortenhorst explained. He expects at least another $10 million to be invested here in 1994. So far, none of the invested money has been borrowed from Bulgarian banks. The completion of the first gas station that Shell built in Dragichevo at a cost of $1 million is being now followed by four more stations -- one each in Montana and Asenovgrad and two in Pazardzhik -- all of which are under construction. Shell Bulgaria controls less than 1 percent of the petroleum-products market but aspires to bring this percentage up to 5-30 percent, Kortenhorst said. Kortenhorst is pleased with his main Bulgarian partner Nef tokhim and says that "the Burgas Refinery works well and its products meet our standard requirements."

Its authorized capital is 107.3 million leva, of which 90 percent (98.7 million leva) is held by the Foreign Aid Agency. Balkanbank is the exclusive distributor of loans. The credit center aims to help the land reform through medium- and long-term investment lending to Bulgarian agriculture, its executive director Dimitur Keremidchiyski explains in an article published in the latest issue of the "Capital Press" weekly. Loans to sole farmers range from 40,000 to 180,000 leva, while up to 500,000 leva is lent to cooperatives. The money can be invested in equipment, livestock, construction, and repairs. The center lends at an annual interest rate of 7.9 percent, with a one-year grace period. The maximum term for repayment of the principal is seven years. The sources of financing are the credit center's owned capital and reserves, leva loans from banks and lending institutions at 6 percent annual interest, an anti-inflationary scheme, foreign currency funds borrowed abroad, and funds granted under specialized assistance programs. According to Keremidchiyski, so far the only source of financing has been the center's own share capital. Since the start of 1993, the credit center has opened two credit lines of 107 million leva and 17 million leva each. Shares in the credit center can be held by juristic and physical persons, industrial companies, nonprofit corporations, and so on.

The company documents will be registered at Sofia District Court next week. The Irish partner in the joint enterprise is the Navan company, which will transfer $4 million to the credit of Biokhim to finance its 25-percent share in the venture. The Bulgarian share of the new company consists of long-term assets belonging to the erstwhile Chelopech Limited Company. Navan managed to convince Bulgarian experts of the economic viability of a new process to eliminate arsenic from the gold-bearing ore concentrate produced at the Chelopech mine, and the new venture will install the necessary equipment. The existing mining and ore-concentrating plant, which came into operation in the seventies, is outdated and standing idle at present, but is nonetheless capable of producing and concentrating up to 0.5 million tons of ore annually. Up to two years ago, when work at the mine was suspended, the mine produced 57 percent of Bulgaria's gold output. The mine is estimated to have about 50 million tons of ore reserves, with a content of 47 grams of gold and 120 grams of silver per ton.

(Sofia BTA in English 1640 GMT 28 Nov 93 AU) MINISTRY REPORTS ON MEAT PRICES, LIVESTOCK NUMBERS: In late 1994, Bulgarians will pay 108 leva for a kilogram of pork, Agriculture Ministry experts stated on 1 December. Pork presently costs 80 leva per kilogram, while chicken costs 50 leva. The minimum monthly wage in Bulgaria of 1,400 leva would 18 kg of pork or 28 kg of chicken. Meat prices are rising in line with the annual inflation rate, which, according to the national budget bill, will average 45 percent in 1994, ministry experts said. Demand for meat slackened dramatically in 1993, and state-owned companies reacted by cutting meat output by 43 percent in January-September 1993, as compared with the same period in 1992. The output of chicken meat alone plummeted 63 percent. Lowered domestic demand was the main reason for the decline in animals purchased and in livestock numbers, according to the figures. In January-September 1993, cattle numbers went down by 266,000 head, pigs by 677,000 head, and sheep by 1 million head. The belated land reform and high feed prices were further factors contributing to the livestock decimation. In January-September 1993, meat exports dropped to one-tenth of their 1992 level, while meat imports doubled. Meat purchase prices are expected to lag behind retail prices and will probably go up by no more than 10 percent. The margin between purchase and retail prices tends to widen and this ruins meat producers, while the profits are distributed down the chain of middlemen. Experts expect domestic meat consumption to rise gradually if the economy recovers. The Agriculture Ministry is contemplating measures to encourage meat exports and reduce export taxes on furs, wool, and other products.
