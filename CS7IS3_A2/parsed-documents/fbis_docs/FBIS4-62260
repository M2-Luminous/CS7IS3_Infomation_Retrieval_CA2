Ogorodnikov and V. Kondratyev; from the "Ostankino" newscast] [Text] [Ogorodnikov] The second day of the Russian president's visit to Germany started in the German Government guest house in Petersberg, a Bonn suburb, with meetings with Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party chairman and prime minister of Rhineland-Pfalz, and Johannes Rau, minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia. [Kondratyev] Both politicians aspire to the highest posts in the state. Rau has chances of replacing Richard von Weizsaecker as federal president as early as 23 May and Scharping is aspiring to the post of Helmut Kohl himself in October of this year. This meeting, apart from a discussion of topical political problems, undoubtedly gave the Russian president the opportunity to get better acquainted with the way the mechanism of interrelations between the ruling parties and the opposition functions in a democratic state. [Ogorodnikov] Two hours later Boris Yeltsin and Aleksandr Shokhin held talks with Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian Social Union and federal finance minister. The head of the German Finance Ministry said that the problem of Russian foreign debt was discussed -- it is assessed at 87 billion German marks -- and also the possibilities of changing the mechanism of granting Russia new credits. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin said that an accord has been reached on Germany granting a 500 million [currency not specified] preferential loan for purchasing railway cars from the former GDR. A big question mark hangs over many other projects, inasmuch as Russia does not intend to settle in hard currency or oil and is offering in exchange deliveries of military equipment, in particular MiG-29 fighter aircraft. Officially Bonn's attitude to this an approach is fairly skeptical. The military theme was also discussed in Petersberg today. Defense Minister Grachev stated this in an interview with the Ostankino TV company; he provided a few details of the discussion of the August ceremony between the leaders of the two countries. [Kondratyev] At this point the official part of the stay in Bonn has been completed. A program is beginning which could be described as lightweight. The point is that Helmut Kohl invites those to whom he wants to show his special liking to Rhineland-Pfalz, the region of his birth. There, in a cozy litte restaurant and in the chancellor's private residence, partaking of Kohl's favorite dishes, the statesmen are continuing the conversations begun in Bonn. [Ogorodnikov] These meetings, rare and unusual in West German politics, and the heightened marks of attention must show, not so much, as they put it here, the male friendship between Yeltsin and Kohl as the fact for Russians that Germany regards Yeltsin as the guarantor of market reforms and that warnings alleging that after the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany the German leadership will turn its back on Russia and will not take it seriously are unfounded. Yeltsin himself, in turn, who is in every possible way demonstrating his good relationship with the chancellor, said that he believes in Helmut Kohl, in his honesty and decency. The process of the genuine reconciliation of the two great peoples after the withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces will enter a new era.
