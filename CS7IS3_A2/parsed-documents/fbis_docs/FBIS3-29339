The deputy prime minister, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu today that the decision was taken after consultations with the prime minister, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and other National Front [BN] leaders. Datuk Sri Anwar said there is no way the federal government can cooperate with a PBS-led state government, as its policies and personalities were inconsistent with those adopted by the BN. On the privatization of several key government agencies in Sabah, Datuk Sri Anwar said the process was conducted contrary to the principles and rules of privatization adopted by the federal government. Any project privatized by the federal government is first evaluated by the Economic Planning Unit before it is considered and approved by the cabinet. The interest of the government and the respective states is always safeguarded. In the case of Sabah, privatization is decided by a single person and the interests of Sabah were ignored.
