[passage omitted] In this sermon I have seven or eight issues to which I wish to refer. Time is short, and I will try to refer to them briefly in view of their importance. First, I wish to thank the honorable deputies of the Majles, especially the members of the Judicial Committee of the Majles, for approving the bill concerning the general and revolutionary courts, as well as approving the bill which allows ladies to be employed within the judicial system in advisory positions if they possess the necessary qualifications. As regards the first issue and the bill dealing with general and revolutionary courts, it was the realization of a 10 or 15-year wish. We spent years working on it. Thanks be to God, it was recently approved by the Majles. The Guardian Council has also announced its final approval. The bill has been returned to the Majles and the Majles will, naturally, implement those amendments proposed by the Guardian Council within the next few sessions and will submit it to us for implementation. The new system will make the procedure for court cases much shorter, it will eliminate many shortcomings, will involve direct submission to the judge, and will eliminate many conspiracies and plots which were hatched by the accused during the interval when the case was submitted by the prosecutor's office to the court and all the difficulties it gave rise to. It will also make many savings in time, in human resources and in procedure. This bill has many positive points and a great deal of expert work has been expended on it. [passage omitted] The second issue is a form of praise and gratitude as well as being informative. Our country's honorable tribes have a particular and well known worth and value indicated in their life history, particularly in their defense of the country and its borders. Their pure and sincere beliefs, particularly in some parts of the country, regarding the family of the prophet is sometimes more intense than those of urban dwellers. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, there were, and are, traditions among them which clearly contradict religious and civil law. In our visit to Khuzestan we discussed the issue with senior officials and, thank God, significant steps were taken. I can now announce that there is cooperation among judicial, political, security and religious officials, as well as many people of influence and respect in the Khuzestan Province in the struggle against things contradicting religious and civil law, including the practices of Nahveh [meaning unknown], Fasl [meaning unknown], marriage of exchange [nekah-e sheghar], sharing of blood money [diyeh], and murders committed in the name of honor. It would not be wrong for me to say here that a father or a brother would kill his daughter, would then give himself up and say: I am the owner of blood and satisfied. And that would be the end of that. But we said this was not right. Although the Lord of the Universe has given the right to the owner of blood, it has also given a right to the government. Such practices violate the security of the system and the system can fight such fathers and brothers or cousins, who are mentioned in the prohibition debate. Extensive discussions and many meetings were held locally and in Tehran. Standing here today I can announce the good news that the good Khuzestan tribal leaders, in cooperation with senior officials, have signed pledges which were prepared. The simplest things do not significantly contradict religious law but might violate law and order -- things such as shooting during some of their celebrations. But from our point of view the sensitive issues are regarding obvious acts violating religious law, in particular, murders. There are things contradicting religious law in the division of blood money, judgment, prohibition, marriage of minors and other things. After the awareness of religious leaders influential among the tribes and the tribal leaders, and cooperation among all officials, we reached the point of a obtaining pledge to abandon such things. Should there be any violations, the security, intelligence, political and religious leaders are responsible for the transfer of the matter to the judicial body, and the judiciary is responsible for dealing severely with the matter. There were a couple of minor issues recently which were dealt with severely and which, thank God, have had positive result. I hope the good, pious and brave Khuzestan tribes defending our country are good examples for other tribes in other provinces of the country, and that we will not hear any violations of law among them. But I repeat that should there be any such things, the judiciary will not show the slightest mercy to any authority whatsoever. [audience chants approval] [passage omitted] The atrocities that the Serbs perpetrated in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the methods that international authorities, the United Nations, the Security Council, adopted... [pauses] every day they witnessed new atrocities, but instead of embarking on actions which might stem them, they sometimes gave the green light; they sometimes even gave support. They imagine they can convince public opinion. In reality, it must be pointed out that their recent behavior has dealt the biggest blow to the reputation of the United Nations and the Security Council. That reputation will not be restored so soon. We call on the Islamic Conference Organization to make even more effort than it has already done -- which is praiseworthy, especially the contact group -- and at least get to a point where the sanctions against the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are lifted and the right of defense -- which is a natural right -- is given to them. The people of our country have given much service and assistance. As the exalted leadership -- may God almighty assist and safeguard him -- has said, that is our duty. He even referred to all its aspects. In fairness, the people of Iran have given assistance and they will continue to give their assistance. We are sure that Islam will be victorious. [passage omitted] The compromising accord between 'Arafat and the Zionists is best interpreted in the following way: Two individuals placing their signatures on a piece of paper, accompanied by false ceremonies, in a country which itself is beset by its own internal opponents and severe problems. Inviting several personalities and placing two signatures on a piece of paper in their presence cannot trample on the rights of a nation. Mr 'Arafat is not the Palestinian nation. He cannot do whatever he wishes in the name of the Palestinian nation. We saw that when the accord was signed, a black day was declared; public mourning was declared; there was a call for a strike and the actions of opponents became more severe. We are certain that the combatant, brave, alive and awake people of our Palestine, especially the intifadah, will never be silent in the face of such policies of aliens, and they will continue their struggle until they regain their usurped lands and until rights have been restored to their rightful owners. [audience chants: "God is great," "Death to Israel," "Death to America"] Please allow me; time is short and I have a couple of other topics to talk about and I do not want to keep you too long. South African combatants fought for almost 30 years against an inhumane regime that was senseless, unjust and even antireligious -- apartheid and racism. The combatants overcame a government which ruled that land, aided and abetted by the West, and headed by America. We all heard about Mr. Mandela's victory. [passage omitted] We formally congratulate the people of South Africa and Mr. Mandela and his colleagues on their liberation and independence. We tell them: You are aware that such victories are achieved at a high cost, and naturally they should be well protected. The protection of such victories needs a great deal more work than what was needed for their achievement. We can take advantage of this issue and tell the brave Muslim Palestinian combatants that today is the day of nations; today is the day of the people; today is the day of rallies and the expressing of the peoples' agreement and disagreements. Governments can no longer consolidate their authority through pressure, oppression and agreements and, as I said, signatures on a piece of paper. You see that when our country's struggles become victorious, when various struggles achieve victory in various parts of the world, and recently, the struggles in South Africa achieved victory, then such accords which may be signed should not make you despondent. You should be confident that those who struggle for their rights will sooner or later become victorious. Fortunately, as you are aware, our country has formally announced the re-establishment of relations, relations which were established a few months ago through the African National Congress, and we intend to expand relations between the two countries. Recently a certain European country, which claims to have mature policies -- Britain -- has claimed, as it were, that Iranian security officials had contacts with Irish combatants, that this and that has happened. I am not concerned with what they said. As the official responsible for the country's judiciary I say to Britain's statesmen: If you are telling the truth, or have anything to say, give us your evidence. We will investigate it, and if it is true we will deal with it. Such political moves to poison the political atmosphere between the two countries, and in the region and the world, by relating a couple of false reports, are not worthy of a country which claims to have mature policies. Such actions are not proper. We are waiting to see if you have any proof to show us. I had a few more things to say about the right of veto and other things relating to the judicial system, but since it is late and I have written a few lines in Arabic, with your permission, I will leave them for another time.
