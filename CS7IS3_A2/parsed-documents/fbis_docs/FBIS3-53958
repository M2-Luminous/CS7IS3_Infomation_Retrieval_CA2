[Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January, adds: "Rabin expected al-Asad to give a warmer expression to his desire for peace. The prime minister said he did not want President Clinton to answer in al-Asad's place when asked this question during the Geneva news conference."] Mr. Rabin said that if we fail to reach an agreement with Syria this year the alternative will be political stalemate. Rabin made these remarks in a meeting of the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv this afternoon. Mr. Rabin noted that Israel may agree to a Syrian demand to make progress with it conditional on simultaneous progress with Lebanon, but Israel will under no circumstances agree to any additional linkage. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that referring to the issue of a referendum, Mr. Rabin said that Hafiz al-Asad must convince the Israeli public--just as Egypt's al-Sadat did when he came to Jerusalem. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January adds: "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres this evening said he does not take the reports concerning al-Asad's severe health problems seriously. Mr. Peres said this is not the first time such reports concerning al-Asad's medical state have been aired, only to turn out to be baseless later. This was reported by our correspondent Sefi Hendler."]
