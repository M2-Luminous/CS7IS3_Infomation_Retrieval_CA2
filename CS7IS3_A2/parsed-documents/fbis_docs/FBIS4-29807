Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of the Defense and Security Department's Public Relations and Foreign Relations Bureau, said this to reporters in Jakarta yesterday. Yuswaji said in fact only a small number of U.S. Congressmen had wanted to stop the training program. He added that it does not mean the Defense and Security Department and the Indonesian Armed Forces headquarters will automatically send their officers to Australia, which has close ties in military training programs with Indonesia, though there are several education and training academies there.
