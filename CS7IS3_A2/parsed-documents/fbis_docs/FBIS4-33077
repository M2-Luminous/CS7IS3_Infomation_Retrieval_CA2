The imperialists know that without an army, there is no country, and they daydream of the fabulous possibilities. What they do not know is that long before the Special Period, the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) began working, step by step, on a savings program. They began looking for alternative sources of energy, ways to make more rational and efficient use of resources, and other options for supplying the troops and feeding the population. When other state institutions made plans to operate with 75 percent of their fuel allotments, the FAR planned on 50 percent. When the other institutions went to 50 percent, the FAR began preparing to maintain and even expand their operations at only 25 percent. When there was talk of a possible zero option, the Army that inherited the legacy of heroism from our mambises [Cuban rebels during Spanish domination] and the combatants of the Rebel Army and the underground period did not cringe or panic. It had been preparing for this eventuality for years. Today the results can be seen in Military Unit 1640 of the Eastern Army. Nothing has been left to chance; no one has rested on his laurels. This is the only explanation for the fact that this military unit has continued to fulfill -- even to exceed, in some aspects -- its assigned tasks with just 19 percent of the fuel and 40 percent of the electricity it received in 1989. Reducing the two to their common denominator, this means it has saved 70 percent on energy. And these are not inflated figures; we went to the field and saw it with our own eyes. The innovations include the use of solar heaters, translucent roof tiles, animals for hauling, and biogas; sugarcane husks and residue as sources of energy; emulsion and magnetism in training units and rear-guard services; bicycles in various activities; and wind energy and compressed air technology. All of this has made it possible to maintain a high training capacity and combat readiness with the absolute minimum amount of fuel. This fact merits special mention because of what it means for the country's defense. One of the many examples that back up this assertion can be found in what has come to be known as "Red Bat," a kind of radar adapted to the warlike conditions that the entire nation faces. It used to require 10 trucks and more than eight hours for deployment. Now, after having been remodeled, it requires only three trucks for transportation and it can be set up in just 30 minutes. Moreover, it is even more effective. In addition, when a young sharpshooter demonstrated his excellent skills and was asked about the accessories he used, he explained that they are exclusively designed and manufactured in Cuba. If the imperialists managed to capture those images with their satellites -- and surely they must have because they spend every minute spying on us -- they would be doing those in Miami who still clamor for an armed confrontation with the revolution a great favor by showing them those images. The imperialists also do not know, and are incapable of imagining, how these Military Councils of the Revolutionary Armed Forces take place. Suffice it to say that the nature of these councils was made clear when, at the end of the presentation by the unit commander, the first words of the minister of the FAR were: "Come on and ask some questions. The purpose of the councils is to spark debate." The way the exchange took place and the topics that were discussed also revealed how this institution cuts to the heart of the matter and solves problems. The council lasted 13 hours, and eight of those hours were spent touring sites to observe the actual implementation of the savings program. An important part of the program is aimed at achieving self-sufficiency and feeding the population. And when Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque asked several questions to determine the reliability of the figures cited, various members of the audience (who were attending these meetings for the first time) commented, in typical Cuban style, how "they really take off the gloves and get down to brass tacks" in these councils. During these stormy times of cynicism when some people are so materialistic and shortsighted that they have stopped believing in true values, in these times of collapsing societies, morally destroyed armies, shattered dreams, and forgotten martyrs, what Armed Forces could maintain their operations and even expand them with scarce resources unless they were forces of the people? What Armed Forces could continue to search constantly for formulas that allow them to improve the living conditions and diet of everyone, unless they were forces of the people? What people, unless they were one and the same as the Armed Forces, could continue fighting with such tenacity to maintain the country's -- their country's -- defense capabilities, cognizant of the fact that the day we become incapable of defending ourselves will be the day we will be absorbed, in a second, by the eagle that has been coveting us for more than a century, but not without first staining the soil of the fatherland with the blood of millions of Cubans? The Military Council was not the only extraordinary thing. Even more extraordinary was the realization that, in spite of all the difficulties, the defense of our children's lives and future was guaranteed. The most extraordinary thing has been seeing practical examples of all that we can do to maintain ourselves and to make progress, even during the Special Period. The most extraordinary thing -- not because we have been unaware of the courage of this incredibly extraordinary people, but because of the chance to bear witness to it once again -- has been seeing even more compelling evidence of the conviction that victory lies only with us. Anyone who doubts that should go to Unit 1640.
