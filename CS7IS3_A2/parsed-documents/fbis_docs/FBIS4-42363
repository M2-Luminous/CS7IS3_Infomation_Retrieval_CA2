The military transport planes currently in service in Europe (Transall C-160, Hercules C-130, and Alenia G-222) are aging and no longer have the adequate capacity and flexibility for the military or humanitarian missions which the European armed forces must now fulfill and should be replaced from the year 2003. The Western European Union (WEU), the defense organization which brings together most of the members of the European Union [EU], has commissioned a feasability study which should be completed by the end of the year. The European aeronautical industry, which is very interested in this project, has formed a consortium for this purpose known as Euroflag SRL, based in Rome, in which Deutsche Aerospace (Germany), Aerospatiale (France), Alenia (Italy), British Aerospace (Britain), and Casa (Spain) each have a 20 percent share. Three other companies are associated with the enterprise: Flabel (Belgium), Ogma (Portugal), and Tusas (Turkey). German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed the need to entrust the major part of the development of the projet to the industry which already has the experience of the Airbus civil airplane program. According to DASA [Deutsche Aerospace Airbus], the requirements of the WEU countries are estimated at between 300 and 350 planes which could be delivered from the year 2003 and produced until the year 2015. The firm estimates that between 300 and 400 additional planes could be sold for export. The total development cost is estimated at $6 billion. The construction of the aircraft would make it
