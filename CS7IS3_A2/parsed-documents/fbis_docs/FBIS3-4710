FBIS3-4710 "dreas040_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 South Korea Recent Development in Nuclear Issue Assessed SK2802095794 SK2802095794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular dailies on 28 February carry editorials and articles assessing the recent development in the North Korean nuclear issue in which the United States and North Korea are reported to have agreed on four points: 1) The United States will announce suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise; 2) North Korea will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to inspect its nuclear facilities beginning 1 March; 3) the inter-Korean working contact for the exchange of special envoys will be resumed in Panmunjom; and 4) the United States and North Korea will hold the third round of high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Progress Only on Procedural Matters." The editorial notes: "This progress in the North Korean nuclear issue is only in procedural matters. No real progress has been made. The so-called `full-scope inspection' to which North Korea has committed merely has the significance of including in the inspection `all of' the seven sites, including the five-megawatt nuclear reactor and the radioactive chemical laboratory. The `full scope' inspection entails only one examination to determine if there has been any change in the seven sites since North Korea rejected inspection one year ago. As a matter of fact, this is a very limited inspection. Real progress to ensure North Korean nuclear transparency remains only in our vague expectation that such progress can be explored in the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks." The editorial notes North Korea unwillingly consented to the inter-Korean dialogue for the exchange of special envoys. The editorial notes the ROK Government's irresolute attitude to date in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, apparently out of the desire to induce North Korea to permit nuclear inspections, and stresses that in future talks on tackling the practical problems in talks with North Korea, we should take a tough, clear-cut position to ensure transparency in North Korean nuclear inspections. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Inspection -- This is Only a Beginning." The editorial notes: "Full-fledged negotiations will be begin at the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, which will deal with the issue of IAEA inspection of the two undeclared nuclear sites in Yongbyon." The editorial notes that these two undeclared nuclear sites are the key to the resolution of the nuclear issue, and notes the fact that "the United States failed to put down in writing the resumption of inter-Korean dialogue as a precondition to the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, accepting the North Korean stance that if South Korea proposes the exchange of special envoys, North Korea will hold a working contact in Panmunjom." The editorial continues: "Under this condition, North Korea proudly disclosed that it had agreed with the United States to suspend the Team Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military exercise." The editorial notes that when the inter-Korean contact is made in Panmunjom on 1 March, the South side will be able to find out how serious North Korea is about inter-Korean dialogue and if the South's irresolute position in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue has been appropriate. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Nuclear Issue and the Attitude of the Authorities of North and South Korea." The editorial anticipates little problem in nuclear inspection by the IAEA "as North Korean delegate Ho Chong said that the inspection will be completed smoothly within the set period and the date for the third round of high-level talks is set." The editorial criticizes North Korea for its attempt to exclude South Korea, a direct party concerned in the national reunification and nuclear issues, from the discussion on the nuclear issue. The editorial criticizes that the South Government "looks like a groomsman," as revealed by the ROK's "awkward" announcement on the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise after the United States and North Korea had already adopted the written agreement. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 7 a 500-word article by Yang Sung-hyon entitled "The North Korean-U.S. Negotiation and the ROK-U.S. Joint Cooperation System" from the "Today's Eye" column. The article notes that relevant ROK Government officials feel the result of the U.S.-North Korean contact held in New York fell short of their expectations compared to the enormous efforts and energy of the U.S. and ROK side. The article notes the North Korean disclosure of the U.S.-North Korean agreement on the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise before a ROK announcement and the failure to demand as a precondition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks that meaningful progress is made in inter-Korean dialogue, and reports: "The failure to include this precondition in the U.S.- North Korean written agreement could be a stumbling block in the future in view of the unpredictable North Korean attitude." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 5 an article by Pak Ui-chun entitled "The Inter-Korean Scuffle Over the Interpretation of the 'New York Contact.'" The article notes: "While South Korea claims that it followed through on its position with North Korea that the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys must be made before the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea claimed that the written agreement was adopted because the United States withdrew the unreasonable precondition, hinting that the exchange of special envoys was excluded as a precondition to the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks." The article continues: "The ROK Government explains that the United States did not include the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys in the written agreement because the United States can call off the third round of talks in case the exchange of special envoys is not realized." The editorial concludes: "Although North Korea shows an allergic reaction outwardly to the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, it will probably agree to the exchange of special envoys before 21 March to create an atmosphere favorable for the third round of talks."
