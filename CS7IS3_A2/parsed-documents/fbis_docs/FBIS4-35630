[Al-Mutawakkil] It seems clear that the Yemeni crisis is fabricated, and we have been dragged into it. It seems that there is a plan to drag us -- through the crisis -- into a long war of attrition and civil war. The aims are now clear -- to fragment and exhaust Yemen through this war, which will destroy everything. However, I am optimistic that the Yemenis will realize their interests and the danger surrounding them. This is why the voice of reason has begun to prevail among the brother unionists in the Socialist Party and to respond to the appeal made by brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih urging the repeal of the secession and a return to dialogue. I expect the voice of reason to trimph in the end. And the unionist leaders in the Socialist Party will revoke the secession decision, which amounts to treason. Let us begin a constructive dialogue to spare us falling into the dangers into which we are being dragged. [AL-HAYAH] But you set four conditions for a dialogue with the other side. [Al-Mutawakkil] There are fundamental conditions which cannot be abandoned. And there are conditions which can be discussed. The fundamental conditions concern unity and legitimacy -- two conditions which cannot be abandoned. The brothers in the Socialist Party leadership must realize that we cannot meet together before these two conditions are agreed. I am confident that they are as interested in unity as we are, and we must reach an agreement in this connection. [AL-HAYAH] In your capacity as member of the three-men committee entrusted with opening a dialogue with the other side, what are the results of the contacts being made to open dialogue channels? [Al-Mutawakkil] Although we have not yet reached a clear position regarding contacts between us and unionist leaders in the Socialist Party, I am confident that we will reach a positive result. The important thing is to initiate a dialogue and establish contacts between us now. I am confident that we will reach a positive result. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Do you prefer to reject the Security Council's intervention and its resolution on the crisis, or do you prefer that amendments be introduced to the proposals submitted to the Security Council? [Al-Mutawakkil] We would prefer the United Nations and the Security Council not to deal with the Yemeni issue, because it is an internal issue. Any attempt to deal with it in any way means interference in our internal affairs in one way or another. As far as we are concerned, we do not want the United Nations to deal with our issue. However, if the Security Council must deal with this issue, it has to be within the premise that unity is fixed and incontestable. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Some Arab states talk about the presence of Afghan Arab mujahidin [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan Mojahedin against Soviets], saying their task is to bolster extremist fundamentalist movements, especially in Algeria and Egypt. What is your opinion? [Al-Mutawakkil] I categorically deny the presence of any Arab mujahidin in Yemen. With regard to Islamists, we are all Muslims. As for the presence of Yemeni Islamic political leaders in Yemen, this is legal for them and others. But there are no Arab and Islamic political parties on the scene. Nor is there any consolidation of an Islamic or political tendency as rumored by Yemen's enemies.
