The national conference crowns numerous rounds of talks in the framework of a national dialogue. Various political and social forces took part in this dialogue, except representatives of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] which the National Dialogue Commission had promised to involve in the last round of talks. However, nothing has been revealed yet on the results of the contacts which the Dialogue Commission has held with the FIS. On the eve of the start of the national consensus conference, numerous political parties continue to announce their participation in this conference. Thus the Islamic Society Movement, HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement], has announced its participation. The leader of the movement, Mr. Mahfouz Nahnah, said at a press conference that the participation of his party was aimed at achieving several objectives, one of which was to contribute to the containment of the current crisis. Mr. Mahfouz Nahnah explains these objectives to our colleague Ahmed Khida: [Begin Nahnah recording] The executive bureau of HAMAS movement, which has been appointed by the movement's national consultative council, has decided to take part in the national conference in order to achieve the following objectives: 1. To contribute effectively to the containment of Algeria's stifling crisis. 2. To find suitable and practical formulas which would lead to the legitimacy with the drawing up of an agenda for the next elections. 3. To discuss formulas aimed at tackling the security crisis and find ways to ensure political detente through political means. 4. To expose the conspiracies, the manipulations and the methods aimed at excluding some people, aggravating the crisis and maintaining the status quo in the service of narrow interests, be they the interests of the authorities or those of the parties. Narrow interests are pursued at the expense of the blood of the innocent people, their property, and honor and at the expense of the country's higher interest. [end recording]
