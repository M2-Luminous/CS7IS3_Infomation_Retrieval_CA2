The message was carried to the White House by American evangelist Billy Graham, who visited North Korea from Jan. 27-Feb. 1, according to Chang Chae-ryong, director-general of American affairs. The evangelist had gone to Pyongyang once before, also carrying a verbal message from a U.S. President. Chang was briefed on the message by U.S. Embassy officials in Seoul. The message was not in the form of a personal letter from Kim Il-song to Clinton nor was it written by North Korean officials, according to Chang. Graham simply recorded Kim's reaction to Clinton's verbal message urging an early conclusion to the North Korean nuclear problem and wrote down the message himself, he said. Kim was quoted as noting that he has said in the past North Korea will not develop nuclear weapons and that he wants to improve relations with Washington. Graham added his own personal observations after talks with Kim Il-song which pictured the North Korean leader as being in comparatively "good health." He also noted that Kim was "in charge" of North Korea's relations with the United States, Chang said.
