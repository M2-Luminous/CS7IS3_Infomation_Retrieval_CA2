It is 6 January again -- this time 1994, and again the destiny of this man is at the center of attention of virtually all the local and foreign media. An official delegation lead by Chechen Republic Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev arrived in Tbilisi late last night. According to information we have, the guests intend to investigate all the details connected with Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death -- along with examining a whole range of economic, trade, and other issues. They have also passed on to the head of the Georgian state a request made by the Georgian ex-president's wife Manana to allow the body of her husband to be buried in his homeland. She means the family cemetery in the grounds of the house in Tbilisi that belonged to the ex- president's father. Eduard Shevardnadze has declined this request. However, some sources claim that the funeral could take place in the Gamsakhurdia family home village in western Georgia. It also become known today that Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has issued an official statement in which he indicates that Zviad Gamsakhurdia should be buried in his homeland with all the honors that befit the first president of Georgia. In connection with this, Dudayev appealed to democratic circles of Russia, asking them to put pressure on official Tbilisi. At the same time, the question of whether Gamsakhurdia has really shot himself still remains open. At any rate, a doubt about this version of events was expressed not only by representatives of the special services who, in one way or another, were closely following the ex-president's activities all this time, but also people who were personally close to Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Anyway, the fact remains -- a man whose name was connected at first with the best hopes and aspirations of the Georgian people, and who later was accused of every mortal sin and proclaimed a chief ideologist of provincial fascism and a traitor, is no more. As the saying goes, speak no ill of the dead.
