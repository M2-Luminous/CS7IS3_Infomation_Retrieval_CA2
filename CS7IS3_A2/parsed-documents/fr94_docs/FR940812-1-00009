FR940812-1-00009 FR940812-1-00004 After the initial years, we believe the effect of services on the achievement of economic self-support diminishes significantly. A report, entitled ``Progress Toward Economic Self-Sufficiency Among Southeast Asian Refugees'', prepared for ORR in July 1989 by Dr. Robert L. Bach and Rita Argiros, presented findings, based on an analysis of data from the ORR Annual Survey of Southeast Asian Refugees, which underlined the importance of service interventions in the first few years. Bach and Argiros found that the longer a refugee remains out of the labor force, the less likely he or she is to begin to search for a job or find a job in a subsequent year. The most significant move into the labor force occurs in the first and second years, followed by a steady decline in the probability of entering the labor force for those who delayed their initial job search. We believe it is important, therefore, to target refugee program resources on the provision of comprehensive refugee-specific services to refugees during their first few years of resettlement in order to provide new refugees with the best foundation for economic independence in the future. We believe that after this initial period of special assistance, refugees should be treated like other U.S. residents and have access to the same assistance and service programs that are available to other eligible populations. Thus we propose to limit service eligibility for refugee social services to refugees who have been in the U.S. 36 months (3 years) or less, effective October 1, 1995. Similarly, we propose to limit service eligibility for the targeted assistance program to refugees who have been in the U.S. 60 months (5 years) or less, effective on the same date. The relatively longer eligibility period for targeted assistance clients would provide States more time to assist longer-term cash assistance recipients towards economic self-support and would help to mitigate the impact of large numbers of refugees on localities, while placing a time-limitation on refugee program participation that is consistent with the 5-year U.S. residency requirement for U.S. citizenship. Once refugees become U.S. citizens, they are no longer eligible for services under the refugee program. In regard to the provision of refugee social services and targeted assistance, we believe that States and local entities should be given greater flexibility to design appropriate service to fit local refugee needs. The program's emphasis on the provision of employment services to achieve economic self-support, however, will remain. We are proposing, however, to eliminate the job search requirements currently contained in ยง400.80 and the requirement contained in ยง400.146 that requires a State to use at least 85 percent of its social service grants to provide employability services if the State's welfare dependency rate is 55 percent or more. To ensure that refugees receive maximum benefit and maximum results from services provided during the proposed time-limited period, it is essential that services be provided in the most efficacious and appropriate manner possible. To accomplish this, program experience dictates that certain principles require greater emphasis in the provision of services to refugees: (1) Services should be provided in a manner that is linguistically and culturally compatible with a refugee's background; (2) refugee-specific services should be provided through a separate service system during the initial years of resettlement, rather than through a mainstream system in which refugees are only one of many client groups served; (3) English language instruction should be provided in a concurrent, rather than sequential, time period with employment or with other employment-related services; and (4) as required by the Refugee Act, refugee women should have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction. Under current policy, if a refugee who is receiving refugee medical assistance becomes ineligible solely because of increased earnings from employment, the refugee's medical assistance is extended for a period of 4 months or until the refugee reaches the end of the RMA time-eligibility period (currently the first 8 months after a refugee's arrival in the U.S.), whichever occurs first. The distinction between RMA and extended RMA has caused confusion in some States, with the effect of extended RMA being inappropriately denied to some eligible refugees. In addition, current policy generates administrative costs because eligibility workers need to make separate determinations of refugee eligibility for extended RMA once a refugee becomes ineligible due to increased earnings from employment. In order to alleviate this confusion and to reduce State administrative burden, we propose to drop the distinction between RMA and extended RMA by eliminating the extended RMA provision and by making RMA available to eligible refugees for the full period of time-eligibility determined by the Director in accordance with ยง400.204 beginning with the first month the refugee entered the U.S., regardless of whether a refugee received increased earnings from employment, unless the refugee obtains private medical coverage during the RMA eligibility period. Thus, under the 8-month eligibility period currently in effect, once a refugee a refugee is determined to be eligible for RMA at time of application, the refugee would be able to continue to receive RMA for a refugee's first 8 months in the U.S. regardless of whether a refugee receives increased earnings from employment during that period of time, unless the refugee obtains private medical coverage through his/her employer or any other source. This provision would replace the current 4-month extended RMA coverage for employed refugees. We believe this change will make the administration of RMA less confusing to States and, therefore, less subject to error than the current extended RMA provision. At the same time, the proposed change will better ensure continued medical coverage to refugees for a clearly specified period of time.
