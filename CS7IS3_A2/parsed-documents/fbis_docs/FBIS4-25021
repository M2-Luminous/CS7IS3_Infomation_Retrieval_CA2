In a clampdown unprecedented since martial law was imposed in 1989, the government flooded the capital with People's Armed Police (PAP) and plainclothes personnel, interrupted satellite television broadcasts and prohibited even the most innocuous-sounding gatherings. Police roadblocks have been thrown up around the university area in the northwest of Beijing, preventing foreigners from approaching Beijing University -- one of the cradles of the 1989 pro-democracy movement that was brutally suppressed by Chinese troops on June 4. The main entrance to Qinghua University was guarded by about a dozen uniformed security personnel, rigorously checking student identifications. On Tiananmen Square itself, hundreds of plainclothes police -- easily recognisable by their dark glasses and two-way radios wrapped in copies of the People's Daily -- shadowed all foreigners and quickly broke up any gathering of more than five people. The square's Monument to the People's Heroes -- one of the focal points of the 1989 demonstrations -- was roped off and one Chinese who complained that he was not allowed to climb the monument's steps was quickly moved on. Three journalists from the US television network CBS, who shot some film on the square Friday morning were detained by police and questioned for two hours. All their videotape was confiscated, one of the journalists said, adding that the police had accused them of filming without authorisation and shooting footage of the heavy security presence. "I have never seen the security so tight for a Tiananmen anniversary," a Western diplomat said. "It only needs troops on the street and it would be like martial law in 1989," he said, adding that widespread discontent over inflation and corruption and a marked increase in dissident activity at the beginning of the year had fueled the authorities' anxiety. While the normal complement of Chinese sight-seers and kite-flyers were in evidence on Tiananmen Square, others were clearly intimidated by the police presence. "We haven't received any order not to go to the square this evening, but I still won't go," said one Beijing worker. With the country's leading activists either in prison or exiled to the provinces and abroad, the only open sign of dissent was provided by university professor Ding Zilin who began a two-day hunger strike Thursday to protest against the heavy police surveillance of her home. Ding and her husband Jiang Peikun began their hunger strike at 6:25 p.m., the time of the birth of their son Jiang Jielun, who was shot dead by Chinese troops on June 4, 1989. Also Thursday, the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) ordered all the capital's major hotels to pull the plug on the US Cable News Network (CNN) until further notice. "The PSB declined to give any reason for their decision, but obviously it's because of June 4," said the public relations manager at a joint-venture hotel. CNN reception in the foreigners' compounds housing Beijing-based diplomats and journalists was repeatedly interrupted Friday whenever a China report was aired. Under a PSB directive issued last week, any group wishing to hold a meeting of more than 20 people in a Beijing hotel must first get police permission. At least two business meetings in the Kempinski Hotel -- a Sino-German-South Korean joint venture -- had to be called off last week after failing to get approval from the PSB. Newspaper listings showed a marked lack of cultural events on what is normally a socially active Friday night and at least one bar popular with foreigners and Chinese was pressured into closing for the evening. A planned showing of the 1993 Cannes Palme D'Or-winning Chinese film "Farewell to My Concubine" had to be cancelled because of a "power failure" -- the same reason given for the cancellation of a leaving party for a US journalist last weekend.
