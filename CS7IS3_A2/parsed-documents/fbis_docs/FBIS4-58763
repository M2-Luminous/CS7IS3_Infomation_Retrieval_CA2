In the Strip, as this was happening, was reporter Alan Ben-'Ami, who is on the line. What is the situation as of this moment, just over one day after the accord was signed? [Ben-'Ami] You could say that today, for the first time, some real concrete steps towards having the Palestinians take control on the ground in the Gaza Strip and have the Israelis pull out, concrete steps began today. Basically, there was a meeting with the Palestinian police liaison team -- some senior Palestinian officers headed by General Ghazi Jabali and Major Ziyad 'Arif. They have been meeting with the top rank of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Gaza and the Civil Administration people, like Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', the former commander of the Gaza Strip, who is now in charge of liaison between Israel and the Palestinians from the Israeli side; and Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, the current commander of the Gaza Strip. They have had more than five hours of discussions. After that, the Palestinian liaison team of about 17 men split up, going off to look at police stations and various security facilities throughout the Gaza Strip, either with Israeli policemen or with IDF officers.
