The premier voiced this statement in the village of Tamaresheni in South Ossetia, which he visited on January 3. The press center of the Georgian government reported to Interfax that the premier had a meeting with the command of the Russian and Ossetian peacekeeping battalions on the territory of the Russian military unit not far from Tskhinvali, an administrative center in South Ossetia. Since July 1992, these battalions have been overseeing the cease-fire in this region together with Georgian servicemen. Patsatsiya also visited several Georgian villages in South Ossetia where he promised the local population to provide them with food products and other necessary consumer goods. The Georgian-Ossetian conflict began in January 1991 as a result of Georgian forces introduced into South Ossetia after the South Ossetian leadership declared its intention to raise the status of South Ossetia.
