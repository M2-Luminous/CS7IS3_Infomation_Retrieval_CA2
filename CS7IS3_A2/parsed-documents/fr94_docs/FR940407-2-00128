Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Portfolio will relate solely to one or more of the following: (a) The differences in certain Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following: (i) Transfer agent fees identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Commission and Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (v) Directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (vi) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan and/or 12b&hyph;1 Plan with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's Shareholder Services Plan and/or any 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (d) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated unless and until approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order. 2. The Directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent Directors, who are not interested persons as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (``Independent Directors''), will approve the offering of additional classes of New Shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the Directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interest of both the Fund and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Directors including a majority of the Independent Directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Directors, and the Directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
