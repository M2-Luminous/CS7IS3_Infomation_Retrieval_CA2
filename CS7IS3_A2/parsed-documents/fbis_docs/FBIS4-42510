The future of Germany cannot be dealt with using the principles of "a leisure park," Kohl said today addressing the CDU/CSU [Christian Democrat Union/Christian Social Union] industrial committee in Munich. The CDU leader announced a "tough austerity course" for 1995. The watchword in the future must be "rethinking, not redistribution." Kohl said that the cornerstones of the tax program for the next period in office are to be submitted in the near future. Under this program, a cut in business tax is proposed to protect Germany as an investment location. In view of the increasing competition on world markets, the German economy can no longer allow itself to stay in second-last place among the EU countries in terms of machinery utilization times, Kohl said. The chancellor noted "encouraging signs" in the progress of the economy despite the existing problems. He highlighted the recent "sensible wage agreements," the cuts in key interest rates by the German Bundesbank, and the low inflation rate. He said that the major challenge is unemployment. To preserve Germany as an investment location, high-performance elites will have to be called for and accepted again.
