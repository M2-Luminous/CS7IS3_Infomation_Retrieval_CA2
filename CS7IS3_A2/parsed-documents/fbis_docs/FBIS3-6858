The spokesman said that Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit has stated a clear policy that the Army does not interfere in politics and everyone is trying his best to perform his own duty. The Army wants to see affection, unity, and understanding among various sectors. The Army chief has urged everyone to regard the interests of the people and the country as major goals. "We never want to have conflicts with others," said the Army spokesman. Asked if Gen. Chawalit, as a former Army commander and Armed Forces supreme commander, may have received some information about it, Col. Phalangkun declined to comment. As for opinions of military officers on this issue, an Army officer commanding military forces, said that Chawalit's remark was meant to divert public attention from the problem of the deteriorating image of politicians, although he knows very well that at present there is no way the military can successfully stage a coup. Today, the military does not even think about a coup and Gen. Chawalit should know this well. "Chawalit can carry out his political activities, but he should think about peace for the country and the people and also his younger brothers in the Army. At present, we are all right. We would be angry if another had said this, but the speaker is Chawalit, a military man and former leader of the Army. But we do not feel well at all about what he has said," the high-ranking military officer noted. He emphasized that everybody knows that a coup will be impossible in the near future, but afterward it is not certain because it depends on the situation. Meanwhile, during an interview with reporters in Nonthaburi Province, when asked about a coup, Gen. Chawalit only replied: "Who said?" and said nothing more.
