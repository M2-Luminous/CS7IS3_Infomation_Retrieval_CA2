FR941122-1-00027 FR941122-1-00002 (ii) Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. A standard with a heating or cooling component shall be made available to households that incur heating or cooling expenses separately from their rent or mortgage or expect to incur such expenses in the next heating or cooling season, except households in public housing units which have central utility meters and charge households only for excess utility costs. Households that receive assistance under the LIHEAA but do not incur out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses are also entitled to a standard that includes a heating or cooling component on the same basis as households that incur such costs. Households that receive other indirect energy assistance are entitled to a standard that includes heating or cooling only if they incur out-of-pocket expenses for heating or cooling costs. Entitlement to an annualized heating or cooling standard shall continue until the household no longer incurs or expects to incur a heating or cooling expense or no longer receives or expects to receive a LIHEAA payment during the next heating or cooling season. If the State agency elects to use seasonal standards, the State agency shall ensure that a standard is provided only to households that incur or expect to incur an expense that would entitle the household to the standard or receive or expect to receive a LIHEAA payment during the season covered by the standard. (iii) Household option. The State agency shall advise a household at the time of certification and whenever it reports a move that it may deduct verified actual utility costs (for any allowable expense identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C) of this section) it incurs rather than the standard (except for the telephone standard) throughout the certification period if actual expenses are more than the standard or the household is not eligible for the standard. The State agency may require use of the telephone standard for the cost of basic telephone service even if actual costs are higher. The State agency shall also inform the household that it may switch between use of actual utility costs and the standard at recertification and one additional time during each twelve-month period. (iv) Sharing utility expenses. If a household lives with and shares utility expenses with another individual, another household, or both, the State agency shall prorate a standard among the household and the other individual, household, or both, or allow the actual costs of each household. The State agency shall determine the proration method if a standard is used. * * * * * (8) Adjustment of shelter deduction .
