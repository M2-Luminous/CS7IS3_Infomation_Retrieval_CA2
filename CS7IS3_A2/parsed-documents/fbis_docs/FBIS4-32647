Currently the D Division of the SRI, for the intelligence protection of SRI personnel, has several files with references to Russian surveillance activity and their attempts to penetrate the circles of SRI employees in the north-eastern part of Romania. The documents sent to the government and the presidency briefing them on these facts have been left without answer. The collapse of the USSR in 1990 did not implicitly mean that the KGB's potential dropped as well. As neither its authority nor its influence at home or abroad has suffered setbacks, the KGB is trying to keep under control its zones of influence, and especially Romania. Moscow does not like the ideas and the conception of the Romanian Armed Forces and certain political circles to integrate within NATO structures. The assertion made on 24 December 1992 by the SRI director [Virgil Magureanu], in his speech occasioned by the Day of Antiterrorist Fighters, according to which "the Romanian Intelligence Service should involve itself more in Romania's reunification with Bessarabia," was a further signal that caused concern at Russian secret service headquarters. Two years after this statement, during a news conference organized in the month of March 1994, SRI Director Virgil Magureanu hinted that the most aggressive intelligence service currently acting on Romania's territory is the KGB.
