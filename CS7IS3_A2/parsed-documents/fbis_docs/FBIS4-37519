King Husayn has often said that any official sessions with Israeli leaders should not be a media show, but must be the result of political forward movement. Hence, King Husayn's rejection in January of an American proposal for a meeting with Rabin at the White House before the peace negotiations achieved a breakthrough. However, the progress achieved in Washington 7 June when Jordan secured Israel's approval of a joint experts committee -- set to meet next month in the region to delineate joint borders -- broke the deadlock and paved the way for Jordanian-Israeli talks at the highest levels.
