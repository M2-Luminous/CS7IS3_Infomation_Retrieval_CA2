As reported, Churkin told reporters Monday that Russia has not taken any obligation to withdraw its troops from Latvia and Estonia by the end of August. Alexander Kirsteins, head of the Saeima [parliament] committee, argued that Russia has long declared its commitment to complete the pullout by Aug. 31 if Latvia compromises on the radar installation at Skrunda and social guarantees for war pensioners. Russia has not signed any international treaty that would have made it assume any obligations regarding the troop withdrawal. In the Kirsteins' words, the absence of formal agreements allows Russia to fix the withdrawal deadline arbitrarily and interpret the Latvian stance on debatable issues in an ambiguous manner. On the other hand, Latvia has also undertaken no international obligations to supply electricity to Russian installations on its soil, Kirsteins said. Consequently, there were no reason for Russia to protest the explosion at the Skrunda's high voltage electricity post.
