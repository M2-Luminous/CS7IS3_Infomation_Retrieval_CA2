Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad pointed out in an exclusive statement to KUNA that this step followed the address the heir apparent and prime minister delivered to the Kuwaiti people on Monday last. He added that the ministers decided "to give Shaykh Sa'd the opportunity to choose whomever he wants to cooperate with, and this is his right." [passage omitted] With reference to the National Assembly's call yesterday to maintain the presence of six deputies in the forthcoming ministerial formation, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said "this is an issue for the prime minister." Concerning his assessment of the experience of having six National Assembly members participating in the present government, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said it was "not an experience inasmuch as the Constitution stipulates the presence of at least one member from the National Assembly in the ministerial formation." He went on to say: "Therefore, the inclusion of the National Assembly was a necessity, as otherwise there would be no government from the constitutional point of view." [passage omitted]
