He added that when he refers to Varosha he means the entire fenced-off area, which will be opened up in two phases: The first phase will begin two months after the package is approved and the second at a date to be agreed upon later. Speaking at the Larnaca Rotary Club last night, Feissel said the financing of Varosha's reconstruction and the travel documents that Turkish Cypriots will use are two issues that are still pending and the two leaders will need to decide on this. [Nicosia CYPRUS NEWS AGENCY in English at 0916 on 9 February carries a Larnaca-datelined report on Gustave Feissel's 8 February speech to the Larnaca Rotary Club, which adds the following: "After outlining the CBM's, Feissel explained that the advantage with the reopening of Varosha is that its inhabitants and property owners will be able to return. It will also increase tourism capacity on the Greek Cypriot side by about 15 per cent of what it is now and will provide a `significant stimulus' through what is envisaged would be at least one billion dollars worth of investment in order to bring back the area into a reconstructive form. ["For the Turkish Cypriots, he said, the benefits will be jobs and the opportunities for services during the reconstruction phase during both the opening of Varosha and the NIA, Nicosia International Airport. `It is estimated that this process could generate as much as 9,000 jobs, of which both sides would benefit,' Feissel said. ["He also said the tourism industry in the Turkish occupied areas, which is less than one tenth of that of the Greek Cypriot side, will open up as there will be direct airlinks to all destinations." [CNA adds: "Responding to questions, the U.N. envoy said the reports of the U.N. teams of experts on the package serve only to `shed light.'" [CNA continues: "Asked with what papers the Turkish Cypriots will travel abroad, Feissel said the Turkish Cypriots already travel to the United Kingdom and the United States 'by using a piece of paper which is given to them by the British and American embassies' and which substitutes for passports. There are ways of doing things without creating difficulties for either side," Feissel said.] The international community believes that implementation of the CBM's will open the road for talks on an overall Cyprus solution. This is the conclusion we draw from statements by the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members in Nicosia on the "Enlargements" program. U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher reiterated that the measures are a unique opportunity for the two communities to cooperate in a way that has been impossible for the past 20 years. He said that people who focus more on benefits for the other side than on the prospects that are being created are the ones impeding the CBM's. Russian Ambassador Boris Zenkov described the current phase of the Cyprus issue as very critical. He said the CBM's will help keep the Cyprus issue alive, adding that the entire issue will be lost if they are rejected. British High Commissioner David Dain said he considers the measures as a way to overcome the current status quo and create a new atmosphere of cooperation toward an overall Cyprus solution. French Ambassador Gerard Pavret de la Rochefordiere said Cyprus' current division is unacceptable and should end as soon as possible. He added that the CBM's are a catalyst that will facilitate discussion on the substance of the set of ideas that will follow. Chinese Ambassador Chen Zhenyou said he was satisfied because both sides accepted the CBM's in principle and expressed readiness to examine ways for its implementation. Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the CBM's philosophy is to create some activity and utilize it to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue. He added that the measures are neither an overall Cyprus solution nor a partial one, but they offer possibilities to Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to meet and communicate, thus proving unfounded Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' argument that there is lack of confidence. Mikhailidhis said that talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue will begin as soon as an agreement on the CBM's is reached and they begin to be implemented. Speaking at the same program, Mikhailidhis said that if an agreement is reached on the CBM's, the road to the European Union will open up because it will be persuaded to set a date for the beginning of accession negotiations. He said: If efforts fail due to Turkish rejection, the UN Security Council will be asked to find alternative procedures. Therefore, during the entire course of the talks the Greek Cypriot side must be consistent and persuasive. Asked whether he is optimistic about the outcome of the talks, Mikhailidhis said that unfortunately there is no indication that the Turkish side has changed its stance.
