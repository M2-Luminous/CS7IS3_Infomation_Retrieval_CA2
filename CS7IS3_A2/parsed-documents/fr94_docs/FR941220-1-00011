FR941220-1-00011 FR941220-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) Series Airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive replacement of the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch. This proposal is prompted by a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit coming from the overhead switch panel on a Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 series airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure replacement of the emergency power switch when it has reached its maximum life limit; an emergency power switch that is not replaced could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a fire in the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit. DATES: Comments must be received by January 31, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
