They discussed ways to deepen the study of Volume 3 of the "Selelected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept of Army building in the new period to guide Army building in all fields. CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou were present at the discussion. At the discussion, MR leaders Li Xinliang, Liu Jingsong, Song Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong spoke glowingly of their understandings gained from the intensive study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" during a concentrated period of nearly 20 days. According to them, the more they studied the works, the deeper they realized the profound meaning and broad coverage of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the great importance of studying Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," especially in the light of the realities in the Army's leadership work. As senior leading cadres, the MR leaders pledged to diligently study and master this theoretical weapon and use it to guide Army building. Liu Huaqing said: To diligently study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of all Army commanders and fighters is the long-term strategic task of the whole Army, which must be carried out without fail. He emphasized: In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability and between local and national interests, it is imperative to integrate theory with practice. Senior cadres, in particular, should conscientiously set a good example for rank- and-file soldiers by promoting the Army's work in all fields and making positive contributions to China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive and to the maintenance of social stability. We should continue to educate all Army commanders and fighters to bring the Army's fine traditions into play and to preserve Red Army veterans' true color. We should administer the Army strictly. Cadres at all level must go deep into the realities to strengthen military training and ensure a good job in ideological and political work. At present, particular attention must be paid to managing troops and strengthening unity between the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians. Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff, and Tang Tianbiao, assistant to the director of the General Political Department, also attended the discussion.
