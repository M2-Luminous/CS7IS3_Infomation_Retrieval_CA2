"It is inconceivable that the Diet should end its session before a new cabinet has been formed," Hata was quoted as saying. He announced Saturday [25 June] his intention to quit with his entire cabinet. KYODO said Hata made the comments as his ruling coalition is stepping up its bid to woo the Social Democratic Party (SDP) back into its fold to form a stable, majority government. The Hata cabinet remains in office until a new administration is launched. The House of Representatives is to convene a plenary session at 10:00 a.m. [0100 GMT] tomorrow. However, it remains unclear whether the lower house will be able to vote on a successor to Hata tomorrow in view of intensifying parliamentary maneuverings by both the coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to win over the socialists to their respective camps. The SDP can swing the balance of power because it holds 74 seats in the powerful 511-member lower house while the LDP has 206, and the governing coalition 183.
