By reaffirming its commitment to the trilateral Moscow agreement on the Ukrainian nuclear weapons, Kiev secured Washington's consent to the offer of 700 million dollars in American aid to Ukraine and the extension of 400 million dollars in reserve credit in the future. From the standpoint of Russian national interests, however, it would be wrong to underestimate the results of the summit. The latest meeting between B. Clinton and L. Kravchuk, just as the Washington visits of the leaders of Kazakhstan and Georgia, suggested that the United States is competing vigorously with Russia for political and economic influence in the post-Soviet zone. Kiev as a Counterbalance We know that in the first weeks after Clinton arrived in the White House, he and his advisers were already making some effort to reassess American-Ukrainian relations. Whereas the Bush administration had conducted an uncompromising dialogue with Ukraine, suggesting that economic and other aid to Kiev be dependent on its renunciation of nuclear weapons and development of relations with Russia, the Clinton team is employing much more flexible tactics. According to the frank admission of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State S. Talbott, "we let our Ukrainian friends know that we are striving for broader, deeper, more meaningful, multidimensional relations with a view to our common interests in the spheres of economics, politics, and security." It is precisely in this context that we must view the congressional hearings on the state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations at the end of June 1993, resulting in the elaboration of the five fundamental principles of the Clinton administration's "Ukrainian" policy: "1. A country in the center of Europe as large and as rich in resources as Ukraine should be playing a decisive role in security matters in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE); "2. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty are important to U.S. national interests; "3. Our relationship with Ukraine will not depend on our relations with Russia; "4. In view of its history and geographic location, Ukraine has legitimate security concerns; "5. We believe that Ukraine's own interests would be served by the fulfillment of its commitments in line with the Lisbon Protocol, its ratification of the START I Treaty, and its affiliation with the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a nuclear-free state." It appears that Washington is pursuing several goals at once in its more active "Ukrainian" policy. First of all, it wants the complete elimination of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, with the whole process under its own close supervision, because the state of nuclear security in that former Soviet republic is a matter of serious concern. Second, it is striving for the more predictable development of the still extremely complex political and economic situation in Ukraine, primarily by discouraging the curtailment of reform and preventing the country from sliding into chaos and splitting into several states, which CIA analysts expect to occur in the next two years. "The problem consists less in how successful or unsuccessful America's actions are than in the uncertainty of Ukraine's own position. It proudly declares its independence, but it does not have the necessary experience to cope with genuine difficulties," the WASHINGTON POST remarked. Third, from the standpoint of American geostrategic interests, an independent Ukraine should serve as a strong buffer zone between CEE and Western Europe and Russia. It is no coincidence that Washington has had a generally positive response to the idea of establishing various types of regional bloc structures along the western borders of Russia under U.S. and NATO control. Furthermore, Washington's own attempts to form groups of states of its own design in the post-Soviet zone have been accepted by all of the countries of the East European region without exception, including Ukraine. In pursuit of the fourth and final goal, Washington has given up its earlier temporizing stance on Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, particularly Georgia and Kazakhstan, and now wants to take the lead in formulating and conducting Western policy toward the CIS and to limit Russia's geopolitical potential considerably by making the breakup of the USSR irreversible and keeping Russia from inheriting great-power status. As S. Talbott, the "generator" of American policy on the CIS and Baltic countries, categorically announced, "we do not agree that Russia has a sphere of influence allowing it to behave in certain ways beyond its own borders with adverse effects on the independence of these states.... We do not even want to accept the implications of the term 'nearby foreign countries.'" Therefore, Ukraine is being assigned the role of a counterbalance to possible Russian geostrategic and geoeconomic ambitions, especially its hope of securing key positions for itself in the post-Soviet zone. During the recent American-Ukrainian summit, L. Kravchuk publicly agreed with this. `We Need a Strong Ukraine' Officials in Washington are not concealing the fact that the "Ukrainian card" will be played primarily in the sphere of military policy, where financial expenditures are not that burdensome but are extremely effective. Above all, this presupposes the offer of security guarantees to Kiev, with a view to its national independence and territorial integrity. As evidence of this, Ukraine was the first of the CIS countries to be included in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. In addition to this, the Clinton administration wants to enhance its relations with Kiev with an extensive long-range program of economic, scientific, and technical cooperation, with a view to the impressive economic potential of Ukraine, which accounts for around 20 percent of the GDP of the CIS countries. In the opinion of several American politicians, during the effort to strengthen Ukraine's economy, America should try to lessen Kiev's dependence on Moscow by redirecting the Ukrainian economy toward the West. According to Z. Brzezinski, who has criticized the Democratic administration several times for putting too much emphasis on Moscow and not paying enough attention to Kiev, "if we do not want the revival of the Russian empire, we need a strong Ukraine." At this time the State Department is working on several proposals to broaden economic aid to Ukraine and send a group of highly professional experts to that country on the condition that it take vigorous steps to decentralize its economy. There is no question that the agreement signed at the American-Ukrainian summit on the protection of foreign capital investments in Ukraine will have a positive effect on the development of trade and economic relations between the two countries. Besides this, Kiev probably will get the promised credits of 1.5 billion dollars from the IMF and the World Bank. In view of the present disastrous state of the economy and the mounting separatist feelings in Crimea and several eastern oblasts, however, the Ukrainian leadership cannot put too much hope in a strong influx of American investments or in the U.S. offer to "usher" Ukraine into Western markets even if it does conduct a harsh confrontational policy in relations with Russia (which Ukrainian public opinion is unlikely to support). Furthermore, Ukraine does not have much chance of joining the rapidly growing European Union or the "Visegrad Group," for which Kiev would be too "unmanageable." In other words, the circle is closing, and it may be impossible to escape Moscow. `The Hand of Moscow' Irrespective of the wishes of the Ukrainian leadership, the once prosperous former Soviet republic might have to rely on a helping hand (in accordance with market conditions) only from Russia in the near future. An economic policy with an anti-Russian thrust would be futile and dangerous for Ukraine. The roots of industrial cooperation are too deep, and its dependence on Russian crude resources, especially gas, is too strong. This does not mean, however, that the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs can turn the pursuit of Russia's "Ukrainian" policy over to Gazprom, which was so proficient in finding a solution to the problem of Ukraine's debts for deliveries of Russian natural gas. The fact is that playing the "Ukrainian" card, just as other cards like the "Georgian" and "Kazakhstani" ones, could lead to the dramatic reduction of Russia's geostrategic and geoeconomic capabilities under some circumstances. It is in Moscow's long-term interest to intensify integration processes within the CIS, establish a single post-Soviet economic zone, unconditionally give up the internationalization of problems between Russia and Ukraine (Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet), and support the social and economic structures in Ukraine with the strongest affiliation with the Russian Federation. Finally, it is time to consider more vigorous activity by Russian transnational corporations. Russia's investment expansion probably will produce perceptible economic advantages and strengthen its influence in the nearby foreign countries.
