Kono told reporters Hosokawa must take responsibility for the scandal, which has brought to a deadlock Diet deliberations on the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1. The LDP has demanded that Hosokawa submit further detailed documents related to a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin Co., the country's leading parcel delivery firm, saying materials Hosokawa offered are insufficient to clear suspicions over the loan. The opposition has also demanded that Hosokawa's former secretary testify before the Diet on the loan issue. The premier has said he borrowed the money to buy a condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture, and he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991. He has reiterated there were no illegalities in the loan. Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition in an attempt to clear his name. The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal involving a number of leading political figures, including fallen LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax evasion last March.
