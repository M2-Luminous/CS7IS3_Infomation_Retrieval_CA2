FR940407-2-00115 FR940407-2-00061 The Commission approved the margin levels for Project, Construction, and Mobile Home GNMA securities on a temporary basis on October 7, 1991. 7 In that filing, PTC submitted historical data which suggested that the price movements of GNMA Project, Construction, and Mobile Home securities tracked those of GNMA Single-Family securities. 8 The Commission approved PTC's margin levels on a temporary basis to allow further evaluation by PTC of price movement correlations between GNMA Single-Family securities on the one hand, and GNMA Project, Construction, and Mobile Home securities on the other, as well as to gauge the volatility of such securities. In seeking permanent approval of its margin levels, PTC submitted in support of its proposal data consistent with the price movement data in the original filing. 9 7 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29793, supgra note 4. 8 The price movement comparisons were based on prices of GNMA Construction Loan, Project Loan, and Single-Family securities, over the period from March 1990 to February 1991. Letter from Alison Hoffman, Assistant Counsel, PTC, to Scott Wallner, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated August 1, 1991. 9 PTC compared daily price movements of GNMA Single-Family 10% securities against each of Project Note, Project Loan, Construction Loan, and Mobile Home 10% securities. File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;04, appendix A. The Commission is satisfied that PTC's proposal is consistent with the Act, but suggests that PTC review periodically the price movement correlations and volatility described above. The Commission believes that the enhanced margin levels for these securities will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and assure the safeguarding of securities and funds in PTC's custody or control by limiting the risk arising from fluctuations in the market value of Project, Construction, and Mobile Home securities when used to collateralize intraday processing of securities transactions. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 10 that PTC's proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved. 10 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 11 11 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a) (12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
