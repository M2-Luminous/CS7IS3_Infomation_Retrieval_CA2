"I want to have two deputy ministers submitted by the parties of the governing coalition in the Foreign Ministry [MSZ] by 1 July at the latest," announced Minister Olechowski. What must happen first is the introduction of a reform of the MSZ, which has been prepared and was presented by the minister to the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission yesterday. The new deputy ministers will be performing political roles, and they will not perform managerial functions with regard to anything in the MSZ. The current deputy ministers will most probably take up the posts of director generals. If the government approves the project, the MSZ will be the first ministry in which the political top (the minister, his deputy, and his cabinet), which usually changes with every government, will be statutorily separated from the apolitical office chaired by a secretary general. The new concept, which was prepared over a period of three months by a hundred experts led by Jerzy Kozminski, a secretary of state in the MSZ, is said to be liked by the president. For a few months, Sejm deputies for the coalition were critical of Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the former MSZ chief, for a "disastrous personnel policy." Yesterday, Olechowski outlined some new principles of recruitment, promotion, and assignments to posts abroad. We know unofficially that he was hoping that this would lead to termination of the infamous Sejm subcommission for MSZ personnel, which was established in January in order to "settle accounts with the MSZ." Olechowski's ideas were enthusiastically received by the Sejm deputies, but Andrzej Micewski (an independent) unexpectedly moved for an extension of the subcommission's mandate by three months. Olechowski responded with anger: "This contributes to an atmosphere of scandal surrounding the ministry. Neither the MSZ nor Polish foreign policy nor the interests of the Polish state benefit from the subcommission's activity." Micewski's proposal was rejected by one vote, but it is not known how the conflict will end because the Sejm deputies for the coalition put the results of the vote in question.
