Rakhimov by M. Kotlukhuzhin, Ufa-Magnitogorsk, under rubric "On the Basis of Stability: Republic President Murtaza Rakhimov Gives Assurance That Bashkortostan Will Continue a Policy of Mutually Advantageous Cooperation With Its Neighbors"] [Text] On 12 December in the neighboring Republic of Bashkortostan, simultaneously with the election to the Russian Federal Assembly, the election of the first president in the republic's history took place. Two candidates laid claim to that position -- Murtaza Rakhimov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, and Rafis Kadyrov, chairman of the board of the Vostok [East] Bank. The results of the voting showed that M. G. Rakhimov won with a large advantage. Our oblast, and especially Magnitka [Magnitogorsk] and its metallurgical plant in particular, is linked with Bashkortostan by traditionally deep mutual economic interests. We are also brought closer together by common sociopolitical problems and the need to resolve them by combined efforts. This explains our striving to meet with the president of Bashkortostan. Despite the fact that he was extremely busy preparing for the session of the republic's Supreme Soviet and for his inauguration, Murtaza Gubaydullovich Rakhimov nevertheless managed to find time for a quarter of an hour to answer a number of my questions. [Kotlokhuzhin] First of all, Murtaza Gubaydullovich, please accept our congratulations on your having been elected the president of Bashkortostan. I saw in the republic press that one of the first persons to congratulate you was B. N. Yeltsin. Does that mean that the sovereignization of Bashkortostan is being supported at the highest state level? [Rakhimov] Thank you for the congratulation. Actually, I received two telegrams from the president of Russia. Boris Nikolayevich also congratulated me on my having been elected deputy to the Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly. But the sovereignization of Bashkortostan could not encounter any opposition from the center, inasmuch as it does not present any threat to the integrity of Russia. Our republic was, and continues to be, one of the most powerful subjects in the makeup of the Russian Federation. I might recall that, on a voluntary basis, we have been part of the Russian state for more than four centuries. And we shall continue to strive not to weaken, but to strengthen, that historical unity. We proceed from the idea that the Russian Federation will be strong in proportion to the strength of its subjects. Therefore we shall support an efficient separation of the powers between the federal agencies of state authority and the republics' agencies of authority, and the independence of the Federation's subjects in many areas of socioeconomic life. We are also convinced that Russia can become strong if we are able to unite among ourselves to achieve a common goal -- the creation of a prosperous society. If we are able to guarantee the supremacy of the law and a truly federal system, without infringing upon the rights of anyone, or any nation. In Russia the Law governs, rather than any single party, clan, or individual. [Kotlokhuzhin] Exactly four years ago, at the first congress of the Bashkir Ural [Urals] Social Center, I proposed including a small line in the telegram demanding the granting of political sovereignty to Bashkortostan: "on the basis of economic independence." At that time the proposal did not find any support. Today the economic independence of your republic is the chief condition for sovereignty. [Rakhimov] Naturally, without any broad economic independence there cannot be any true sovereignty. I am convinced that if Gorbachev had granted the Baltic republics economic independence promptly, it would have been possible to avoid the collapse of the USSR. And under today's conditions of the complete collapse of the country's economy, which I consider to be simply a crime against the nation, sovereignty is necessary to multi-ethnic Bashkortostan in order to guarantee to its people a worthy life. For this purpose it is necessary create in the republic those conditions in which every citizen -- irrespective of his nationality, religion, or social status -- can, without any restrictions, engage in his job, demonstrate all his capabilities and receive just compensation for his labor, and be calm concerning his own life and the life of his children. The republic's economic independence guarantees more rights and opportunities to the cities and rayons in carrying out their social development programs. [Kotlokhuzhin] What paths do you see and plan, Murtaza Gubaydullovich, for getting out of the present complicated socioeconomic situation? [Rakhimov] What we need first of all are political and social stability, consent among nationalities, and the prevention of indecisive actions. It is necessary to restore and stabilize production, to develop our life on the basis of all forms of ownership, to encourage private enterprise and business, and to encourage investments in the republic's economy. I feel that stability in the regions is necessary in order to save Russia from collapse. The main error in reforming the economy, in my opinion, is the making of encroachments on the producer. In our republic we are planning a new course. The producer in Bashkortostan will receive the state's complete support in the high-priority economic areas. We feel that economic reforms must be carried out in the interests of people. And we choose as our unshakeable rule the following: any reform must be carried out only in the event that it improves people's lives. Of course, the economy of Bashkortostan cannot develop in complete isolation from the economy of Russia, or the entire former Union. The negative consequences of the universal economic collapse did not bypass us. So, just as pertains everything, although perhaps only to a lesser degree, our volumes of production are dropping. Among your neighbors, for example, at the Beloretsk Metallurgical Combine, a powerful wire-making machine is standing idle because of the lack of production orders. Nevertheless, the steps being taken by us are already yielding certain positive results. In our republic we have not allowed a reduction in the volumes of housing construction, and we consider this to be a major achievement. It apparently will be important for the people of Chelyabinsk to know that we also are not allowing a complete drop in agricultural production, since your oblast, and particularly Magnitka, receives a rather large amount of food products from Bashkortostan. We plan to continue to render effective support to agriculture, without making any distinctions at such time among the forms of ownership. We are ready to help everyone -- the kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and individual farmers -- so long as they manage their farms effectively. That is the main criterion. And the rural areas respond to this attention by performing work well. I am aware that in Chelyabinsk and Orenburg oblasts a rather large number of fields remained unharvested during the recent serious autumn. That did not occur in our republic. All the grain was harvested. [Kotlokhuzhin] One can only rejoice at your successes. Am I correct in thinking that, with this attempt on your part to achieve stability and to preserve your previous economic ties, the Magnitogorsk metallurgists apparently have the right to count on the continuation of the mutually advantageous cooperation with Bashkortostan? [Rakhimov] There should be no doubts about this! The cooperation will continue on the basis of the long-term contract that was signed by us two years ago with the leadership of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. In exchange for metal products, Bashkortostan will continue the shipment of food products and of petroleum and chemical products. [Kotlokhuzhin] The interests of the MMK [Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine] are not limited only to this. Recreational centers for the combine and for other industrial enterprises are situated on the territory of Abzelilovskiy and Belorechnyy rayons. Do your political concept and the program for developing economic cooperation make it possible to hope not only for their preservation, but also for further development? [Rakhimov] Of course. I reemphasize that we are not planning to isolate ourselves, to separate ourselves, or to speculate with our sovereignty. We have enough land, both for the recreational centers for the Magnitogorsk metallurgists and for other good deeds. So we shall continue to live in peace and harmony, and, on the basis of mutually advantage cooperation, to strive for a good life for all working people, wherever they live -- in Bashkortostan or in Magnitka. [Kotlokhuzhin] Thank you, Murtaza Gubaydullovich, for the conversation. On behalf of the readers of our newspaper,I would like to wish you success in your important endeavors. [Rakhimov] Rakhmat. Khau bulygyz! Good luck!
