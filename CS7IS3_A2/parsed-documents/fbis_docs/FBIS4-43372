Yesterday, SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse no longer ruled out such a cooperation for his party in eastern German municipalities. The PDS representatives must not be treated like lepers and thus turned into martyrs, he said. All parties are obliged to cooperate in order to solve the pending problems. This is something completely different from coalitions with the PDS on the land and federal level, which he considers impossible. First offers have already been made by the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. For example, Wolfgang Methling, PDS frontrunner in Rostock, stated that the PDS does not want "to govern the city at all costs." Methling announced coalition talks with the Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD. According to the preliminary result, in the Hanseatic city the PDS gains 20 seats, the SPD 16, the CDU 11, and the Greens six. In Thuringia, however, the SPD has basically opposed coalitions with the PDS. Last evening, the land executive committee of the party still wanted to discuss a recommendation to the district and local associations not to form any coalitions with the PDS on a local level.
