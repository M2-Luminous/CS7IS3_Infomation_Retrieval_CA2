Preliminary information has been reported by LA PRENSA. This is the story: Journalists who attended the funeral of Ismael Jaimes, LA OPINION editor in chief in Barrancabermeja, thought they knew who the assassins were. Today they have learned the truth -- a Navy intelligence network led by Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez became a gang of killers. Two of the Navy members who were part of that intelligence network turned over to the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's Office testimonies and evidence on approximately 100 assassinations that were planned and carried out like routine business. This can be heard during a taped conversation regarding the identification and death of an informer. [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker] That is how it will be done. [Second unidentified speaker] That is the least important thing because if an appointment is made, meaning he is told he must go to a certain place on a certain date.... [pauses] all we have to do is leave a message [words indistinct]. He can be called and an appointment can be made for two days later, or something like that. The young man will go and he will be told to be alert because a man -- whose description he will be given -- will arrive. Juan Carlos knows him. [First speaker] How can [words indistinct]? [Second speaker] We can call him from here. [end recording] The document published by LA PRENSA again reviews the fact that military members have been corrupted by the war and have become assassins. [Begin journalist Gonzalo Guillen recording] I believe it is one of the most monstrous things that have happened in this country. It is one of the most atrocious crimes because the state is assassinating the people. [end recording]
