The CAR has observed that: 1. In accordance with its 23 April statement, none of its members agreed to join Edem Kodjo's cabinet. 2. The presidential group holds more than 60 percent of the ministerial posts. 3. Four of the five most important ministerial posts, national defense, foreign affairs, interior, and security, are held by members of the presidential group. The CAR is also surprised that Edem Kodjo continues to claim he belongs to the CAR-UTD [Togolese Union for Democracy] parliamentary majority and that he will implement the majority group's joint program. In fact, through his obstinacy to form his government in violation of the 26 March agreement, Edem Kodjo is dealing with a majority that is not the one that was chosen during the 6 and 20 February parliamentary elections. This is evident in the composition of his government. Moreover, in order to mislead the people, Edem Kodjo, in his introductory statement during the naming of his cabinet, went to great lengths to point out that he accepted the prime minister's post to save the parliamentary majority. In the same introductory statement, Edem Kodjo concedes that his government did not meet the people's aspirations. The CAR, therefore, thinks it is a matter of urgency to form a legitimate and credible government which reflects the wishes expressed by the people during the parliamentary elections and which will meet with the people's approval. Issued in Lome on 26 May for the CAR by its chairman, Yaovi Agboyibor.
