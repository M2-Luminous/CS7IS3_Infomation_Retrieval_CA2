Diplomatic sources said that while Pyongyang had yet to respond to the invitation, the Kim visit would help boost China's power as a major arbiter in regional affairs. Two major heads of government in East Asia, Japanese Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and South Korean President, Kim Young- sam, are scheduled to call in on Beijing next month. The visit by President Kim (Il-sung) would help cement Beijing's role as a mediator among the major players in East Asia. The sources said while Pyongyang had been angered by the growing ties between Beijing and Seoul there was little doubt that Mr Kim would accept the invitation. However, the sources added, if Mr Kim's health was failing or if he was too preoccupied with the increasingly ferocious power struggle that had broken out within the "Kim Dynasty", North Korean Prime Minister, Kang Song-san, would pay the visit on his behalf. It is understood that Mr Kim II-sung was anxious to see Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in case the patriarch's health failed. Despite Beijing's recent "tilt" towards Seoul, President Kim Il-sung and his advisers have not given up hope that "first-generation revolutionaries" like Mr Deng still have a sentimental attachment to the old "lips-and-teeth" relationship between the two communist neighbours. According to Chinese sources, however, Beijing's major goal in having President Kim Il-sung arrive after the visits of the leaders of Japan and South Korea was to demonstrate its influence in East Asia. Japan and Western governments, particularly the United States, have urged Beijing to persuade Pyongyang to put a freeze on, if not dismantle, its nuclear weapon programme. Chinese diplomats have also indicated their willingness to help promote the peaceful unification of North and South Korea. Diplomatic analysts said, however, that Beijing's ability to influence Pyongyang's policy had been diminished. They said President Kim Il-sung would visit Beijing after the end of March and Kim Chong-il, probably before the summer. Aside from economic aid and co-operation, President Kim Il-sung will probably seek Beijing's support for his son and anointed successor Kim Chong-il. Sources said despite his avowed desire not to meet any more foreign leaders, Mr Deng would probably agree to see President Kim Il-sung in private. Meanwhile, President Kim met a Chinese Communist Party official in Pyongyang yesterday. Mr Kim received Li Shuzheng, head of the international liaison dapartment of the Chinese Communist Party, and her entourage and held talks in a "cordial and friendly atmosphere" the Korean Central News Agency said.
