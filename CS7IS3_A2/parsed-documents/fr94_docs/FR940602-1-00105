FR940602-1-00105 FR940602-1-00014 c.1. Permitted combustion facilities. EPA is proposing, in §270.62(b)(6) for incinerators and §270.66(d)(3) for BIFs, to require the Director to send a notice of the expected trial burn schedule to all persons on the mailing list and to appropriate units of State and local government. As mentioned previously in the preamble, the trial burn plan is available for public review at other points in the permitting process (e.g., at application submittal, at draft permit issuance, and at final permit determination). Thus, unlike the notice requirement for interim status facilities, explained in the section below, the notice of the trial burn schedule for permitted facilities does not refer to the trial burn plan. EPA recognizes that, in a limited number of situations, circumstances beyond the control of the facility or the permitting authority could delay a trial burn. It is not EPA's intent, in these limited situations, to require an additional notice with a revised burn schedule. The notice must contain the following information, specified in §§270.62(b)(6) or 270.66(d)(3): (1) Name and telephone number of the facility's contact person; (2) name and telephone number of the permitting authority's contact office; (3) location where the approved trial burn plan and any supporting documents are available for review; and, (4) the expected time period during which the facility is scheduled to conduct the trial burn. Including this information in the notice enables members of the public to speak with a person who is knowledgeable about the trial burn plan, and to be aware of an imminent trial burn in their community. c.2. Interim status combustion facilities. In §270.74(c)(3), EPA is proposing notice requirements for interim status facilities that are similar to the requirements for permitted facilities. The proposed rule will require the Director to send a notice to all persons on the mailing list and appropriate units of State and local government, informing them of the proposed approval of the trial burn plan and the expected trial burn schedule. The Agency is requiring this notice before the permitting authority approves the plan in order to provide an additional opportunity for the public to review the final draft plan. It should be noted that, for interim status facilities, the Director's decision to approve the trial burn plan is not subject to administrative appeal. EPA recognizes that the draft plan submitted with the initial Part B application may differ significantly from the final version that the permitting authority approves. EPA wants to ensure that the public has a chance to see the revisions prior to approval and the actual burn. EPA would like to solicit comments on whether the Agency should establish a comment period for interim status facilities prior to approving the trial burn plan, in view of the fact that, for permitted facilities, the public has an opportunity to comment on the draft trial burn plan as part of the draft permit process. Currently, there are less public involvement opportunities for interim status facilities than there are for permitted facilities, with regard to the review of trial burn plans. As mentioned previously, for permitted facilities, the public has the opportunity to review the trial burn plan at both the application and draft permit phases before a trial burn occurs. The notice must contain the information specified in proposed §270.74(c)(3). The notice should include the following: (1) Name and telephone number of the facility's contact person; (2) name and telephone number of the permitting authority's contact office; (3) location where the draft trial burn plan and any supporting documentation are available for review; and (4) a schedule of activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the date by which the Director expects to approve the plan and the expected time period during which the facility is scheduled to conduct the trial burn and submit results to the Director (refer to proposed §270.74(c)(4)). Including this information in the notice enables the public to speak with a person who is knowledgeable about the trial burn plan, receive or review additional information, and learn of an imminent trial burn in their community. As stated earlier, interim status facilities will conduct the trial burn prior to permit issuance, as required by current regulations. Although the public will have an opportunity to review the trial burn plan, since it must be submitted with the initial Part B application, in accordance with today's proposed requirements in §270.74(a) or (b), a significant amount of time may elapse before the Director approves the plan and announces the facility's expected schedule for the burn. EPA believes that it is important to inform the public of the Director's proposed approval of the trial burn plan, separate from the rest of the Part B permit application, and the anticipated time period for conducting the burn. Again, this is consistent with the Draft Combustion Strategy goal of promoting public involvement in the trial burn stage. d. Post-trial burn period at interim status combustion facilities. In today's rule, EPA is proposing that interim status combustion facilities be subject to the performance standards of §264.343, for incinerators, or §§266.104 through 266.107, for BIFs, upon completion of the trial burn. During the post-trial burn period, interim status facilities must operate only under conditions that passed and were demonstrated to meet these performance standards, and only if the successful trial burn data is sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions. EPA has provided information, in its June 1994 Guidance on Trial Burn Failures, for determining whether conditions resulted in non-compliance and under what circumstances successful data from the trial burn is sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions. This proposal is more stringent than current regulations and practices. Currently, no regulations provide for setting post-trial burn conditions at interim status facilities. EPA believes that these proposed regulations will give the permitting agency the direct authority it needs to restrict these interim status facilities' operations to ensure that they are in compliance with the basic performance standards applicable to permitted facilities during the post-trial burn period. Establishing these requirements will ensure that interim status combustion facilities are operating in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment during the post-trial burn period. This proposed requirement for interim status facilities is consistent with the post-trial burn requirements for permitted facilities. It is also consistent with EPA's draft model permit (September 1988), which has wording for the permitting agency to incorporate into combustion permits regarding temporary restriction of operating conditions following the trial burn.
