The main thing is that a dialogue began, and that it proceeded constructively enough. It's also indicative that the launch of the negotiating mechanism led to lowering the intensity of violations on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan," the Director of the 3d Asian Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry, Yuriy Kotov, told INTERFAX on Wednesday. According to him, "nothing great" was expected from the talks in Moscow. "We did not expect the two sides to reach comprehensive agreements at once. It's gratifying enough that they worked out an extensive agenda, adopted a statement on the need to refrain from any actions conducive to complicating the process of talks, agreed to form a commission on refugees, and coordinated a joint communique," the diplomat said.
