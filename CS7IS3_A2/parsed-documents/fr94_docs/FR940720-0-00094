( 1 ) Method 1, per batch, actual RVP data will be used to define that batch as either summer fuel or winter fuel. Summer fuel is defined as fuel produced and intended for sale to satisfy federal summer volatility standards. When such per batch actual RVP data is not available, data is allocated per month as follows. A summer month is defined as any month during which more than 50 percent (by volume) of the gasoline produced by a refiner met the federal summer gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month which could not be considered a summer month under this definition. * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* In any case, all data collected through the date of collection of the last data point included in the determination of a baseline fuel parameter value must be utilized in the baseline determination of that fuel parameter. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (iv) *␣*␣* E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.000 * * * * * T js = total 1990 volume of blendstock j used in the refinery's season s gasoline * * * * * (v) *␣*␣* (A) *␣*␣* T js = total 1990 volume of blendstock j used in the refinery's season s gasoline * * * * * (4) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* (A) *␣*␣* UV = [AV/(100^OV)] x 100 E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.001 * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* * * * * * (ii) *␣*␣* (A) *␣*␣* AV = UV x (100^OV)/100 * * * * * UV = non-oxygenated parameter value * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.002 * * * * * (5) *␣*␣* (vi) *␣*␣*Such data shall be used in the determination of the baseline value, due to the work-in-progress, of each of the fuel parameters specified in §80.91(a)(2)(i) and as verification of the effect of the work-in-progress.
