On its pages the paper raised a most urgent question which touches on the long-term vital interests of Russia. Once again I was convinced of the terrible situation (let us call a spade a spade) in which our navy has existed for the last two or three years, that same avy which for the first time in history had ranked second in the world in terms of power. The peoples of friendly countries on all continents welcomed ships flying the white and blue flag, and enemies treated it with respect on all the waters of the World Ocean. The Deputy Chairman of Goskomoboronprom [State Committee of the Defense Industry] of the Russian Federation G. Voronin, straightforwardly and with facts in hand, sketched the rapid fading of our fleet and its dismal prospects. In five years the complement of the navy has been cut by 40 percent. For the second year not a single new ship has been started. The basing system has been destroyed, alert-duty service has been cut, the squadrons of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean have returned to their own coastal waters, some ship-building centers have broken away, and the financing of fundamental and exploratory research has stopped. Deprived of its navy, the country will inevitably lose its great-power status. This prospect is dismal and ruinous for the state. Still, some estimates demand clarification, some predictions require discussion. First of all I want to note that one can speak of the navy only with allowance for the geopolitical factor. In contrast to island states, England, Japan and (in a sense) the U.S., which does not have the million-strong armies of neighboring states nearby, Russia must first protect itself from the possible invasion of ground troops. Nor is invasion from naval axes ruled out. As many now assume, world nuclear war is not very likely. But nuclear weapons will remain weapons of deterrence and prevention of aggression for many years yet. It is no secret that before the start of perestroyka, when no expense was spared on defense, the USSR put the emphasis in the nuclear triad on heavy ground-based missiles (ICBMs), which the U.S. most feared and which most met the geopolitical interests of our state. At that time it was easier and cheaper to form the Strategic Missile Troops than the Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces. A change in the structure of strategic offensive arms to increase the naval component up to 50 to 70 percent, as G. Voronin proposes, will lead to another naval arms race. Voronin acknowledges that it would be unrealistic and inexpedient to try to achieve quantitative parity at sea given the great economic superiority of the U.S. Our country would not be able to breath freely under the burden of excessive military expenditures. He suggests concentrating strategic missile submarines and their supporting forces in the North and East as part of the Northern and Pacific Fleets. Allowing for the great economic importance of the Northern and Far-Eastern Seas, the author believes that "our navy must provide full superiority in these zones." Accomplishment of this task would require too many forces. However, temporary control over certain waters with the goal of blocking amphibious assaults, for example, is a realistic task. The new grouping of Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces also demands balance by conventional forces, to prevent skewing in the direction of any single weapons system. Forces to combat submarines, aircraft carriers, and other strike vessels are needed. All this requires an "air-defense umbrella." Everyone remembers the Caribbean crisis of October 1962, when our forces in Cuba found themselves beyond the reach of Soviet conventional weapons and we were compelled to withdraw our missiles from Cuba literally under the muzzles of American guns. Thus in every theater, a complete structure of the present-day navy must be established. So we must save the navy. To do this, the main forces of the navy must be concentrated in the North and Far East. What then of Russian interests in the Baltic and Black Seas? The U.S. has already announced that the Baltic countries and Ukraine are zones of their vital interests, and consequently they are prepared to defend them by force of arms. On March 19 of this year, on the "Vesti" [news] television show the new U.S. Defense Secretary W. Perry, allowing for the instability in Russia, spoke in favor of further development of nuclear forces, including the "Trident-2" sea-launched strategic missiles. Interest in the Baltic and Black Seas has also increased in other states. Remember, however, that the appearance of a regular navy in Russia was prompted by an historical task, to penetrate the community of European states. Peter the First, after building St. Petersburg and creating the navy, had formed a great European power. Since then Russian has not been a guest in Europe, but an equal partner. Cooperation with European countries supported commercial and other interests in the Mediterranean. With the help of the navy dispatched from the Baltic, the Far East, Alaska, and Russian America were conquered. For Russia, remaining in the community of European states means having an army to protect it from possible invasion from the West and having freedom of navigation in the Baltic Sea. The latter must come from the small but combat-ready forces of the Baltic Feet. Here one must remember that during the Great Patriotic War, in the Northwest Strategic Axis the goals of the war were achieved through the joint efforts of the fronts, the navy, long-range aviation, and the National Air Defense Forces. Russia's second geopolitical task has been and remains the furtherance of free trade of states at the crossroads of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. The annexation of the Crimea and the creation of the Black Sea Fleet met the needs of rapid development of the southern regions of the state. Rivalry with Turkey, England and France in this region led to wars, the demise of the fleet and its new restoration. Now the Near East is an enormous storehouse of oil. It is also a tangle of ethnic, religious and cultural contradictions, as was demonstrated by the Arab-Israel wars and the punitive operations against Iraq ("Desert Storm"), effected from naval and ground axes. For Russia, remaining a Black Sea power is an historical, unending task. How can it be achieved without reliance on the base system in the Crimea, after losing the ship-building capacity in the south of the former USSR? Clearly we must continue to look for new forms of cooperation with Ukraine and the other Black Sea states. It has developed historically that in Russian foreign policy, Far-Eastern and Pacific problems derived from European-Atlantic problems. The flood of international capital into Southeast Asia, and in particular to China, led Russia to create the Pacific Fleet, and resulted in two wars with Japan. Now in this region the task clearly is not to "ensure full superiority" but to maintain a reasonable balance of forces between the U.S., Japan, China and Russia. According to reports from the SMI [not further expanded], all ship-building plants have stopped running in the Far East, and without them there can be neither military bases nor a fleet. At present public opinion supports the idea of a need to create more mobile and better armed forces. In this we cannot help but allow for past experience. In the 20th century, Russia (the USSR) participated in two world wars without having concluded the formation of an ocean-going fleet. This made the "Russian front" very dependent on the status of the battle in the European-Atlantic and Asiatic-Pacific theaters of war. Retention of naval might exerted a great influence on the results of wars. In the period of the postwar confrontation and the "Cold War," the USSR constructed a powerful ocean-going fleet, but excessive military expenditures, including those for the fleet, were one of the causes of profound economic crisis. We should support in every way the proposal of Gennadiy Voronin regarding the need to discuss the question of the navy before adopting a 10-to-15-year ship-building program and assigning the appropriations, not only in the Security Council but also in the Parliament. We need a Law on the Navy. The situation of the navy is so serious that perhaps its rescue should be started with the formation of an independent Ministry of the Navy.
