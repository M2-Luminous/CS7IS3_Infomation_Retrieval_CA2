FBIS3-5845 "dreas048__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-048-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 March 1994 ANNEX Japan EIAJ Issues Report on Semiconductor Market OW1003132094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1003132094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] "For foreign semiconductor manufacturers to expand their market share in Japan, they must tackle the consumer electronic products sector, selling more discrete semiconductor devices, for instance." That is the conclusion of a report prepared by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ; chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto), which looked at the relationship between conditions in the Japanese semiconductor market and market shares of foreign-made semiconductors in Japan. Copies of the report have been distributed to U.S. Government offices and U.S. manufacturers. With statistics on the Japanese market share of foreign-made semiconductors in 1993 expected to be announced soon, and with intergovernmental talks expected to begin shortly, the association, through the report, is seeking the understanding of the U.S. industry of Japanese market conditions and is urging U.S. industry to increase its own efforts. The report has five parts, and runs to more than 60 pages in English. So far, parts one and two have been distributed, and the remainder of the report will be issued by the end of next week. The association said it had taken about half a year to prepare. Copies are being sent to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), manufacturers affiliated with the SIA, U.S. Government offices, research organizations, and news media organizations in the United States. The report presents the trend of market share held by Japanese and foreign semiconductors in the consumer product and in industrial product areas from 1990 up to the third quarter of 1993. It claims that in that period the market share of foreign semiconductors grew from 12.8 percent to 16.7 percent of the total semiconductor market in the industrial product area and from 2.9 percent to 5.5 percent in the consumer product area. But the breakdown of products bought in the second and third quarters of 1993 shows that among foreign semiconductors, integrated circuits for bipolar-type digital-processing, which account for only 5 percent of the total Japanese market, held the largest share. These circuits are used mostly as logic elements in computers. On the other hand, the foreign share of the less-integrated, discrete semiconductor devices, which account for more than 20 percent of the total Japanese market, was only 6.2 percent. The report notes that while the consumer semiconductor market accounts for less than 5 percent of the total U.S. semiconductor market, it represents about 40 percent of the total Japanese market. The report therefore suggests that foreign semiconductors can win a bigger share by putting the emphasis on sales of semiconductors in this area -- primarily by increasing sales of discrete devices. As an illustration of the openness of the Japanese market, the report also points out that instances of foreign semiconductor makers cooperating with Japanese finished-product makers from the design-in stage jumped six-fold in the six years between 1986 and 1992.
