We are presenting a radio interview with the chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Batono Eduard, the Abkhazian side again violated an agreement, the Geneva Memorandum last week. In addition, the work of the commission for drawing up the statute of Abkhazia, held in Moscow under UN auspices and with the participation of the CSCE, was virtually fruitless. Jointly with Yeltsin you have addressed Butrus Ghali, emphasizing that all chances of a peaceful settlement should be tried. [Words indistinct] said on TV that any political decision is better than war. And if this does not produce a result, if the killing of the civilian population continues, what way will remain? [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I would not say that the Moscow talks on a statute for Abkhazia were a complete failure. Generally, talks about the statute will be complex and [words indistinct]. The next stage should be in Geneva on the 22d and I think the issue will be clearer then. As for the principal problem of the issue, I mean an overall settlement of the conflict, I believe there should be no doubt that we were right to have chosen a peaceful way toward a settlement from the very beginning in spite of the fact that it appeared to be ineffective. A peaceful way is the best and most reassuring way to settle conflicts in our time. Those who can analyze all that has been happening on our planet for the last 20, 30, or 40 years will be convinced that a peaceful settlement is the most reliable way. Both the Russian president and I were guided by this as we appealed to the UN Secretary General to have international peacekeeping forces in their classical form deployed or, if that were impossible, a Russian contingent would be a major force there. Every opportunity should be used. I realize that many people feel upset when I keep speaking of a peaceful settlement to the conflict. I am not really surprised that this can upset someone whose house has been burned down and who does not know when he will be able to return home. He will naturally be looking for an extreme decision, which in his opinion could represent an earlier return home and the beginning of a normal life. But this is a superficial impression which is created by emotions and it cannot be fruitful. I would like to say the following. If we fail to bring in peacekeeping forces -- and this is the only way out and the shortest way to peace -- if we fail to bring in peacekeeping forces, (although I believe that this can be done as a result of consultations in New York and other capitals), if this fails and proves useless, everyone should remember that if this proves to be ineffectual, the worst thing will happen, there will be bloodshed. I see this as a dreadful prospect. This will happen spontaneously irrespective of the will of the Georgian authorities or bodies of other countries. Processes will become uncontrollable and the conflict will spread over large areas, however grave it might be to think of this. Everyone should understand this. As I say this I mean our listeners, the listeners of our country, I mean the Abkhazian leaders who are in Gudauta and Sukhumi, and of course members of the UN Security Council and Russia in the first instance, because Russia has understood the reality of this danger of the spread of the conflict over large areas. Regardless of what we want, additional forces will be dragged into the conflict and this would be a disaster not only for Georgia but for this big region as a whole. [Oniani] You say that Russia understood it partially and this was felt when several members of the Russian State Duma made a statement on television last night. Almost the same ideas were expressed. However, a politician differs from an ordinary mortal by the need to take unpopular decisions without being guided by emotions. At a parliament sitting you said that the Abkhazian issue could not be settled without Russia's participation. Your and Yeltsin's appeal says that if UN forces cannot be deployed in the conflict zone, Russia is ready for this. We are said to be asking Russia to do what Russia itself has taken an interest in. [Shevardnadze] I would like to make the official Russian stance clear. Either international forces in their classical form arrive, and Russia agrees to the participation of the international forces and it will cooperate with the forces even by being a part of those, or it will make a commitment to bring in its contingent on a peace mission. There is no other way. If we speak of a peace settlement, there should be either international forces or a Russian contingent. There is a third way, I mean another decision can be taken within the CIS but this will apparently be a repetition of a Tajik model. And this is obviously not quite desirable. It is difficult to argue against the righteousness of this stance. I mean the Russian statement that supports the introduction of international forces but, if that is not possible, Russia will undertake to bring in its contingent. It is really difficult to argue against this. We ourselves are primarily interested in what we are asking Russia to do. The idea that we are asking Russia to do what Russia is interested in can be reversed like this: We are asking Russia to do what we ourselves are interested in. No other way out can be seen. [Oniani] One deputy has suggested that Russia close off the border and we shall fix Abkhazia. [Shevardnadze] There is that idea. But this request is rather naive and I think the main point is what I have just said. [Oniani] I would like to remind you of your words said at the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. The whole country should turn toward the economy. A morbid politization of our community is a deviation from the proper coursel. An anticrisis government program was made public last week. How effective do you think this program will be and how likely do you think the government crisis or even resignation is in the near future in the light of numerous complaints against the government and an idea that our government is not a unified team? [Shevardnadze] The presented program is a maximum of current abilities. All existing forces participated in the work; I mean ministries, agencies, institutes, individual experts, and so on. The work took months. I also joined at the final stage and I was also involved, in a way. The principal thing is that the country should really turn toward the economy and everyone should care about the economy and think and care about escaping from the crisis. The presented program is realistic. I said in a speech that an optimistic scenario was mentioned as well as a pessimistic scenario. I can say that the maximal version is a realistic one. But it can be realistic only if we are able to find additional resources to overcome the energy crisis. Armenia receives several-fold less power and fuel and they run 70 percent of their industry. The population experiences extreme hardships there but they all realize that if the economy stopped the country would lose all prospects for the future. I do not mean that we can still take something away from the population but we obviously have to look for additional resources, additional sources of fuel and power. This could be received either through foreign credits or other ways, such as through relations with Russia or with Iran and a lot of other ways. As for an idea that there is not a unified team, I am not aware of anyone in Georgia who is capable of summoning his people and creating a united team. I think these ideas create a very primitive image of a team. A team cannot be created just like that. In order to create a team, like-minded people, people who understand each other easily are needed and, in addition, a very high professional level should be guaranteed and this takes years. It needs years of experience and sometimes decades. Thus, we cannot demand that the present authorities do something that is very difficult and almost impossible to do. We have not got an ideal and strong team like this at the moment but, anyway, the present Cabinet of Ministers is the most we could afford in a difficult situation like this. As for a government crisis, there will probably be certain complications during the endorsement of the members of the government by the parliament. I would like to ask everyone to refrain from extreme demands. A government crisis will make the desperate situation in the economy even more complicated and difficult. Those who put forward revolutionary slogans demanding, in particular, that the Cabinet of Ministers be replaced, certain statesmen resign and so on are driving the country to a deeper crisis. It is impossible that a person learn how to be a minister in just three or four months. This should be realized. When we were changing the previous Cabinet, I was against it because one needs at least one or two years to have an idea about one's department. That is why we have to take care of the people and we have to be more kind to individual statesmen and even to the Cabinet. Today, we have to be guided by a common responsibility rather than by a desire to amuse ourselves. Unfortunately, the latter is often observed in one part of the community and especially in the parliament. [Oniani] I would like to recall yet another point from your speech at the Cabinet of Ministers. You said: We have to introduce private ownership as soon as possible. There are people in the government, including the staff of the head of state, who hamper the activities of entrepreneurs. Incidentally, the mafia is not happy because of the development of entrepreneurship in Georgia, either. They have a significant network and not only in our republic, unfortunately. [Shevardnadze] Speaking of the country's development in the long run, of course proprietors, businessmen, industrialists should be considered as major components of the society required for the expansion of the economy. We have to do our best to switch to the market economy as soon as possible. I agree with you that this idea scares certain structures and it scares the mafia, too, because a proprietor has a well-developed sense of responsibility and aspiration to protect his own property, which is the basis of his personal happiness. Despite the opposition, this process must be sped up and it will be sped up. Apart from that, our population has to realize that something should be done so that a proprietor, an entrepreneur will not become a leech. An antagonistic attitude to leeches can be observed in people at the initial stage. We have to support and help the establishment of serious business and the preparation of a whole school of businessmen, the businessmen who will come forward thanks to their intelligence, cleverness, and hard work rather than dishonest ways. The earlier we manage to establish businesslike ties and have such proprietors on the scene, the sooner the country will find a way to improve the situation. [Oniani] You accepted the defense minister's resignation last week and temporarily assumed the duties of minister. I would like to recall your words at the meeting with the army high command. I have been quoting you very often today but this is due to necessity. The state has to provide for the army. The army cannot exist on charity or depend on someone's mood. The army cannot be built on sand. You also spoke about building a modern Georgian Army. On what is your optimism based? Is there a basis in Georgia to allow the building of a new army? [Shevardnadze] When I speak about a new army I do not mean that those who are in the armed forces now have to quit and new people have to come in. When speaking with a certain optimism that we will soon have a truly modern national army, I mean the cadres who comprise the basis of our army now and who already have combat experience. Many of those are model heroes and brave fighters fully devoted to the interests of the country. We were defeated but this loss is also a certain experience which this generation has acquired. This is obviously one of the bases for my optimism. The main thing is that we have cadres. Second, there are people, I mean in our community, who realize the importance of the army and its purpose for the building of an independent state. I believe that youth will say a decisive word in the building of the army. I will do my best to make military service the highest duty, an honorable mission, and even a kind of privilege for the best of our youths. My direct and active involvement in this process is due to my desire to use all my power and rights and have the army built on a legal basis and financed through legal sources. And this should improve two- and three-fold the conditions of the servicemen rather than aggravate them. I did not use the word privilege accidentally. Speaking of the army I also mean border guards, interior troops, and all [word indistinct]. [Oniani] And a final question. An Armenian delegation led by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is arriving in Georgia today. What is the chief purpose of this visit and is it not linked with an idea you expressed during President Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, namely, that it is necessary that leaders of the three large Transcaucasian states meet regularly to handle conflicts in the area. Plus Russia. [Shevardnadze] We agreed to meet before. The Armenian president was in London and he asked me to arrange this meeting as soon as he returned. I spoke to Mr. Aliyev as well as Mr. Ter-Petrosyan about the necessity of such meetings. All three of us share a view that the meetings; regular, systematic meetings are essential. These may start on a bilateral basis and then later all three of us will probably meet. Then Russia as well as other countries will be able to join us. Obviously, a major topic will be a Caucasian dialogue and how promising, how reassuring, and realistic the beginning of a Caucasian dialogue will be. Speaking of dialogue, I do not mean an ordinary conversation. I mean a certain (?quorum) which will be regulated chronologically; in other words we will meet two or three times a year and discuss problems. In addition, bilateral relations could predominate today, problems that concern the two countries. We will have a serious conversation. We have many interests in Armenia, and the Armenians strongly depend on how well the Georgian communications network works. I would like to add that Mr. Aliyev will not be involved in our present dialogue personally but I have had preliminary talks with him and after my meeting with the Armenian president has ended, my meeting with the Azernaijani president will take place. I think we are approaching the phase when our contacts are to become more vigorous and we have to do our best so that the Caucasian factor will play its decisive role in fighting for peace and stability in the region.
