This is the second round of talks in the U.S. capital after U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. These two rounds of talks are significantly different from the discussions during the past 11 rounds because of the semiopen nature that has been granted to these two rounds of talks. A State Department spokesman has also described the Arab-Israeli talks as unofficial. This shows that the nature of the current talks is actually midway between Israel's persistent call for unofficial and closed talks with Syria and Syria's insistence on official and open talks within the framework of international regulations. Israel is seeking to repeat the experience of the secret PLO-Israeli talks with Syria as well. However, Damascus, which has strongly criticized this behavior by the PLO and Israel, does not want to give in. The second round of the semiovert talks in Washington has started away from the limelight at a time when a suitable political atmosphere for compromise is not discernible. Syria, which had described the signing of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule accord in Washington between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv as a blow to the Middle East peace process, has described the recent PLO-Israeli agreement as a new tragedy. Damascus has also stated in advance that any expectation for progress in the current talks is useless. The Zionist regime too has called for a postponement of the talks or raising the level of the talks. Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the occupying regime, has called for a meeting between the heads of Tel Aviv and Damascus. But Syria's political officials say that with this request, Israel is trying to escape from the content of the talks and to stick only to the form of the talks. The Washington talks concerning Jordan and Palestine are at a standstill because of the signing of agreements, while the parts concerning Syria and Lebanon do not present a very hopeful outlook because of Israel's stances, especially when the experience of the PLO-Israeli accord has not been able to gain much popularity either.
