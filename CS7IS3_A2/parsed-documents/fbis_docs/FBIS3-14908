The entire world shuddered in February of 1988 as it witnessed the genocide of fanatical savagery. The name Sumgait became the symbol of atrocity, death, and horror. It also became a shameful testimony to the unhealthy and inhuman nature of illusive prosperity and society. Because this crime committed against humanity and civilization failed to obtain a deserving assessment, it became an ill-omened precedent and evolved into a shortsighted state policy. The same plan, crime, inhuman and unnatural logic was put to work in Sumgait, Kirtovabad [Ganja], Baku, Getashen, and Shaumyan. That notorious neocolonialist doctrine of using force to drown the national self-determination issue in blood became the main cause of the misfortunes and sufferings of hundreds of thousands of Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the last six years. The sharpened iron bars and knives used by the brutish mob of Sumgait were eventually replaced by firearms, then by Grads and grenades, and by powerful tanks and supersonic bombers. Not only tens of thousands of young men and innocent people were thrown into the melee of war, but also thousands of mercenaries and soldiers of fortune. It is long overdue that the Sumgait syndrome be shaken off, and the condemnable behavior of solving human rights issues and interethnic problems by resorting to the use of force be abandoned. Remaining true to the international norms of behavior, guided by the principles adopted by the UN, CSCE and other international and regional organizations for the peaceful resolution of contentious issues through political talks, proceeding from the state policy of establishing good-neighborly relations with all the neighbors, the Armenian Republic's authorities hereby express their determination to find a peaceful resolution to the Karabakh problem. They call upon the Azerbaijani leadership to refrain from the further escalation and internationalization of the conflict and instead welcome the establishment of a stable cease-fire and the peace- making initiatives for the political settlement of Karabakh problem. They call upon the leadership to refrain from undermining them yet again and from causing new privations and suffering to the two neighboring peoples so as not leave new black Sumgaitian pages to history.
