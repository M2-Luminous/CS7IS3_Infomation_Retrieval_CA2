In his discussion of the study results, Mr. Saul explained that the four values in excess of 0.2 f/cc resulted from: a removal in which wet methods could not be employed, wetting painted surfaces, removing and wetting metal enclosed pipe lagging, and improperly sealing of a mini-enclosure. He further concluded that these data indicate that the work practices used by these workers are generally effective during these maintenance-type asbestos activities.
