Only in such a country would Tansu Ciller, without even minimal administrative experience, have the chance to become prime minister. Making Mrs. Ciller prime minister was a very risky investment. As in all risky investments, those who hoped to be the big winners were the ones who portrayed Ciller as the "savior." Unfortunately, these hopes were not realized. Quite the opposite, Turkey has become a country where the risks of Mrs. Ciller's administration are steadily growing. Actually, the collapse of the Turkish lira and spiraling interest are the results of this growing risk. At the point where we are now, the risk of continuing with Mrs. Ciller and this government increases every day and is reflected in the marketplace. It seems nearly impossible to eliminate this risk and turn this negative course around. Even those in the business world and finance sector where almost everyone has lost morale, who were laid back just two months ago, saying, "Oh, really, is the country going under again?" are now frowning and worrying, "Where are we going, how are going to get out of this mess?" Various solutions are being proposed in seeking an answer to this question. For example, many agree that the only way out of the impasse in the economy and financial markets is through a medium-term program. The following are the major conditions necessary for such a program to be successful: - This program would be based on as widespread as possible a social compromise, or consensus. - A well-informed and experienced team would prepare this program. - A government that would not be frightened by daily problems into swerving from the program and that would be determined not to make concessions would implement this program. - The government would be fully trusted to carry out the program. Now let us think sincerely: Which of the conditions necessary to prepare and implement such a program can the Ciller government fulfill? Can this government, which cannot even reach consensus on an Ataturk rally, be expected to reach a consensus on a stabilization program requiring the fair distribution of heavy obligations? Mrs. Ciller has no one in her stable who is knowledgeable and experienced. Recently, Mrs. Ciller has pursued only those things oriented to saving the day and earning her political points. She is trying to use the state-owned banks in a way that totally violates the concept of a stabilization program. No one trusts the Ciller government anymore. Mrs. Ciller, who is at the point of not knowing what to do, is believed to be under the influence of various interests and circles. Every measure this government would take would, in this climate, be met with suspicion and everyone would ask, "Who is it for?" In a climate in which "devaluation" and "consolidation" are on the agenda, everyone seeks ways to escape the calamity. The concern that Mrs. Ciller may take on new adventures at home or abroad feeds the climate of instability. In short, the "Ciller risk" is preventing a solution and devaluing the Turkish lira.
