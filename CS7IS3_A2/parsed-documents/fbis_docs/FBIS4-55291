The federation's external borders have been fixed, insomuch as the Croat and Muslim demands to the Serbs and to the international community are concerned. The internal cantonal organization, as well as the organization of the federation's and the government's leadership, have also been agreed upon. The reports we have received say that the federation will have eight cantons, but it has not yet been agreed which ones will be purely Croat and which ones purely Muslim. All that is known is that four will go to the Muslims and two to the Croats. Some reports say that the Croatian cantons will include western Herzegovina and upper Posavina. Two cantons will be mixed. Tihomir Vinkovic has this report: [Vinkovic] The agreement will formally be signed in Geneva on Saturday, 14 May. Kresimir Zubak, head of the Bosnian Croat delegation, said after the talks that the first president of the Bosniak-Muslim federation for the period of six months will be a Croat, while the first prime minister will be a Bosniak. Six of the 17 government ministries will go to Croats. The federation will encompass 58 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina over eight cantons. Croat people will constitute a majority in two cantons, Muslim people in four, while two will be mixed. The mixed cantons--one in central Bosnia with a seat in Travnik, and the other in the Neretva River basin with a seat in Mostar--will be administered on a parity basis in accordance with the 1991 census. Zubak thanked the U.S. Embassy for its good services during the talks. He also thanked U.S. mediator Charles Redman and U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina Viktor Jakovich. Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic said that this is a major step toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also a major step toward the preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Silajdzic added. He expressed hope that not just Croats and Bosniaks, but also all those who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina as their homeland, will work toward the implementation of this agreement. He assessed the internal borders to be very democratic. Silajdzic also said it was a provisional agreement that will be submitted for adoption to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. Asked by a journalist whether the Serbs would agree to return part of the territory they had conquered so that the Croat-Bosniak federation could encompass 58 percent, Silajdzic said he hoped for help from the international community, which will not tolerate genocide. As a confederal partner, I wish to congratulate Bosniaks and Croats on the serious talks and the agreement that I witnessed, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said. It is in Croatia's interest that this agreement is implemented, Minister Granic said in conclusion.
