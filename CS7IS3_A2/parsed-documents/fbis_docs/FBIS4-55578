As expected, the talks focused on the recent ministerial meeting (Russia, United States, EU) in Geneva and the agreement on ending hostilities in the whole of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was confirmed by David Owen, who gave a brief statement after the talks with Slobodan Milosevic, which lasted almost three hours. David Owen, who was in an unusually good mood, which is not completely irrelevant in such situations, first described the talks with Slobodan Milosevic as "very good." "The talks focused on ending the hostilities in the whole of Bosnia," Lord Owen said, adding this was "the highest priority issue." According to Owen, Gorazde is currently the biggest problem, because, as he said, the agreement was still being violated there. "We hope these problems will be eliminated within the next 24 hours and that the belligerent sides will attend talks with the UN secretary general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, on ending hostilities, to which they had almost agreed. The two cochairmen will discuss these and other problems this afternoon with president of the republic of Srpska Radovan Karadzic. Lord Owen said he would "probably" hold talks with Karadzic, but did not specify where. It is unofficially reported that they are to meet in Zvornik. Owen said he would discuss the proposed 51:49 percent territorial division and the maps with Karadzic. The issue of sanctions was also discussed in the talks with Slobodan Milosevic. Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg reiterated the position contained in the Geneva communique that "sanctions will be eased after the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb forces from the agreed positions." "There is a very clear link between the agreement on ending the hostilities, the withdrawal of troops, and the easing and lifting of the sanctions," Lord Owen said. Asked about his opinion of the controversial decision by the U.S. Senate regarding the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, Lord Owen said the decision was "contradictory in some way." "It remains to be seen whether this proposal will appear either before the House of Representatives or the Senate itself. I believe that this will probably not happen," he added. After the talks with Karadzic this afternoon, the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia are returning to Belgrade. According to Owen they are to travel to Zagreb tomorrow, where they will meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.
