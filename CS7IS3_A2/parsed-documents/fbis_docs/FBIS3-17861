Even a Name"] [Text] Tbilisi -- The Transcaucasus Border District has changed its name. It is now called the Caucasus Special Border District. The change of name reflects the need to pursue a unified border policy in the Caucasus as a whole. The district's troop directorate has been relocated from Tbilisi to Stavropol. "The directorate of the `Gruziya' troop group of Russian border troops will function in Tbilisi," Colonel V. Chistousov, chief of the troop group, said. "None of the units has left the territory of Georgia, and each of them is continuing to guard the border in the same structure. I hope that attacks on border subunits, the taking of motor vehicles, and hostage taking are a thing of the past and that the attitude toward those who defend Georgia's interests on the border will change." During last year alone approximately 100 intruders were detained by Russian border guards on the Georgian-Turkish border. But there are no grounds for complacency. Georgian Security Minister I. Georgadze declared in an interview with the newspaper SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA that all the preconditions exist for the republic to be able to become a major transshipment point for the transit of drugs to Europe and America from Asian countries. Tasks of guarding the border are resolved jointly with the Georgian Border Troops Department. An agreement has been signed on the procedure for manning the Russian Federation border troops and for the performance of military service on a voluntary basis by citizens of Georgia on the republic's territory. It is planned to draft up to 600 people in the fall. In the opinion of the chief of the "Gruziya" troop group, the agreement will create a favorable basis for forming Georgia's own border troops.
