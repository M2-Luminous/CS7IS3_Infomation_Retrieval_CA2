Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said in a press conference that "Hosokawa's office made me out to be like a criminal, using me as a tool to make Premier Hosokawa look clean." From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds and gained profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen, according to Kuwahata. Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds, in spite of Hosokawa's citing "new suspicions" over the legality of his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation. He said he did not invest the funds on the black market. Some newspapers have reported that a former secretary of the late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka introduced him to Hosokawa's financial secretary. Kuwahata, however, said an "ordinary person" who has since died introduced him to Hosokawa around 1980 when Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member of the Liberal Democratic Party. In investing Hosokawa's funds, Kuwahata promised him an annual interest rate of 12 percent, he said. "I did not care if I made a loss, because I thought of it as a political donation," Kuwahata said. Hosokawa told a news conference Friday, "from 1981 and for several years, my office let a certain person use the funds, and he gained personal profit from them. That person is an old personal friend of mine." The premier declined, however, to elaborate on the specifics of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political office was still under way.
