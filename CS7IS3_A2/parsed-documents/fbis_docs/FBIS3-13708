Anger still prevails there after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Security Council has not yet adopted a resolution condemning the massacre or meeting the minimum level of Palestinian demands. U.S. President Bill Clinton received Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but the meeting produced nothing that meets Palestinian demands. What are your expectations following the Clinton-Rabin meeting? [Qaddumi] After studying and scrutinizing the situation, and following the talks between Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. President Clinton, it is clear that Israel does not intend to take measures that will provide the necessary protection for our people. Therefore, we expect psychological tension to increase and fabricated local differences to escalate. The Israeli enemy will create seditions and local differences, as it did previously when it faced such impasses. It will practice the ugliest forms of repression and coercion. It will strike at our national unity and social cohesion to cover up the crimes committed by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It will claim that Palestinians cannot run their own affairs or maintain their national security, in order to prolong the occupation and to (?implement) its plan in the occupied territory. I believe the overall fabricated incidents that have taken place in some areas in the West bank and Gaza over the past few months show the Israeli plan to create internal conflicts is being implemented. Therefore, we -- as individuals and groups inside the occupied territory -- must be patient in tackling the local events and not resort to weapons at all in tackling political and social differences. Only the Israeli enemy benefits from this. [Words indistinct] the entire Palestinian leadership categorically rejects the use of weapons against any Palestinian citizen and stresses the need to resort to officials and wise men to prevent any bloodshed. Prophet Muhammad prevents Muslims from fighting each other. Therefore, we expect the Israelis' reaction to be negative, because they agreed with the United States not to take any measures. This means they are moving toward dealing a blow to the whole peace process. There will be no peace in the region. [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, Yitzhaq Rabin called from Washington, and today from Rome, for a speedy resumption of negotiations with the Palestinians. He also stressed the need to resume negotiations with Syria and the other Arab parties to the peace negotiations. In your view, what are the prospects for the Middle East peace process, in light of the available facts? [Qaddumi] Yitzhaq Rabin has narrowed the chances for peace in the region. It seems that, with U.S. consent, he is going ahead with his scheme of striking at the political settlement and terminating the honest international efforts to boost the peace process. He postponed withdrawal and used immense pressure to control security at the crossings. Israel does not want peace. It continues to devour the land and commit crimes against Palestinian citizens. Israel has lost its so-called democratic face. It is a racist state, just like South Africa. [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, after it surfaced that there are major difficulties facing the Oslo agreement and that this agreement will not be implemented as scheduled on 13 April, in your view, is there a possibility that the Palestinians might give up on the Oslo agreement and return to the formula of collective Arab dealing with the Middle East peace process? [Qaddumi] What is the point of going ahead with the Oslo agreement if Israel violates most of its articles? This cannot be called an agreement. They want the Palestinian people to succumb. They want to prolong the occupation. Therefore, they have torn the agreement into pieces with their heinous behavior and their terrorist practices. I believe that after this massacre, which has been completely condemned by the world, the world has a major responsibility to maintain peace and security in the region and to preserve human rights. It must be noted that every day, Israel hammers more nails into the coffin of the Oslo agreement. Israel proposed the agreement. Now it is trying to bury it. [Salamah] What is the alternative, brother Abu-al-Lutf? [Qaddumi] The constant alternative is continued struggle, whether or not there is an agreement. As long as an Israeli soldier occupies Palestinian territory, it is our right to defend ourselves. This is a sacred right approved by international law and the UN Charter. [Salamah] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, thank you for this interview with Radio Monte Carlo. [Qaddumi] Thank you, brother Salah.
