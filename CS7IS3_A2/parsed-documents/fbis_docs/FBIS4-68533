On the surface, the agenda looked more trivial than intriguing: "Incidents of the Flagrant Violation of Tax and Labor Laws by Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia." On the surface, it seemed as though this would lead to the same kind of banal arguments that were once heard in the USSR Committee of People's Control. Just imagine, the chief of the tax inspectorate was dismissed, reinstated by a court, and then driven out of office again. Is this kind of labor dispute a matter for discussion by the Committee on Security? In fact, questions of this kind were the "warm-up exercises" of a group of committee members: Must we, they asked, become involved in this? Would it not be better to send the files to judicial agencies? And why did some of us receive the information late? Would it not be better to form a commission to review all of this? Committee Chairman V. Ilyukhin, who also chaired the hearings, dismissed the unfounded complaints and called for constructive work. We journalists and the members of the committee were handed a thick pile of documents providing an excellent illustration of the criminal history of the discussion topic. Incidentally, PRAVDA reported it in an article entitled "Why Is Filippov in Charge?" on 14 December last year. Now some new facts of the case have come to light. Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov is one of the administrators whom the so-called "democrats" described with what they perceived as the offensive term "party nomenklatura." Suffice it to say that he was sent by the Komsomol Central Committee to head the BAM [Baykal-Amur Trunk Line Project] staff and was serving as secretary of the Leningrad Party Obkom in charge of industrial affairs in August 1991 before the overthrow of the CPSU. During the years of "reform" he put together a tax inspectorate in Leningrad literally from scratch--an absolutely new and unfamiliar undertaking. He repeatedly said that this structure was completely depoliticized: All forms of ownership, he said, are the same to us. The important thing is the observance of the laws and the payment of taxes. The press has had enough to say about the concealment of income by cooperative managers--the former "saviors of the economy." They had planned to use the same little tricks when they turned their shops into small businesses, private enterprises, and joint ventures, but how were they to conceal dividends from Filippov and his people, who were well aware of the potential of each large and small plant in the city? Filippov also set up a tax police force to investigate cases of unreported income and went after the street vendors who had no intention of complying with all of the edicts and decrees mandating the use of control cash registers. Soon people from dozens of oblasts were coming to him for advice. After all, this was something absolutely new! Even Mayor A. Sobchak held him up as an example, once saying approximately the following when he addressed the team of inspectors: "The State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg took shape quickly, and it is largely due to this that we do not have a budget deficit, and have even been able to do a great deal for people in the social sphere." This "great deal" consisted in subsidies for bread, benefits for low-income households, free breakfasts for schoolchildren, free transportation for senior citizens, and so forth. This actually turned out to be the key: By going after the businessmen who did not report their income and did not pay taxes, Filippov's service had supplemented the municipal and republic budgets considerably, but it soon became apparent that he was serving not the regime, but the teachers, health care personnel, students, and staffers of scientific establishments whose wages had always been held up by the government, forcing them to go on strike. Filippov had put together a team of competent and experienced inspectors, some of whom were rumored to have come from the KGB. All of the inspections, voluminous documents, fines, and penalties understandably irritated the schemers who had established so many enterprises, commercial structures, and private shops. The city's chief financial inspector began receiving calls from the mayor's office, advising him to "stop digging so deep." Here are just a few of the incidents he related to the committee: "When we went after a sacred cow, the Property Fund, we were absolutely stunned by the scales of the fraud we uncovered. Inspections revealed undistributed (in other words, concealed--Ed.) resources in the amount of 6.623 billion rubles. Of course, we charged them a penalty of almost 400 million and a fine of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. You can understand why they were annoyed. We also learned that 44,000 vouchers were inexplicably missing in this privatized establishment and that Fund Deputy General Director Fishkov had been arrested for a discrepancy of 134 million rubles in privatization checks.... "We also learned that the fund had privatized whole city blocks and port facilities in violation of the law, but the biggest surprise came later: The fund did not transfer all of its receipts to the proper account, but allowed commercial banks 'to make use of its money' at a ridiculously low rate of interest--a whole 2 percent! "We are not children, after all," Dmitriy Nikolayevich told the deputies, "and we have to understand that commercial agents are not being offered these unimaginable privileges just for their good looks." A genuine storm broke out when D. Filippov formed a special group to inspect the joint ventures. After all, he managed to go where most inspectors would not venture. And just imagine, the very first audit of the Europa Hotel revealed an amazing panorama of theft. This joint venture preferred to keep its dividends in Stockholm, naturally without contributing a single cent to our budget. The financial inspector fined the Swedes 5 million dollars, but as Dmitriy Nikolayevich put it, "it will take much more effort to force them to return the 25 million dollars that are working for the Swedish economy." The auditors also ruffled the feathers of "Lenraumamebel," the joint venture so dear to A. Sobchak's heart. This respected establishment was manufacturing furniture with cheap energy and manpower, from raw materials that were so inexpensive they were almost free, and selling 90 percent of it for hard currency abroad. The currency was then put in circulation there, promoting the "rebirth of Finland." "When we ordered the Finns to return the hard currency and pay the taxes," Filippov continued, "they sent a whole team of ambassadors and consuls after me. They accused me of trying to 'sabotage Yeltsin's policy.' I replied that I was supporting his policy by forcing them to abide by his edicts and our laws." I saw the journalists sitting around me exchange looks when the speaker added another detail to his account: The ambassadors and consuls insinuated that he had a choice of officials who would order him to leave their joint venture in peace. Did he want a call from Sobchak or from a member of the Russian Government? The call came soon.... On 11 October, after the well-known tragic events (which were immediately recalled by the people gathered there), Russia's Chief State Tax Inspector V. Gusev dismissed D. Filippov from his job without any explanation. Filippov was not intimidated and was soon reinstated by the Sverdlovskiy Rayon People's Court in Moscow. This was followed by a bureaucratic ruse we used to hear about in the days of the reprisals against undesirable people's controllers and other auditors: On 3 November the position occupied by D. Filippov in St. Petersburg was eliminated by order of V. Chernomyrdin himself. His duties were reassigned to another individual, who was given the title of deputy chief of the Russian State Tax Service. Who was this individual? We were told that he was a livestock breeder, a former sovkhoz director who later worked on the mayor's staff. Then the effusive Deputy A. Nevzorov addressed V. Gusev: "You removed a first-rate specialist from office, saying he was remiss in his duties. He probably has no equal in all of Mother Russia, and you replaced him with a man with no experience in auditing tax records or catching swindlers." The chief tax inspector turned red in the face and did not know how to respond to the subsequent barrage of questions. How had D. Filippov, whom he had praised earlier and held up as an example, suddenly become "unsatisfactory"? Who had made the phone call from the Council of Ministers to order his dismissal? If he was guilty of some kind of "negligence," then why did the order for his dismissal state "staff reduction" as the reason? In a message to State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin, the dismissed financial inspector named some specific reasons for his expulsion: "According to Deputy Chief Yu.M. Ulyanov of the Russian State Tax Service, the reasons were a letter from Mayor A.A. Sobchak of St. Petersburg and the pressure exerted by First Vice Premier Ye.T. Gaydar".... I could also cite an extremely intriguing excerpt from the report proposed by committee members and journalists. It says that A. Sobchak, A. Chubays, Ye. Gaydar, and former Minister of Finance V. Fedorov were involved in the "unwarranted" dismissal of V. Filippov from his job. This is the kind of leverage the offended ambassadors and consuls used to get rid of a financial inspector who was too intractable and too incorruptible! Chubays, Gaydar, and Fedorov did not grace the committee session with their presence, although they were invited to attend, and could not explain the "grounds for the dismissal." Representatives of the counterintelligence services, the Security Council, the tax police, and the RF Procuracy and deputies S. Govorukhin, Yu. Vlasov, A. Nevzorov, N. Krivelskaya, and other speakers discussed the widespread misappropriation of the country's natural resources and foreign currency and the colossal sums that have settled in foreign banks. Just as the chemical composition of the ocean can be judged from a single drop of water, speakers remarked, the plundering of Russia can be judged from this single case. And the most frightening aspect of the matter is that the incorruptible and highly professional specialist was objectionable to government officials. Then whom are they serving? This leads to the obvious conclusion that we are no longer the masters of our own country, now that a principled employee acting in the interest of his country can be dismissed from his job simply at the request of a foreign consul or ambassador. Summing up the debate, Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin had this to say: There is money in Russia. There is enough money for the miners, the students, and the teachers. But this money is being rerouted to commercial entities through artificial channels. What we are witnessing is the deliberate destruction of the state: Mutual nonpayments cause millions of people to suffer and stop the work of plants and factories. Much of the blame has to be accepted by the government, which, as we have seen, has little interest in supplementing the state treasury.
