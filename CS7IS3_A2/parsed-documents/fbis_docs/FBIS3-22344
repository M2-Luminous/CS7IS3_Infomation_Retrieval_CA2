At least, on New Year's Eve, our state literally poured diesel fuel to Slovakia. However, it was not our fault. An accident on the oil pipeline close to Polyana in Svalylavskiy Rayon became a real ecological disaster and caused a fuss around the world. [passage omitted] Some time ago, this pipeline secretly met the requirements of the defense industry of the Council for Mutual Economic Cooperation. Its headquarters is still located in Samara [in Russia], while its Transcarpathia Department is situated in Rovno [in Ukraine]. This department has two oil reservoirs -- in Dubrinichi village (Perechinskiy Rayon) and Rososhi village (Svalyavskiy Rayon). At 1500 on 30 December 1993, Samara began pumping oil under very high pressure. It is clear that a handmade pipe collar broke and diesel fuel made its way to Europe by way of the river. Unfortunately, the accident took place on 31 December, on New Year's Eve, when all the personnel were deep in thought sitting around the table. The State Department for Environmental Protection did everything possible to mobilize as many people as possible into action. [passage omitted] An enormous oil spill spread for kilometers and eventually crossed the state border. People who saw the Latoritsa River at that time, witnessed a terrible sight. The entire river was covered with foam and a layer of oil. Though the State Department for Environmental Protection phoned everyone, everywhere, the officials in Chop were not quick enough in closing the water-intake valves from the river. This was how diesel fuel got into the city water system, making the water unfit to drink. Even on 9 January, the Latoritsa River near Chop was still covered with oil. The environment has been irreversibly damaged. The safety measures cost a lot of money. However, this is just the beginning, because we cannot avoid international responsibility for the contamination of the river. The Slovaks promised to hold back, but this oil slick continued on to Hungary, so when Budapest makes out a bill to Bratislava for damages, we will have to pay it. [passage omitted] The Prosecutors' Office should put an end to such irresponsibility. Oil and gas pipelines should be properly guarded. This is an axiom. Otherwise, we will have not a flourishing Transcarpathia but a new Chernobyl monster.
