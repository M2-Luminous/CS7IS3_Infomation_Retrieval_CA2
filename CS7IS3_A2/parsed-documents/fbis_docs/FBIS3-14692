In a letter addressed to president Kim Il-Song through the North Korean ambassador in Amman, the IAF denounced U.S. attempts to conduct inspections on North Korea's nuclear programme at a time when Washington continues to provide unlimited assistance to the Jewish state by helping it to build up its own nuclear arsenal. The Americans continue to supply military assistance to the Israelis who continue to occupy Palestinian land and cause the dispersion of Palestinians throughout the world, said the letter. American threats levelled against North Korea remind us of the tragedy and the sufferings of the Iraqi people who continue to endure the consequences of the unjust war waged on them and the results of the embargo on its children and women, the letter continued. At the same time, it said, the Americans continue to pursue a policy aimed at humiliating the Iraqi people and devastating their potentials in order to prevent them from building for future generations. American threats levelled against North Korea, which refuses to succumb to Washington's hegemony, they said, also remind them of Washington's threats against Sudan, whose people suffer as a result of an embargo imposed since the emergence of an Islamic regime in the country, said the letter. In conjunction with the sanctions on Sudan is American continued support for the separatist movement in the South of the country a move which, the letter said, is designed to weaken the Sudanese people and keep them subjected and under American control. "While we express our total astonishment at the U.S. administration's insistence on conducting inspections on your nuclear programme through the help of the U.N. Security Council, which has become a tool in Washington's hands, we also note that the United States administration protects and enhances Israel's nuclear programme and an arsenal of hundreds of nuclear heads that perpetually threaten the Arab region's security," said the IAF. Such practices, concluded the letter, provide a stark evidence of the United States double standard policies.
