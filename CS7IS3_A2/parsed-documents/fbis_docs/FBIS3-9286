This was announced by Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and president of the Croat National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosiljka Bucan reports from the news conference at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb. [Bucan] Unlike other agreements on the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, the Washington agreement's clauses are precisely defined. They are, according to Ivo Komsic: [Komsic] "At midnight on Monday Bosnia-Herzegovina will have its new constitution and will begin to live according to the new constitution. According to the new constitution elections should be held in six months. Until then the assembly will be a constituent assembly and will pass only one law -- the election law." [Bucan] The Washington agreement is the basis for the resolution of the entire crisis. The Serb aggressor side can reject or accept the agreement. If they accept, they would have to do the following: [Komsic] "They must give up the objectives of their aggression and must try to recreate the prewar situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will be a very difficult and long process." [Bucan] The agreement introduces a new dimension in the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The military option was not considered and we hope for a political resolution of the problem.
