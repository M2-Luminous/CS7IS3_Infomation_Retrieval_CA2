FR940826-1-00013 FR940826-1-00001 To retain the add-back provision under the proposal recommended for adoption herein could only result in increasing the minimum Class II milk price. An analysis of what the Class II price would have been with and without an add-back provision reveals that in 1990 the add-back would have enhanced the effective Class II differential by 19 cents; for 1991 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 24 cents; for 1992 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 15 cents; and for 1993 the Class II differential would have been enhanced by 34 cents. Additionally, because this decision makes a clear break from the past in that Class II prices are more importantly coordinated with the Class I price, there remains no rational argument for its retention. The need for advance pricing, as well as the need for coordination with Class I price movements, means moving away from price coordination with the current month's Class III price. Both objectives can not be simultaneously satisfied. 2. Need for Emergency Action. On the basis of the record evidence and testimony, no emergency conditions could be ascertained that would warrant the omission of a recommended decision. Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certain interested parties. These briefs, proposed findings and conclusions, and the evidence in the record were considered in making the findings and conclusions set forth above. To the extent that the suggested findings and conclusions filed by interested parties are inconsistent with the findings and conclusions set forth herein, the requests to make such findings or reach such conclusions are denied for the reasons previously stated in this decision. General Findings The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the New England and other orders were first issued and when they were amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed, except where they may conflict with those set forth herein. (a) The tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act; (b) The parity prices of milk as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act are not reasonable in view of the price of feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk in the marketing areas, and the minimum prices specified in the tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, are such prices as will reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest; and (c) The tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, will regulate the handling of milk in the same manner as, and will be applicable only to persons in the respective classes of industrial and commercial activity specified in, marketing agreements upon which a hearing has been held; and (d) All milk and milk products handled by handlers, as defined in the tentative marketing agreements and the orders as hereby proposed to be amended, are in the current of interstate commerce or directly burden, obstruct, or affect interstate commerce in milk or its products. Recommended Marketing Agreements and Orders Amending the Orders The recommended marketing agreements are not included in this decision because the regulatory provisions thereof would be the same as those contained in the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended. The following order amending the orders, as amended, regulating the handling of milk in the New England and other marketing areas is recommended as the detailed and appropriate means by which the foregoing conclusions may be carried out.
