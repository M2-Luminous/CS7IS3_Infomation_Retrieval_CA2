This is because the most comprehensive and profound concept of budget ramifications, such as political spending, must not stop at the numbers only, but rather must consider far-reaching ramifications of many indicators, as well as local and international factors, on the Kingdom's financial strategy. Some of these realities were clearly raised in the new budget, and the influence of certain others will not lag far behind in the circumstances of the coming stage. One of the most important facets of the 1994 budget is, undoubtedly, the considerable cut in government spending (20 percent), which is down to 160 billion Saudi riyals [R] ($42 billion). In our view, this rate of reduction means a drop in expectations for the Saudi masses, in general, in the next few years while, at the same time, creating a basis for permitting the Saudi Government once again to realize a surplus in the budget, which it can use to eliminate part of the general debt, currently estimated at 52 percent of the gross domestic product. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance, if it wishes, can now maintain this rate of spending over the next few years, or increase it moderately, profiting from any improvement in oil prices and the Kingdom's oil revenues, in order to achieve a surplus to be used to reduce the debt and the cost of financing that debt. The Ministry of Finance has decided to use this option, or to combine it with other means to increase state revenues (such as privatization of certain public organizations), or stretching out the expenditures on certain "flexible" budget items, such as spending for defense systems, etc. However, the important thing is that lowering the level of spending will allow the Saudi Government to have an immediate response to the problem of oil prices and, at the same time, expand its ability to move in the future toward reviving the financial situation in light of the possibility of improvement in oil prices. It could perhaps be useful to repeat here what we said in a previous year, to the effect that the most important factor concerning the Saudi budget is that--despite its importance--it is no longer the singular event on which the future direction of Saudi Arabia depends. In fact, the budget used to be the decisive event in the first stages of the development process and in providing the infrastructure. However, the Saudi state's biggest accomplishments have been completed. In its efforts to lessen the citizens' and businessmen's dependence on the government, it has succeeded in making the budget just one among many factors that affect the economy's movement. For two decades, the state itself has overseen, under King Fahd's personal direction, the composition and growth of a domestic sector that increasingly expands and matures each year. Every means has been used to encourage it to play a leading role in stimulating the economy. Therefore, because of private sector investments, we see the importance of the government's burden regarding the stimulation of the economy, becoming slightly smaller with each new budget. It is sufficient for us to look at the considerable growth in the Saudi financial market and the movement to capitalize organizations and companies, in order to realize the extent of basic development that has suddenly occurred in the country. In the past, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and its generous loans, was an indispensable factor in the establishment of projects. Now, the fund has begun to finance its own projects and does not now cost the state any additional resources. Moreover, the ratio of its participation in providing subsidized and long-term financing is gradually lessening. Despite that, it has provided excellent opportunities for profit, creating corporations specializing in investment and creating projects through the increased participation of private capital without, at times, waiting to obtain any government financing. This great vitality in private sector financing, which has been built on a foundation of confidence in political and economic stability, is developing a capital market whose liquidity adds tens of billions of riyals each year to the Kingdom's fixed capital. The amount of the capital market has recently reached nearly R200 billion. This figure significantly surpasses the amount of the government budget. We can also cite examples of significant growth in Saudi industry, with an increased exporting capacity for a number of industries in which the Kingdom has marked advantages (such as those that strongly rely on oil and its derivatives). Furthermore, the increased growth in exports offers an excellent indicator of the growth of profit margins and marketing expertise of an increasing number of Saudi organizations and of the rise in competitive ability of the economy in general. This improvement is unobserved year after year, with the Saudi organizations benefitting from studies and mistakes in planning, thanks to the balanced protection which, although it provides additional strength to Saudi products, does not exceed, or rather is generally less than, the advantages and protection applied in many nations, including those nations to which those products are exported. The increased vitality and effectiveness of the economy in general, and Saudi organizations in particular, is because of the development that the Saudi Government has been creating on their behalf. In time, this will allow the government to lessen many transitional burdens, which it accepted under the circumstances of applying development plans and giving the organizations--small and large--suitable time to learn the market game and become competitive under the aegis of appropriate cover. Without going into detail, areas of economizing in spending can be found either through privatization of several government assets, through more guidance being made available, represented in itself by a "hidden force," or through unforeseen reserves in the Saudi economy, i.e., the state out of its continued generosity in subsidizing specific sectors has, for this reason alone, cards that it can use if necessary. In fact, we believe that it has begun to be possible to use these cards, because Saudi society is over its initial stages of protection and the "stage of solicitude," and has become ready to accept the facts as they are, as well as being more confident about dealing with them. If some of these domestic realities will help to redirect Saudi fiscal policy, there are also international developments flowing in this direction. The current and future budgets will be prepared under completely different international circumstances than those that existed before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of regional alliances that it produced. A completely new situation has emerged from the war to liberate Kuwait, for example, which will require reconsideration of policies and defensive strategies for Saudi Arabia and other nations. Consequently, as has happened in all Western countries, it might be reflected in a new look at defense and investment in regional security. Naturally, on this level, much depends on the path of the thorny negotiations aimed at reaching a joint settlement of the historic conflict in the Middle East and the opening of a new era of mutual coexistence, cooperation, and a redirection of the region's wealth and priceless resources to growth and prosperity.
