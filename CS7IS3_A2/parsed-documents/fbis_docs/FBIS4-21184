The government considers this to be ``an emergency solution'' to fight the widespread corruption system set up by the numbers game kingpins around betting places. According to Pedro Simon (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul State), who is the government leader in the Senate, the inclusion of the numbers game on the list of crimes forced it to go underground and to generate a system of ``related crimes,'' such as trafficking in drugs and arms and holdups of armored bank vans. Minister Dupeyrat will propose at the meeting that the numbers game continue to be considered an illegal activity if it is exploited without the government's authorization. He claims that to simply legalize it--as proposed by some--would only benefit those offenders who now are facing charges because the courts would then have to dismiss all charges. Dupeyrat believes the problem may be solved by authorizing the Federal Savings Bank (CEF) or another government institution to exploit the game to compete with the illegal operators. Dupeyrat said: ``The numbers game is being exploited by criminals who are obtaining very high profits because they are withholding part of the prizes.'' He added: ``If the game is exploited adequately and if higher prizes are distributed to bettors, the people will prefer the government-run game.'' Planalto Palace expects to learn today whether the CEF has the capability to include another betting game in its lottery system. Sen. Simon believes, however, that a solution should start by excluding the numbers game from the list of crimes and by legalizing it. He wants it to become a legal activity that would be supervised by the government and would be liable for taxes. He said: ``That would put an end to payments of bribes to policemen and government officials.'' He added: ``It also would become much easier to fight the number of crimes surrounding betting places.'' Playing on Simon's side is the fact that he ``legalized'' the numbers game upon his inauguration as governor of Rio Grande do Sul as soon as he realized that one-third of police personnel in the state were officially assigned to fighting this crime, but that in reality they were only offering protection in exchange for kickbacks. The proposal now being discussed by the government will block a Congress vote on a previous proposal that virtually reserves the market for the current numbers game operators. The bill, which already has been approved by the Constitution and Justice Committee, legalizes the numbers game and authorizes its current operators to continue to exploit it exclusively. The proposal, which was endorsed by the Rio de Janeiro kingpins, was sponsored by Deputy Paulo Almeida (Democratic Social Party-Rio de Janeiro), who is the president of the League of Samba Schools, Liesa.
