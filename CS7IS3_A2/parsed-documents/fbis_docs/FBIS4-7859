FBIS4-7859 "dreeu067_p_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 POLAND Walesa-Coalition Deal on Budget, Rosati Noted Walesa-Coalition Deal on Budget, Rosati Noted WS0604163294 Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 6 Apr 94 p 1 WS0604163294 Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA Polish BFN [Article by Dominika Wielowieyska and Waldemar Kumor: "Rosati in Return for Budget; Peace at Top?"] [Text] The coalition would no longer insist on Rosati's candidacy, and it would also amend the neo-popiwek [wage-controlling] law along the lines of what the presidents wants. The president would sign the budget and also approve, without any reservations, a new candidate for finance minister put forward by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. It is possible that such decisions will be made as soon as tomorrow [7 April] if a summit meeting between Walesa, Pawlak, and Kwasniewski takes place. Prime Minister Pawlak is said to have promised the SLD that he will do everything in his power to persuade the president to hold such a meeting at the end of the week. We learned unofficially that the prime minister told Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy (SLD) yesterday that a meeting at the Belweder "has very good chances of materializing." Right before Easter, the prime minister telephoned Dariusz Rosati, the SLD candidate for finance minister, and asked him not to give up, despite the president's rejection of his candidacy. Professor Rosati confirmed yesterday, while talking with GAZETA WYBORCZA, that the coalition members continue to ask him not to withdrawal his candidacy until the dispute is finally resolved. But he is aware that his chances are slim. "The president has already rejected the candidacy once, and I do not think he will change his mind," Lech Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office, told us yesterday. The coalition wants to overcome the deadlock by suggesting a deal: Perhaps it could give Rosati up, but it is waiting for assurances from the president that he will approve the next candidate submitted by the SLD. The coalition is also hoping that the president will sign the Budget Law, despite his earlier threats to veto the measure. In return, the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD could show remorse and admit that the neo-popiwek law, which was vetoed by the president, requires amendments. It is true that both parties intend to overrule the presidential veto, but the only goal of that would be to move for an amendment to the law, using urgent proceedings, and, in the course of the amendments, the presidential reservations would be taken into account. The issue is primarily about amending the legal provision pertaining to the government's introduction of wage controls in all companies, should "the country's financial stability be endangered." The coalition is not sitting idly by. We found out at the Finance Ministry that proceedings to amend the law have reached an advanced stage. The solution could satisfy both parties because the continuity of wage controls would be maintained. The Sejm would overrule the president's veto, and the law would then become effective retroactive to 1 April, while the parliament would amend the law within a month and a half. Will Lech Walesa decide on a cease-fire? One does not know. It is also hard to predict whether the coalition's leaders will not begin arguing among themselves at the last moment once again.
