Appendix C to §1915.1001_Qualitative and Quantitative Fit Testing Procedures. Mandatory Qualitative Fit Test Protocols I. Isoamyl Acetate Protocol A. Odor threshold screening. 1. Three 1-liter glass jars with metal lids (e.g. Mason or Bell jars) are required. 2. Odor-free water (e.g. distilled or spring water) at approximately 25 ○C shall be used for the solutions. 3. The isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known as isopentyl acetate) stock solution is prepared by adding 1 cc of pure IAA to 800 cc of odor free water in a 1-liter jar and shaking for 30 seconds. This solution shall be prepared new at least weekly. 4. The screening test shall be conducted in a room separate from the room used for actual fit testing. The two rooms shall be well ventilated but shall not be connected to the same recirculating ventilation system. 5. The odor test solution is prepared in a second jar by placing 0.4 cc of the stock solution into 500 cc of odor free water using a clean dropper or pipette. Shake for 30 seconds and allow to stand for two to three minutes so that the IAA concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. This solution may be used for only one day.
