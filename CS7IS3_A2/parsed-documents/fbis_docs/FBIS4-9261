FBIS4-9261 "dreeu078_s_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 SLOVENIA _O_Economic Relations With Croatia Examined _O_Economic Relations With Croatia Examined 94P20645A 94P20645A CSO [Editorial Report] "Intensive" talks between Slovenia and Croatia have resulted in the signing by the Slovene and Croatian prime ministers, Janez Drnovsek and Nikica Valentic, of a package of agreements on cooperation in various fields (Zagreb Radio, 7 February). According to the 25 March Maribor daily VECER, seven of these Slovene-Croatian agreements were ratified by the Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly on 24 March. Describing the proceedings in the Croatian Assembly, VECER reports that agreements on maritime fishing, reciprocal implementation of court decisions, legal aid to citizens, establishment and authority of joint bodies to examine and delineate borders, economic and trade relations and cooperation, employment, and cooperation in culture and education were adopted without debate. One deputy, the paper reports, raised the issue of layoffs of Croats working in Slovenia and another, a representative of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], requested an explanation regarding the rights of Croats living in Slovenia. Croats in Slovenia do not have the status of an ethnic minority, VECER points out, and are therefore not entitled to rights, such as education in their native language, granted to the recognized minorities: Italians and Hungarians. An article in the 31 March issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK analyzing Croatian-Slovene economic relations comments that the joint commission of the two countries' Chambers of Commerce "is not active enough." The article reports that this was also the opinion of a Slovene economic delegation headed by Vojka Ravbar, state secretary of the Ministry for Economic Relations and Development, that visited Zagreb in March to discuss "unresolved questions" of bilateral trade. Explaining the decline in bilateral trade, the Slovene delegation stated that Slovene firms had been looking elsewhere for partners, because of cases in which Croatian firms had failed to fulfill contractual obligations. The delegation cited the lack of an agreement on a free trade zone as another negative factor in economic relations, noting that Slovenia had signed such agreements with the Czech and Slovak Republics and was in the process of doing so with Hungary. The latter agreement was signed on 6 April, according to a Budapest Kossuth Radio report of the same day. Judging by the statements of the Slovene delegation, VJESNIK concluded, the two sides agree that problems with denationalization and privatization had "slowed" economic development in both countries and contributed to problems in bilateral trade. The sides reported "dissatisfaction" with the state of bilateral trade and viewed the "politicization" of economic problems as especially detrimental to cooperation. An analysis of Slovene-Croatian economic relations in the 29 January issue of the major Ljubljana daily DELO reports that trade with Croatia had declined from $8.2 billion in 1990 to less than $1.5 billion in 1993. Croatia is Slovenia's third-largest trading partner, following Germany and Italy; Slovenia holds the same rank among Croatia's trading partners. Trade is unbalanced, however, DELO notes, with Slovenia having a "considerable" trade surplus with Croatia. In spite of such negative trends, the paper observes, Slovene economists view trade with Croatia as important to Slovenia's own economic well-being. In this context, DELO cites economist Dr. Franjo Stiblar's observation that "Croatia remains an important and interesting trading partner for us... and it is to be hoped that Croatia will succeed in stabilizing its economy, since that would also have a favorable effect on the revival of Slovenia's."
