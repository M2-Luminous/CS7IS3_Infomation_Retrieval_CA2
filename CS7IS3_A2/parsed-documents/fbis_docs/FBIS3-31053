The fact that it is the president himself who will be signing the document underlines the importance attached by Bulgaria to the European structures in general, as well as its desire to obtain the best possible guarantees for its security. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Mr. President, why has Bulgaria turned to the "Partnership for Peace?" [Zhelev] Bulgaria cannot remain alienated from this initiative, which is attracting all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and to which Russia will also probably turn. For us, this initiative represents an important step towards full membership of NATO. Bulgaria hopes that, in time, NATO will transform itself into a European-Atlantic security system -- a pole guaranteeing security for all countries, large or small, in any region of Europe or the Atlantic. Naturally, Bulgaria cannot remain distant from this initiative in order to seek alternative, utopian and uncertain, guarantees for its national security. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you believe that Bulgaria could lose some favor with Russia by doing this? [Zhelev] I do not consider such a hypothesis to be well- founded, for sooner or later Russia will, or should, join this collective security system, depending on the natural run of events. The European-Atlantic community itself has an interest in attracting Russia, which constitutes a major element of this very community. It is not out of fear for any ambitions that the Russians might have that we aspire to join NATO structures. Bulgarian-Russian relations are traditionally friendly. If politicians in certain circles -- communists, neocommunists, or postcommunists -- regard our interest in NATO as an expression of our being in opposition to Russia, then it is because they have a poor understanding of the run of historical events. Russia is on the way to democratization, just as we are. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there agreement between the various political forces in Bulgaria regarding its joining the "Partnership" and, possibly, NATO? [Zhelev] I believe that there is already a consensus on this matter, at least at institutional level. I have, on several occasions, expressed my view favoring Bulgaria's commitment to and membership of NATO, for our country has no alternative regarding its national security. The government supports the same policy. In our Parliament, which is the arena of the fiercest debates, there were only two votes against when a vote was taken on the declaration in favor of subscribing to the "Partnership" initiative. [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Does the possibility of NATO air strikes in Bosnia constitute a threat of the conflict spreading? [Zhelev] We have always emphasized that Bulgaria will not get mixed up in that conflict in any way whatsoever. Moreover, we want the other Balkan states and the countries bordering the former Yugoslavia to adopt the same principle, for we believe this to be a condition sine qua non for preventing the conflict from spreading, and avoiding another war in the Balkans. We believe that the UN embargo must be strictly respected, because it is proving fairly effective. As for possible air strikes, I believe them to be an extreme measure taken by the United Nations with a view to lifting the siege of Sarajevo; and I hope that, if it has to be implemented, the United Nations will take account of the actual conditions on the ground to spare the civilian population, and only attack the military targets which are undermining the practical application of its initiatives. However, in any case, this can only be done under the aegis of NATO and within the context of the decisions it takes.
