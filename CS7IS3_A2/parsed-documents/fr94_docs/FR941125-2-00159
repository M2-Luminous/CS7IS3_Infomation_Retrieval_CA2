The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representation 1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, and its sole portfolio series is Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund (the ``Fund''). On August 31, 1988, applicant registered under the Act as an investment company, and applicant filed a registration statement to register its shares under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective on October 27, 1988, and the initial public offering commenced on the same day. 2. On February 5, 1990, the Fund's board of trustees adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the ``Plan'') for the Fund. The Plan provided for (i) the sale of applicant's assets and subsequent distribution of the proceeds to its shareholders; (ii) the payment of or provision for applicant's liabilities and obligations; (iii) the cessation of applicant's business as an investment company under the Act; and (iv) applicant's dissolution. Applicant's shareholders approved the Plan on March 30, 1990. 3. On June 25, 1990, the Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund Shareholders' Liquidating Trust_Certificates (the ``Certificate Reserve Trust'') was formed. The trustees of the Certificate Reserve Trust were Patricia Ostrander, Joseph L. Bower, Richard E. Floor, Bernard J. Korman, Franco Modigliani, and Ernest E. Monrad. The Certificate Reserve Trust was formed pursuant to the Plan, and its primary purpose was to hold assets transferred to it by the Fund on behalf of shareholders of the Fund who, as of June 25, 1990, had neither surrendered their certificates representing shares in the Fund, nor provided the Trustees with an indemnity bond, in the event of loss or destruction of a certificate. The Trust would hold these assets until the shareholders furnished the certificates or an indemnity bond in accordance with the Plan. 4. On June 26, 1990, the Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund Shareholders' Liquidating Trust (the ``Liquidating Trust'') was formed. The trustees were the same as those for the Certificate Reserve Trust. The Liquidating Trust was formed pursuant to the Plan, and its purpose was to satisfy contingent liabilities of the Fund and the applicant, and the balance would be distributed to shareholders. 5. On or about June 29, 1990, the Fund distributed an aggregate of $1,811,899.29, representing substantially all of its assets. The Fund distributed the money as follows: $724,645.42 to the Certificate Reserve Trust, $200,000 to the Liquidating Trust, and the remainder directly to the Fund's shareholders. 6. On or prior to December 31, 1992, the Certificate Reserve Trust terminated upon the distribution to the last of the shareholders who had missing certificates. 7. In May 1993, Ms. Ostrander reimbursed $17,182 to the Liquidating Trust in connection with an agreement reached with the SEC to reimburse monies to shareholders of the Fund who may have purchased shares of the Fund at incorrect prices. Ms. Ostrander also made direct restitution to certain identified shareholders of the Fund in the amount of $21,103. Applicant is not aware of any other amounts owed by Ms. Ostrander to applicant or the Fund. 8. On May 26, 1993, applicant was named as a defendant in Continental Airlines, Inc. v. Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund, et. al, Civil Action No. 93&hyph;3164. Continental alleged that applicant had violated Massachusetts law in connection with Continental's investments in the Fund. The parties settled the action pursuant to a release dated April 18, 1994. 9. All of the assets of the Liquidating Trust have been used to satisfy contingent liabilities of the Fund and the applicant or distributed to or for the benefit of the Fund's shareholders. On August 5, 1994 the Liquidating Trust made a final distribution of $70,462.17 to the Fund's shareholders.
