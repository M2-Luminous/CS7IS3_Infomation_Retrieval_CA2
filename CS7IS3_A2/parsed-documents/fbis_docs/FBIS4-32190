It postponed the adoption of amendments to the law on the sale of apartments under tenancy agreements until there has been a revision of the use of all so-called army apartments. The chamber decided to call an extraordinary session in July, at which an answer will be formulated on whether the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate should be extended. It was suggested that the state president be invited to this session. The decision to convene a session in July was adopted following a debate on a resolution condemning the genocide in the form of large-scale terror and violence being perpetrated by the occupying Serbian authorities as they deny water supplies to Biograd, Zadar, and its environs. The resolution -- which will be sent to the parliaments of European countries and those of the members of the UN Security Council, the UN secretary general, and the International War Crimes Tribunal -- will remind the international public of the genocide perpetrated against the Croatian people, and inform it about the situation in Biograd and its environs as they cannot get water from an area belonging to Biograd, although it is under exclusive UNPROFOR control. UNPROFOR's indecisiveness and its soft approach to the Serbian terrorists is ever more irritating for the 30,000 people of Biograd and its 10,000 refugees, who have for three years now been suffering an unbearable shortage of water. Hence, the resolution stresses, there is a possibility of the local population demonstrating openly their dissatisfaction at UNPROFOR's inefficiency. The assembly demands that the Croatian Government adopt energetic steps to curb further Serbian terrorism against the people of Biograd, Zadar, and its environs, and that it demand the consistent implementation of all UN Security Council resolutions and the Zagreb agreement.
