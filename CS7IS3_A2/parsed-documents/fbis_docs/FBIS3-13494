Perhaps what exposes this bias is the U.S. stance on Jerusalem and the refusal to vote on a resolution that considers Jerusalem to be part of the occupied Palestinian territories. This, under the pretext of not interfering with what has been agreed on in Oslo, namely that discussion on the Jerusalem issue will be put off until the final stage of the talks. With this unsound stance, the U.S. Administration is backing down from its previous position on Jerusalem, which considered the city to be an inseparable part of the occupied territories. At the same time, the U.S. Administration is ignoring the fact that talks over implementing the Oslo accord should be carried out with the aim of applying Security Council Resolution 242, which stipulates the inadmissibility of occupying the lands of others by force. Clearly, this resolution applies to Jerusalem as well. Furthermore, the U.S. Administration's excuse about not interfering with what has been agreed on in Oslo is a very flimsy pretext, because all the evidence and facts indicate that the United States is constantly interfering in the details of what is happening in our region -- and always to the advantage of Israel's leaders. There is no better proof of this than the U.S. Administration's position on Jerusalem and the recent Security Council discussions, as well as its invitation to resume the talks in Washington in a bid to deflect the massacre's repercussions and neutralize any position opposed to keeping the settlements in our occupied territories.
