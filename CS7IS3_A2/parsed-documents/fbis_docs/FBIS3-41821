This will be carried out as a 3-year project from this fiscal year, as comprehensive research under the FY93 Science and Technology Promotion and Coordination Budget. Through this research, an infection and outbreak biological model, which is needed for R&D on the treatment of the disease, will be developed. Also, the living environment (reproductive cycle) mechanism of HIV, which breaks down the sophisticated immune system of an organism and penetrates cells, will be studied and the technology to control the multiplying and infection of the virus will be developed. It appears that this will open up an important path to the development of effective treatment of AIDS. At present, the fact that an appropriate biological system for experimentation has not been established is pointed out as a factor that is hampering R&D on the treatment of AIDS, and an urgent response is required. The rapid reproductive cycle of HIV and its extremely high variability also are substantial barriers to R&D. To overcome these barriers, the comprehensive research project will proceed based on three main tasks: (1) Development of an infection and outbreak biological model; (2) Development of control technology aimed at the virus multiplication process; and (3) Development of control technology aimed at the virus infection process. Participating research organizations include STA's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, MHW's National Institute of Health, MAFF's National Institute of Animal Health, Kyoto University and Tokyo Medical and Dental University. The spread of the AIDS virus begins when it couples with CD4 (receptor) of a helper T-cell. That composite enters a cell and begins to multiply, thus advancing to the next stage of infection. The virus does not advance to infection if it does not couple with the receptor. That is why the chimpanzee, which can be infected by the virus, is being used as a biological model in current AIDS research. However, using chimpanzees hinders the efficiency of research because raising and testing chimpanzees is costly, according to STA's R&D Bureau. Under this research project, the mouse, in which the appropriate background at the gene level exists, will be selected as the biological model to replace the chimpanzee. CD4 will be incorporated into the mouse to develop a biological model that can be infected by HIV. However, infection is difficult with just the incorporation of CD4. Infection efficiency cannot be raised without the addition of a third element, which human beings possess. Thus in this research project, emphasis will be given to finding that third element for infection.
