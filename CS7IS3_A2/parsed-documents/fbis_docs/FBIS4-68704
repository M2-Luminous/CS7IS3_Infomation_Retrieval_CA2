FBIS4-68704 "jpusr053___94052" FBIS-USR-94-053 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 27 April 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Officials Differ on Interpretation of Foreign Investment Officials Differ on Interpretation of Foreign Investment Edict 944Q0350A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 27 Apr 94 p 3 944Q0350A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Vadim Bardin: "Minfin Challenges President's Benefits to Foreign Investors"] [Text] [Begin boxed material 1] Foreign investments in Russia (data of Minekonomika [Ministry of Economics]) --There are 12,000 registered enterprises with foreign investments. --The contributions to the charter funds of these enterprises are estimated at $1 billion. --The most dynamic area of foreign investment in Russia is oil drilling. There are 30 registered joint ventures, which in 1994 may extract 9 million tonnes of oil (that is, increase extraction by three times over the last 2 years). [End boxed material 1] [Begin boxed material 2] The most attractive sectors for foreign investments (based on appraisals of participants in the seminar, "German Investments in Russia") --The food industry. The volume of Russian import of delicatessen food products shows that there is a solvent demand, and Russian tariff policy makes the development of domestic production effective. --Oil and gas extraction. Needs no comment. --Building materials industry. A boom in the construction of cottages is being observed in Russia. [End boxed material 2] Representatives of firms which participated in the seminar, "German Investments in Russia," held yesterday in the FRG [Federative Republic of Germany] embassy, had the opportunity to see with their own ideas the different interpretations of Russian legislation on the part of presidential and government structures. Yevgeniy Yasin (the head of the analytical center under the president's administration) and Igor Noskov (the chief of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] Department of International Tax Relations) have opposite interpretations of the benefits presented in the presidential edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investments." The seminar which was held was interesting primarily because of its organizers. From the German side this was the Moscow Representation of German Economics--the first step on the road to opening a German chamber of commerce and industry in Moscow (an American chamber of commerce and industry already exists in Moscow). From the Russian side it was the Expert Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Its director, Yevgeniy Yasin, was recently named to head up the analytical center under the president's administration. So that German businessmen had reason to expect from the organizers of the seminar not only appraisals of the development of the economic situation in Russia, but also support of their interests. Yevgeniy Yasin characterized Russia's economic position as "naturally-critical, but not catastrophic." The decline in production in 1994 comprised 23 percent in January, 24 percent in February and 27 percent in March. According to Mr. Yasin's evaluation, this is an overproduction crisis, the solution to which is structural reorganization. A typical example is that of the textile industry, which Yasin's institute studied. There is a natural differentiation taking place in this industry: Leaders are emerging (15-16 percent of the 170 enterprises studied) as well as outsiders (24 percent), whose only prospects are--bankruptcy. The tactics of the leaders in 1993 amounted to sales priorities, including export, as well as the total absence of capital investments. In 1994, Yasin believes, these tactics must be supplemented by investment activity. The function of the government is reduced to holding down inflation and supporting private investments. Investment potential has been accumulated in foreign and domestic trade and at the commercial banks. Hopes are riding on the financial consortium of non-state banks and investment companies which is being created, and which will emit state-guaranteed securities and finance projects selected by the consortium itself from among those prepared by Minekonomika. This is not the only project. Thus, commercial banks are prepared to finance an investment project in the sum of $200 million for production of the Il-96-m. Mr. Yasin's general conclusion was that the situation on the money market (inflation being held down and the positive value of bank interest) make realistic a turn toward stepping up investment activity, without which Russian industry "will not survive." After such an announcement, the seminar participants turned to the problems of specifically foreign investments. Their attention, not surprisingly, was concentrated on taxes. The application of the VAT [value-added tax] (20 percent) and the special tax (3 percent) to import equipment was characterized as a "tax on investments." The 38 percent tax on "surplus wages" (including that of foreign citizens) was called a "fine." Explanations were presented by Igor Noskov, head of the Minfin Department of International Tax Relations. And it was he who gave the seminar participants their main surprise. Mr. Noskov said that, from the standpoint of Minfin, the 3-year immunity of foreign investments from statutes of the Russian authorities (except for federal laws and presidential edicts) which may inflict material loss upon them, which was introduced by the 27 September 1993 presidential edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investments," does not apply to taxes. The justification for this is that all changes in taxes must be ratified by parliament. The comment of the German entrepreneurs to the effect that the 38 percent tax also did not get the approval of the Federal Assembly clarified the Minfin position: "To let everyone in and not to let anyone out." Igor Noskov's announcement met with sharp reproach from Yevgeniy Yasin, who announced to the satisfaction of the participants that Minfin must carry out the presidential edicts. Moreover, the stipulation of immunity must be secured and expanded (it is presumed that the term of the moratorium will be increased from 3 to 5-7 years) in the changes which are being introduced into the law on foreign investments.
