Ceremonial speeches were expected to be delivered on the occasion, but Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo caused a stir. [passage omitted] [Begin Ngonhamo recording] I would like to repeat that this is a nonpartisan army. Its officers can never make political decisions, because the politicians are the right people for that. Your decisive role is to defend the country from any possible threat or aggression. Our country is threatened from all corners. All neighboring countries pose a threat to Mozambique. Likewise, there are some Mozambicans who are still guided by the spirit of revenge and violence. Some of them are hiding arms; others are secretly training forces. You, however, have bet on peace, not violence. There is no reason for alarm. I would like to answer a question posed by two officers. My answer will be for all of you. They asked me what was the mission of the troops undergoing training. For your information, Mr. Nihia, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party secretary for Nampula, is the leader of a 1,000-man group that has been secretly trained in Nampula. The United Nations is aware of it. The United Nations has been informed and tried to investigate the case in the field, but was prevented from going there. My question is: Who will those troops attack? They will not attack Renamo, Frelimo, the Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence Party, the National Convention Party or any other party. They are supposed to attack the FADM. [end recording] [passage omitted] Meanwhile, General Eduardo da Silva Nihia has reacted to Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations. This afternoon, Nihia rebutted the accusations, saying his mission in the province is to educate Frelimo members and sympathizers as well the residents in general on how to take part in the multiparty elections scheduled for October 1994. He demanded that Gen. Ngonhamo produce evidence about his alleged involvement in the training of the 1,000 men and the hiding of arms. [Begin Nihia recording] I do not know where Gen. Ngonhamo got his facts. He must produce evidence. He must say that arms are hidden in such and such a place and Nihia is responsible, and that men are being trained in such and such a place and that Nihia is responsible. The truth is that, right now, I know nothing about it. My task has to do with the Frelimo Party. Gen. Ngonhamo will have to produce facts, places, and districts in Nampula Province. The war is over, and our party believes that. [end recording] We asked Nihia to comment on Renamo's accusations leveled against him. [Begin Nihia recording] My reading of the situation is that, in Nampula Province, Renamo is desperate. Renamo has been unable to consolidate its position here. The residents have rejected Renamo. You will recall that in November 1992, Renamo claimed that it had a strong following among Nampula Province residents. Now, the situation is different. When they come here they talk about me precisely because I am charge of this province politically. I feel Renamo does that because they realize they have no room for maneuver here. Pensado [Renamo's representative for Nampula Province] is always insulting people. That is his policy. We do not wish to argue on the basis of insults. That is to go too low. He insults me, [Nampula Province Governor] Gamito, and other people. He has no grounds for such insults. So, I think Renamo is desperate. [end recording]
