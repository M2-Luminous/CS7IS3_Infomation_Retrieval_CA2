For this reason, we have called Valle Governor Carlos Holguin Sardi at this time of the morning, 0702 to be exact, to ask him about the truth to television reports by the "TV Today" and "AM-PM" newscasts. According to these two newscasts, the U.S. troops that spent 60 days in Valle del Cauca Department reportedly buried toxic waste. Mr. Governor, good day. What is the basis for these televised reports? [Holguin Sardi] Good morning. Believe me, I am very surprised by all of this. I was accompanied by Admiral Ross and Major General Jesus Maria Vergara, commander of the Army's 3d Division, in Juanchaco on Friday, and no one, absolutely no one, expressed any concern or commented on any rumors or hearsay about the report disseminated by the television newscasts. In fact, television reporters were there, and I do not know when they received such reports or why they failed to ask us about them there. Had they asked us, we would have at least found out about these claims. It seems that this is a new episode in the soap opera revolving around the presence of U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco. Nevertheless, the report is baseless. I repeat, no one mentioned such a tale to me. [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, the engineers of the U.S. military forces came to build a school, a clinic, and to help work on the Juanchaco-Ladrilleros road. All of these projects were left incomplete. Do you or the national government have a plan to complete the projects so that the walls built by the U.S. engineers -- who caused so much controversy by their very presence -- will not be left abandoned? [Holguin Sardi] The clinic needs plumbing and electrical work; everything else is done. The Colombian Army and Navy, which are building the nearby Juanchaco airstrip, will oversee the completion of the work. The school is a bit behind schedule. It needs plumbing and electrical work, as well as part of the roof and the inside walls that divide the various classrooms. About 80 percent of each of the two projects is complete. As I already mentioned, the Army and Navy will be in charge of completing the projects. It is estimated that 20 Navy workers will finish off in one month what 60 soldiers did in eight days in terms of building the school and the clinic. [Arizmendi] Other media have reported that another contingent of U.S. troops will return to Colombia within two months to conduct an operation similar to the one just completed in Juanchacho. What do you know about this? [Holguin Sardi] Absolutely nothing. After what has happened, I do not believe there will be new similar experiments. The fact that the deadline originally set in the agreement for this project was not extended is an indication that there is no interest in having U.S. troops return for this type of work in Colombia. [Arizmendi] After having described the report about possible toxic wastes as a soap opera, will any action be taken to deny this report? [Holguin Sardi] Yes, it will be very important for the media that obtained the report to remember where they got it from. [Words indistinct] keeping the source a secret. Notwithstanding, if any citizens know anything about this report, it is very important for them to inform us about it in order that we can conduct the relevant investigations on such a terrifying and unpleasant story. I repeat, however, I think it is only a soap opera. No one in his right mind thinks that such a thing could happen. The Pacific naval forces maintained very strict and complete vigilance over the soldiers' activities. There were many opportunities to oversee what they were doing. No one could prove that they were doing something other than building the school and the clinic. They were always concentrating on their work. Therefore, I repeat, it is only a baseless rumor, a soap opera. However, if we are informed about where, who, and how, we would be willing to begin the relevant investigations.
