Jing Shuping, chairman of the federation, said that China's reforms have entered the stage of "storming the fortified positions" as the central government have instituted a series of major reform measures in banking, taxation and other key economic fields since the beginning of this year. His federation, a non-governmental organization and a chamber of commerce mainly linking with private and other non-public economic sectors, will do its best to facilitate the reforms, he said. He noted the herculean task for the taxation reform. For instance, though the private sector handed over 29.3 billion yuan taxes to the state in 1993, tax evasion was serious because of poor taxation awareness among the self-employees and private businesses. Jing said that the federation and its subordinates throughout China will organize publicity of the new tax law among persons engaged in non-public sectors. The federation will also encourage private businesses to absorb more surplus laborers and help enterprises solve problems in social security, labor protection and welfare so as to maintain social stability, he said. Jing pledged that the federation will help its members to upgrade product quality, improve service, expand exports and participate in more international economic activities. The federation will bring into full play its role of political consultation and democratic supervision, participate in the anti-corruption drive and help persons in the non-public sectors abide by law and make contributions to the establishment of a socialist market economy.
