The Cuban revolution was making a strong impact on the world. It was June 1959. Jorge Ricardo Masetti, an Argentine journalist, had interviewed Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra a few months earlier, smack dab in the middle of the fighting against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. Masetti was in Havana again and wanted to create a different kind of news agency. He requested the cooperation of several young Latin American and Cuban journalists and, with the revolution's support, created the Latin American News Agency, PRENSA LATINA. The idea for a news agency of this kind stemmed from a reality imposed by the circumstances at that time; that is, the monopoly that transnational news agencies exercised and still exercise. Every day these agencies transmit hundreds of news items on Latin America and the undeveloped world that present a distorted picture that is detrimental to the area's interests. These agencies, primarily the U.S.-based ones, were waging a strong campaign against Cuba and the revolutionary government's first social justice measures. It was necessary to spread Latin America's own informational concept and to reach the majority of our countries. That is how PRENSA LATINA emerged 35 years ago. The agency's creation did not go unnoticed. Some commentators predicted it would last only a few months, but the dream, with all its ups and downs, continues. We are still present in 21 countries and reach 19 of them every day with objective, truthful reports on the national situation and that of the rest of the Third World. PRENSA LATINA has become a modest media complex that publishes the magazines PRISMA -- already in its 20th year -- and CUBA INTERNACIONAL, has its own television department (TV Latina), and offers printed and radio bulletin services. PRENSA LATINA has created its own advertising agency, PUBLIMAGEN, and prepares promotional materials aimed at the market. More than 130 reporters keep PRENSA LATINA operating around the clock under complex conditions. We serve customers in Latin America and Cuba and strive to improve our services to the Latin American and world press. In the past few years, PRENSA LATINA has achieved a significant technological transformation by installing an automated news monitoring and broadcasting system devised by its own engineers. The agency's primary importance, however, does not lie in the display of large resources or sophisticated technology but in its well-known prestige and authority among news media and professionals around the world. PRENSA LATINA helped found and actively collaborates with the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool and the Association of Latin American National Information Systems (ASIN). In addition, PRENSA LATINA upholds the principle of the need for a new order of information and communications because inequalities regarding access to and handling of information persist. Powerful consortiums have the upper hand and impose a news flow detrimental to undeveloped countries, which continue to regard the concepts and ideas of independence and sovereignty as their inalienable rights. Information and communications must serve as instruments of understanding rather than hostility and dominance among men. For several years PRENSA LATINA has been promoting the highest values of Latin American journalism and sponsoring the Jose Marti Award, created in 1986. Anyone who has published works on the nation's situation and on our struggle for social justice is eligible to compete. On 15 June, the agency commemorates its 35th anniversary with the determination to keep uniting voices and to exercise a genuine, independent, integrated, sincere, and articulate journalism. This is the example set by dozens of Latin American and Cuban journalists who learned the trade in some of their editor's offices, worked as correspondents, or fulfilled dangerous assignments. Most of them feel they are part of the agency which, as Galeano said, keeps sailing come hell or high water.
