They are now protecting, with courage, valor, and sacrifices, the most sacred achievements of the Yemeni revolution, unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. Since they are the forces of the entire Yemeni people, they know neither malice nor treacherous bloody collective liquidation. Therefore, and out of their full confidence in the honorable fate that is worthy of the human and his rights, honorable unionist officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the units that take orders from the rebellious elements in the Socialist Party continue to join the army of unity and constitutional legitimacy, confident that they will only be received with love, loyalty, and good treatment. The most recent example of this was the wise Yemeni treatment of the members of the 3d Armored Brigade. Today, all members of the 1st Artillery Brigade in (?Yalin), members of the Khurafi camp where al-Bid's personal security team is stationed, and members of the military police battalion in Sanaa joined the ranks of the army of unity and constitutional legitimacy. They joined the ranks of their brother members of the Armed Forces, the protector of unity and democracy, after they became aware of the nature of the wicked scheme of that secessionist gang that wants to fragment the homeland. The source praised the high morale of all members of the Armed Forces and security units who are offering dear sacrifices in order to strengthen steadfastness and victory in the homeland of 22 May 1990. In a related development, our air defense units continued their valiant and competent confrontation of the aircraft of that gang and repelled all their hostile, treacherous raids against the capital Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, and Ma'rib. These raids targeted vital and strategic installations in these valiant cities and aimed at terrorizing citizens. The air defense units foiled these missions and the aggressors retreated in failure. At a late hour yesterday, Colonel Jawad Muthanna, the commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade, and members of the brigade staff were arrested. They had launched sedition in Dhamar and then fled, but they were caught by the hand of justice. The source praised the masses of our great Yemeni people in the entire homeland for their courageous national stand and their siding with the Armed Forces and security units in the trench of defending unity and the homeland. After they were burned by the fire of the fabricated crisis and its pain, these masses realize that this is the decisive hour of decision between a wrong that is nearing collapse and a right that is proceeding with all confidence and competence toward clear victory, God willing.
