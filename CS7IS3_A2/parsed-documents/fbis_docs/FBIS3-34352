The Foreign Ministry denounced what it said Monday was the "negative stance of the UN Security Council vis-a-vis these inhuman killings." It called for an end to what it termed was a "human rights violation in Bosnia- Herzegovina". The government called for the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Muslims in the besieged city. The United Nations have been unable to determine who fired the single mortar round Sunday.
