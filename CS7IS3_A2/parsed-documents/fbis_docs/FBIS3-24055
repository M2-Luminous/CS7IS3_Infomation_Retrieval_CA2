What is more, the deputies decided to turn to the judicial organs, including the appeals and supervisory courts with complaint statements about declaring invalid the decree of the electoral commission of the kray on the elections to local organs of authority "Concerning the Organization of 25 Electoral Districts" and its other decrees that were adopted in defiance of the kray council. The Inner Council also sent documents to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, appealing against a decision of the kray people's court, which refused to examine its complaint to the kray electoral commission. Thus, the dispute between the representative and executive branches of authority in the kray has entered a more acute phase. The gist of the delayed and by no means concluded dispute is the following. In January of this year, already not for the first time, the Inner Council once again ratified the decision: Forty-two deputies will work on a permanent basis in the State Duma of Stavropol Kray. But the administration of the kray is insisting on 25, of which, in its opinion, only 10 deputies should work on a permanent basis, and it is also insisting on increasing the percentage of signatures of voters for the nomination of candidates for deputy from 3 to 5 percent. These proposals were interpreted by members of the Inner Council as a frank desire of the current administration to form an obedient representative authority that it had in its pocket. After all, the more signatures that future candidates will have to collect, the easier it will be for the executive authority, which has a powerful apparatus, to push its own people into key posts, mainly heads of local administrations, believes Yevgeniy Borodin, a member of the kray council and an activist of the Democratic Russia movement. Many kray, oblast, and city dumas are being formed today according to this principle. He reported that after a meeting of the Inner Council, which affirmed its previous decisions, the deputies learned about the decree of the head of kray administration, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, in which the numerical size of the future duma of 25 deputies apparently is legalized. The kray electoral commission is also adopting a similar decree to please the governor. Briefly, the elections are just around the corner, but the dispute is heating up in earnest. The people's deputies believe that the 25 districts--according to the number of candidates for deputy--that were organized by the kray commission are illegal and that the competence of the deputies in them can be disputed, which creates a basis for the instability of future authorities and the sociopolitical situation in the kray. "Supporting our assumptions that the kray administration will create an obedient authority is the fact that the first registered candidates for deputy of the kray duma are entirely representatives of executive authority," asserts Ye. Borodin.
