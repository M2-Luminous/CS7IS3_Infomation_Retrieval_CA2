But the battle he has launched in difficult conditions to try to succeed Jacques Delors is one of the great challenges he has set himself. At a time when Jean-Luc Dehaene is hiding behind his "no comment," Margaret Thatcher's former minister is playing the openness card. He has just written a book, The Europe We Need which has been published by Plon. In addition, the European Commission (EC) deputy president is granting interviews, like the one he granted to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE on Tuesday morning [3 May]: [Lamfalussy] Are you, after all, the only declared candidate to replace Jacques Delors? [Brittan] I am not a declared candidate. This is not an election campaign. But everybody knows that the British Government has nominated me. And I have publicly said that I am available. I have worked here for five years and six months. It would be a great honor to do something more for Europe if the heads of state and of government so wish. Because there are discussions on this subject, in the new world of openness and democracy, I think we must be clear and express our ideas. [Lamfalussy] You are the only one to be putting your cards on the table.... [Brittan] Almost all (the heads of state and of government -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) have told me that being open is an advantage for Europe. [Lamfalussy] Do you still have a chance? [Brittan] It is clear that most of the governments have not yet decided. The decision will be made in Corfu. A great deal is being written in the newspapers. This is mainly speculation. Almost all the heads of government are keeping their cards close to their chest. [Lamfalussy] Do you therefore expect a decision at the Corfu summit? [Brittan] It will be made in Corfu. That is a legal necessity. We must prepare for the new Commission. And the European Parliament now also has a say. [Lamfalussy] Is it a handicap to be British? [Brittan] I assume that the guarantee of having no national discrimination exists for the choice of the future EC president too. [Lamfalussy] The British Government has adopted positions which have offended France, Germany, and other countries.... [Brittan] I am supported by the British Government but in full awareness of my differences of opinion. The British Government understands this very well and has stressed the fact that I am independent. My book is not an expression of the British Government's view. [Lamfalussy] In this connection, is one of the big differences your support for monetary union? [Brittan] And this is nothing new. Even before I came to Brussels, after my resignation from the British Government, the first speech I delivered in the House of Commons advocated Britain's entry into the the Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time when the government had not yet decided to do so. [Lamfalussy] You are relatively optimistic about monetary union, but with the feeling that a hard core will be necesssary.... [Brittan] This is the Maastricht Treaty plan. A degree of temporary variable geometry is included in the treaty for those who satisfy the convergence criteria. Those who are really in a position to start the third phase will do so. The others will wait. [Lamfalussy] Should these convergence criteria be strictly implemented? [Brittan] We must not change them. But you will find in the treaty provision for the possibility of examining the progress made in a dynamic way. This means that if a country is in a position which is close to the criteria and is on the right path, it would be possible to judge that the time had come. [Lamfalussy] In your book, you do not cite Belgium as one of the countries which could join the first group? [Brittan] This does not mean that Belgium is excluded from it! It is perfectly possible. Starting the third phase in 1997 is doubtful. But doing so in 1999 is possible. A great deal can happen in five years. [Lamfalussy] Your book reflects your economic concerns, free trade, opening up to East Europe, monetary union. However, the big date for Europe in the coming years is political. It will be the 1996 intergovernmental conference. [Brittan] It is obvious that the conference is important. The central concept is that we should not choose between expansion and deepening. Both must be chosen. We must accept the Central and East European countries for moral, economic, and political reasons. Moral because we must help these countries to continue along their path. Economic because the inclusion of these countries will ultimately be an advantage for us. Political because if we are negative toward them, the result will be to push them toward the Russians. They will have no alternative. But these countries themselves do not want to join a Community which would be weakened. Deepening must therefore be continued.... My view of Europe is that it must be open and capable of defending itself. For that, it must be united and have a driving force. And that driving force is the Commission. [Lamfalussy] What do you think of the Delors years? [Brittan] The position of the institutions has been enormously strengthened. The leadership has really been able to provide a vision. [Lamfalussy] What should the future EC president be like? [Brittan] It is not for me to define him. I express my ideas very frankly. But it is for other to say what personal qualities the future president should have.
