This year, grain crops will cover a little more than 60 million hectares and agricultural products manufacturers could harvest about 100 million tons "despite all our troubles." However, farm workers failed to plough nearly one third of arable lands last autumn. As a result, they will have to plough up to 20 million hectares more this spring which alone will result in a loss of 15 million tons of grain, he said. In addition, Russia had always spread 18-19 million tons of pesticides every year, a quarter of which was used for grain crops. This year, farms do not have more than 10 kilograms of pesticides per hectare. This will seriously affect the grain output, because every million tons of pesticides results in an additional 4-5 million tons of grain, according to expert calculations. Large losses - about 2-3 million tons of grain - should be expected this year due to the poor condition of winter crops. To make matters worse, too few winter crops were sown in comparison with the last year. Another reason for the losses is poor maintenance of agricultural equipment and the lack of fuel and lubricants. Zvolinskiy stated that taking this into account Russia could count on only 50 million tons of grain this year. Moreover, "the country will receive this amount only thanks to God and the selfless labor of Russian citizens who, despite the fact that the state has not paid for the grain it purchased from them last year, are doing their best not to leave the land unsown this spring," he was quoted as saying.
