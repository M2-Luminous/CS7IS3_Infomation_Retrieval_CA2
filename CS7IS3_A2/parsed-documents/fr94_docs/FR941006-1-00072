FR941006-1-00072 FR941006-1-00015 B. Documentation and Reporting 1. Documentation of Disbursements Sections 9003.5(b)(1)(i) and 9033.11(b)(1)(i) set forth the documentation required for disbursements in excess of $200. Although a canceled check, negotiated by the payee, is required in most situations, it is not currently required if the committee presents a receipted bill from the payee stating the purpose of the disbursement. The proposed rules would change the documentation requirements so that committees must provide canceled checks negotiated by the payees for all disbursements over $200. This change would assist the Commission's audit staff in verifying that public funds are spent on qualified campaign expenses. Committees should already have canceled checks in their possession, so production would not be burdensome. Please note that, as in the past, the proposed rules would require that documentation in addition to the committee's check be provided for disbursements exceeding $200. 2. Alphabetized Schedules The proposed rules include two new sections, 11 CFR 9006.3 and 9037.4, which would require that presidential campaign committee reports containing schedules generated from computerized files, list in alphabetical order the sources of the receipts, the payees and creditors. For individuals, including contributors, the list must be in alphabetical order by surname. However, presidential campaign committees would not be required to computerize their records if they do not wish to do so. The new provision is intended to remedy situations in which committees maintain computerized records of contributors or payees in alphabetical order, but file schedules with the order of the names scrambled. That practice makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to locate particular names on the committee's reports if the schedules are voluminous, thereby thwarting the public disclosure purposes of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq . [``FECA''] and making it more difficult to monitor compliance with the contribution limits. C. Audits 1. Sampling and Disgorgement The Commission has a statutory obligation to complete the audits of publicly funded committees in a thorough and timely manner. In the past, the resources required to conduct reviews of the contributions received by presidential committees contributed to the Commission's difficulty in fulfilling that obligation. Beginning with the 1992 election cycle, however, the Commission began to make more extensive use of statistical sampling for audits of contributions received by publicly financed presidential primary election committees, and to use the sample results to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of any related audit findings. While the Commission continues to conduct a limited non-sample review of contributions received by these committees, most audit testing of contributions and supporting documentation is now done on a sample basis. The Commission is now proposing that new paragraph (f) be added to 11 CFR 9007.1 and 9038.1 to incorporate these procedures. The Commission notes that this approach would apply in a general election only to contributions raised due to a deficiency in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, or to contributions raised by new or minor party candidates. See 26 U.S.C. 9003(c)(2), 9006(c); 11 CFR 9003.2(b)(2), 9003.3(b). The use of statistical sampling is legally acceptable for projecting certain components of a large universe, such as excessive and prohibited contributions. See, e.g., Chavez County Home Health Service v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 904 D.C. Cir. 1991) (sampling audit used to recoup Medicaid overpayments to health care providers); Michigan Dep't of Education v. U.S. Dep't of Education, 875 F.2d 1196 (6th Cir. 1989) (sampling of 259 out of 66,368 total payment authorizations upheld as proper basis for determining amount of misexpended federal funds in vocational-rehabilitative program); Georgia v. Califano, 446 F. Supp. 404 (N.D. Ga. 1977) (Medicaid overpayments). The statistical sampling technique currently employed in this process, known as Dollar Unit Sampling, Probability Proportional to Size, or Combined Attribute Variable Sampling, is widely accepted in the auditing profession. This plan is discussed in the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts' Audit and Accounting Guide entitled Audit Sampling, and is the only sampling plan capable of producing dollar projections supported by the audit software package IDEA, which is marketed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This same technique has been used by the Commission since 1980 to determine the amount of committees' matching fund payments. The Commission is using this sampling plan to evaluate committees' compliance with contribution prohibitions and limitations, itemization of contributions, omission of disclosure information and receipts documentation. See 2 U.S.C. 432(c), 434(b), 441a, 441b, 441c, 441e, 441g. For example, the Commission projects the total amount of excessive or prohibited contributions based on apparent excessive or prohibited contributions identified in a sample of a committee's contributions. This projection becomes the basis, in whole or in part, of the audit finding.
