The coastal green protective line is typically 100 to 2,000 m wide, with trees of selected species, shrubs and grass. The belt is playing a great part in preventing the loss of water and the erosion of soil in the coastal areas. Every year millions of tourists come here to enjoy themselves in the dense woods and on the soft, sandy beaches. To take advantage of the large stretches of wooded areas, local governments are planning varieties of forest and island tourist cooperative projects with foreign businessmen.
