The suspense prevailing in the country lasted only about 48 hours after Mr. Oye-Mba recently presented his resignation and that of his cabinet to the head of state. His reappointment was expected since Mr. Oye-Mba was the chairman of the electioneering campaign commission of Omar Bongo, candidate for the December 1993 presidential elections. Thus, Mr. Oye-Mba is again head of the Gabonese Government. Let us listen to the prime minister after his reappointment: [Begin Oye-Mba recording] My first impression is that of responsibility. I am extremely honored by President Bongo who has renewed his confidence in me the fourth time. This means a heavy responsibility on my shoulders; I have to deserve this confidence and serve Gabon which is in a difficult situation, especially concerning its development in economic sector and other sectors. [end recording] After giving his impressions, Mr. Oye-Mba explained how he intends to form his new cabinet: [Begin Oye-Mba recording] The head of state said he wanted the new cabinet to be formed as soon as possible. So, we will try not to waste time, but a government is not made up of only one person. A government is formed with other citizens and the political forces on the ground. This means that I will begin now to try to get in touch with the representatives of all the Gabonese political forces to put in place a cabinet capable of facing our country's situation and resolving the problems confronting Gabon. [end recording] The meeting between the Gabonese prime minister and representatives of political parties is in response to President Bongo's appeal for a one-year priority program of action. The agenda for this meeting is expected to center on the devaluation of the CFA franc and its consequences on the economy and on Gabonese's revenues, health, employment, and training.
