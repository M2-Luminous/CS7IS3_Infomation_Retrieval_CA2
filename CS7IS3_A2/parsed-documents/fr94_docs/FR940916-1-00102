FR940916-1-00102 FR940916-1-00016 FRA feels that, as train speed increases, limiting the number of responses required from the locomotive engineer will increase overall train safety. As a result, FRA proposes to require that intermediate and high speed train brake systems be computer controlled. FRA recognizes the unique designs and features that the braking systems of these types of operations may incorporate and, thus, FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the train brake systems used by these operations should be controlled by some kind of automated computer system. FRA proposes to require that these computer systems have the ability to run diagnostic programs capable of self-testing the brake system and detecting faults in the system and have the ability of either alerting the engineer to these faults or taking automatic corrective action. In addition, FRA requires that the computer software of these systems be analyzed to determine the safety impacts of software failures and to ensure that the software is fail-safe and functions as intended. Due to the unique designs that intermediate and high speed braking systems may incorporate, the inspectors of the equipment may be required to place themselves in dangerous positions in order to inspect the equipment. If that is the case, FRA feels that the brake systems should be equipped with sensors that give a reliable indication of the application and release of the brakes, visible to an engineer in the cab and to an inspector on the platform or along the side of the track. FRA proposes general design guidelines for several types of train brake system sensors. FRA intends to encourage the development of brake system sensor technology in order to improve train brake system tests and inspections while reducing the risk of personal injury. Section 232.115. This section proposes design standards for one-way EOT devices that are largely unchanged from the standards currently stated in ยง232.19. Since these standards have proven effective, FRA sees no reason to change them. The only major change to the current requirements is the extension of the calibration period for all EOT devices from 92 days to 365 days. FRA bases this proposed extension not only on its own experience but also on the comments received from several parties that the devices are fairly reliable and can operate for years without calibration problems. Although several labor representatives commented on the unreliability of the devices, these comments generally addressed the failure of the railroads to properly perform the calibrations or the misuse of the devices. Furthermore, FRA believes that the 92-day calibration period was established at a time when there was little experience with these devices. Since that time, not only has calibration of the devices not proven to be a problem, but technology has further improved the reliability of the devices. These proposed rules result in one-way EOT devices being gradually phased out of use as they are replaced by two-way EOT devices. Section 232.117. This section provides design standards for two-way EOT devices. No design standards for two-way EOT devices currently exist; however, the two-way devices currently in production meet the design requirements for one-way EOT devices and also provide two-way communication and the ability to make an emergency brake application from the rear of the train. The currently available two-way devices have several optional features that could prove very beneficial to railroads. Although FRA recommends that railroads obtain as many of the optional features as they can when purchasing the devices, FRA does not intend to mandate their use and feels that each railroad is in the best position to determine which features best suit its operation. FRA proposes to apply the one-way device design requirements to two-way devices as well as a set of specific requirements intended to ensure the existence of two-way communication and the ability to make an emergency brake application from the rear of the train. In order to prevent vandalism and to avoid the possibility of a train accidentally being placed in emergency, FRA proposes to require that the front and rear units be linked together so that the rear unit will only respond to its associated front unit. Although these proposed design requirements essentially specify a specific two-way EOT device design, FRA encourages the development of alternate equivalent or better technologies. Subpart C This proposed subpart includes qualification requirements for personnel who inspect, maintain, and test train brake systems and individuals who supervise the work of the aforementioned personnel. FRA believes that the current training provided to the individuals charged with performing brake maintenance, tests, and inspections should be greatly improved in order to ensure that train brake system maintenance, tests, and inspections are performed properly. Several labor organizations and their individual members explicitly commented that they are not sufficiently trained to perform the inspections and tests required of them. In addition, several railroads admitted that the training they currently provide could be improved. FRA recognizes that many railroads are attempting to improve their training programs; however, FRA thinks that minimum training qualifications need to be established to assure that brake inspections and tests are being properly performed in order to protect both the public and railroad employees from the operation of equipment that does not meet Federal standards. Although there has been a decline in the number of train accidents, derailments, fatalities, and injuries over the last ten years, FRA believes that the number of these incidents will be further reduced if maintenance, inspections, and tests of the brake system are performed by individuals who have received this minimum training. Railroads continue to consolidate mechanical work to fewer and fewer locations on the railroad. This trend places an increasing premium on the ability of train crews to conduct meaningful inspections and tests of the power brake system. Although features of this proposal offer incentives for proper deployment of mechanical forces, increases in train speeds and increased pressure on operating personnel due to growing traffic density will continue to make it critical for train crews to discharge their duties with respect to power brake systems both diligently and effectively even under the most optimistic of scenarios with respect to the operation of incentives.
