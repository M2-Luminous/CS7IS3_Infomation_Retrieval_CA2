FR941020-2-00009 FR941020-2-00007 [C&hyph;357&hyph;052] Non-Rubber Footwear From Argentina; Determination not to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on non-rubber footwear from Argentina. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Lorenza Olivas, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69343) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on non-rubber footwear from Argentina (52 FR 3474; January 17, 1979). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. On January 21, 1994, we received objections filed on behalf of forty U.S. manufacturers of non-rubber footwear, interested parties within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.2(i)(3). Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: October 13, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26053 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
