Groznyy sees consultations with the Chechen opposition, underway in Moscow, as a sign that Moscow has no intention of settling problems in bilateral relations by civilized and peaceful means. The statement says Moscow's dialog with what is known as Chechnya's Provisional Council proves that Moscow "is trying to destabilize the situation in the Caucasus and the Chechen republic with a view to occupy Chechnya". As a result, it is practically impossible for Groznyy to hold negotiations with Moscow. The Chechen leaders repeat that a solution to the problem of bilateral relations can be found only by Presidents Dudayev and Yeltsin, in a face-to-face rendezvous. Only a meeting between the two presidents can return to the norm relations between the Chechen republic and the Russian Federation, says Groznyy. All contacts with the so-called public and political forces, as represented by the Provisional Council, "will yield no result other than aggravation of bilateral relations". Dudayev's Office rejected reports on plans to send an official delegation to Moscow.
