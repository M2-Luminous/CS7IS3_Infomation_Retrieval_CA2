[passage omitted] Political observers yesterday interpreted Kliridhis' open warning as an answer to insistent efforts at the Security Council and in Cyprus -- with the continuous meetings between Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas -- to help the Turkish Cypriot side, even though the "agreement" on the 21 March document is set. It must be noted that there has been no reply so far to Kliridhis' letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major. Asked to explain the reasons that may force Kliridhis to resign, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis clarified that this is a strictly personal issue for the president and noted the "inconsistency" of others, implying the United States and Britain. Kasoulidhis mentioned that there are three hypothetical scenarios: a) Denktas accepts the 21 March UN document, and there is an agreement on the confidence-building measures; b) negotiations begin on issues other than the 21 March document; c) a dialogue begins and our side raises its objections. Kasoulidhis said that in the first case we would have immediate agreement. The National Council's decision, to which the president is committed, clearly states that discussion on the confidence-building measures has ended. However, the president made it clear to National Council members that he has accepted the 21 March UN document, and if Denktas accepts it, even now, he will accept it too. A serious issue would be created if talks begin on issues other than the 21 March UN document, because the UN secretary general's representatives told the president it was the last UN document. As a result, Kliridhis lifted his objections to reach an agreement. In the third case, Kasoulidhis said reservations and objections would return to the negotiating table if we were led to an endless procedure. He added: Although we will also raise objections, our side will be in a very difficult position because the president has accepted the 21 March document. The spokesman stressed that the president believes that, if necessary, he would make it easier for the Cypriot Hellenism to call for presidential elections in order for the new president to receive a public order without the obligation of accepting the document. Commenting on an observation that Denktas may finally give a positive answer, the spokesman said: "Denktas supposedly has approached some UN positions, but not the 21 March document."
