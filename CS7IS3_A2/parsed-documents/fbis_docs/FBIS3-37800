That was how Andrey Kozyrev and Andrzej Olechowski, the foreign ministers of Russia and Poland, summed up the progress and results of the bilateral talks that ended here late in the evening on 22 February. During the meeting, the whole spectrum of relations between the two states was examined, said A. Kozyrev, replying to questions from ITAR-TASS correspondents. A number of very interesting initiatives were put forward, covering the economy, culture and social relations between our countries. Unfortunately, the Russian minister noted, many specific accords reached during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Warsaw last August have not been fully implemented. That is why the present talks are extremely important. We have met in order to "puff along," as Mr. Olechowski says, that is, to urge these processes on. We are on the right path, A. Kozyrev pointed out when appraising the state of bilateral relations. In the Russian minister's opinion, the part to be played by Poland and other Central European countries in building a united Europe is very important. Equitable Russo-Polish cooperation should be a substantial factor in it. Our states official relations "do not look at all bad," A. Olechowski observed. The task now is to fill them "with benevolent content." Mr. Kozyrev and I have discussed a number of concrete actions and have made a number of concrete decisions: "We are thinking about some, we are working on others, and we have agreed on a third group." All that is the "puffing along," as my counterpart put it jokingly, the development of our relations . Commenting at the request of the ITAR-TASS correspondent on the thoughts of the Polish mass media on the present role of Russia -- as "adversary or partner of Poland," A. Olechowski said: "Neighbors should never be adversaries. The question now is how to pave the way as quickly as possible from relations of neighbors to relations of very good neighbors, and then to relations of a friend." It is understandable that it is impossible to achieve this in a few days, but we should try to achieve it as quickly as possible, the Polish minister pointed out. Speaking about Russia's attitude to the problem of Poland joining NATO, A. Kozyrev noted that this question had been discussed "in a very confidential and realistic way." It is now necessary to concentrate on participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program, the minister said. There was no ruling out one country or another joining NATO. And these countries should find their own way to making a decision. It is possible, he pointed out, that Russia may join NATO too. But there may also be other options. A machinery of interaction of the partners has already been created now. This is the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, A. Kozyrev pointed out.
