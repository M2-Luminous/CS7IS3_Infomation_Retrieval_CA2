The establishment of this center, according to economists, marks the initiation of a multi-layered financial market system in this economically developed province. To further the reform of the financial system, Zhejiang has over the past few years established a host of fund-circulation centers, foreign exchange circulation centers and securities exchanges. Meanwhile, a multi-layered financial market system, covering inter-bank loan markets and foreign exchange swap markets as well as securities exchanges, has started to take shape. The province has some 45 securities exchange business departments, where people can trade freely stock shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges as well as financial bonds, treasury bonds and time certificates. Official sources said that the transaction value in those departments reached more than 30 billion yuan last year. According to official statistics, the business done at the provincial funds circulation center and foreign exchange circulation center hit a record 17.9 billion yuan and 1.94 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 67.7 percent and 41.2 percent from the previous year, respectively. To regulate the expanded and invigorated financial market the provincial government has drawn up a series of management rules and regulations and has set up a competitive pricing system as well as automatic price quotation system, aiming at standardizing and systematizing the financial market. In addition, the province has opened the financial sector wider to the outside world in the last few years. According to official sources, last year the province approved its first Sino-foreign joint-stock bank (the Zhejiang Commercial Bank) and a solely foreign-funded bank (the Ningbo International Bank). The Standard Chartered Bank of Britain has also set up an office in Hangzhou, capital of the province. At present, the province is making efforts to boost the work of transforming its specialized banks into commercial banks, in order to speed up the reform of the financial sector and invigorate the financial market. Approved by the People's Bank of China last year, the province has stepped up the preparatory work of establishing two commercial banks -- the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou Branch and the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Industrial Bank's Hangzhou Branch. The flourishing financial sector has greatly accelerated the economic development of the province. Official statistics show that last year the provincial gross domestic product and fiscal revenue hit some 164.5 billion yuan and 16.66 billion yuan, up by 25 percent and 38.6 percent, respectively, over the previous year.
