FR940525-0-00031 FR940525-0-00020 B. Regulations Revisions We are adding to ยง406.32, Monthly premiums, a new paragraph (b)(3) to show the year by year reductions required by the statute and a new paragraph (c) to show the requirements for qualifying for the reduction. We are redesignating paragraph (b)(3) as (b)(4) and revising its contents, which concern rounding off fractions of dollars, to specify that the paragraph applies to the unreduced and the reduced Part A premium. We are redesignating current paragraphs (c) through (f) as (d) through (g), respectively. V. Extension of 10 Percent Reduction in Payments for Capital-Related Costs of Outpatient Hospital Services A. Legislative Provision Under 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I) of the Act, Medicare pays the capital costs of hospitals allocated to outpatient departments on the basis of reasonable cost principles, subject to a 10 percent reduction through FY 1995. (Sole community hospitals and rural primary care hospitals are exempt from these reductions.) Section 13521 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I) of the Act to extend the 10 percent reduction through FY 1998. B. Regulations Revisions We are revising ยง413.130(j)(1)(ii), Reduction to capital-related costs, to extend to 1998 the year through which the 10 percent reduction applies. VI. Extension of Reduction in Payments for Other Costs for Outpatient Hospital Services A. Legislative Provision Under section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act, Medicare payments for hospital outpatient services made on a reasonable cost basis and the cost portion of outpatient services paid on the basis of a blended amount are both reduced by 5.8 percent through FY 1995. Section 13522 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act to extend the application of the reduction through FY 1998. B. Regulations Revisions We are revising ยง413.124, Reduction to hospital outpatient operating costs, to extend to 1998 the year through which the 5.8 percent reductions apply. VII. Reduction in Payments for Intraocular Lenses A. Legislative Provision Section 1833(i)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act includes in the cost of surgery to insert an intraocular lens during or after cataract surgery a payment that is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved. Section 4151 of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90)) froze the amount of payment for the lens at $200. Section 13533 of OBRA 93 reduced the payment amount for intraocular lenses inserted during or after cataract surgery in an ambulatory surgical center on or after January 1, 1994 and before January 1, 1999. For that period, the payment is $150. B. Regulations Revisions Our regulations do not contain the specific amounts allowable for intraocular lenses, which are, instead, contained in our administrative guidelines. Therefore, we are making no changes to regulations to implement the legislation. VIII. Payment for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrients, Supplies and Equipment During 1994 and 1995 A. Legislative Provision In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;509), section 9340 provided that reasonable charges for parenteral and enteral nutrition supplies and equipment may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which the supplies and equipment are widely and consistently available. Under our regulations at 42 CFR 405.511(c) those levels are set at the 25th percentile of the charges for the items or services, in the locality designated by the carrier for this purpose, during the three month period of July 1 through September 30 preceding the fee screen year for which the item or service was furnished. Section 13541 of OBRA 93 requires that in determining the amount of Part B payment for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment during 1994 and 1995, the charges determined to be reasonable with respect to these items may not exceed the charges determined to be reasonable for them during 1993. B. Regulation Revision As our payment regulations do not specifically address payments for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment, we do not need to revise our regulations to implement this provision of OBRA 93 but will make any necessary changes in our program manuals. IX. Increase in Annual Cap on Amount of Medicare Payment for Outpatient Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Services A. Legislative Provision Section 1833(g) of the Act limits the amount payable annually for covered outpatient physical and occupational therapy services provided by independently practicing physical and occupational therapists. Section 6133(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation of 1989 (OBRA 89) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the maximum amount of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $500 to $750, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1990, and section 13555 of OBRA 93 amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the maximum amount of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $750 to $900, effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 1994. B. Regulations Revisions We are revising paragraph (c)(2) of 42 CFR 410.60, Outpatient physical therapy services: Conditions, to show the various caps since before 1982 through 1994 for physical therapy services furnished by independent physical therapists. There is currently no corresponding regulation section for occupational therapy but we will include the $900 cap when we publish final regulations on those services.
