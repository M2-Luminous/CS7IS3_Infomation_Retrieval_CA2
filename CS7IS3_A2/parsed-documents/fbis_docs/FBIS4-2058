The president is scheduled to visit Costa Rica and South Africa for presidential inauguration ceremonies next month. It will be his second overseas trip this year. Tai told reporters that President Li's visit abroad is to seek international cooperation so as to help decrese the hostility between Taiwan and the mainland. He was quoted as saying Taiwan and the mainland should act like brothers, not like father and son, and the two sides should help each other bring about a new China. Regarding his recent trips to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, Tai said the trip was not meant to poison relations between Peking [Beijing] and the three nations. Instead, Tai stressed, Taiwan is seeking more economic cooperation with those countries.
