Today, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria made a technical stopover at the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen, during which he met with his Panamanian counterpart Guillermo Endara. Cesar Gaviria declared his meeting with Endara at the airport had nothing to do with his possible participation in the bid for the post of OAS secretary general, nor was it intended to pressure the Endara government to support him. [Begin Gaviria recording] We are working on all fronts. We want to have better control of our borders, but we are also working on commercial aspects. The Grancolombiana Merchant Fleet is working on an interesting project to begin ferry transportation on a daily basis between Cartagena, Colon, and Panama City. This is a very interesting project that for the time being will resolve the Darien gap problem and will allow us to have permanent transit not only between Panama and Colombia, but also between Central and South America. [end recording] Gaviria stressed he came to strengthen bilateral ties. He then left the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen to attend the inauguration of new Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Meanwhile, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara called his brief meeting with Gaviria as positive. He also explained that his decision to not attend the inauguration of the new president of Honduras was because he prefers to stay in the country to think about possible changes he will make in his government cabinet.
