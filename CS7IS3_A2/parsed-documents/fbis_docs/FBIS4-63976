The council was established two years ago in Copenhagen and authorized to jointly resolve problems of economic cooperation, the environment, illegal immigration, and organized crime. But the main event for the country was the arrival in Tallinn of Andrey Kozyrev. Russian-Estonian talks had become stalemated, the last meeting between politicians at this level having taken place back in December 1992. So everyone was eagerly expecting Kozyrev in Tallinn. In an exclusive interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, the minister said: "We have nevertheless managed to create the post of supreme commissar for national minorities' affairs. He works mainly in the [former Soviet] Baltic countries. We have prevailed on the Council of Europe, which was quick to grant Estonia membership, to send a mission to Estonia; this mission now works there practically full time, and is also making fairly serious demands that the regime relating to our compatriots should be adjusted. And finally, this forum sees the appointment of a new commissar whose task includes strengthening democratic principles. But what kind of democracy are we talking about if almost one-third of the population are considered foreigners? You know, in order to secure ratification of this mandate, I was even obliged to issue a threat that I would not come to this meeting."
