FR941206-0-00051 FR941206-0-00008 The counterpart Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) includes the more general requirement that, at the completion of phase II, after revegetation has been established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, an additional amount of bond may be released. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) is more specific than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) in that Colorado has defined, as discussed below, what is meant by ``revegetation establishment'' for phase II bond release. The Federal regulation does not specify the percentage of the bond amount that may be released at phase II, but it does require that the regulatory authority shall retain that amount of bond for the revegetated area which would be sufficient to cover the cost of re-establishing revegetation if completed by a third party. Although Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) provides for release of up to 85 percent of a bond at phase II, Colorado's Rules 3.03.1(3) (a) and (d) also require, that when determining the amount of bond to be released, Colorado must retain the amount of bond necessary for Colorado to complete the approved reclamation plan (see discussion of Colorado's proposed revisions at Rule 3.03.1(3)(d) in finding No. 8.a above). With respect to Colorado's proposed requirement that prior to phase II bond release an operator establish vegetation which exhibits seasonality and species composition consistent with the ultimate achievement of the success standards, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111 and 817.111 require, among other things, that a permittee establish where appropriate a vegetative cover that is diverse, effective, and permanent, and to re-establish plant species that have the same seasonal characteristics of growth as the original vegetation and are capable of self-regeneration and plant succession. Colorado's requirement for seasonality and species composition that are consistent with ultimate achievement of the success standards is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111 and 817.111. With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which meets the approved success standards according to Rule 4.15.8 for cover, referenced Rule 4.15.8 is consistent with, and has been previously approved by OSM as no less effective than, the requirements for vegetative cover in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111, 816.116 (a) and (b), 817.111, and 817.116(a) (1) and (2). With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which meets the approved success standards according to Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for productivity on prime farmlands or alluvial valley floors, as discussed in finding No. 8.c below, Colorado's referenced Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2) and 823.15. With respect to the requirement that, prior to phase II bond release, an operator must establish vegetation which meets the approved success standards according to Rule 4.15.9 on croplands, Colorado's referenced Rule 4.15.9 sets forth the requirements for demonstration of success of revegetation on cropland. The requirements of Colorado's Rule 4.15.9 are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(3) and 817.116(b)(3) for cropland that receives less than 26 inches of annual average precipitation. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) requires that, prior to phase II bond release on cropland, an operator must demonstrate that vegetation, which meets the approved success standard for productivity on cropland during a single year of the liability period, has been established. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), in conjunction with referenced Rule 4.15.9, is consistent with the phase II bond release and revegetation success requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2), 816.116(c)(3), and 817.116(c)(3) for areas that receive less than 26 inches of annual average precipitation. Based on the discussion above, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(2), 816.111, 816.116 (a), (b), and (c), 817.111, and 817.116 (a), (b), and (c). The Director approves the proposed rule. c. Rules 3.03.1(2)(b), 3.03.1(3)(b), and 4.25.5(3)(a), The Criteria for Successful Establishment of Revegetation on Prime Farmlands At proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), Colorado requires, prior to phase II bond release, that an operator establish vegetation which meets, among other things, the approved revegetation success standards according to Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for productivity on prime farmlands and alluvial valley floors.
