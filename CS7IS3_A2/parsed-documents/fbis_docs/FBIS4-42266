Turkish Officials Make Arrangements for Meeting With Iraqi Kurdish Leaders"] [Text] London -- Iran appears to have failed to convince Turkey of the possibility of a joint operation inside the Iraqi Kurdish areas which have, over the past three weeks, witnessed an armed conflict between the two largest parties there. According to identical reports from the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani, Turkish Government officials have intensified their contacts with the two Kurdish leaders to help them bridge their views and end the estrangement resulting from the recent fighting between them. Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Turkish officials are making arrangements for a tripartite meeting in Turkey to be attended by representatives of the Turkish Government and the two Kurdish parties, and probably by PUK Secretary General Jalal Talabani who is now in Damascus. The Turkish sources said that the discussions at the meeting would not be confined to the tension between Barzani and Talabani but would also cover relations between Ankara and the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq and the situation resulting from the exodus of thousands of Turkish Kurds to Iraqi Kurdistan to escape the military operations carried out by the Turkish Army in the Kurdish areas adjacent to the border with Iraq against fighters of the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. The sources expected the meeting to be held after the 'Id al-Adha holiday. The Turkish press reported last week that a visiting Iranian delegation had suggested to Ankara that a joint operation be launched to put an end to the fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan. According to PUK sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard elements are taking part in the operations against PUK forces in areas near the border with Iran, and Iranian artillery is shelling Iraqi Kurdish areas from across the border. Other Kurdish forces and international relief officials have confirmed these reports but KDP sources have not. Iran has accused Talabani's party of providing shelter and aid for the Kurdish parties opposed to the Iranian Government. Turkey feels that instability in northern Iraq suits the PKK, which has been fighting the Turkish state for 10 years, in that it enables the PKK to set up bases and staging posts in the mountainous areas near the border with Turkey. It is worth noting that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel announced at a press conference last Monday [23 May] that Turkey intended to contact Barzani and Talabani "to promote a peaceful solution between them." As regards the armed conflict between the parties of Barzani and Talabani, sources of the two parties in the areas where the clashes started early this month say that the situation there ranges from guarded calm to limited clashes in isolated spots. The sources are cautious when it comes to the question of whether or not the current truce would develop into a firm peace. Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that earlier this week Barzani and Talabani spoke to each other by telephone, for the first time in several days, and, the sources say, they also exchanged fax messages focusing on the cease-fire agreements reached by their two parties and "emphasizing the importance of Talabani's presence in Kurdistan alongside Barzani to implement these agreements."
