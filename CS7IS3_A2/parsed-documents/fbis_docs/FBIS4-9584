This was announced by the SNS Central Council at its conference held in Banska Bystrica on Saturday [23 April]. SNS Chairman Jan Slota also said at a meeting with journalists that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Christian Social Union [KSU] are being taken into consideration as possible partners for a preelection coalition. The selection of the KSU for preelection cooperation will be influenced by the outcome of the KSU all-Slovak assembly following its session on 1 May. The SNS intends to proceed in the elections as a force uniting Slovaks in South Slovakia and as the advocate of their interests. Slota is convinced that the nationally oriented parties and movements will win by a substantial majority in the elections.
