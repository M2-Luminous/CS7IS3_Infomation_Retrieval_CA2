Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, the Chiapas Government secretary general, has told a news conference that the EZLN "aggressors" left the mayors offices in Las Margaritas and Chanal today and that Mexican Army troops are in the city of Comitan, south of San Cristobal, to guarantee peace. The EZLN forces violently seized the mayors offices in San Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, Chanal, Altamirano, and Ocosingo on 1 January in what constituted a violent guerrilla outbreak. The guerrillas left San Cristobal on 2 January and moved toward Rancho Nuevo, where they have sustained several clashes with the troops stationed at the 31st Military Zone Garrison. The EZLN presence continues in Ocosingo, where there have been clashes, and Altamirano, Oxchuch, Huiztan, and Cuxulja, which they occupied on Sunday. Certain reports stated that a group of rebels has taken over Guadalupe Tepeyac, in Las Margaritas Municipality. Gonzalez Lastra said he trusts that order will be reestablished in Ocosingo and Altamirano "within the next few hours." Media reports, which authorities have not confirmed, state that the troops arrested 12 civilians in Comitan. Near the city an EZLN unit kidnapped former Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos on Sunday. His whereabouts are unknown.
