He negatively commented on the introduction of the office of the Ukrainian president's representative in Crimea, describing this step as a political provocation aimed at hindering the second round of elections for the Crimean Supreme Council. Regarding presidential representative Valeriy Horbatov, Yuriy Meshkov said in a televised interview yesterday that Crimean interests are Horbatov's least concern, and that a honest man who cherishes these interests will not shake his hand. At the news conference, Meshkov added that the Republic of Crimea has lost one of its citizens. In a sharp and even offensive tone, Meshkov spoke of the Ukrainian leadership, which, in his opinion, prevents the Crimea from dealing with its economy, provokes confrontation, and creates tensions on the peninsula. The presence of military subunits saturated -- as he put it -- with nationalistic spirit not only does not guarantee Crimean security, but also threatens it. Many questions from journalists concerned relations between Yuriy Meshkov and Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Saburov. Meshkov stated that he corrected Saburov's mistakes by issuing another decree. Effective today, the previous low prices for bread are reinstated in the Crimea. The Crimean president does not share the concern that Saburov might be dismissed, which is being voiced behind the scenes.
