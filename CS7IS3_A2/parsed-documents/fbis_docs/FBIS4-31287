When the coalition talks are completed, the SZDSZ will decide at another convention whether to approve the draft coalition agreement. We interviewed Gabor Kuncze, a leading member of the SZDSZ, on the conditions set by the Free Democrats. [Dano] Do you still see yourself as a prime ministerial candidate? [Kuncze] After the second round of elections, the Free Democrats do not have a chance to name a prime ministerial candidate. [Dano] Were there any concrete facts in the Socialists' offer for negotiations? [Kuncze] There were not any. However, we assume that both sides are open and ready to make compromises, and that they are thinking in terms of the whole negotiating package. Within this, we have to have detailed talks on the program of governmental cooperation and the elements of efficient governmental and parliamentary work, and we have to decide on personnel and the distribution of the ministries. [Dano] Is it possible that the person filling the presidential post will also be discussed? [Kuncze] If this issue is raised then the SZDSZ insists on Arpad Goncz. [Dano] Do you disregard the SZDSZ's former statement that [MSZP Chairman] Horn's nomination for prime minister might stop the SZDSZ from entering the coalition? Generally, can any of the MSZP's offers make the SZDSZ accept Horn as prime minister? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not yet withdrawn this statement but the situation is fundamentally different. The MSZP gained an absolute majority and we have to take this into consideration at our talks. [Dano] Can the MSZP give guarantees for a liberal economic policy? [Kuncze] It is not worth partaking of power for power's sake alone. The stake of the negotiations is whether the SZDSZ can receive guarantees that make it possible to implement elements of our ideas -- naturally, through compromises. If these guarantees do not exist then the SZDSZ must not enter the coalition because, in this situation, it would only be given various positions. A guarantee could be if the principle of majority voting cannot automatically prevail in the coalition. My meaning is that the SZDSZ's effective influence in the governmental work must not become doubtful. Therefore, at the negotiations, both sides will have to show a large degree of willingness for compromise, and empathy, and the talks will have to be conducted with absolute openness and goodwill. [Dano] Do you think it possible that the economic ministries will be merged in the new government? [Kuncze] The governmental structure will be an issue at the coalition talks. According to the SZDSZ, one person has to be responsible for the economic policy within the government. One kind of economic policy is needed, rather than three kinds that characterized the previous government's activities. The question is whether the economic top minister should be responsible for the economic ministry or the finance ministry. [Dano] Do you insist on having one of the economic ministries to yourselves? [Kuncze] Again, we can only answer this during the negotiations. The size of the MSZP's majority cannot be questioned. This has to be accepted and the ministries have to be distributed accordingly. On the other hand, the MSZP obviously accepts that it is only worth for the SZDSZ to enter into a coalition if it can also be given important ministries. These can also be economic ones. [Dano] You mentioned that you will reconsider the governmental structure at the negotiations. Is it possible that establishing a position of deputy prime minister will be raised? [Kuncze] This position might be created. If it is then the constitution has to be amended because this position is not in it. If this position is created then the deputy prime minister will also be responsible for the activities of other ministries, but he will not have the right to instruct other ministers. [Dano] Do you require any of the ministries of armed forces? [Kuncze] It would not be fortunate to insist on anything in advance. However, the SZDSZ would be capable of supervising the Interior Ministry. [Dano] What are your views on the suggestion that the MSZP would subordinate the civil secret service to the Interior Ministry? [Kuncze] Numerous versions are possible. For us it is inconceivable that a minister without portfolio should continue to be responsible for this area. However, it is not certain that the Interior Ministry is the best place for the secret service. It might be better placed in the Justice Ministry. [Dano] Would you ban government party deputies questioning the ministers in parliament? [Kuncze] This cannot be banned because this ensures the independence of the deputies. However, we would not like the government party deputies to question the ministers in parliament and take the opportunity away from the opposition deputies. Questions to ministers are the most important tool of the opposition. However, the government party deputies have to be given the opportunity to turn to the minister in a given situation and the minister has to be compelled to give an answer within a certain period of time. If the minister's reply cannot be accepted then the problem has to be dealt with in the parliamentary groups.
