Petr Filipov, head of the Russian Federation president's social policy analysis center, says that irrespective of various reform pledges made by Viktor Chernomyrdin and his deputy Soskovets, what counts is their financial policy. He believes that they will abandon Fedorov's strict controls over credits and reintroduce subsidies to unprofitable industry to appease voters. In his words, "the resignation of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov from the Russian Government will undoubtedly complicate our advancement along the path of economic reforms." Economist Pavel Bunich believes that the government decided to change the course of reforms even before Fedorov's resignation and thinks that some degree of adjustment is indeed necessary. However, he voices concern that the government's determination to change the course of reforms may go too far. He believes that too many old-timers who were in positions of authority during Ryzhkov's and Pavlov's time are surrounding the government and there is a danger that they could try to reverse the reforms.
