Nevertheless, it is not the mediating services of the Norwegian Government that will be remembered, but the moment when U.S. President Clinton, arms held wide, formed the background for the historic handshake between Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat. The U.S. Administration, the superpower United States, was the godfather of the agreement and signaled the seriousness of the difficult new undertaking. At the beginning of March, the scene was repeated in Washington, even though at a lower echelon of diplomatic hierarchy. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stood behind Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic and Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Granic when the two initialed a Croatian-Bosnia agreement on a common state consisting of cantons. Once again the truth has proved true, which is more than well known from the times of the Cold War -- namely, that the superpower United States can solve problems if it uses its diplomatic weight. This is an impression that became quite obvious shortly before, when NATO broke the ring of siege around Sarajevo with the threat of bombing [Serbian positions], especially with the help of U.S. fighter bombers. There you see, it was thought, the Europeans had held discussions and mediated for almost two years, but the United States finally really achieved something by threatening to use force. Moscow immediately jumped on the train, and once again it seemed as if the old superpowers alone would do the trick. This impression is correct and wrong at the same time. The way in which the opportunity of putting an end to the two years of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has developed and is growing confirms the old insight that it is not coalitions that pursue foreign policy but nations. The attempt to end the war between the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims by means of multilateral organizations, represented by mediators Vance, Stoltenberg (United Nations), and Owen (European Union), proved to be unsuitable. The warring parties accepted the mediators and repeatedly split them up at the negotiating table. British against French, French against Germans, Germans against Greeks. Nothing could be seen of the nascent common foreign and security policy of the European Union after Maastricht. In the meantime, the warring parties seized their opportunities on the battlefield. The European Union looked just as helpless as the blue helmet soldiers at and between the frontlines. Despite all the economic power and political relations, it proved to be depressing for the Europeans that "the West" is not able to settle crises such as the one in the Balkans without the United States. However, just as the Gaza-Jericho agreement was not possible without the preparations in Norway, the Croatian-Bosnian agreement is not conceivable without long preparations and work. And that was done by the European Union, in particular by the cooperation between Paris and Bonn. Graphically speaking, the Europeans brought in the piano on which the United States can now play its triumphal march as the superpower. Ever since the action plan was recommended by Foreign Ministers Juppe and Kinkel to the European Union last November, a red thread of persistent negotiations and flexible plans has been running through the emerging peace process for Bosnia. Just as the continuing embargo against Serbia, giving up the plan to divide Bosnia into three parts contributed to pulling the United States into the peace process. Bonn's approach to bring Croats and Muslims together led to first negotiations in Vienna and at Petersberg in Bonn at the beginning of January; to negotiations at Frankfurt Airport; to the Bosnian conference in Bonn; and finally to new negotiations in Vienna. Mr. Chrobog, the political director of the Foreign Ministry, went to Moscow and Washington in November to integrate this dimension in the mediating process. If the agreement, in which now the Serbs are also showing interest for the first time, is signed in Washington in a few days, the European Union has very right to be visibly participating. The fact that this will probably be done on the back burner is reason enough for the Europeans to think about how they can -- as soon as possible -- use more than just their economic potential to settle conflicts. "It is too early for us," a high-ranking official of the Foreign Ministry stated, referring to the need of the European Union to be able to use military means to give bite to the Union's diplomacy and foreign policy -- bite that is, as the Bosnian war clearly shows, is necessary to be successful. The United States should also be interested in that, especially since it again and again experiences the magical point in foreign policy, from where on prestige and military potential are the decisive elements.
