He conveyed to him the greetings and gratitude of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council. He explained in detail the situation in our country, particularly after the war criminal, traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has fomented sedition among the sons of the Armed Forces in order to attain his treacherous conspiratorial aims. The brother minister told the UN secretary general that the secessionist gang does not represent the south or the Socialist Party, but only itself, and that it broke away from legitimacy and national unity. He said broad popular sectors as well as all leaders, members, and cadres of parties and sons of the Yemeni people do not agree with the secessionist clique's explosion of the situation or its treacherous secession announcement. He told him that unity took place peacefully and was blessed by the people and recognized by the Arabs and the world. He added that elections took place and a referendum on the constitution was held and that the claim that the unity was imposed by force is baseless. On the contrary, he said, there are attempts to impose secession by force by this deluded secessionist gang. He indicated that those who demand peace do not want or desire peace or even the existence of a strong and sound Yemen. The UN secretary general expressed his desire to convey his greetings to the brother chairman of the Presidential Council. He said neither he nor the Security Council is biased toward any party, but there is right and wrong and there is no neutrality between the two. Yahya Jaghman, our ambassador in Geneva, attended the meeting.
