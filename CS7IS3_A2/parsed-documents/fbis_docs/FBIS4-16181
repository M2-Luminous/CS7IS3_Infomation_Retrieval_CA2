This was said at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information and press department. He said "the Russian delegation proposed visiting Odessa together with Ukrainian representatives." According to G. Karasin, "the Russian side made this proposal in the belief that a joint visit to Odessa by Russian and Ukrainian representatives and their possible meetings and conversations with people could have been received with satisfaction and understanding by public opinion both in Russia and Ukraine and would have helped ease the tension which has arisen following the recent incidents around the Black Sea Fleet in Odessa." Such a joint working visit would undoubtedly have been in the spirit of cooperation and friendship between our peoples, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
