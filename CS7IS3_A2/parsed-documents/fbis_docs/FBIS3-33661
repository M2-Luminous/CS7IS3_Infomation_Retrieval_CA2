Now 53, the man with silver hair and a pepper-and-salt moustache emerged from three years in the wilderness last year to succeed Major-General Khaled Nezzar as defence minister. Nezzar was widely considered the strongman of the five-man presidential college that has ruled since president Chadli Bendjedid resigned on January 11, 1992, shortly before the cancellation of the second round of a general election that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win. Zeroual has kept his forays into the public debate on the country's political future to a minimum. But in two memorable statements on October 24 and January 16, he warned that while the army remained neutral, it would not stand by passively in the face of dangerous developments that were threatening the fate of the nation. His unscheduled televised broadcast on January 16, a vain attempt to galvanise the key political players into attending this week's abortive national conference, had the stamp of a presidential hopeful. It had been hoped the conference could choose a new president, but in the absence of comprehensive participation, the task fell to the HCS. In that televised speech, Zeroual called in firm and solemn tones for a "new national political system to enshrine true democracy, to guarantee all individual and collective freedoms and to put an end to political, economic, cultural and ideological monopolies." He also called for a "complete break from the old style and methods of management." Zeroual's army colleagues portray him as reserved and a man of principle. He resigned as commander of land forces and deputy chief-of-staff and quit the army in 1989 after clashing with Bendjedid about his plans for a military shake-up. He was then named ambassador to Romania, but resigned after less than a year to get away from politics and spend time in his hometown. After the assassination of caretaker president Mohammed Boudiaf on July 29, 1992, there were persistent rumours that he would be appointed interior minister or a kind of secretary-general of the five-man presidency. But he got neither job, and it was much to the surprise of most people that he was appointed defence minister on July 3 last year. His appointment was seen as the army's way of inciting the politicians to reform the management of the civil service. Zeroual, who advocates a professional army, has in his long career as a serving officer commanded the Tamanrasset military region in the extreme south of Algeria in 1982, Bechar on the Moroccan border in 1984 and Constantine in eastern Algeria in 1987. He has also commanded two of the army's training schools, including the Cherchel Academy, the nursery for the officer elite.
