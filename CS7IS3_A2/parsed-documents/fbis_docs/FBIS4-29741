"From the series of talks (with North Korean officials), I got an impression that the country possesses nuclear weapons," Yoichi Tani told a press conference. Tani, along with former Defense Agency head Taku Yamasaki, visited North Korea last week and held talks with North Korean officials, including Korean Workers' Party Secretaries Kim Yong-son and Hwang Chang-yop. Tani criticized recent remarks by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who said he did not believe North Korea has atomic bombs. "I don't have the slightest idea why he said such a thing," Tani said. Yamasaki, also at the press conference, said North Korea is now considering opening the door to its market after solving the nuclear issue diplomatically.
