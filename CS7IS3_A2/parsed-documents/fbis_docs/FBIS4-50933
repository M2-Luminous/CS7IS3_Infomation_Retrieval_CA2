On the morning of 9 May, the provincial government held a trade and investment briefing at the conference room of the Korea Exhibition Center. Sun Yaoting, deputy secretary general of the provincial government, chaired the briefing, and Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu gave an introduction on Jilin's natural resources, investment climate, foundations for agriculture, industry, education, and science and technology, current foreign economic relations and trade, and preferential policies. Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu said: Jilin Province welcomes more foreign investors and Overseas Chinese to come to discuss trade and develop industries. The Jilin Provincial government will make utmost efforts to help promote all the projects of common interest that are mutually beneficial and will, as always, provide various preferential policies. On the basis of the preferential policies stipulated by the state, we have also drawn up 29 encouraging policies on import and export management, production and operation, and tax levy. These policies have four major characteristics. First, the areas in which foreign investment can be made are relaxed even more, and we encourage investment to be made chiefly in developing enterprises producing export products, enterprises with advanced technology, enterprises engaged in building infrastructural facilities and exploiting resources, the pillar industries and superior industries Jilin will develop on a priority basis, fund- and technology-intensive industries, and the technical transformation of the existing enterprises. Second, the measures for attracting foreign investment will be more flexible and varied. In addition to money and technology investment to build joint ventures or exclusively foreign-funded enterprises, we also allow some investors to invest with materials to buy the property rights of our enterprises, develop Chinese-foreign limited liability stock companies, or carry out land development in large areas. Third, even more preferential policies will be applied to the levies of taxes and fees from foreign-funded enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises which invested more than $10 million in the areas we have encouraged will have their taxes reduced and levied at the rate of 15 percent when their tax reduction and exemption periods expire and when they have obtained approval from tax organizations. When foreign firms use the profits they have earned from the "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" to reinvest in building the enterprises in the fields we encourage, the income tax they have paid for the profits which they use to reinvest will be refunded. Fourth, the procedures for screening and approving the establishment of foreign-funded enterprises will be simplified, and the procedures will be handled by the foreign economic relations bureau in a unified manner. When Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu finished his introduction, responsible persons of relevant provincial government departments answered questions raised by pertinent ROK personages. The briefing proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. According to incomplete statistics compiled up to the evening of 9 May, transactions reached at the trade fair had totaled $44.1 million, and agreement was reached on 81 foreign investment projects involving $840 million, of which $521 million would be made by foreign firms. Of these projects, 51 were contracts involving $109.52 million, of which $79.77 million would be foreign funds.
