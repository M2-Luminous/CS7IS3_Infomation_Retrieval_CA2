We expected the situation to calm down. Instead, the Muslims are making every effort to improve their military positions and to depict themselves as victims in order to provoke military intervention, Krajisnik told Novi Sad radio. He said that the Muslim side did not want a cease-fire, nor does it want a cease-fire across the entire territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received]. He said that the Srpska republic is attempting in every possible way to present the truth to the world and prove that the Muslim side has brought about the latest crisis around Gorazde. We have, Krajisnik stressed, ceased all military activity around Gorazde. The foreign media are, however, spreading lies and claims that a large number of shells are still being fired on Gorazde from Serb positions and that the Serb forces are allegedly trying to occupy the town. Krajisnik said that this was not true, stressing that the Serb forces were on the right bank of the Drina and that they did not want to cross onto the left bank, as envisaged under the agreement [not further specified].
