Party organizations are becoming increasing secularized and are disregarding their traditional role of providing "spiritual and ideological" guidance to the Government and the country as a whole, the current issue of PARTY STYLE MONTHLY said. The paper complained that party members no longer referred to each other as "comrade" and treated party meetings simply as an administrative chore to be got over and done with as quickly as possible. "Cadres attend meetings not to discuss important party issues but to simply issue instructions. Leading cadres don't even pay their party dues themselves but send someone else to do it for them," it said. This lax attitude "posed a threat to the party's development, ideology and work ethic". PARTY STYLE pointed out that while such questions as the form of address used in party meetings may seem to be mere details, they were symptomatic of a much wider problem. The use of government rank titles such as "bureau chief" or "director" rather than the more egalitarian "comrade" was preventing a free flow of discussion and leading to the ossification of the party's work. "How can there be any criticism of leaders when the term 'comrade' is not used?" the paper asked. By being referred to by their administrative titles, leaders tended to lose sight of the party's traditional humble and honest work ethic, it said. Analysts said the PARTY STYLE article reflected a deep seated crisis of identity within the party. "Very few rank and file party members really understand what the party actually stands for nowadays, nor do they really care," a Chinese political observer said. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theory of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics", which is supposed to be the guiding light of the party, was so vague as to be virtually meaningless, he said. "So, without any real ideological direction, cadres are just getting on with business the best they can and ignoring ideological questions they can't answer. "At least under Chairman Mao Zedong everyone knew where they stood but now there just seems to be mass confusion." Other analysts pointed out that because of the party's failure to separate itself from the work of government, it was perhaps inevitable that the party structure would become subsumed into the structure of government. And while PARTY STYLE has sounded the alarm bell, most analysts agree it will be difficult for the party to recover its old identity in a rapidly changing and modernising China.
