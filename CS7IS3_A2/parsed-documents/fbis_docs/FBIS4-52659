On April 28, members of the Minamiosaka solidarity society for peace and human rights comprising workers in Minamiosaka area conducted street propaganda in front of four government offices and distributed to citizens copies of a literature saying that the recent search can never be tolerated. They said the search by the Osaka prefectural police was not an ordinary one but a "preliminary search" aimed at "freezing the property" of Koreans in Japan and "preserving public peace" in "case of emergency." The chairman of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party, Yukio Takemura, said in his recent statement that the search was a repressive act against Chongnyon perpetrated under the cloak of "investigation." He reaffirmed the resolution to struggle in solidarity with Koreans in Japan to defend their rights.
