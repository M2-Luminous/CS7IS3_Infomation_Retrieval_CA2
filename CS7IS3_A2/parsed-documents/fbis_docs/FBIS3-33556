Salinas de Gortari said: "This is a dignified and just peace, and this is exactly what we have been striving for. Without a doubt, I am encouraged by the results announced yesterday and the progress being made." Today in the Chiapas town of San Cristobal de las Casas, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation, and the armed group began their fourth day of talks amid substantial progress in an effort to find a political solution to the conflict that began on 1 January. Interviewed at the conclusion of a "Flag Day" ceremony in Mexico City, Salinas de Gortari commended the peace commissioner's work by saying, "he is working with utmost dedication, complete loyalty and commitment, and with great patriotism." Camacho Solis "is earnestly performing the task I entrusted upon him (on 10 January), and the fact that the dialogue is advancing so rapidly is certainly pleasing," the president noted. In confirming the announcement Camacho Solis made yesterday, Salinas de Gortari indicated the peace commissioner "has been in permanent contact with me, and I have authorized him to proceed with the proposals he has made." The president said the peace commissioner has been instructed that "in terms of the Indians' social demands," he should be "generous with his responses." Yesterday, the Zapatist National Liberation Army said it had received a "satisfactory response" to one-fourth of its demands regarding health, education, housing, communications, and respect for Indian traditions and rights. Also during the impromptu interview, President Salinas de Gortari commented on the recent talks between the Government Secretariat and the nation's political parties concerning the 21 August federal elections. "I am convinced we need to take additional steps in advancing the country's democratic life," the president stated, while emphasizing his commitment to promote the advancement of democracy in Mexico. He added, "As a citizen, I may have -- certainly, as each one of you have -- an (electoral) preference, but as president of the Republic I am committed to an impartial and democratic election." Earlier, during the "Flag Day" ceremony headed by Salinas de Gortari at the midtown Constitution Plaza, the Armed Forces reiterated their support for the pacification process in Chiapas -- a process the president began on 10 January. "We are not indifferent to the efforts you and your government have made and are still making to resolve the problems we face, some of which date back a long time, others of which are new," General Alvaro Vallarta Cecena stated. The commander of the 16th Military Zone continued, "These problems are complex and difficult to resolve because of the balance that must be maintained in an effort to avoid isolating people in a world that is becoming more interdependent and more demanding." The military chief added, "The defense of the fatherland in this new world requires a flair and unity that will withstand all tests, combining in a balanced manner family with society, nationalism with internationalism."
