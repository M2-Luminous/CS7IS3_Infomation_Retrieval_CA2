"The direction should be indicated as concretely as possible," Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa urged ministers concerned to work harder in the macroeconomic field, she said. Kubota said tax cuts, expansion of domestic demand and cutting the current account surplus need further discussion. The coalition government has already vowed to enact permanent tax reform this year, which is expected to offset reductions of income tax and other taxes by hiking the consumption tax. The reform is seen as answering U.S. complaints that this year's 6 trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts are just one-time measures and will not give domestic demand the sustained boost needed to help cut Japan's trade surplus. Suggestions have emerged in recent days to include such macroeconomic steps in the market-opening package due by month's end, which is to include deregulation, import promotion, stricter antitrust enforcement and improved government procurement practices.
