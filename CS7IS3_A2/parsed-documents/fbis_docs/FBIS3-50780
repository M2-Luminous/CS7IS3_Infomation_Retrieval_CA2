Shooting continues between Mexican Army troops and snipers of the Zapatist National Liberation Army in Ocosingo. At the same time, a large number of troops was deployed in the area of Guadalupe Tepeyac, where heavy clashes are reported. Today, the Army established a security cordon around combat zones, preventing both civilians and journalists from entering in an effort to prevent any incidents. This comes precisely because of what occurred yesterday when the Army staged a number of operations and bombings in an area where there were journalists. It is said the journalists were told that they were in the area at their own risk, but they nevertheless remained there. This was explained yesterday by Ramon Mota Sanchez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee. As a result, it has been decided that journalists will not be permitted to enter combat zones to prevent similar incidents from occurring. Meanwhile, there is tense calm in Altamirano and other towns affected by the violence. Commercial activities are taking place irregularly and classes are still suspended. [passage omitted] The latest official figures on the number of victims in the confrontations show that 102 people have been killed, an undetermined number have been wounded, and 34 rebels have been arrested.
