FR940314-2-00017 FR940314-2-00006 The approach adopted in the interim policy maintains protection of national forest resources. First, under the terms of the Memorandums of Understanding with the State fish and wildlife or game agencies, the Forest Service continuously participates in the review and adoption of State game regulations as they affect National Forest System land or resources. Second, the interim policy provides the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor with the flexibility and discretion to determine if baiting should be prohibited in a specific location. Finally, if a hunter, in placing bait to attract resident game creates litter through improper placement or untimely removal of bait in violation of State regulations or Forest Service closure orders, the agency has the authority under its regulations at 36 CFR 261.11 to cite the hunter for violating the prohibition on litter. If such bait results in violation of State regulations, the agency has authority to cite the hunter for violation of 36 CFR 261.8, and agency employees routinely do so where such violations occur. In short, the agency's approach (1) relies on existing relationships with each State, (2) prevents duplicative regulation by Federal and State agencies, and (3) provides site-specific environmental safeguards to address those situations where baiting would have an adverse site-specific effect on National Forest System land or resources. Pursuant to the rules at 36 CFR part 316, the text of the baiting policy as it has been issued in Interim Directive No. 2640&hyph;94&hyph;1 to the Forest Service Manual is set out at the end of this notice. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption of a final policy. Environmental Impact Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Servicewide administrative procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This interim directive would provide administrative instructions to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of baiting resident game. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this policy falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption of the final policy. Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public This policy will not result in additional paperwork. Therefore, the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320 do not apply. Regulatory Impact This interim policy has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Federal Regulations. It has been determined that this is not a significant rule.
