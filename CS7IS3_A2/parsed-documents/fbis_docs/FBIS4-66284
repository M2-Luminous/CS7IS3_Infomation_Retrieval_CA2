This, as a consequence, is conflicting with the output-related responsibility system. In a reform experiment in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, it had become quite clear that a rational resolution of this new contradiction is only possible with a reform and remolding of the system of proprietary rights to land in the rural areas, comprising a shift from the land subcontracting system to a system of "investment responsibility" [tou bao]. In the new system of proprietary land rights at Nanhai's reform experiment the property right of land was split into land ownership and corporate proprietary right to land, and the ownership right would then be returned to the peasants, while the corporate proprietary land right would be held by an economic organization in a cooperative land-shareholding system, thus forming a double-tier structure of the proprietary rights to land, where the ownership of land is dispersed and is integrated with a socially more acceptable distribution of the land resource. This is not privatization of land, but a process of discarding the useless and maintaining the useful in the system of proprietary land rights of the traditional collective economy, with its too high a degree of public ownership. It is a newly structured system of land proprietary rights of the rural cooperative economy on a shareholding basis, marked by land being brought in as shares. A Cooperative Land-Shareholding System The reform and remolding of the proprietary rights in the rural areas thus consist in establishing a cooperative land-shareholding system. In concrete terms, it is the conversion of land into shares, the resulting entity then being quantified per person according to their ages and according to the quality of the land. In planning the conversion of land to shares, reference may be made to the land tax evaluation or to the pricing of land according to its operational returns. This cooperative land-shareholding system separates the value substance of land ownership from the use value substance of the corporate proprietary right of the enterprise. This kind of a separation can resolve the contradiction between the future reversion of land ownership to the peasants and the intended overall land arrangements, the more rational utilization of land, and unified planning with regard to land. It will accurately resolve the contradiction between the modernization of the rural areas--the division of all land, with administrative districts as units, into basic agricultural land preservation districts, industrial development districts, and commercial and residential districts--and the system of proprietary rights to land. At the same time, the system of dispersed land responsibilities will be transformed in a well-ordered manner into an "investment responsibility" system. Implementing the cooperative land-shareholding system is a second reform of breakthrough dimensions in the rural areas, as it replaces the proprietary system of land holdings in the traditional collective economy and follows on the output-related household responsibility system. The difference between the present reform breakthrough and the first breakthrough is that the first reform breakthrough only went as far as the output-related household responsibility system. Indicative of it was that its precondition was the preservation of the original proprietary system of land holdings in the traditional collective economy, as the proprietary right to land was divided into ownership and use right, and the land was then distributed by the land owner, the former collective-economy organization, equally according to the head-count of contracting peasants, while no fundamental reform was effected in the proprietary system of land holdings of the collective economy. Indicative of the present reform breakthrough in the rural areas, however, is the creation of a new proprietary system of land holdings, while preserving the useful and discarding the useless in the proprietary system of land holdings of the traditional collective economy. With the cooperative land-shareholding system as breakthrough point, the cooperative shareholding system is being promoted all over the rural area. An assessment is being made of the entire assets of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in the former collective economy, and total value of assets will be converted into shares, the shares then allocated to persons, and share certificates will be issued. It will be stipulated at the same time that no withdrawal of shares will be permitted, a fact that will help maintain stability in the operation of assets in the cooperative shareholding economy. Distribution of income in the cooperative shareholding economy shall be preceded by payment of taxes and deductions for public welfare funds and public accumulation funds, whereupon dividends shall be paid according to the number of shares held. This is a socialist cooperative land-shareholding system with Chinese characteristics. Step By Step Implementation The reform experiment at Nanhai has made it clear that the shift from the output-related household responsibility system to the land-holding target model of the cooperative land-shareholding system must be accomplished in two steps: The first step shall accomplish the transitional model of the proprietary land right, while the second step shall achieve the target model of proprietary land right. It means that during the first step of Nanhai's cooperative land-shareholding system, there has to be set up first a transitional model of proprietary land right by "unremunerated allocation of shares, and by actual dividends paid on nominal shares." The term "nominal shares" is to signify that these "land-shares" cannot be passed on as inheritance, cannot be transferred or pawned. The term "actual dividends" comprises two meanings: one is that dividends are paid according to number of shares, and the other is that when aggregate dividends reach the value of the land-shares (in some places set at 14,000 yuan per mu, in other places at 20,000 yuan), the stockholders' rights automatically end, but not so the right to dividends, which are then joined to the basic share and continue. The unremunerated allocation of shares is conducted according to the ages of the peasants and according to the quality of the land. I inspected an economic cooperative operating on shareholding basis at Xianan, Pingzhou township, and saw that their statute prescribed: 1 share for every person below 16 years of age, 2 shares for persons between 17 and 35, and 3 shares for every person of 35 and over. They had completely broken away from the proportions of land held under the former responsibility system, so there was no problem about contracted land use rights affecting the share holdings. As to communes holding different amounts of land, conversion of the value into shares was done according to the actual holdings of each commune, so there was no more any problem of egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfer of resources of the "communal production" mode. The second step in implementing the cooperative land-shareholding system at Nanhai would then be the target model for proprietary land rights, namely "remunerated taking-up of shares and actual dividends paid on actual shares." The so-called "remunerated taking-up of shares" is the counterpart to the "unremunerated allocation of shares." The land use rights contracted for by the peasants was then actually already bought back by the enterprise entity of the cooperative economy, using the accumulated dividends. It was for this reason proclaimed that the shareholders' rights from the unremunerated allocation of shares had ended, and that the peasants thereafter were again allowed to buy back land ownership by way of remunerated taking-up of shares, making the peasants' land ownership their share contribution; this, then, is the "remunerated taking-up of shares." This procession from unremunerated allocation to payments of dividends according to number of shares, and again to remunerated taking-up of shares, amounts in actual fact to giving back the land ownership to the peasants without remuneration. This, then, is the essence of Nanhai's experiences with the cooperative land-shareholding system. Nanhai implemented the system in two steps. First, it gave the peasants land dividends to strengthen the peasants economically, enabling them to take up remunerated shares, and this remunerated taking-up of shares will also convey to the peasants the idea of truly possessing ownership of the land. The "actual shares" part in the mentioned "actual dividends paid on actual shares" is the counterpart to the "nominal shares" in the mentioned "actual dividends on nominal shares." While it was not permitted to transfer, pawn or inherit "nominal shares," the present "actual shares" can be transferred, pawned, or inherited, but withdrawal of shares is not permitted. However, two things must be watched out for when allowing the peasants "remunerated taking-up of shares," namely, one, in consideration of the particular character of the socialist cooperative economy, provisions must be made as to the proper qualification of persons taking up land shares, and, two, considering the fact that land is a means of production without reproductive ability, and considering also the particular character of the socialist cooperative economy, it must not be permitted that a small group of people become prominent by controlling large amounts of land shares; a ceiling must therefore be prescribed for the amount of remunerated shares that peasants may take up. Will It Lead to Privatization of Land? Nanhai's new rural land-holding system is a two-tiered structure of proprietary rights to land. At one level the land ownership is given to the peasants, and the peasants are owners of the land. At the other level, the peasants use the land as share contributions and thereby create the corporate proprietary rights of the cooperative enterprise operating on the shareholding system. The system of which they adopt useful elements and discard useless elements is the land-holding system of the traditional collective economy. The system that they newly create is the land-holding system of the cooperative economy. The objective is to use the land-holding system of the cooperative economy to replace the land-holding system of the traditional collective economy with its too large a degree of public ownership. There is essentially no question here of changing the collectivization of land into a privatization of land. Looking at the target model of the rural land-holding system, we see that the next step in promoting a well-standardized cooperative land-shareholding system has, as its precondition, acknowledgment of land ownership by the peasants. Without this precondition, there can also not be any cooperative land-shareholding system. Whether we honestly acknowledge land ownership by the peasants or do so only hypocritically will determine whether the land property ownership of the peasants will indeed be respected and protected.
