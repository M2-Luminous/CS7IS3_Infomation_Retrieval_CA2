And of course she did! She had spent several days on a train. Could not sleep properly--kept watching this milk can; she would have put it under the pillow, but this was not possible--honey would spill out. She just walked into the hotel room; just breathed a sigh of relief. And then everything collapsed instantly. Here it is, this milk can on the table--there are three kilograms of raw opium in it, hidden in the honey. In monetary terms--more than R40 million. Outside her window, free, city sparrows were chirping welcoming the spring, while she was facing... ...Novosibirsk Oblast is among the 10 regions in Russia where due to the activism of antidrug departments registered drug-related crime is on the rise. There is no contradiction in this. Illegal distribution of drugs--growing, manufacturing, transporting, storing, and distributing--are a latent--in other words, hidden--crime. (Alas, drug use has been taken off the list of criminal offenses during the past few years). This means that the better the operatives' work is organized, the more the personnel are informed--the higher the figures. Over the last three months of last year, 302 criminal cases were initiated; now there are 470 over the first quarter. This is against the background of an overall decline in the crime rate. Almost half a tonne of drugs (marijuana, poppy straw, and so on) have been confiscated, as compared to 1,200 kg over all of last year. Including 15 kg of raw opium. Calculate the value, keeping in mind that one kg costs R15 million. Also confiscated: 400 kg of controlled substances--narcotics, hallucinogenics, or substances enhancing the effect of real medicines (tranquilizers, antidepressants, etc.). Despite the ban, they are still sold in the streets and in commercial kiosks. Where does it all come from at a time when there are not enough drugs in hospitals, and some are not in pharmacies--or if they are, it is at prices beyond anybody's reach? The old supply and distribution disbalance is playing into the hands of those who make money on anything. To win the battle against drug dealers, one must have, using modern terminology, a data bank. "We control the situation in the sphere of drug use," is the simple explanation given by one of the senior people in the department. Criminal investigation goes from crime to a criminal. In the Department for Combating Illegal Drug Distribution [ONON], they go from a criminal to crime. Naturally, the woman with the milk can was "escorted" all the way to the hotel room. About a month ago there was a burglary in an apartment in Leninskiy Rayon. The owner of the apartment was messed up so badly that he did not make it to the hospital. Several hours later a suspect was detained: The trail had started with the victim who was known in the drug addicts circles. Approximately 40 percent of the pot consumed by Novosibirsk drug addicts is manufactured within the oblast. Which is not surprising, since poppy does grow here, as well as hemp, which has contaminated 27,000 hectares. Nobody is in a hurry to remove it--rural residents are busy with other things, and the militia has limited resources. The transparency of so-called borders, plus being at a crossroads, attracts drug business from Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. It is brought most often by train or car. In increasingly larger consignments. Only a year ago one kg was considered a large consignment. In January almost 12 kg were confiscated from just one courier. It is not rare to encounter consignments of eight, five, four kg. In specialists' opinion, the bulk of raw opium (one gram of which is equivalent both in effect and in cost to a cup of poppy straw) is brought from Afghanistan through Tajikistan. I have heard the opinion expressed that militia efforts to combat the drug business only increase it. It does not make sense, they say, to catch small-time dealers because others take their place. It is a superficial and erroneous opinion. ONON works in different directions. A one-time catch of three kg of opium is not a small-time deal. In some operations just one seller unloads the drugs to 100 or more buyers. They get registered, and the seller will face a trial. Drugs cost money, and a drug addict as a rule does not work. The more distributors are isolated, the fewer the number of mercenary-type crimes. The department has an interrayon unit for investigation of general drug-related crimes. There were 100 of them solved in the first quarter. More than 20 units of firearms uncovered, not counting ammunition. In one commercial kiosk, together with marijuana they found two shrapnel grenades. A gun disguised as a pen was found in possession of a female drug seller. One charge was sufficient to kill a person. The next day, a home-made revolver was found. A certain T., who has committed 16 apartment burglaries and an assault, was detained. Almost half a tonne of confiscated drugs has a street value of R410 million--this is just for three months. This is the amount taken out of criminal circulation. This means that this money will not be used to support crime bosses; will not be used to set up organized groups and gangs; will not be used to purchase arms or hire contract killers. And these millions, which is also important, will not have flown to near-abroad countries, where they are like dollars for us--hard currency. Because over a three-month period criminal charges were brought against 54 couriers and distributors from the former republics. What is the prognosis? The demand--which means the supply--will keep growing. Increasingly, more young people and teenagers get drawn into the horrible game. A drug addict does not live long. He is lucky if he makes it to 40. Drug-related crime committed by juveniles last year increased by more than 20 percent as compared to 1992, and over three months of this year, by 19 percent. Crime committed in the state of drug intoxication is on the rise. As a rule, distributors do not use their own goods. Of more than 300 persons (80 of them women) charged with distribution of drugs, only two had previous convictions. Fresh people--which means that the drug business does not surrender its positions. There is also a trend toward the use of synthetic drugs, which destroy a person 20-100 times faster. Trimethylphentanil, one gram of which is enough to make 1,000 doses, and crack have not yet reached us. Choice drugs cost incredible money. The situation is under control. Last year two labs were liquidated in the city, which had the needed set of chemicals to produce "synthetics." The number of poly-drug addicts--those who can use anything, whether it is hashish, marijuana, or vodka--is growing. Meanwhile, many bitter words are being said in different departments on the subject of combating and preventing drug addiction. The result is practically zero. It is like the shouts "Halva! Halva!" do not make sweet taste in the mouth. While medical practitioners for drug addiction have a clear picture of the terrible danger, it looks like our educational system does not intend at this point to enlighten children and their parents openly and on a broad scale. ONON personnel have enough conversations with fathers and mothers who refused to notice the strange behavior of their offspring and the suspicious glitter in their eyes. Where are our hygienic-educational measures, which used to be quite strong in the past? The drug business is essentially a part of organized crime. It is also smuggling. It has to be interdicted at customs and by the endlessly reorganized KGB. Yes, they also work on it. But the lion's share of the work is still left to militia. Meanwhile, the department that deals with it has only five cars. There are probably rich, decent, and concerned people in our city, too. The perfidy of drugs also is in that they do distinguish whose son (or daughter) jokingly, in pretense, inhales that first puff. And then progresses to a needle... Perhaps they would find it worth it to help in this quiet war, because it is indeed a war against a formidable enemy.
