Timor Talks With Portugal BK0405143094 Jakarta TEMPO in Indonesian 23 Apr 94 p 42 BK0405143094 Jakarta TEMPO Indonesian BFN ["Excerpts" of interview with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas by TEMPO correspondent Fikri Jufri in New York -- date not given] [Text] [Jufri] To what extent has progress to solve the East Timor issue at the international forums been made? [Alatas] There has been no breakthrough through the formal tripartite talks involving Indonesia, the United Nations, and Portugal. The talks are not stalled, but progress has been made at a very slow pace. We are now discussing the issue of CBM or Confidence Building Measures. However, outside the formal tripartite talks, several breakthroughs have been made. The first breakthrough occurred last year with the establishment of EPIFA or European Parliament Indonesia Friendship Association]. We certainly welcome the establishment of this association, which was able to thwart Portugal's motions at the European Parliament. The second breakthrough took place even within Portugal itself with the establishment of the Portugal-Indonesia Friendship Association by Macedo and his friends. While business was the initial motivation, the association later also engaged in political activities. We certainly welcome this development. The third breakthrough occurred was when Araujo, a former leader of Fretilin [Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] now living in Portugal, decided to contact us and expressed his wish to meet with his old friends in Indonesia. Of course we had to double check his sincerity, and it turned out that he was sincere. We certainly welcomed his initiative. [Jufri] If that is the case, why do we still hear protests on East Timor? [Alatas] The protests come from those who feel they are being cornered, namely the hardline group opposed to Araujo's initiative. Who are these people? They are Ramos Horta and his friends, who are supported by the Allan Nairn group. I also believe that the film entitled Pilger was produced in a hurry so it could be shown before the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. This is understandable becuse they are worried about the impact of the breakthroughs mentioned above. Therefore, we are now in a unique situation: On the one hand, we see bright prospects, but on the other hand, we also notice that our opponents are also intensifying their activities. [Jufri] Do you think that the upcoming meeting of the Indonesian community in the United States organized by the Asia Society will produce another breakthrough in that country? [Alatas] It is hoped that the meeting will be able to introduce Indonesia in its totality to the U.S. society, especially to those whose knowledge on Indonesia are limited to issues like human rights and environment. This meeting is aimed at approaching not only the U.S. Congress, but also the U.S. media, which are responsible for building public opinion. [Jufri] Therefore, this meeting is a kind of public diplomacy? [Alatas] Yes, because present-day foreign diplomacy is no longer restricted to traditional diplomatic forums.
