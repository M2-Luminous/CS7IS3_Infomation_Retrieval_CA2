Your excellencies! Ladies and gentlemen! Only upon having restored its national independence on March 11 of 1990, after a hiatus of fifty years, and upon having consistently carried out political and free market economic reforms, is Lithuania beginning to participate in the implementation of the new security strategy of the North Atlantic states. This strategy is oriented toward the establishment of the fundamental values of democracy, law, peace, and human dignity. The security and stability of a country are essential preconditions for the functioning of democracy and of the free market. We are convinced that the assurance of Lithuanian national security is an integral and inseparable part of the security of Europe as a whole. Lithuania alone cannot ensure its own security. We think that European--and Lithuanian--security must be guaranteed by the political, economic, and military integration of the countries concerned, the most important institutional manifestations of which are the European Union and NATO. Lithuania seeks to participate in the strengthening of the security of the North Atlantic region by becoming a member of NATO and of the European Union, as well as of the Western European Union. Lithuania sees its integration into the economic and political structures of the European Union and its integration into the political and defensive structures of NATO and the Western European Union as mutually interrelated processes. Lithuania welcomes the NATO initiative "Partnership for Peace" as a means of improving the security and stability of the whole region from Vancouver to Vladivostok. I would imagine that this initiative does not fully satisfy all of those countries that seek to draw closer to NATO or to join the Union. It is a compromise plan, oriented toward the future, not the past, toward a Europe not riven by suspicion, hate, opposing ideologies, or widely divergent standards of living. I would especially like to emphasize that by entering into the "Partnership for Peace" program, Lithuania has as its clear-cut goal full-fledged membership in NATO, a goal that I have also emphasized in my letter to the General Secretary of NATO. More and more people in Lithuania are beginning to realize that the mere desire to become a member of NATO and to receive guarantees of security is not enough. We ourselves must create in our own country not only the military, but also the political, economic, and psychological foundation for integration corresponding to those of the NATO countries. Upon signing the major document inviting "Partnership for Peace," Lithuania is prepared to begin the work of implementing the democratic control of defense structures, opening up the defense budget process, and common planning, training, and exercises. We will try to create opportunities for cooperation with NATO forces in areas such as peacekeeping, search and rescue operations, humanitarian aid, etc. Lithuania recognizes that integration into NATO is a complex evolutionary process that requires great intellectual and material resources. We should ask other interested countries to join in the work of "Partnership for Peace." I would also like to make note of the organizational significance of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Lithuania views with favor the role of the Council's political consultations in the successful withdrawal of the Russian army from Lithuania. We intend to apply the recommendations of the "North Atlantic Cooperation Council Group on Cooperation for the Maintenance of Peace" in developing the idea of a joint Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian peacekeeping unit. Lithuania welcomes the opportunities set forth in the proposal for the preparation of joint military training and exercizes, and is preparing to fully participate in them. We were pleased to hear the news that the foreign ministers on the Council had accepted the suggestion that the meeting of the Atlantic political advisory group with the "Cooperation" partners scheduled for the spring of 1994 be held in Vilnius. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Lithuanian position on membership in NATO is not directed against any neighboring or other European country. Lithuania is a supporter of a unified move of the Baltic states into Europe. Lithuania's request of January 4, 1994, for membership in NATO is an integral part of the cooperation of the Baltic states amongst themselves and with NATO. The military cooperation of the Baltic states is not and must not be construed as the creation of a threat to Russia. Lithuania has no territorial claims whatsoever against its neighbors. Russian pronouncements to the effect that Russia has special interests and rights to maintain peace in the so-called "near abroad", or the ex-territory of the USSR, do not quite accord with the spirit of either international law or of the "Partnership for Peace." Especially difficult to understand are Russian claims of special interests in the Baltic states, if only because Lithuania and the other Baltic states were never legally parts of the USSR. Lithuania is in favor of the implementation of international norms and agreements, and emphasizes the importance of the rapid, orderly, and unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army from Latvia and Estonia, which will increase the security and stability of the Baltic sea region. The peaceful withdrawal of the Russian army from Lithuania serves as an example of the fundamentally new possibilities for coexistence in this region of Europe. The acceptance of the Baltic states as well as of the Visegrad and other Central European countries into the European Union, NATO, and the Western European Union would strongly and effectively stimulate economic and political reforms in those countries. We are convinced that it would provide significant support for the strengthening and continuity of the democratic processes in Russia. We are among those who are convinced that Russia can have a democratic future. That is why the leadership of the Republic of Lithuania supports the efforts of Western countries to help Russia carry out its political and economic reforms, to create a democratic Russia. I believe that after the passage of some period of time, in a similar auditorium, a president of Lithuania will place his signature on a document that will ratify full integration of the Republic of Lithuania into a structure that recognizes common values and guarantees security and stability--the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
