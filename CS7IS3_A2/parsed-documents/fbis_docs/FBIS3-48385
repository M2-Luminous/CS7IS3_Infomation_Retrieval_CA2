"But, whether or not it would be necessary to carry on efforts for its peaceful resolution will be determined in the next two to three weeks," Han said. The minister's remarks were taken to suggest that if the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fails to reach a satisfactory accord with North Korea by the time the next IAEA Board of Governors meeting opens on Feb. 21, the nuclear question could be referred to the U.N. Security Council for necessary action. While answering questions after he delivered a speech at the Korean-America Friendship Society, Minister Han said that if North Korea comes to possess nuclear arms, the danger of conventional armed clash on the Korean peninsula grows much larger. Regarding world powers' view of Korean unification, the foreign minister said the four powers having stakes in the Korean peninsula seem wanting to see Korea remain divided as now. "Though the world powers do not favor our unification, they won't do anything outright to obstruct it if and when unification is achieved," he added. Minister Han also said it is natural for South Korea to share the expense of the U.S. forces in Korea to a certain extent. For, the U.S. forces here perform a role South Korea needs though their presence is due in part to the U.S.' own interests, he said.
