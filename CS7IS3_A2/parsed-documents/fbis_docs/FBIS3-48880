Because of this, the total amount of government bonds for fiscal 1993 will reach the record high of some 16 trillion yen. Moreover, the reliance rate of the general account on national bonds will exceed 20 percent for the first time in the past seven years or since fiscal 1986. Expenditures in the third supplementary budget will be allocated mainly for public works projects, facilities and additional investments -- including Small Business Finance Corporation and the People's Finance Corporation -- which are accompanied by an increase in guidance policy financing. The amount of government bonds issued by the second supplementary budget reached 13.992 trillion yen. About 2 trillion yen will be added to that amount. The Finance Ministry issued 14.172 trillion yen's worth of government bonds in fiscal 1980. It was the largest amount (of which about 7.2 trillion yen was for deficit-covering bonds) in the past. In fiscal 1993, the total amount of government bonds will exceed 14.172 trillion yen. Moreover, due to the decision to issue additional bonds, the general account's reliance rate on national bonds will be well over 20 percent. It will be the highest-level reliance rate since fiscal 1986, when the rate was 21 percent. While the government promoted rehabilitation of public finance, the reliance rate was going down in the eighties. Although it dropped to 9.5 percent in fiscal 1991, however, the rate suddenly rose again.
