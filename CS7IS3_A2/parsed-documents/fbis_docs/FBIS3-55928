The program includes recorded remarks from an interview with Yegor Gaydar by Dorenko; the place and date of the interview are not given. Gaydar says: "The prime minister has consulted me regarding proposals on reorganizing the government. Both the president and the prime minister have asked me to stay in a new and reorganized government. I know certain ideas and alternatives that have been formulated in this area." Gaydar refuses to divulge any details. Dorenko then mentions that Gaydar's most recent meeting with Yeltsin took place on 31 December, and asks Gaydar whether he will be held responsible for somebody else's decisions. Gaydar replies: "A situation, the ongoing situation, when someone else is making decisions for which we have to bear responsibility is absolutely intolerable to us. If, for instance, a decision is taken against the will and position of our like-minded colleagues... [pauses] I will fight to keep our monetary and financial policy fairly consistent and will oppose irresponsible decisions. I will fight to prevent some members of the Cabinet, who are good guys, from making empty and irresponsible promises while other members of the cabinet, the bad guys, have to explain later why these promises could not be kept." Dorenko concludes the program by saying that power in Russia remains shrouded in secrecy, that is why his program contains so many conjectures and too few facts.
