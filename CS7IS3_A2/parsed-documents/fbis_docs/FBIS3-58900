The operation is to start at the beginning of February and -- just like the return of the Americans -- be completed at the end of March. The Defense Ministry's plans currently envisage first of all, transporting German servicemen from the Somali capital of Mogadishu by German naval vessels, probably to Mombasa (Kenya). The return flight to Germany will then be from there. According to the ministry, Ruehe intends to avoid the possible risks of transporting them by air in the Mogadishu area, and thus to aim for a higher degree of security for the servicemen. The plans were closely connected with the U.S. Government decision to transport its personnel initially by sea.
