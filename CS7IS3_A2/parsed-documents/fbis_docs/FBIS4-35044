The blunder occurred during a news conference at the Argentine Embassy in Washington after a meeting between Menem and U.S. President Bill Clinton when Menem was asked to clarify the situation of two Latin American candidacies to head the WTO, which comprises 111 countries. Menem explained that during the recent Fourth Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) his country supported a Colombian proposal nominating Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to head the WTO at the end of his presidential term. Menem added that at the time he was unaware the Brazilian Government had proposed Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero, a veteran diplomat and former Brazilian negotiator at GATT. The surprise occurred when Menem said it was up to the EU (Menem insists on calling it "community") to name a president for the WTO, an organization created to implement GATT agreements that is expected to become operational next year. "Of course, it is up to EC members to decide on these candidacies and (the president) might very well be European," Menem said. Journalists asked why the EC would have the power to choose the president of the WTO and Menem said: "Because it is an EC organization." "It is not a world organization, it is an EC organization," Menem insisted despite the organization's name which clearly identifies it as being global. "If you have any doubt, I will tell you again," the Argentine president repeated to the astonished Brazilian journalist who asked him to confirm his remarks. Menem added: "I will clarify things even more: During the Ibero-American meeting we asked Spain and Portugal to sponsor Salinas' candidacy. It is an EC organization, not a world community organization," Menem insisted. Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who was sitting next to Menem, just put his head in his hands. Argentine Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo, who was sitting next to Menem, made no attempt to correct him either.
