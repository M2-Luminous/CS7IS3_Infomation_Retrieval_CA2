Entrusted by Comrade Jiang Zemin and on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Li Ruihuan first extended Spring Festival greetings to leaders of religious organization across the country and to the broad religious masses. At the discussion, Li Dezhu, deputy director of the United Front Work Department, briefed those present on a national seminar of leaders of religious organizations recently held in Hainan. The main topic of the seminar was discussing how to adapt religion to a socialist society. From the standpoint of integrating theory with practice, participants in the seminar profoundly discussed the historical inevitability and feasibility of adapting religion to a socialist society and put forward some constructive opinions and suggestions in this regard. At today's discussion, those who spoke on how to perform religious work more effectively and how to adapt religion to a socialist society included Zhao Puchu, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and president of the Buddhist Association of China; Ding Guangxun, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Protestant Churches of China, and president of the Christian Council of China; Zong Huaide, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College and chairman of the China Patriotic Catholic Association; An Shiwei, president of the China Islamic Association; and Xie Zhongxin, vice chairman of the China Taoist Association. In his speech at the discussion, Li Ruihuan said: The present situation is good in our country's religious work. In the past year, party and government organizations and religious administration departments at various levels have conscientiously implemented the party's religious policy, scoring remarkable achievements. Cooperating closely with the party and government, religious circles have done a lot of work in uniting the broad religious masses, promoting the building of material and spiritual civilization, maintaining social stability, advancing the reunification of the motherland, and increasing exchanges with foreign countries. Li Ruihuan said: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, people across the country are establishing a new socialist market economic structure. So our religious work is now facing a new situation. Party and government departments at all levels should profoundly study, accurately understand, and conscientiously implement the party's religious policy, assist patriotic religious organizations and personages in solving practical difficulties and problems, and manage religious affairs according to law. Religious circles should actively assist the party and government in implementing the religious policy; unite and guide the religious masses to participate in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive; improve themselves by raising their quality; and learn to find their appropriate positions and bring their specific role into full play so as to adapt themselves to the new, rigorously developing situation. Li Ruihuan expressed the hope that religious work departments and religious circles would make concerted efforts to strengthen their ties, enhance their mutual understanding, and shape an ever more harmonious relationship between them in order to do religious work more efficiently. Other leaders of religious organizations attending the discussion included Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, Ming yang, Dao shuren, Fu Yuantian, Li Yuhang, Min Zhiting, Shen Xiaxi, Abudula Damaola, Wan Yaobin, A Yiming, Jin luxian, Fu Tieshan, Luo Guanzong, and Shen Yifan.
