The party's secretary-general, Sanan Khachonprasat, said: "I don't know how the Defense Minister has explained this policy to the commanders for them not to have understood it and to have come out with the statements that they have." The Industry Minister was speaking in Chiang Rai, where he was attending a gathering of office managers and executive committee members of the party's Northern branch to brief them on the political situation. Maj. Gen. [Major General] Sanan said it was the duty of the Defense Minister to go back again and try to explain the Government's requirement to the commanders. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, reaffirming the Government's commitment to its arms-through-barter policy, said he was confident the Defense Minister would be able to talk armed forces commanders into accepting it. Mr. Chuan said the Defense Minister had been asked to try once again to explain the Government's policy to the top brass. "I believe the Defense Minister can clear up any misunderstanding (the commanders) may have," he said. [passage omitted] Maj. Gen. Sanan said the Government had never asked the armed forces to renegotiate the deal because the armed forces could not conduct the talks by themselves. "It is not Government policy to allow the Armed Forces to engage in negotiations. We only want talks so that Italy can be convinced to buy more Thai goods," he said. He said the arms market was at present in the hands of buyers because of a preponderance of manufacturers. Waiting to allow responsible agencies to negotiate with the Italian Government would not upset the armed forces procurement process, and the Government was prepared to absorb any extra cost that might be caused by the delay. He denied that the Government was putting pressure on the armed forces by tightening the procurement process. "We have to look at the whole picture," he said. "Our farm products are suffering. Everyone must help, particularly the armed forces. Other government agencies are no exception." Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak denied that the Government was interfering with the Armed Forces' procurement process. "We want some delay only in order to press Italy to give Thailand more favorable terms on the deal," Mr Suphachai said. "We are about to spend thousands of millions of baht. We should have some more in return for what we're going to spend." [passage omitted]
