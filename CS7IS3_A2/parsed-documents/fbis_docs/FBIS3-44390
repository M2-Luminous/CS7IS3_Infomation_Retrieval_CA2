I wish you success in everything and family happiness in the year ahead. Friends, the past year has been a year in which the Chinese people, working under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, continued their triumphant advance in accordance with the strategic policy decision to seize the opportunity to deepen reform and bring about rapid and healthy development. It has also been a year in which major progress was made in implementing the decision of our party's 14th National Congress on establishing a socialist market economy. China is now enjoying economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress. Facts show that the line, principles, and policies formulated by our party and government for economic and social development are correct. Facts also show that the experience of our party and government in keeping the overall development situation under control and in improving their macro guidance is becoming richer and more mature. The tasks we shoulder are very arduous and we still face difficulties and problems in our advance, but we have the means and abilities to overcome them. We will begin the new year and march toward a bright future with even fuller confidence and greater strides. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics means adherence to the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world -- the only way to develop contemporary China -- to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modern socialist country with the persistent hard work of several generations. To shake off poverty and backwardness and achieve a prosperity in our motherland is a common aspiration which all the Chinese people and the entire Chinese nation longing day and night to realize. China is a large, oriental country with a history of 5,000 years of civilization and a population of some 1.1 billion. A prosperous and strong China will not only contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people and Chinese nation. It will contribute even more to the civilization of all mankind. China's stability and development cannot be separated from the peace and development of the world as a whole, and vice versa; this has become the common understanding of more and more people. Friends, the present world is in a period of transition from an old to a new structure. On the one hand, some positive tendencies have appeared in international relations, the process of multi- polarization of the world is being accelerated, and the people of all countries in general are demanding detente and cooperation. On the other hand, the world is still far from peaceful. The contradictions in some regions have intensified, resulting in turmoil and endless armed conflicts. Hegemonism and power politics are still very conspicuous, seriously challenging world peace and development. The Chinese Government and people, firmly adhering to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, have played an important role in the complex, changing international situation and made positive contributions to promoting peace and development in the world. China's international prestige has risen remarkably, its international environment has been further improved, and we have friends all over the world. The world is varied and colorful. Any country should respect the right of people in other countries to maintain independence and keep the initiative in their own hands. A strong, big, and rich country can never achieve its goal by bullying a weak, smaller, and poor country, and will only end up hurting itself. China will never seek hegemony, and its development will not constitute a threat to any country. We will, as always, persistently develop friendly and cooperative relations with other countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and make unremitting efforts to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and rational new international order. It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people, including our Taiwan compatriots, to complete the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Peaceful reunification is also the general trend in the development of China's history. People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are longing for reunification. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "one China, two governments" goes against the aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the general trend and the people's aspirations, put national interests above all, do more solid work for the reunification of the motherland, and together with the mainland create a more prosperous China. The dates when Hong Kong and Macao will return to the motherland are approaching. Due to the fact that the British side persists in its wrong stand on the Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong have broken down. This is something that we did not want to see. No matter what happens, we share the feelings and aspirations of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our policy of "one country, two systems" will not change, our principal stand of adhering to the Basic Law on Hong Kong will not change, and our resolve to restore China's sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change. We are fully confident that we have the ability to keep Hong Kong prosperous and stable for a long time to come. Friends, a solid foundation for the people of all countries to strengthen unity and cooperation is working together for peace and development. Unity and cooperation need mutual understanding. In the past year, tens of thousands of guests from abroad have visited China. Many foreign guests I have met have told me that the China they had personally witnessed is entirely different from what they thought and originally understood it to be. An old Chinese proverb says, "It is better to see once than hear a hundred times." The year 1994 is the 45th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the coming year, we earnestly welcome more foreign friends to come to China and see for themselves. Such contacts will promote mutual understanding, trust, and friendship. For decades the China International Broadcasting Station has been introducing China's developments to overseas audience, and it has been a bridge linking China with the outside world. I hope it will play a still greater role in enhancing friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of various countries of the world. Finally, I once again wish you Happy New Year! Thank you.
