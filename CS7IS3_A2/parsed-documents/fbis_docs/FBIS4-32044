What made you take this step? [Moravcik] This is nothing new. We spoke with Mr. Cernak and his colleagues a long time ago. We may not have reached an agreement at that time, but it is a different situation now, and we thought it was necessary to discuss once again the original project, which is still attractive. The parties of the center that are oriented more or less liberally should unite, and this is why we have revived this idea. [SME] Could you specify in what respect the situation is new? Several weeks ago, the DU Republican Council presented a final resolution of your party to run independently in the elections, and Mr. Cernak discussed preelection cooperation with the Christian Democratic Movement.... [Moravcik] We spoke about establishing a confederation of parties of the center before the elections. There is not enough time for this, however. Now, the opportunity has arisen to reach agreement with the NDS on a joint list of candidates. [SME] So, we were mistaken when we thought that the DU's lists of candidates had been closed? [Moravcik] They are not. Within our party, we agreed on the leaders in the individual electoral regions. [SME] The Democratic Union announced that it was open to negotiations with the Democratic Party (DS).... [Moravcik] Yes, we are fulfilling the project about which we spoke--a gradual merger of the parties of the center. This is important for Slovakia mainly from the viewpoint of the crystallization of the political scene. We are trying, and will try, to fill the center and the gap right of the center. However, this will require more time than the time we have left before the elections in the fall. [SME] What places are you offering to the NDS and the DS on your lists of candidates? [Moravcik] The talks will continue. It is premature to speak about it for the time being.
