This was stated at a press briefing of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] by Pal Csaky today. Speaking about the forthcoming parliamentary elections, he said that the MKDH supported the notion that the Hungarian political forces in Slovakia ought to have a joint stand, but he did not agree with the idea of establishing a joint party. The MKDH wishes to study the proposal of a union worked out by Coexistence, but, for the time being, it is supporting the idea of creating a tripartite coalition between MKDH-Coexistence and the Hungarian Civic Party. Csaky also said that, after the elections, his party will support any government that, on the basis of democratic principles, continues on the course Slovakia has entered on.
