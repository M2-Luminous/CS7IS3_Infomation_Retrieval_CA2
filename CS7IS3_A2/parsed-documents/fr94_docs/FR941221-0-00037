Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) are mandated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;603), as amended. The purpose of SLIAG is to lessen the financial impact on State and local governments that resulted from the legalization of certain previously illegal aliens under IRCA. The SLIAG program provides reimbursement to States for the costs of certain public assistance, public health, and education services they have provided to these eligible legalized aliens through September 30, 1994. The Labor/Health and Human Services FY 1993 Appropriations Act, Public Law 102&hyph;394, dated October 6, 1992, amended section 204(b)(4) of IRCA to provide that any funds not expended as of December 30 1994, be reallocated to participating States which have expended their entire allotments and which have incurred unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. The basis for the reallocation is each State's percentage share of total unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs in all States with such costs.
