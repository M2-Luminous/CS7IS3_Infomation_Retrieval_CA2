The move follows a decision by a bank handling most of the money remitted to North Korea not to serve as an intermediary on behalf of other Japanese banks, the sources said. Ashikaga Bank, a regional bank based in Tochigi Prefecture, has told other Japanese banks that it would not remit dollars to North Korea for them, the sources said. Some of the Ashikaga Bank's customers are Korean residents of Japan who use the bank to remit money to North Korea as the bank is a main bank for a North Korean-born owner of a pachinko machine maker, the sources said. Ashikaga Bank issued statements that the bank stopped intermediating with other banks in remitting dollars to North Korea some time ago, but is still handling such transactions by its own customers. The bank also said it is not the sole bank in Japan that is handling money transactions to North Korea. But a Finance Ministry official confirmed the suspension of dollar remittances to North Korea, describing it as a voluntary action. "It's each bank's own decision to suspend remittance of dollars. Remittance of money in yen and (German) marks is still carried out as in the past, so I don't believe (banks) are discriminating against North Korea in money remittance," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States has reportedly asked Japan to regulate remittance of money to North Korea as Pyongyang is suspected of using the money to promote its alleged nuclear weapons program. It is not known how much money is actually remitted to North Korea from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills. Then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pledged in February to take appropriate action if the UN Security Council adopts a resolution calling for economic sanctions against North Korea. Asked at a news conference about the reported suspension of dollar remittances to North Korea from Japan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said the government will look into the matter. He did not elaborate.
