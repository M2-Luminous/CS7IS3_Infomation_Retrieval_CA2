Karadzic by Vasiliy Fartyshev in Moscow, date not given: "Radovan Karadzic: `We Were Merely the First Line of Defense'"] [Text] There was a meeting at the Russian Federation Writers' Union between the leaders of the writers' organization and Moscow writers and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs and vice president of the Union of Serbian Writers. In a cordial and fraternal atmosphere poets and writers from Russia and Serbia talked about the historical ties of friendship and kinship between the two Slavic cultures and the problems facing our peoples today. The Yugoslav colleagues noted the great contribution Russian writers and the general public have made to settling the armed conflict and to the success of the joint opposition to the West's expansionist policy directed against the sovereign republic. Our correspondent asked politician, poet, and doctor Radovan Karadzic to answer a few PRAVDA questions. [Fartyshev] Comrade Karadzic, what is your opinion of Russia's recent initiative on settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Karadzic] We are uncommonly heartened and grateful for all that Russia has done for Serbia. Many attempts are being made in the world today to resolve the Yugoslav problem without the participation of an entire people, and it is perhaps the grimmest period in Serbian history. During World War II we learned first-hand what genocide means: The Hitlerites destroyed 700,000 Serbs as well as a large number of Jews and gypsies. We have failed to preserve a unified Yugoslavia as a state, but we are making every effort to uphold the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why throughout the 22 months of the war we have been defending our territory and our people, in order to prevent further, "civilized" genocide. We have created and formalized our own Serbian Republic, and a treaty on this will be ratified in the very near future. The Russian action helped overcome confrontation with NATO, and, as a result of this, I believe Russia emerged in the world political arena as an independent force to be reckoned with. [Fartyshev] Many of my colleagues who have been in Yugoslavia when battles have been raging have said that the Serbs were bewildered by Russia's long "silence" and were accusing us of inaction. Tell me, in the minds of your ordinary citizens are the Kremlin and Russia synonymous? [Karadzic] No, we see a difference between Kremlin officialdom and the Russian people, who have had truly fraternal feelings for us Slavs for centuries. I am sure that ordinary people are well aware of the difference. "If the Serbs cannot be destroyed, let's befriend them" -- that is more or less the metamorphosis that has occurred in the case of your Foreign Ministry. [Fartyshev] Tell me, did you ask Russia for aid -- two years ago or after that? [Karadzic] No, we did not ask for aid. But I admit that we were hoping to get it. And it came. Incidentally, I must say that Russian writers and their protests and solidarity with us had a big influence on your government. [Fartyshev] Radovan, you are a well-known poet. Just before this war you were presented with a prize for making a major contribution to the development of Yugoslav children's poetry. How do you manage to combine politics and poetry? [Karadzic] When Yugoslavia was torn apart we writers were forced to become politicians. Now most writers in my country are politicians, and they have done a very great deal to defend the Serbian people and their sovereignty. We have always studied the classics of Russian literature, without which there would be no world literature. In the same way, without Russian politics there can be no world politics. As a poet I am very grateful to a number of Russian publications for publishing my poetry at what is a most difficult time for my country. [Fartyshev] There was one particular phrase that struck me in Dostoyevskiy's "Diaries" -- to the effect that the time would come when the southern Slavs would "set us an example." What do you think he meant? [Karadzic] As I see it, what he meant was that we, the southern Slavs, live on the border between East and West. In the present war Yugoslavia was merely the first line of defense for Slavdom and Orthodox culture in general. This war was a dress rehearsal for what lay in store for Russia. A veritable blitzkrieg was mounted against us. The West, NATO, and Germany were planning to deal with Yugoslavia in two months. But they did not manage it even in two years. Next in their plans was Albania, and then the dirct route to Russia. But we are not talking, of course, about outright aggression, no, the main task is to split peoples, make them quarrel among themselves, make Russia small. Never let yourself be divided -- that is one of the lessons of our war. Take Ethiopia, another Orthodox country. It lost Eritrea, and with it access to the sea. And no one in the world interceded on its behalf. The same might have happened to us, had not great Russia interceded on Orthodox, Slavic, fraternal Serbia's behalf. [Fartyshev] Tell me, has the war ended or is this just a pause? [Karadzic] I would like to believe that the war will end soon. And we will create a new border between East and West, so that there are no more intrigues against the Slavic world. [Fartyshev] Are the intrigues still going on? [Karadzic] I heard a speech by Zbigniew Brzezinski recently. He always talked with great passion about the fight against Bolshevism. There is no Bolshevism now, but he is just as vicious when he talks about the fight against Russia. I realized that it is not actually a matter of communist ideology -- Brzezinski and dozens of special institutes in the West have been fighting and will continue to fight against the USSR, Russia, and the Russian people.
