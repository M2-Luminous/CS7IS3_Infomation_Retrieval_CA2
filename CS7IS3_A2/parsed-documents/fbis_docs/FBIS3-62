Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-040--JAPAN JAPAN: KAZUSA ACADEMIA PARK, SCIENCE PARK Chiba Prefecture has been successfully carrying out construction of the "Kazusa Academia Park," the second project of an ambitious plan to establish three new industrial-based cities in Chiba Prefecture. Chiba Prefecture incorporated a semi-public corporation in 1991 to establish this world-class science park. This cooperative effort included four Chiba cities, the Japan Development Bank, and private companies. Zoning and infrastructure development for the first phase of the Kazusa Academia Park is to be completed by the end of 1995. It has been estimated that the first phase will cost approximately 41 billion yen ($370 million) of which over 22 billion yen ($200 million) is designated for the construction (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). (The hard copy version of this FMN contains a photo of the final proposed site plan for the Kazusa Academia Center which will be the central facility of the Kazusa Academia Park.) Three Industrial-based Cities in Chiba Chiba Prefecture is making steady progress in the construction of its new science park, Kazusa Academia Park. Establishment of the Kazusa Academia Park was part of Chiba Prefecture's conceptual plan submitted in 1983 to establish three new industrial-based cities in Chiba. These cities include Makuhari New Metropolis, in Chiba City; Narita International Airport Community, in Narita City; and Kazusa Academia Park, in Kisarazu City. Chiba Prefecture aims to establish the Kazusa Academia Park as a world-class research and development city, integrating primary R&D facilities for prospective industries (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). Construction of the Kazusa Academia Park was initiated in March 1991, following the completion of the first stage of the Makuhari New Metropolis. The total area of the project site is approximately 1000 hectares. Chiba Prefecture predicts it will take approximately 10 years to complete each of the three phases of the project completing the construction in 30 years (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). The first development phase will result in approximately 278 hectares of the site. The table shown in Figure 1 represents the projected size of each construction site (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). Kazusa Academia Park, World-class R&D Center Compared to Tsukuba Science City, in Ibaraki Prefecture, in which the majority of the research organizations are national research institutes, the center of the Kazusa Academia Park will be comprised of private companies. These companies are expected to be the driving force of Japanese science and technology in the 21st Century. Chiba Prefecture's objective is to establish an international R&D center for high-tech industries including electronics, advanced materials, and biotechnology, centered with private research institutes. The prefecture also aims the development growth of Kisarazu City and Kimitsu City as "mother cities," along with development of the new cities. When a new road that crosses over the Tokyo Bay is completed in 1996 it will be approximately 30 minutes to the Kazusa Academia Park from either the Haneda Airport or Kawasaki City and about 50 minutes from downtown of Tokyo by car (See Map shown in Figure 2.) (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). Kazusa DNA Research Institute The highlight of the Kazusa Academia Park will be the "Kazusa DNA Research Institute," which is scheduled to be open in the fall of 1994. The research institute will be Japan's first research center specializing in structural analysis of DNA. The construction of the institute is near completion, with approximately 15 billion yen ($136 million) allocated. The institute is expected to be one of the world's largest research centers when completed. The institute will be operated by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation, which was established in March of 1991. Gaishi Hiraiwa, senior advisor to The Tokyo Electric Power Co. and chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), has been appointed as the chairman of the board of the institute (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 19 Jan 94, DENKI SHIMBUN 13 Dec 93). The institute will initially be operated with 70 staff members, including Mitsuru Takanami, professor emeritus of Kyoto University, who will be the director of the institute, Susumu Tonegawa, Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist and MIT professor, and Itaru Watanabe, professor emeritus of Keio University -- both appointed as special advisors (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). The institute will encourage joint research projects between Japanese researchers and researchers from overseas as a research institute with an "open-door policy." The institute plans to establish lecture rooms for visitors and observers (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94 and 19 Jan 94). (The hard copy version of this FMN contains the final proposed site plan for the Kazusa DNA Research Institute.) The Research Institute, equipped with supercomputers and 18 of the latest DNA sequencers, will focus on 1) analytical research on DNA structure, 2) research on analytical technologies for DNA structure, 3) research on mechanisms of DNA, 4) production and provision of DNA data, and 5) education of personnel for DNA research. Along with these research activities, a primary mission of the institute will be to provide research data to the private sector in order to promote biotechnology industry (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94). So far, the institute has made agreements with seven Japanese companies to construct high-tech R&D centers and R&D-focused plants in the Park. These companies include Fujitsu, Canon, Nissan Chemical Industries, Denki Kagaku Kogyo, Nippon Zeon Co., Maruzen Petrochemical Co., and Tokyo Tanabe Co. (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94) Tokyo Tanabe Co. will obtain approximately 34,000 square meters on the site. Total area of its research center will be approximately 20,000 square meters. The company plans to allocate about 200 researchers and invest approximately 12 billion yen ($109 million) into the project excluding the cost for the land (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93).
