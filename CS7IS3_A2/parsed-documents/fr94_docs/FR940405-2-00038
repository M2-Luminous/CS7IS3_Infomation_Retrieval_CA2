Status of Environmental Analysis: This application has been accepted for filing and was previously noticed as ready for environmental analysis. Comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however, because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project. l. Description of Project: The project as licensed consists of the following: (1) An existing dam with a total length of 1,215 feet which is comprised of (a) an uncontrolled overflow timber crib spillway which has a length of 524.6 feet, a height of about 16 feet, crest elevations of 960.06 and 960.49 feet mean sea level (msl), and which is surmounted by 3.3 foot-high flashboards; (b) a gated spillway section which has a length of 190 feet, and which contains three 17.5-foot-high by 30-foot-wide and two 14-foot-high by 20-feet-wide Taintor gates which have sill elevations of 947.7 feet and 950.74 feet msl, respectively; (c) an emergency timber crib spillway capped with concrete which has a total length of 238.7 feet and crest elevations of 963.83 feet and 963.97 feet msl; (d) a timber crib guard lock section with a length of 184 feet located at the entrance of the forebay channel; and (e) nonoverflow abutment sections; (2) a reservoir with normal pool elevation of 963.3 feet msl, a surface area of 150 acres, and a length of about one mile; (3) a forebay channel that extends approximately one mile from the guard lock section of the dam to the powerhouse; (4) an existing 166-foot by 129-foot powerhouse located at the end of the forebay channel and discharging into the Wisconsin River, and which contains eight flumes and five turbine/generator units_four are horizontal ``camel-back'' turbines and one is a vertical Francis unit_with a combined nameplate rating of 3,592 kilowatts (Kw), an average head of 17.5 feet, and a total hydraulic capacity of 3,124 cubic feet per second (cfs); and (5) appurtenant facilities.
