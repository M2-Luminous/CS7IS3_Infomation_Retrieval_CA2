In an interview in Tripoli, Fahimah and al-Miqrahi told AL-HAYAH that they are tired of the restrictions imposed on their movement. They stressed their wish to live a normal life, "instead of being stared at wherever we go and instead of our news dominating all world news bulletins." Al-Miqrahi said: "Our only crime is that we hold Libyan nationality.... We are victims of the West's desire to politicize the case and try Libya for a crime it did not commit in the context of settling scores in other issues." It appeared from the interview that al-Amin Fahimah and al-Miqrahi were in a bad mental state, but they tried to look composed. Al-Miqrahi pointed out that he was not in Malta during the period in which the accusation was leveled at Libya, and that he never met the owner of the timing device (timer) factory. Al-Miqrahi added that he and al-Amin Fahimah placed their full confidence in lawyer Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl the moment he was assigned to defend them, and that they support any decision he takes. He pointed out that they were not subjected to any pressures to hand themselves over, that the decision is theirs, and that they are willing to appear before "any court that enjoys the elements of fairness, not one that convicts people before the trial begins." He said that "the accusations have affected all my relatives, especially my children, who used to convey to me questions from their colleagues about this incident. I had to move them to another school...and change their family name to their mother's in order to alleviate their suffering." Having stressed that he does not fear for himself, he said that he now wants "the days to pass quickly so that I can get the innocent verdict." He stressed that "I will never sell myself to any quarter in the world, whatever the reward." And "I have never been an officer in the Libyan intelligence service." He added that "I am willing to hand myself over if the case is going to end at that point and if the sanctions imposed on Libya are going to be lifted." He added: "However, from my protracted discussions with the lawyer, they (the Western states) do not want to bring an end to this case, because its continuation is likely to lead to the continuation of the sanctions imposed on Libya." He said that the Libyan testifying against them, namely 'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah, "maybe acted under pressure or for other unavoidable motives." He stressed that "the statements attributed to Ja'akah are absolutely baseless and completely fabricated." He declined to talk about Ja'akah's mental state or go into the details of his personal life. As for al-Amin Fahimah, he expressed his belief that 'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah "will withdraw his lies the moment he sees me..., because I helped him a lot in several issues. And I believe that the case will end the moment Ja'akah admits the truth." The two suspects' lawyer, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, who attended the interview, believes that "the great suffering" al-Amin Khalifah and al-Miqrahi are experiencing is capable of "driving those afflicted by it toward madness or introversion."
