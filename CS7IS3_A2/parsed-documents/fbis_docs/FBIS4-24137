John Maguire met him in Paris this morning and asked him what he thought of the UN's vote, giving the green light for Operation Turquoise: [Begin Rudasingwa recording, in English with superimposed French translation] I do not think the UN decision reflects a consensus on the part of the international community, because in the post cold war era, to have five abstentions at the UN Security Council is very significant. You also know that the OAU, the countries of the region, and many international organizations of excellent repute, strongly oppose this intervention. So, I think we have witnessed not a consensus, but rather the will of the northern powers to consolidate a program which counters the interests of our people, to save those very groups who are responsible for this genocide. These powers at present see that these groups are weakened and are losing ground. I think that not only France, but also other countries, in particular Zaire, are trying simply to see how they can reorganize these groups of people so as to give them a place in the future.
