There were earlier reports of AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] gatherings in this area and Robbie Terblanche went to investigate. [Begin Terblanche recording] Everything seemed normal, and no serious incidents had been reported. Tension could be felt wherever we spoke to people, and nobody was prepared to appear on camera. There was a strong army and police presence. Several road blocks were set up. According to the police liaison officer for Western Transvaal, Captain Koos Degenaar, the step to declare 14 magisterial districts unrest areas was taken mainly to prevent unrest, conflict, and violence. We received a report that AWB members had gathered in the Koster region but we could not confirm this during our visit. Our investigation at Koster led to cameraman Roy Freeman and myself being stopped by police between Koster and Lichtenburg and escorted to the Lichtenburg police station. They wanted to confiscate our video material but they released us after viewing the material. According to the police people are very tense and they are receiving several calls from concerned people.
