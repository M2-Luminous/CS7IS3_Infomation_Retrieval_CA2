The two are the Government's Board of Investment [BoI] and the private sector's Thai Military Bank. The BoI will set up an office in Ho Chi Minh City, its first in Vietnam and seventh abroad, while Thai Military Bank says it will apply for a representative office--and ultimately a branch--in Hanoi to supplement its Ho Chi Minh office. They see opportunities for Thai businesses both as suppliers and contractors for an expected increase in investment in Vietnam, and as manufacturers exploiting the newly created opportunity of exporting from Vietnam to the United States. In addition to the opening of a Ho Chi Minh City office, the BoI's Vietnamese push will include an investment seminar next month, similar to one organised last month in Phnom Penh and, like the Phnom Penh event, timed to coincide with a visit by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. The Ho Chi Minh City office will join the BoI's existing six offices abroad: in New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris. Board secretary-general Sathaphon Kawitanon said it would also welcome the setting up of a special economic zone ("Zone 4") in Thai border areas to increase cooperation with neighbouring countries and boost the competitiveness of Thai investment. Thai Military Bank's decision to apply for a second representative office in Vietnam and ultimately a branch, both in Hanoi, follows what the bank reports to be a profit at its Ho Chi Minh City representative office after only one year. Although Ho Chi Minh City is still considered to be the larger business centre, bank executives believe that a presence in Hanoi is needed to be closer to decision-making, including those involving infrastructure. Bank president Thanong Phithaya and his executives believe that the lifting of the embargo will spark a growth in activity for Thai businesses. This will partly be to support the expected new American investment and related Vietnamese infrastructure projects, and partly to use Vietnam as a production base for exporting to the United States. Dr Thanong said yesterday that Thai construction companies were already studying opportunities. Construction materials would also be needed for the project, executives sald. Dr Wirasak Apharak, senior executive vice-president, said that Thai garment manufacturers wanted to invest in Vietnam in order to export to the United States because many categories of garments made in Thailand have hit their quota limits. But for the time being no one knows what exactly the trading terms will be after the lifting of the US embargo. Dr Thanong said he expected approval for the representative office in Hanoi to be routine. Setting up a branch would take longer. Thai Military Bank is one of only two Thai banks represented in Vietnam--the other is Bangkok Bank. Executives say that while Bangkok Bank has concentrated on larger Thai corporations doing business in Vietnam, Thai Military Bank has been working with smaller operations, particularly imports of goods from Thailand into the Vietnamese markets where prices can be considerably higher. Dr Wirasak said that almost all motorcycles in Vietnam were made in Thailand and many were bought using Thai Military Bank credit. Thai Military Bank is also considering applying for a representative office and later a branch in Shanghai. It already has a joint venture bank in southern China. The rationale for setting up in Shanghai is similar to that for Hanoi being close to where commercial decisions are being made. Dr Thanong is due to make a business trip to Shanghai in April. He said the request for a representative office was one of the subjects likely to be discussed. The BoI's first step in establishing an office in Vietnam will be to send officials to cooperate with the Thai commercial counsellor's office in Ho Chi Minh City in providing information for Thai investors. Mr Sathaphon said the BoI must pay close attention to economic changes in Vietnam because with the lifting of the embargo trade and investment in the region would expand. Thailand should not worry about effects on Thai investment in Vietnam in four sectors in which the United States has expertise which Thailand cannot match--food products, consumer products, services and energy. Thailand should join the U.S. on investment projects in energy, he said. Thailand had competed for investment with countries such as other ASEAN members and China for a long time. Vietnam would be just a new competitor. Vietnam had an advantage in labour costs because in that country these are just 10% of total investment outlay, he said. Raw materials, infrastructure, investment regulations, tax and government policy were significant to foreign investors. Vietnam wanted a long period to develop its electricity, transport and airports. Mr Sathaphon said Thailand must reduce costs and increase its skilled workforce to attract foreign investors. Thailand must speed up development of infrastructure in remote areas. However, Thailand's strategy was to develop supporting industries which were small or medium-scale looking towards high technology. Vietnam needed a long time to develop its industry. Mr Sathaphon said the establishment of "Zone 4" in Thailand might increase the competitiveness of this country's remote areas. The BoI has agreed in principle to set up zone 4 in horder areas such as in the growth triangle. If the Government has a clear policy on zone 4, the Finance Ministry, Commerce Ministry and the BoI will cooperate to consider the details which cover complicated aspects such as tax systems and quotas. Mr Sathaphon said the BoI would join the Vietnamese Government in holding a seminar on investment prospects in Vietnam. More than 50 Thai businessmen were expected to attend the session in March. The seminar will give Thai investors a chance to meet state enterprise representatives from Vietnam for talks on joint ventures. Mr Chuan is scheduled to visit Vietnam in March. Thais can invest in Vietnam in many areas such as mining consumer products, light industries and agriculture, most of them under state enterprises the Vietnamese Government wants to privatise. Thailand has prospects of exporting spare parts and construction materials to Vietnam which aims to double its Gross Domestic Product by 2010. The Vietnamese Government's development plan for the next six years envisages spending about US$40 billion, made up of $12-13 billion from foreign investment, $7-8 billion from domestic sources and $20 billion from foreign loans. The BoI reported that 119 foreign investment projects in Vietnam in 1993 comprised 15.35% of total investment. Taiwan ranked first with 32 projects or 26.9% of the total foreign investment. Thailand was fifth with eight projects and 6.72% of the total investment.
