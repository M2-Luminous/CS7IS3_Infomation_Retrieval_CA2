FBIS4-55807 "dreeu099_i_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Army Comments Army Comments LD2205141594 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1300 GMT 22 May 94 LD2205141594 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] In response to the agreement on the demilitarization of the exclusion zone 3 km east of the Drina River, which UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the Serbian aggressor's side signed on 21 May, the press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been authorized to announce the following: Representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not take part in the signing of the agreement, although an offer was made to them. They were not obliged to take part because the agreement is not in line with UN Resolution 913 and NATO's ultimatum, which clearly specify the obligations assumed by UNPROFOR and the Serbian aggressor side. This makes it clear to UNPROFOR representatives that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will be ready to discuss the implementation of UN Resolution 913 and NATO's ultimatum in the future. The situation in the field shows that the Serb aggressors have not fulfilled all obligations specified in the above mentioned documents. Among other things, they have not withdrawn military units and weapons from the 3-km exclusion zone around the town center. Furthermore, the aggressors' heavy weapons are still in the 20-km zone around Gorazde and are not under UNPROFOR's control. There are one tank, six howitzers, seven [word indistinct], one self-propelled weapon, one 100-mm cannon, and three antiaircraft guns in the 20-km zone. The complete evacuation of the wounded has not been made possible, and living conditions of the residents in the protected area have not improved. We stress that representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army [break in reception] are ready to discuss the resolution of the situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields and other decisions that will be based on UN and NATO resolutions.
