Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin received Saudabayev at Ankara's Esenboga Airport and conferred with him for some time. In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Cetin recalled that two years ago Saudabayev was in Turkey as his country's ambassador and expressed his pleasure at receiving Saudabayev as his counterpart. Cetin said: Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan have developed rapidly since its independence. Today, approximately 100 Turkish companies have reached the point where they are ready to conduct business in Kazakhstan. The investments and projects of these business ventures exceeds $400 million. Our exports and foreign trade with Kazakhstan, which started at zero, have reached significant dimensions. There is a very close cooperation between us. There are almost 2,000 students from Kazakhstan studying in Turkey. Cetin pointed out that a protocol was signed envisaging the transportation of oil from Kazakhstan over Turkey by way of the Mediterranean to world markets and added that work on the issue will be furthered. Saudabayev, in turn, explained that the very quickly developing bilateral cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan proves to what extent the two kindred people value each other. Saudabayev will leave Turkey after spending the night in Ankara.
