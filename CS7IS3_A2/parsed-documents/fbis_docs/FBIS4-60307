The sources did not disclose details of the discussions at the emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] which was held the day before yesterday and paved the way for yesterday's meeting, but they expected important decisions to be made that would strengthen the steadfastness of the southern forces on all fronts to halt the advance of the northern forces and prevent them from controlling the main roads leading to Aden. 'Umar al-Jawi, secretary general of the opposition's Yemeni Unionist Grouping, who supports the YSP's position, however, dismissed the claim that the Higher Salvation Council announced in Aden three days ago was a government substitute in the south. He reaffirmed his support for the preservation of Yemen's unity despite the deepening military crisis. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, al-Jawi said that the opposition urged the rest of the political parties to support the initiative which aims at stopping the war and "rescuing the country from the daily pools of blood." He added that "the signatories to the agreement seek to impose a broad political reconciliation between all the conflicting sides, parties, and rivals at home and abroad." He emphasized that the opposition is capable of achieving that "despite the terrible artillery shelling, explosions, and killing." He said: "We will endeavor to convince the General People's Congress [GPC], which is led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], which is led by House of Representative Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar; but if they reject this initiative, they would clearly be making a mistake and their aim would be to continue the war." Al-Jawi reaffirmed that "there is no longer north and south, but a united Yemen, and those who promote secessionist talk in fact want to abort the plan for the rescue of the homeland." Referring to the formation of the Higher Salvation Council, he said that "branch councils will be formed anywhere in Yemen where these parties have a presence, and the participating parties will comply with the same agreement and with the resolutions and directives issued by the Higher Council and based on the Pledge and Accord Document." He saw the grinding battles between the northerners and southerners in Yemen as "the belated dowry for unity we had expected, but it is by no means a divorce. It is a reconstruction of unity."
