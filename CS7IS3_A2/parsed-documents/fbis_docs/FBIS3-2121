Regional leaders Wang Qun, Qian Fenyong, and Shen Shuji spoke at the conference. Liu Zuohui, Liu Zhen, Chen Youzun, and Xu Bonian attended the conference. Wang Qun stressed in his speech that the reform should be oriented to seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting production, safeguarding unity, and effecting the large-scale reform, large- scale development, and large-scale advancement of the economy. In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the region's achievements in the 1993 economic work and stressed the necessity of pushing the 1994 economic work onto a new stage and a new level. Wang Qun said: This year is critical to establishing the socialist market economic structure. The major sign of embarking on a new stage and a new level is for the economic structure to keep pace with the process of shifting to the socialist market economy where efficiency is the central and fundamental issue, and the region can effect an obvious improvement in labor productivity and make even greater contributions to the financial revenues of the state. Only after embarking on this new level can we gain initiative. He said: The central authorities have recently raised the guiding principle of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting production, and safeguarding unity." By opportunity, we mean the current situation. When viewed as a whole, the current situation is favorable to our large-scale development, large-scale reform, and large-scale advancement. Currently, the world and domestic situation as well as the domestic and world markets are very conducive to us. In particular, the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee have introduced one after another some policies and regulations that facilitate large-scale development, thus providing economic development with an excellent opportunity and favorable environment. In addition, the region's reform and opening up over the past 15 years have laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development. We should seize this golden opportunity to practice and work boldly. He said: After getting a clear understanding of the situation, we should catch sight of many difficulties. Some of the problems we face, such as fund shortage, financial difficulties, and deficits incurred by some enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, are the problems with regard to reform that will surely emerge in our way of advance. Therefore, we should not get confused by these problems, but should enhance our morale and deepen reform. Only by carrying out reform can we find the way out. Without advancement, we will lag behind. And, refusing to carry out reform, will only lead to to a road of ruin. With regard to deepening reform, Wang Qun pointed out: In carrying out reform, we should not seek outside performance, nor should we engage in formalism. In reform, we should exert real efforts. To carry out reform, we should also conduct renovation and positively press forward technological progress. We should also resolve the problems regarding work bodies, product quality, and development. When shifting the structure, we should lay emphasis on key projects, large enterprises, and items producing good results. We should take the shareholding system as the major orientation in conducting enterprise reform, and adopt the methods of closing down, suspending operations, amalgamating with others, and transfer to other units in order to eliminate small, poverty-stricken, and money-losing enterprises. We should establish the enterprise operating mechanism that is suitable for the socialist market economy with a view to improving the economic efficiency of enterprises. We should attend to the following five aspects in line with the central authorities' principles of pressing forward overall reform, making breakthroughs in major aspects, using exemplary cases to guide the road, and accelerating the pace: 1. Establish and perfect the rural collectivized service system so that economic patterns where industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry serve foreign trade emerge; 2. Accelerate the transformation of mechanisms among industrial enterprises and make great efforts to basically complete the transformation of mechanisms among small and medium-sized enterprises by the end of this year; 3. Achieve success in commercial, grain, trade, and circulation reforms to promote economic development; 4. Achieve success in financial, taxation, pricing, and banking reforms and support the development of enterprises in line with the practical situation, state regulations, and the principles of "facilitating the development of socialist productive forces, the enhancement of comprehensive strength of the socialist countries, and the improvement of the people's living standards;" 5. Accelerate transformation of government functions and support reform of organizations and assign young and capable cadres to the first line of economic development and to industrial, commercial, tax affairs, and security and law departments in an effort to ensure the smooth progress of economic reform and development.
