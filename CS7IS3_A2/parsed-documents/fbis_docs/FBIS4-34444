We can see that it is a very ambitious plan. How will the plan be financed? Where will the money come from? [Zedillo] Javier, the plan will be financed with money that we hope the process of economic growth will begin to provide in 1995. It will also be financed by better distributing the money within the federal government. We are going to do what has been done in the past few years; we are going to reallocate nonpriority expenditures to those areas of a social nature, such as those contemplated in this plan. We are also going to finance the plan by asking the civilian population, those organizations interested in working to solve this problem, to contribute as well. It is a good plan, a plan that can be financed. The plan will be expanded as we receive more money, without creating inflation, to support the plan. [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, do you plan to get money through the sale of state enterprises that have not been privatized yet? [Zedillo] The money received from privatizing state enterprises will basically be allocated to the fund for the promotion of the infrastructure, which we announced last week as a suggestion. These would be huge works aimed at unleashing the country's economic growth. For the antipoverty plan, we will use the fiscal resources that will grow with time and the money that we receive through better public administration, as well as through contributions from the people. [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we understand that with this plan to fight poverty, you will try to help 14 million people who live in poverty. I rounded up the figure when I said 14 million; if I am not mistaken the number is actually 13.6 million, according to the information you provided. Will this represent some changes in the economic policy the current administration has followed? Will there be new changes? In other words, what will you retain from this current administration, and what will you change? [Zedillo] Javier, that is a very broad question. Last week, I presented my economic plan. At that time, I said it is very important that we maintain overall economic discipline and good public finances, but that we have to move to a phase of economic promotion. We must promote investment to create the new jobs that our country badly needs. I have presented an antipoverty plan. This is a more ambitious plan. This antipoverty plan is possible precisely because we have that material base. This will allow us to help many people and implement much more specific measures to attack poverty. I believe this policy, the economic as well as the social policy I am promoting, is the result of the fact that for the past few years very solid bases have been built. It would have been impossible for us to set such ambitious goals six years ago; however, today we can do it responsibly. [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, what happened in Chiapas State is perhaps an example of the poverty that exists in some areas of our country. Will the plan be a response to this very old problem? [Zedillo] Definitely, Javier. Poverty is expressed in specific ways. Poor health, lack of food for children and mothers, lack of education, lack of the essential services such as drinking water, electricity, and sewers, and lack of job opportunities. Had the country been capable of developing a plan such as this one many years ago, I doubt if today we would be regretting those tragic situations that concern us. [Alatorre] Is violence a justifiable response to extreme poverty? [Zedillo] Definitely not. I said this earlier this morning, and I have said it on several occasions. We understand the problem, and we must solve it; however, nothing is an excuse for violence or unrest. Mexico is a country that has laws and institutions, a country with a Constitution we must all respect. [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we know that you have had a very active day. We learned about your program to fight poverty in Ecatepec, and we know you are going to be in Veracruz tonight. You have a tight schedule for tomorrow as well. Before bidding you farewell, I would like to ask you about the incidents at the National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] this morning, the attacks against the candidate of the National Action Party [PAN]. What is your opinion? [Zedillo] It is very regrettable. I do not have the details, but I believe it should be condemned. This is something that should not be done, but I also believe we cannot make a poor overall judgment of our national university because of the actions taken by an irresponsible, aggressive minority. I was at the UNAM a few weeks ago during a very interesting, participatory, and respectful meeting with a considerable number of students. But when I was leaving the university, I was the object of an act of aggression. It was an act of aggression, which by the way, was organized by a party that is participating in these presidential elections. I would expect these regrettable incidents not to be linked to that party as well, otherwise it would represent an intolerable situation that would not promote civilized political life in the country, which all Mexicans want. I, therefore, condemn this incident. I convey my solidarity with the PAN candidate, and I also reaffirm that this in no way reflects the true feelings of the UNAM. The UNAM is the most important university in the country. Mexico owes a great deal to the UNAM, and these incidents of violence in no way discredits our highest education center. [Alatorre] We thank you for this interview. You are now in Jalapa, Veracruz. We invite you to accompany us here at the studios of Television Azteca in Mexico City. [Zedillo] Thank you, Javier, and I will be in your studios soon. It will be my pleasure.
