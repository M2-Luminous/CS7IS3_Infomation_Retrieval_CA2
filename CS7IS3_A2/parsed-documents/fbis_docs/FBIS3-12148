Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the massacre was a result of the continuation of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The paper said the crime has provided a clear evidence that the proposed peace initiatives will never be realized. It would be better for those who raise their voices speaking about human rights to get acquainted of the fact that no peaceful settlement will never [as received] be realized without putting an end to the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and departure of the Jewish settlers. 'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the massacre at Ibrahim mosque has reflected the criminal plots hatched by the Zionist quarters against the Palestinians. It is not a mere crime committed by one person as the Israeli authorities have been alleging, but is a well-arranged crime prepared by a number of culprits, said the daily. By alleging that the criminal committed suicide Israel is trying to distract attention from the vicious bloody crime, said the daily. The daily held Israel responsibile of all massacres committed in the occupied Palestinian territories. It also condemned shooting of the Palestinians who gathered at the hospital to donate with their blood to the injured people as well as shooting of the Palestinian demonstrators who shouted to express their anger over the bloody incident. This massacre was not the first of its kind and will never be the final one, said the daily. For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH said overlooking of such crime will never be tolerated or accepted. The Israeli authorities should be held responsibile for the massacre of the worshippers at Ibrahim mosque yesterday, said the daily. The paper criticized the Western information media which used to justify the Israeli acts against the Palestinians and the Arabs. When the Zionists commit crimes voices are always raised calling for self-restraint and rationalization, added the daily.
