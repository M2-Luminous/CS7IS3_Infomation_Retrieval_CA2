Its statement, received by ITAR-TASS today, pointed out that the absence of such control "resulted in the self-isolation of the armed forces and the work of the military leadership without taking into consideration the economic and political processes in Russia." As a result of it, authors of the statement believe, "social tension among servicemen heightened both in the Army and the Navy." The Military for Democracy Movement urged the Russian president and government to "take all necessary measures for improving the situation in the power structures of the Russian Federation, for which the personnel policy should be shaped directly by the Russian president."
