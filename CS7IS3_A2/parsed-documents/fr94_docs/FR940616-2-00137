Faxed documents will not be accepted, nor will documents postmarked on or before September 2, but received at a later date. It is the responsibility of each grant applicant to ensure that proposals are received by the above deadline. Subject to availability of funds, notification of awards will be announced on or after February 1, 1995 for exchanges to begin on or after May 1, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Overall authority for these programs is contained in the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). Overview: Grant funding is intended to promote the exchange of secondary school students, from 14 to 17 years of age, between the United States and the NIS (Newly Independent States) of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Limited funding is also available to support leadership development and training for adults in NIS non-governmental organizations who work with youth, when such an activity is coupled with a youth exchange program. The Agency's main objectives are to foster interaction between American and foreign youth, to promote democratic values and the development of democratic institutions, and to build sustainable partnerships between organizations in the United States and organizations in the former Soviet Union. It is important that all projects make interaction between the American and NIS participants a central focus of their activities. Proposals should demonstrate how American and foreign participants will interact in a substantive way that encourages the exchange of ideas, culture, values, and information. Four different program designs will be utilized in the NIS Secondary School Initiative: (A) An academic year program, (B) a semester exchange program (C) a school-to-school linkage program, and (D) a short-term exchange program. This RFP describes the short-term program. Other RFPs will be published separately soliciting proposals for the other three programs.
