Moscow Authorities Ready To Override Laws"] [Text] Yesterday's session of the city administration discussed a draft decree on progress made to carry out Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov's directive "On the Imposition of Special Rules of Sojourn in the City of Moscow, the Russian Federation Capital, for Citizens Permanently Resident Outside Russia." Speakers at the session put forward such radical ideas on tightening the rules in Moscow that they themselves came to doubt their legality. However, Luzhkov thought, Moscow will live in accordance with its own ideas of human rights even if they contravene the laws in force. The Moscow administration has been more active of late in pressing for the recognition of Moscow as a city with a special status. Yesterday, for example, it was proposed during the session to further tighten the registration rules in force in Moscow by increasing liability and the size of fine for violating them. The majority of participants in the session felt that citizens trying to evade registration should be subject to "extremely large" fines, a detention for up to 30 days, and subsequent expulsion from Moscow. Yesterday's discussion, however, was not limited to the questions of registration of visitors in Moscow. Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov announced a new presidential edict on combating banditry and organized crime which considerably widens the powers of law and order organs. The mayor thought the document gives the go-ahead for resolute actions by the Moscow administration. In this connection, Luzhkov proposed a series of steps aimed at freeing the city from "visiting thieves" and stabilizing the crime situation in the city. In particular he declared it necessary to demand that the Foreign Ministry tighten the visa rules for citizens arriving in Moscow from countries "with a complex situation," having in mind the developing countries of Africa and Asia. The Moscow government premier thinks that in imposing tough measures one should not be hidebound by legislation because "it is especially important to throw out of Moscow those who should not be here." Sergey Dontsov, head of the City Hall legal administration, tried to argue against the view of his own boss. Dontsov thinks sending people outside the limits of Moscow and Russia is not only a violation of the right to freedom of movement, it is simply an ineffective measure because "those thrown out go back to the city without ever reaching their destination." "We override laws by bringing in new rules while you render the registration rule impotent," the mayor retorted.
