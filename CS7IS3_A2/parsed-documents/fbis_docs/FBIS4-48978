C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will represent Taiwan at the fifth working party meeting on Taiwan's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled for May 17-19 in Geneva. Sheu said Wednesday [27 April] that he will travel to Geneva from Washington, D.C., where he will meet with US officials on tariff issues May 9-10. During the forthcoming GATT working party meeting, he noted, he will also hold bilateral consultations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. The fifth working party meeting will be the first such meeting this year. The fourth meeting was held last October. So far, 21 countries have asked for bilateral tariff negotiations with Taiwan, of which 14 have made tariff reduction requests, he said. Japan and the European Union, two of Taiwan's major trading partners, have not yet submitted their reduction requests, he added. Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Africa, and Hungary. Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) is currently heading a delegation to the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand for similar talks, while BOFT Director- General Huang Yen-chao is now in Tokyo for informal tariff talks with Japanese officials. Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.
