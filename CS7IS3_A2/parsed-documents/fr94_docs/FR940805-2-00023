Take notice that on July 22, 1994, pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), as amended, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Regulations (18 CFR 157.7), Southern Natural Gas Company (Applicant), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35202, filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction, installation and operation of pipeline, measurement and related appurtenant facilities, as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Applicant states it has received long-term commitments for firm transportation service under its FT Rate Schedule from the Citizens Gas Utility District, Cookeville Gas Department, Etowah Utilities, Hawkins County Gas Utility, Jefferson-Cocke County Utility District, Knoxville Utilities Board, Loudon Utilities, Middle Tennessee Natural Gas Utility District, Oak Ridge Utility District, Powell-Clinch Utility District and United Cities Gas Company, hereinafter referred to as ``Customers'', for a total subscription of 11,350 Mcf per day of firm transportation service to the Customers. Applicant requests authorization to construct, install and operate approximately 21 miles of 12-inch pipeline and the necessary measurement facilities to connect its system at or near mile post 101.44 on its Chattanooga Branch Line in Catoosa County, Georgia, with the facilities of Tenneco East, L.P., in Bradley County, Tennessee. The estimated cost of the proposed facilities is $6,951,000. Although a final plan of financing has not been determined, Applicant states that the costs of construction will be financed initially by short-term financing and/or available cash from operations, and, ultimately, by permanent financing. In addition, Applicant requests the Commission waive all applicable provisions of its tariff and ยง284.7 of the Commission's Regulations so that the Customers will not have to pay any GSR surcharges or transition costs on Applicant's system. Applicant requests Commission approval of the application by June 1, 1995, so that facilities will be available for service to the Customers on or before November 1, 1995. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August 21, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, or if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
