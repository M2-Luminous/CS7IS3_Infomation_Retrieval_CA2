The resolution also defines procedures for license issuance to transfer such materials across Ukraine's territory. The resolution specifies that both bringing to Ukraine and transit of such materials without permits from the Ministry for natural environment protection are forbidden. Commenting on the resolution at Ukrinform's request Ukraine's Minister for natural environment protection Yuriy Kostenko noted that the document was an element of a comprehensive package of documents, which the Ministry and other relevant departments were drafting in order to adjust Ukraine's legislation to accepted international norms and standards. The List of groups of substances and materials, which belong to the category of hazardous wastes and are banned from importation into Ukraine, was drafted based on lists, which are contained in the documents of the Basel Convention of 1989 "On Control over Transborder Transfer of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal". On March 21 through 25 Geneva is supposed to host a meeting of the parties to the Basel Convention to discuss, in particular, the Convention's ratification procedural issues and their accedence to it. The Ukrainian Ministry's delegation is also to attend the meeting. Yevgeniy Motorin, chief of the Ministry's ecological safety agency, singled out the following major legal safeguards, which the resolution contains: -- the amount of wastes should correspond to the designated enterprise's reprocessing capacity; -- the contract should specify that in case of importation of substandard raw materials and wastes to be reprocessed in Ukraine, the importer is bound to take them out of Ukraine at his expense; -- the custom-house is responsible for exercising due control over transborder carriage of wastes, in accordance with the active legislation. Besides, the Law of Ukraine of February 25, 1994 complements the Criminal Code of Ukraine with an article, which specifies that importation of banned materials into Ukraine is actionable and entails punishment up to three years of imprisonment. Importation into or transit across Ukraine's territory of wastes and secondary raw materials without due permits entails fines in amounts of 150 minimal wages. As Ye. Motorin thinks, the state's support for environmental safety is inadequate. There are only three garbage incineration facilities in Ukraine. The state budget provides for 1.638 trillion karbovanets allocated for natural environment protection. Factual allocation, though, is barely enough to support the Ministry for natural environment protection alone.
