Journalists were told this by the head of the Georgian delegation at the Abkhazian-Georgian talks, Dzhaba Ioseliani. He stressed the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry, and in particular the first deputy Russian Defense Minister [Colonel-General Georgiy] Kondratyev, guarantee the complete safety of refugees returning to Abkhazia. He also noted that Russian peace-keeping forces will be active observers of the ongoing processes and will actively participate in them. They are very resolute and will take the appropriate measures against any forces which try to disrupt the agreement achieved. [Announcer] The statement by Dzhaba Ioseliani on the introduction of Russian troops to the conflict zone was commented on by Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian Federation Council's Defense Committee, at the request of our radio station. [Begin Shirshov recording] Unfortunately I did not hear Mr. Shevardnadze's official statement and statements by other officials of the soveriegn state of Georgia. Nevertheless I do not understand, if this is actually true that the introduction of troops between the sides in conflict, between Georgia and Abkhazia, has begun today, then this violates the constitution of the Russian Federation, no matter who made the decision, no matter which top Russian officials. I want to stress that Article 102 of the Constitution, Part 4, Point G, says that the agreement to the introduction of Russian Armed Forces outside the Russian state can be given only by the Federation Council.
