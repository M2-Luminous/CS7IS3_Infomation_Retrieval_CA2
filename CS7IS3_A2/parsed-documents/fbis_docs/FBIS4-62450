The conference was attended by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk and leaders of a number of ministries and departments. It was pointed out at the conference that the indebtedness of enterprises and organizations for gas by 12 May this year reached over 14.5 trillion karbovantsi. This is leading to the growth of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia's GazProm [gas industry] and is fraught with a stoppage of the natural gas deliveries from Russia. The main debtors are the enterprises and organizations subordinate to the Ministry of Power Engineering, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Machine-Building, the State Committee for Housing and Utilities, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. In connection with this, the domestic gas and transport gas subunits of DerzhKomNaftoHaz [state oil and gas committee] were instructed to stop gas deliveries to the consumers should they fail to pay for gas in advance or fail to pay out their debts in good time. The cases against persistent defaulters will be passed to the court of arbitration. At the same time, the ministries and departments have to pay off their debts in compliance with the the worked out schedules and take measures to save energy resources.
