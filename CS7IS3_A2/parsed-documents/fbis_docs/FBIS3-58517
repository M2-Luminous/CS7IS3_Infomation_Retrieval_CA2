Following the NATO summit in Brussels and President Clinton's visit to Prague, Kiev, and Moscow, Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend discussed topics of international security policy in a KURIER interview. -- The new NATO concept: The fact that the Eastern reform states have not been accepted as members is not primarily a concession to Russian President Yeltsin. The foremost consideration in this is the alliance's unity. Homogeneous political, economic, and social structures are the real strength of NATO. This requires an adaptation process of several years for prospective members. I expect this process to be concluded before the end of this decade. -- Consequences for Europe: We must not draw the wrong conclusions from the outcome in Brussels. The truth is that Europe will have to do more for its security by itself, also in the future. -- Consequences for Austria: We are going a different way: Security via integration. Austria will try to codetermine European security within the European Union. -- Clinton's foreign policy: However fervently the U.S. President may state the opposite, the fact is that following the end of the Cold War American interests have moved away from Europe. And a power vacuum has formed in the Pacific area, which has the highest population growth and where some of the countries have two-digit economic growth rates. Japan, the leading economic power, only has a very small army. Opening up of Communism requires a different security policy in that part of the world. There are also other parts of the world that are more important to the United States than Europe at the moment: the Middle East for instance, where the peace process demands support; or the petroleum producing countries, upon whose political stability the United States' economy is dependent. -- The situation in Russia: The recent developments should not be dramatized. History has shown that times of big changes tend to play into the hands of radical nationalists. But the danger must not be underestimated, either. In Russia we have the same situation now as before the elections: The president faces a parliament where communists and nationalists hold a majority. Considering this, a long period of political and military instability can be expected. -- Nuclear arms: In view of the distribution of arms in four states of the former Soviet Union and considering the diminishing central power and control, nobody can rule out that mass destruction arms get into the wrong hands. This is the real challenge to American security policy. Beside continuing efforts for disarmament, it would be important to include the new nuclear arms countries in a network of international monitoring.
