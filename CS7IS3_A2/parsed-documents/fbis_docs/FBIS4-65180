Preioni obtained 12 votes against the 11 won by outgoing president Giovanni Pellegrino of the Left Democrat Party. Two elections were needed because the first resulted in a tie between Preioni and Pellegrino. The new vice presidents of the commission are Lino Diana of the People's Party and Elidio De Paoli of the Lombard Alpine League. Although approval by the body and a subsequent vote by the full assembly are no longer necessary to lift parliamentary immunity from investigation, magistrates still need the green light from the committee to carry out searches, telephone taps and preventive detention of legislators, unless the crimes carry mandatory arrests and/or prison sentences of more than five years. Lawmakers can also be arrested without permission from the legislative body if they are caught in the act of committing a serious crime. Preioni, 43, was a registered lawyer and a secondary school teacher before being elected to the Senate with the Northern League in 1992. He was a member of the Justice commission and of the same body he now chairs. Preioni's election set off a series of protests and criticisms from opposition parties, who accused the three right-wing coalition partners of bullying their way to the top of all institutional bodies, even those that traditionally have been led by the opposition. "This government coalition," a communique from the Left Democrat Party Senate caucus said, "is so power hungry that it makes the old five-party coalition seem like a club of gentlemen by comparison." A right-wing Senate whip this morning announced the majority would do the exact opposite of what it actually did when it elected Preioni, the communique said, adding that the election contradicts a tradition that gives chairmanships of many commissions to the opposition parties. With a majority and the chair of the body in charge of granting waiver of parliamentary immunity, critics say, the League could protect its own members of parliament from prosecution. "In Italy and in other civil countries there is a tradition that gives leadership of this sort of body to the opposition," Lower House Left Democrat whip Luigi Berlinguer commented. Livio Caputo of Forza Italia responded that there was no "provocatory intent" in the election of Preioni and called the entire affair an unfortunate "stop-gap incident" caused by technical reasons. He said the present state of affairs may turn out to be temporary. Even the former Christian Democrats, who led coalition governments for 40 years before falling apart in the wake of corruption scandals, criticized the election of a majority senator. Nicola Mancino, who heads the senators of the party, now renamed the People's Party, said this state of affairs will "stiffen" relations between majority and opposition, especially after the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of Forza Italia as Senate speaker.
