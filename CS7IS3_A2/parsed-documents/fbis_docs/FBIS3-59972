Therefore, it is a matter of great urgency to begin the prevention and treatment of drug abuse in our country. According to the convention, drug abuse is a social problem that endangers public health and is one which faces the international community. The WHO lists drug abuse as the abuse of anesthetics, medicines for psychiatric treatment, tobacco, alcohol, and dissolvable organic substances. In our country, there is close government and nongovernment attention to the abuse of alcohol and tobacco and their hazards. But problems such as the abuse of non- anesthetic drugs and treatment with addictive pain-killers have not yet received wide attention. A poll of 1,822 households in the Beijing urban area in 1988 found that the drug- dependency rate originating from the abuse of prescribed medicines was 0.309 percent of those polled, half the drugs they depended upon were, on the whole, fever medications. Another special poll of 4,139 medical workers in 10 city and district hospitals in Beijing toward the end of 1989 reported that of the 96 drug dependents, 76, that is 79.2 percent, were on sleeping pills and sedatives. Investigations by the departments concerned show that middle-aged and young people account for the majority of the 250,000 drug addicts in our country, concentrations of whom extend from the Yunnan borders to Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guangxi, involving some 700 counties in 17 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. Statistics from the Public Health Ministry's AIDS Monitoring Center show that by November 1993, 60 percent of the nation's HIV carriers became infected by injecting heroin intravenously. Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang said in his address that anesthetics and psychiatric medicines are indispensable in medical work and, properly administered, ease pain and protect health. But, if they are abused or illegally manufactured and sold, they become poisonous drugs and cause harm. He therefore stressed that in preventing and treating drug abuse, we must learn from countries around the world about their successes in combating drugs. It is hoped that the newly founded Chinese Society for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse will, under the centralized leadership of governments at all levels, launch mass prevention and treatment; mobilize circles in society to campaign widely and educate people against drug abuse, targeting the effort above all at adolescents and youths; work in coordination with the government departments concerned to prevent drug abuse; and work for the health of our country's people.
