Most of their members are non-Estonians, he said. Kozlov said the so-called Riga, Perm, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Azerbaijan and Chechen groups are all great powers in Estonia. The only Estonian group of note in the underworld is the Saha-Loo or the so-called "poultry complex" gang, he said. The police chief claimed the groups concentrate round people most of whom live since long in Estonia and carry permanent residence permits. Igor Kalinin, one of the leaders of the Riga group that had of late gathered strength in Estonia was recently killed in Tallinn. Kozlov told reporters Kalinin's slaying was an unpleasant surprise to Tallinn's criminal police, since the police had been able through him to keep the activity of the group in check to a degree. "Now a new man will take over and we haven't the slightest idea who he is or which way organized crime will turn," Kozlov stated.
