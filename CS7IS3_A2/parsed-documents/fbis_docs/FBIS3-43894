In a joint statement the organisations noted that "the best hope for peace, prosperity and stability lies in decisive ANC electoral victory". Such an election win could only be achieved by "building the broadest unity of all sectors into a front, within the Indian community, behind the ANC". The meeting -- attended by ANC President Nelson Mandela -- also resolved to develop joint programmes to reach out to communities on a door-to-door and sector-to-sector basis, and to build a credible leadership platform to effectively address the Indian community.
