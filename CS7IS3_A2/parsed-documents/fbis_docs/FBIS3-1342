Two Johannesburg-based newspapers reported on Friday [25 March] morning the former Vlakplaas operative had gone into hiding, apparently in Europe. One newspaper reported he left on a flight from Cape Town on Tuesday evening to Frankfurt, and then onto another destination in Europe. The report could not be confirmed. News of his departure from the country comes amid a report in another newspaper that the Goldstone Commission has discovered a Swiss bank account used to fund third force activities. The newspaper said information about the fund was one of the cards Mr Justice Richard Goldstone was holding back as he prepared for an all out confrontation with Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe. It said Judge Goldstone was also in possession of a video-tape incriminating several of the people named in its latest report.
