Based on an analysis of the 1993 results of the economy, the goals for 1994 are exceedingly demanding and their attainment is associated with a number of risks. Which of these risks are most serious and what possibilities do we have to limit or eliminate them? Risk of Failure To Achieve Zero Economic Growth The factors of this risk are on the side of demand (low domestic household demand underpinned by purchasing power, low demand of the government and entrepreneurial sector, low external demand), but far greater, in my opinion, are the risks on the side of supply. They dwell, in particular, in the inadequate reaction, differentiated according to sectors, to the long-term transformation changes, short-term cyclical changes, and other changes in the economic environment. What are the causes of the entrepreneurial sector's inadequate reaction? The conduct of an entrepreneurial entity depends primarily on the internal interest structure and mechanisms of the realization of differentiated interests therein, according to the characteristics of the entrepreneurial environment [sentence as published]. The most radical intervention in the internal interest structure is a change in proprietary relations. The structure of proprietary relations determines, to a decisive extent, the interest structure but the interest structure is also influenced, to a large degree, by the mechanisms of the realization of interests of various interest groups. Let us cite the example of one of the most complex interest structures -- the interest structure that comes about in a company that has gone through the process of coupon privatization and in which the state has retained a certain stake. This structure comprises the interests of the management, the interests of individual small shareholders, the interests of investment funds, the interests of the National Property Fund of the Slovak Republic, the interests of employees (those who do not constitute the management), the interests of creditors (in the event of indebted companies), and, possibly, also the interests of an individual large owner (such as a foreign investor, for example). The mechanisms of the realization of the interests of individual interest groups are still only taking shape and are imperfect, as are the mechanisms of solving conflicts between diverse interests. Moreover, the existing mechanisms are being applied in an environment that deforms their effect. For example, the low effectiveness of the law on bankruptcy and settlement is not caused only by some of the law's shortcomings. The introduction of arbitration proceedings is often being criticized. This stipulation is contained also in the U.S. bankruptcy law, where, however, it has been introduced in the interest of creditors who are insufficiently prepared, or afraid, to bear the risks arising from bankruptcy proceedings. The risk of the failure to achieve zero economic growth can be limited, on the side of supply, by a micro-economic policy of the state that will establish suitable conditions for more adequate reactions of the entrepreneurial sphere. The main focus of the state's micro- economic policy in the transformation period is, undoubtedly, a change in proprietary relations. However, it must not be confined to that but must also center on eliminating various deformations of the environment such as, for example, its monopolization, and the like. In all the transforming economies, this environment is characterized, among other things, by the so-called "trap of tough budgetary restrictions." It is a consequence of the unfavorable combination of several factors: the rapid transition from a soft budget policy toward tough budgetary restrictions, companies' inadequate structural adaptation, and soft or ineffectual legislative conditions. A result of these factors is drastic growth of inter-company credit indebtedness and an alarming deterioration of the commercial banks' portfolio. A solution to the consequences of the "trap of tough budgetary restrictions" will be effective in the long term only when we succeed in eliminating its causes. It is therefore exceedingly important that various approaches to solving intercompany debts and so-called bad debts be coupled with the part of transformation policy that establishes conditions for a change in the conduct of the entrepreneurial sector. Once these prerequisites are met, it will be possible, as the next step, to release on a larger scale domestic and foreign credit resources so as to boost investment demand. The sooner we succeed in setting these processes into motion, the smaller will be the risk of failure to achieve zero economic growth. Risk of Failure To Meet Budget Deficit Target This risk has been fairly thoroughly analyzed and measures designed to limit or eliminate it are in an advanced stage of preparations. A part of these measures is of fiscal nature (tax-related measures, for example), the other part has, in addition to fiscal effects, also more fundamental transformation effects. The tax-related measures are to raise state budget revenues but, on the other hand, they also entail some additional risks. There is the risk that the resultant price increases will reduce demand and there exist social or political risks. The drop in demand could lower the mechanically estimated impact of tax adjustments on budget revenues and raise demands for additional budget resources. The lowering of social risks, for example, could raise demands on additional social payments (welfare payments and the like). It is evident that the tax adjustments aimed at eliminating the risks of budget management must be carried out so that their positive effects outweigh their potential negative effects. Measures that, in addition to fiscal effects, have transformation effects, too, include the lowering of subsidies of the prices of electricity, gas, and heat for households. Maintaining these prices deep below the level of costs does not encourage energy conservation and, at the same time, it deforms criteria for the allocation of investments in individual sectors of the economy. The liberalization of the prices of energy for households is therefore an important transformation step. On the other hand, it requires that: a) steps be taken to prevent monopoly price rises (by introducing regulation of natural monopolies), b) steps be taken to limit the impact on households in general (by promoting energy conservation programs) and on socially weak groups in particular (by means of various schemes of protecting the socially weakest strata). Sociopolitical Risks The fifth consecutive year of economic decline, and the resulting continuing decline of employment, growth of the cost of living, growth in the number of long-term unemployed, growing number of households whose income is in the range of 1 to 1.5 times the subsistence minimum, and so forth, poses the growing risk that transformation will become socially unsustainable. The fact that these processes are in their fifth consecutive year (with a certain alleviation in the second half of 1992) is particularly serious. It means that the mitigating effect of the relatively good starting social standard of households in 1989 is being exhausted. Major risks dwell in: a) the growth of the socially weaker strata at the expense of the middle class, b) the growing regional differentiation of the social situation, c) the impossibility of tackling some needs of the population (such as housing needs) from their own resources, in a situation when other resources not available. The mounting social difficulties create a fertile soil for political forces proposing extreme or populist solutions. The enforcement of such solutions in the actual economic sphere would, however, further aggravate the risks of the Slovak economy. There is no doubt that alleviating the risks in the economic sphere -- that is, in particular, the risk of failure to achieve zero economic growth, the risk of higher-than-projected inflation, and so forth -- is the basic prerequisite for addressing the sociopolitical risks. On the other hand, it will also be necessary to take steps in the social sphere that will alleviate social tension and maintain social peace. Without maintaining social peace, it is impossible to create by democratic means prerequisites for the Slovak economy to become, within an acceptable time frame, a modern and efficient economy integrated into the European and global economic structures. The endeavor to maintain social peace makes it necessary to spread the social costs of transformation over a longer period of time. This means that some partial transformation measures with serious social repercussions must be administered in doses, without, however, being postponed. It is becoming apparent that, without administration in doses, as it were, costs of the social safety net can soar and trigger additional risks (for example, sharply increase the budget risk). A hopeless situation then comes about. The estimates of the costs of transformation are often being compared with the costs of reconstructing the war-ravaged West European economy [after 1945]. The transforming states cannot reckon with any new Marshall Plan. Foreign aid represents only a small fraction of their needs. The magnitude of the costs, and the social inevitability of spreading them over a period of time, make it necessary to acquire foreign credit resources. It is of extraordinary importance under what terms these resources are extended and on what they are spent. It is the duty of government policy to ensure that the terms under which resources are acquired, and the methods of their use, be as favorable as possible for the Slovak economy. That is why it will be necessary, in the course of 1994, to address the risks of the Slovak economy and to demand the implementation of an economic policy, the aims of which are not easy to reconcile: maintaining macroeconomic stability at an adequate level and ensuring that the economic decline does not continue. The conditions in which the Slovak economy finds itself in the year 1994 make this task even more demanding.
