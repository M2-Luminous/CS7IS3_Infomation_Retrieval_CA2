FBIS4-9031 "dreeu076__a94049" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ANNEX Poland Walesa Interviewed on Current Issues Walesa Interviewed on Current Issues LD1904183594 Warsaw PAP in English 1546 GMT 19 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1904183594 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- After receiving the invitation of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) parliamentary caucus to hold a meeting, President Lech Walesa told PAP on Tuesday that if the caucus invites him, he is ready for a meeting and for talks. Walesa added he "never refuses invitations and has accepted many of organized social forces comprising more than five-ten serious people." Commenting on the suggestion by a group of deputies to amend the Small (interim) Constitution, the president said he cannot ignore an initiative "that can become a great fire." Walesa criticised the prime minister's move to announce local elections and said he "has a grudge against Pawlak" over doing this. In reply to a remark that the Small Constitution does not at the moment empower the president to dissolve parliament, Lech Walesa said that "we are constructing a new constitution, a new order and a new system. This process has many shortcomings and it would be bad if the president did not see them. Being aware of the fact that the change of the system is proposed, the president cannot avoid issuing a challenge, cannot avoid asking the question if the system can be changed like that, if this case does not require asking society and the nation for consent." "I am not doing anything that would testify to my violating the law. I will address the nation with the question whether it is possible for a group set up for two hours to change the basic law and the political system of the country. In my opinion, this is inadmissible and should be forbidden. I will build a force that will make this not possible and in this context I said that I will use this force to dissolve parliament. It will be authorized to do so. "It is in the interest of the state and all of us not to make accidental changes of the system, like it is happening now. It is a challenge for today and for the future. That is why my reaction was as it was. I reacted in that way not because I love power and I want to have it. I reacted like that in the name of responsibility for the future of the country, bacause tomorrow a different coalition may be set up and change the basic law." Replying to a remark that the proposal was made by several deputies only while the decision belonged to parliament, the president said: "A match can set fire to the whole city. Therefore I sometimes have to strike early to make everybody think. Of course, may [as received] opponents will say that I want to destabilise the situation but can the fact that I am using legal measures at my disposal be called destabilisation?" The president stressed in this context that it was high time to tell judges and prosecutors that "nobody should be allowed to say that the president is destabilising (the situation) when he exercises his rights and observes the dates envisaged by the law." He added that there were many things in Poland which were still in the process of creation and "our behaviours are strange. Seeing serious shortcomings I must provoke a discussion." Criticising Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's decision to order elections to local government on June 19, President Walesa declared that this was yet another thing to which he had to react. "For the first time I must complain about the prime minister's conduct and tell him publicly that he should not act in such a way. I still have time to sign the new local election law (the final date is April 21) and he should not have done such a thing." Walesa also added that he would have to draw the attention of lawyers to the fact that the faulty legal system permitted [word indistinct] to annouce that the elections would be held according to the old law while the Sejm already passed a new law. "It is not so much the prime minister that is to blame but rather the incorrectly constructed system," the president said. The president confirmed that he starts a tour of the country on Friday and intends to publicly speak of this and other problems.
