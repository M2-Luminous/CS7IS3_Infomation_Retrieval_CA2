He stated: "The parties are united by a commitment to put into effect the government program." Cesar denied that he has lobbied for the position of finance minister because of rumors that Finance Minister Emilio Pereira will leave the post. He said that he does not wish to work with a government which has lost "influence and credibility....I have no relations with (Presidency) Minister Lacayo, nor do I want to. Not with Lacayo or any member of the government team." With regard to 1996, Cesar observed that a liberal-conservative alliance of two or three parties is "possible" and "desirable." Based on recent polls he predicted that no member of the government will win more than 8 to 10 percent of the votes in 1996.
