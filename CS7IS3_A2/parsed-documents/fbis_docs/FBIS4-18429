He also clarified that the National Guard has been placed on partial readiness due to the alert of the occupation forces along the confrontation line. Kasoulidhis described the National Guard's reaction as a normal procedure that will conclude when the Turkish occupation forces are taken off alert. It would be naive, the spokesman concluded, for anyone to believe that the Greek Cypriot side, amid the current political developments, would be foolish enough to tamper with the confrontation line.
