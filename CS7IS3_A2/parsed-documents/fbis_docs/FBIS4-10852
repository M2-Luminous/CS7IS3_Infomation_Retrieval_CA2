But one of them, photographer David Garcia, already has been released for lack of evidence. [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] These men belong to the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front terrorist group. The group members became known a few years ago when they murdered two Mormons, two Americans, in La Paz. These images from our files remind us that these men were sentenced, in some cases, to 20 years in prison. In the last few hours police arrested Judith Munoz and David Garcia for their alleged involvement in this case. It has been reported, however, that David Garcia did not have any participation in the murder of the two Mormons. Therefore, Judith Munoz will be formally accused of belonging to the terrorist group. [Minister of Government German Quiroga] We found a close link between that woman and the Mormons' murder. Therefore, police are carrying out an investigation in that direction. [Reporter] Reliable Bolivian police sources indicated that a clearly identified jeep was used when the Mormons were murdered. The finding of the jeep at her house lead to Judith Munoz' arrest.
