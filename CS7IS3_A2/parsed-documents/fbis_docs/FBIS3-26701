The new development, under the name of "Yinhe (milk way) power supply system for computer-monitoring, unmanned and computer-controlled telephone switchboards", has passed a state technical appraisal in this capital of central China's Hunan Province. The system, China's first of its kind, was developed by researchers with the China National Defense Science and Technology University based in Changsha, the Hunan Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Research Institute and the Changsha Rixin Electrical Appliance Plant. Previously, China relied heavily on similar imported power supply systems for its posts and telecommunications sector. Such foreign products were not only expensive but also inconvenient to repair. Some of the imported ones do not have a computer-monitoring function. Experts from the appraisal group say that some technical functions of the newly-developed system have reached international advanced standards, while the price is two-thirds that of the imported ones.
