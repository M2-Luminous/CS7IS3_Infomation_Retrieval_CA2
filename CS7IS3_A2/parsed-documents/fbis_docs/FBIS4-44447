There is not the slightest doubt about this. But in freeing up prices, will everything be fine and everywhere be peaceful? Do governments in market economy countries no longer manage prices? Obviously this is not the case. Since China's government still must manage prices, how does it management them? To manage them too much and too rigidly and return to the old system obviously will not do. If they are managed too little and too laxly, large price fluctuations will inevitably occur. This also is unacceptable. How does the government manage prices under socialist market economy conditions? This truly is a new problem. This article by Comrade Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary of the State Planning Commission and deputy bureau head of the former State Pricing Bureau, deserves to be read. With the historically great progress in China's price reform, the traditional price managing system characterized by a high degree of centralization and administrative methods alone, has been essentially eliminated, and a new price managing system framework is gradually being formed. Under these circumstances, questions clearly confront us such as: Is price reform complete or not; After prices are freed up will they be allowed to drift;? and how are prices managed in a market economy? Whether we can properly answer these questions in theory and promptly resolve these questions in practice is directly related to continuing price reform and to a certain extent affects the sound development of the economy and the stability of society. Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equate To Completing Reform In fifteen years of price reform, China has converted from planned pricing mechanisms to socialist market pricing mechanisms and has already made some decisive steps. The highly centralized government fixed price system has been smashed and the prices of the vast majority of commodities are formed by the market. Since the end of 1992, the retail prices of only 5.9 percent of the commodities in society were set by the government; the prices of 12.5 percent of the total agricultural products sold by farmers were set by the government; and the prices of 18.7 percent of capital goods sold by industrial enterprises were set by the government. The comparative price relations of major commodities have been fundamentally improved and the price structure is constantly being rationalized. The scissors of industrial and agricultural product prices is greatly reduced. In 1992 the industrial products that farmers could exchange the same amount of agricultural products for had increased by 50.9 percent from 1978. The low price situation of extraction and basic industries had clearly improved. The domestic selling price of more than 95 percent of imported commodities were directly related to international market prices through the agency system. These all are historically great achievements, creating important prerequisites for the formation of socialist market pricing mechanisms. But price reform is by no means complete. According to the goals for the reform of the economic system determined by the party's Fourteenth Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee, the fundamental task of price reform is to establish socialist market pricing mechanisms. These pricing mechanisms are mainly formed by the market with macroeconomic control by the government. The basic requirement is that in the formation of prices the vast majority of commodities enter the market. Because enterprises rely on market supply and demand to determine prices, in pricing they can adjust prices through supply and demand in an ordered market atmosphere of unified open competition and prices lead to rational distribution of resources. On top of price restraints, the government can establish a complete and effective system to control prices and using limited fixed prices as the mainstay adopt price fixing activity that conforms to the standards of the market economy and legal standards. Comparing the successes already achieved with these reform goals, we should say that there still is a considerable gap: 1) The market system still is not sufficiently developed. The current market structure is comparatively unitary. Development of the market for the elements of production has just begun. The scale of the market is still comparatively small, facilities are imperfect, trading methods are backward, and market regulations are very unsound, and regional blockades and division of markets still exist. With prices formed in this kind of market, we cannot flexibly reflect the overall supply and demand of society and the degree of scarcity of resources and we cannot accurately transmit signals for the orientation of resources. The December 1993 grain price fluctuations occurred after China's grain production had had successive years of bumper harvests and state reserves were ample, and overall supply and demand were balanced. To a very great extent this situation is directly related to the fact that China's current market system is not sufficiently developed. 2) Reform of internal enterprise operational mechanisms still is incomplete. Although enterprises that have fixed prices as their mainstay already have competition induced mechanisms, generally speaking they still lack the restraining mechanisms of risks, lack a complete internal price control system, and lack the understanding, the experience, and the ability to make scientific pricing decisions. The first half of last year, certain large steel enterprises took advantage of the inflated scale of investment and the great demand for building materials and contended with one another to inflate prices and even colluded to raise prices, causing steel prices to double. Subsequently prices fell sharply and steel piled up in the warehouses creating circulating difficulties for enterprise production. This is just a typical example of the situation. 3) A price control system still has not been established. After the scope of prices under direct state control was greatly reduced, an effective price control system and a complete set of prices laws and regulations still were not established for the vast majority of freed up commodity and service prices. Although the state began to establish reserves for some commodities and certain regions established price adjustment funds for a few important varieties, generally speaking economic methods still are very weak, legislation is relatively retarded, and controls are lacking in strength, not very suited to the development of the overall reform situation, and becoming a pronounced contradiction in current reform. 4) The problem of the unsuitable pricing system still has not been completely resolved. The prices of a few basic products such as energy and railroad transportation and infrastructure prices still are low, which is disadvantageous to preferential distribution of resources, and grain purchasing prices are not altogether reasonable. The relative performance of grain production has declined and the scissors differential of industrial and agricultural products that had been reduced since reform, in recent years has given indications of expanding, which is disadvantageous to the stable growth of agricultural production. All of these situations indicate that it still is necessary to put forth a great deal of actual arduous effort to accomplish price reform. We especially must continue to develop the market system and establish a unified, free, competitive, and orderly market system; and promote reform of internal enterprise operating mechanisms. We should actively cultivate the market as the mainstay; pay close attention to establishing a sound price control system, and continue to smooth the price relations of important commodities. Only if we do this can we establish socialist market pricing mechanisms. We Cannot Take a Hands Off Approach to Prices Under Market Economy Conditions An important characteristic of the market economy is using economic benefits as a fundamental driving force and realizing optimum distribution of resources through the market. This type of economy has mechanisms to encourage competition and is vigorous. It also is a legal system economy, limiting the negative effects that spontaneity and blindness can produce on the market. Socialist market pricing mechanisms also must fully realize this important characteristic. With the vast majority of commodity and service prices freed up, since producers and businesses have obtained autonomy in fixing prices, it has greatly aroused enthusiasm for production and business and clearly promoted economic development, a flourishing market, and improvements in people's lives. But at the same time, in some regions, departments, and institutions, certain chaotic phenomena have occurred such as: Exceeding authority in establishing prices, arbitrarily collecting fees, monopoly prices, seeking exorbitant profits, getting on the bandwagon to raise prices, raising prices without authorization, clambering to raise prices, demanding exorbitant prices, cheating and gouging, and counterfeit and inferior goods. Although the manifestations of these problems are somewhat different in different regions and different sectors, their danger cannot be overlooked. They disrupt the economic order and affect the image of reform, damage the interests of the masses, and to a certain extent promote overall inflation. According to calculations, in the 13 percent total rise in the retail prices of society in 1993, spontaneous price increases made up 6.8 percentage points. A significant portion of this was caused by chaotic prices. These chaotic prices essentially are produced by the disorderly activity of various special interests who, with the pattern of interests drastically changing, pursue their own benefits and do not care about the benefits of society. It is a reflection of the spontaneity and blindness of the market economy. To guard against and overcome the destructive effects that this spontaneity and blindness can produce, the state must control and manage economic activity and market prices. Western market economy countries also do not take a hands off approach to prices. All major developed countries have established different levels and different types of price control structures, distinguishing the different situations for commodities and services and have adopted separate direct control, indirect control, and oversight and inspection measures. Japan has established a unified national price control structure with a price issue council structure to make price decisions and a price administering structure with the Price Bureau of the Economic Planning Agency at its core. France has a National Competition Commission as the general bureau to check on competition, consumption, and anti-fraud. Thailand has the Fair Price and Monopoly Prevention Commission established by the Ministry of Commerce for unified control of national prices. The United States has not established a national unified price control structure, but oversight and control of overall price levels is maintained by the Labor Department of the federal government; railroad freight prices are controlled by the government's Interstate Commerce Commission; and consumer interests and enterprise price oversight is undertaken by the Consumer Bureau. In Germany national control of commodity prices generally is the responsibility of state government economic agencies. The items with direct government control of prices by various countries are: Japan has such products as petroleum, coal, railroads, air transport, public housing, land prices, rice, cigarettes, and salt, approximately 18 percent of the products in consumer price indices statistics. The United States has public utilities such as, electric power, taxis, subways, cable television, running water, gas, public housing rent, and museum tickets, making up between 5 percent and 10 percent of citizens' consumable expenditures. In France there are such things as public transportation, post and telegraph, health care, spirits, education, military industrial products, and agricultural products, making up approximately 20 percent of commodities and fees. In Germany there are such things as railroads, pharmaceuticals, coal, agricultural products, lawyer, architect, and notary fees, and legally stipulated insurance fees, making up 22-26 percent of commodities and public utility fees. Countries' governments have three forms of indirect price controls. One is the use of monetary policy and financial policy by adjusting the reserve discount rate, the interest rate, and the use policy budget, adjusting government expenditures to regulate overall supply and demand of society. The second is to use industrial policy to support the development of key industries. For example, the United States conducts a price support and subsidy policy for agricultural products to protect farmers' interests and the European Union and Japan also have a considerable number of agricultural product subsidies. The third is social intervention measures, intervening by means of price oversight from a consumer commission or the public opinion of society. Foreign price oversight and inspection also are very serious. They have established special price oversight and inspection forces, and some countries arm their inspectors and when necessary they can search and serious law-breakers are prosecuted. Throughout today's world there is not a country, whether a developed country or a developing country, that completely lets prices drift. The Third Plenary Session of the party's Fourteenth Central Committee, based on China's practical experience since reform and opening up and consulting certain general practices of Western countries, made some clear determinations regarding establishing a macroeconomic control system. The plenary session passed the Decision on Some Issues Regarding the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System pointing out that "establishing an improved macroeconomic control system with indirect controls as the principle means will ensure the healthy operation of the national economy" and "further conversion of the operating mechanisms of state enterprises" and "establishing a national unified free market system... is the basic framework for a mutually related and mutually restraining, organic, complete, and integral socialist market economy system. We must establish corresponding legal systems and adopt feasible measures centered on these important links to actively and gradually totally advance reform and promote the development of productive forces in society." Establishing an Improved Price Control System is an Urgent Task of Current Price Reform In the new situation with the marketization of the Chinese economy constantly increasing, in order to continue to promote reform of the economic system, enhance and improve macroeconomic controls, guard against dramatic price fluctuations, curb excessive inflation, standardize market pricing , and achieve equal competition, fair trade, and appropriate operations, we must establish a complete and effective government control system for prices. This new price control system should reflect the demands of the market economy and controls should be focused on maintaining an overall balance in the economy mainly by macroeconomic controls and the object of controls should be the entities and markets that determine prices mainly by indirect controls. Control methods should use mainly economic means and legal means augmented as necessary by administrative means. Establishment of this kind of price control system should be a gradual process of constantly enriching and improving the means of control with the intensification of reform, strengthening economic forces, and perfecting the legal system. It will require a considerable period to be completed. We should base ourselves on the current situation and take into consideration the long-term, center on stable market prices and standard pricing activities, and pay close attention to establishing sound economic means and legal means to control prices. 1) Establish a reserve system for important commodities such as grain, cotton, and petroleum to prepare to engage in the market to guarantee the needs of society when production and supply and demand fluctuate. 2) Establish an adjustment fund for the prices of grains and non-staple foods to be used to level prices when large rises or large falls occur in the prices, and protect production and protect consumption, and stabilize the economy, and legalize the channels of sources and the orientation of uses of the fund through legislative processes. 3) Sound pricing laws and regulations to encourage competition and oppose monopolies; protect legitimate profits and oppose windfall profits; protect appropriate businesses and oppose cheating and gouging and attack fake and inferior goods. Beginning in March of this year, with the agreement of the State Council, the State Planning Commission promulgated and implemented the Regulations for Implementing Clearly Marked Prices for Goods and Services as an important economic regulation to encourage fair market trading, improve the transparency of pricing, and oppose deceptive pricing. 4. Initiate price information services. Price departments at every level should fully utilize current information networks and in accordance with the needs of society extensively collect, collate, and issue price information, and in a timely fashion provide enterprises with the situation and forecast trends on market supply and demand and prices for various important commodities and in various different forms such as engaging price advisors, special consultation, and issuing publications, initiate price information services leading enterprises to organize production and adjust business orientation in accordance with market demands. 5) Enhance enterprise policy direction and business training to help enterprise administrative personnel master market business and sales tactics and price decision skills, and improve their professional qualities. 6) Conduct appropriate administrative intervention for a few important commodities. For essential capital goods and citizens' basic necessities that can easily have price fluctuations, we should conduct necessary and appropriate intervention distinguishing different situations. We can respectively carry out price rise files, price rise declarations, differential profit rate controls, and temporary price limit measures. The recent State Council decision to monitor the prices of twenty commodities and services that are most closely associated with the lives of the masses is a new move to stabilize people's lives and promote reform of the price control system from key variety breakthroughs. It reflected the principle of making indirect controls the mainstay and combining economic means and appropriate administrative intervention to control the frequency and extent of price rises and falls and curb windfall profit activities, and it helps to keep overall prices levels relatively stable. We should combine actual conscientious implementation of various price monitoring measures to better serve the overall situation of reform, development, and stability.
