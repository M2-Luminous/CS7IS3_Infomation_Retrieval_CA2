But if Norway continues to insist on its completely impossible position that it does not have a single fish to give away, it will be Norway and not Spain that is blocking the way for membership," European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp told AFTENPOSTEN. In the midst of yesterday's busy round of negotiations between the EU and the four applicant nations, AFTENPOSTEN was granted an exclusive meeting with an extremely relaxed European affairs minister and his closest aides, Franscisco Elorza and Alberto Navarro. This troika is currently firmly pushing large numbers of Spanish demands in the negotiations with the applicant nations. They are doing so in what seems to be such an uncompromising manner that many observers in Brussels are shaking their heads in resignation and wondering how it is to be at all possible to reach a solution that both the applicants and Spain can accept. However, this practiced Spanish negotiating trio -- long since pointed to in Norway as the archenemy -- gave the appearance of being friendliness itself. With one voice and with a sparkle in the eye, they assured me that they want Norway as a member of the EU, and they insisted on being believed when they claimed that they are willing to negotiate everything. But in the negotiations both sides must make some concessions, and so far they have not seen a single signal of a Norwegian determination to negotiate, they said. "No Norwegian EU membership without fish for Spain," Francisco Elorza said determinedly. He claimed that he has already been in contact with Norway to signal a clear and unambiguous willingness to negotiate, but threw his hands up in a gesture of resignation at what he views as Norwegian implacability. But does Spain really dare block Norwegian membership, if Norway stands up for itself? "We are convinced that we do not need to block membership. Look what happened during the EEA [European Economic Area] negotiations. Eventually the EU won some fish from Norway. Spain had to share this with others. This time we want our own quota from Norway. If it was possible to reach agreement during the EEA negotiations, why not this time too?" Westendorp asked. The Spanish European affairs minister compared Norway and Spain to two trains that are approaching each other at full speed, but that still have time to apply their brakes to prevent a collision. "I do not think that there will be a collision," Westendorp said. He does not rule out the possibility that Spain will be put under great pressure from the other EU countries to abandon its demands. "We could become isolated in the EU, but remember that unanimity is needed to reach a joint position vis-a-vis Norway," he stressed. Westendorp added for safety's sake that the demand for Norwegian quotas is the only Spanish demand in the fisheries field. "Norway also refuses to allow foreign investment in its fishing fleet. This goes completely against the EU's regulations, so here Norway will have to give in," he said. On the other hand Spain has no problems with allowing Norway full duty-free market access for fish and fish products from day one of membership of the EU, Elorza said. Nor has he heard that any other EU countries will oppose this, but does not rule out the possibility that such demands could surface. The difficult topic of yesterday's negotiations with the applicant countries was first and foremost the applicants' demand that parts of their territory should be included among so-called Objective 1 regions and be allocated funds from the EU's structural fund. The EU's formal requirement is that the average income in such regions must not be more than 75 percent of the EU average. The Commission has proposed that the four northernmost Norwegian provinces be entitled to support under this criterion. Spain takes a very different view and claims that there can be no suggestion of agreeing to allowing Finnish Lapland and Norway's four northernmost provinces to receive support under Objective 1. Francisco Elorza made it crystal clear that Spain does not intend to allow Objective 1 to "be polluted," as he put it. "These Norwegian provinces do not meet the requirements." "But you people in Norway will receive financial support nevertheless," he said, smiling. "The point is that this support must be financed via other areas of the EU budget, and must be called something else. Call it a special program or something like that," he suggested. "We in Spain understand extremely well that you have problems in your regions, and we want you to receive money. In the years leading up to 1999 we must find a way to reach a transitional solution. After that, you will be treated in line with other EU countries," he stressed several times. His unspoken point is that Spain is such a major recipient of EU support under Objective 1 that the country does not want new members to help themselves to money from this particular fund. "Remember that here too unanimity is also needed in the EU if a joint position is to be reached," he said meaningfully. On the subject of Norway's demand that it be allowed not to have to adjust agricultural prices from the first day, he said that this is something Spain can understand very well. "Here we will agree to a transitional arrangement. But do not forget one thing: As far as fruit and vegetables are concerned, Spain is demanding full duty-free access to Norway from day one of membership."
