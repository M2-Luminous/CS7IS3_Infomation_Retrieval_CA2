FBIS4-22132 "jptot017__l94072" JPRS-TOT-94-017-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 19 April 1994 WEST EUROPE TURKEY Major Operation Against PKK in Turkey, Iraq Reported Major Operation Against PKK in Turkey, Iraq Reported NC2204133594 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS in English 19 Apr 94 p 2 NC2204133594 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS English BFN [Text] Diyarbakir/Ankara -- Turkish commandos, supported by warplanes and military helicopters, have expanded their operation in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and will remain in the region for a major part of the summer, official sources said on Monday. They said approximately 5,000 troops had already entered Iraq where at least 60 Kurdish separatists have been killed over the past six days. Witnesses in Sirnak said hundreds of paramilitary village guards were aiding the troops amid an intense buildup of soldiers and land vehicles on the Turkish side of the border. Military officials said the cross-border operation targeted camps of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and concentrated on the Sivi and Haftanin regions in northern Iraq, immediately opposite the Turkish towns of Cukurca and Uludere respectively. The crackdown started last week with a massive land and air operation launched on the Gabar mountains and the Mezi border region which the PKK has been using as a main base. Officials said on Sunday that an important rebel depot was discovered on the Gabar mountains and troops had seized nine mortars, seven antiaircraft guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70 antipersonnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000 rounds of ammunition. Over the past weeks, Turkey seized some 400 tons of foodstuff also stockpiled by the PKK. Sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that a majority of Kurdish civilians in the Gabar region had evacuated their homes and crossed the border into northern Iraq. There were unconfirmed claims on Monday that prior to the Turkish crackdown, PKK forces in Gabar had also moved out. Reports coming from the clash zone on Monday said that while land and air operations continued in Shive and Haftanin, air force jets and helicopter gunships had attacked PKK hideouts in the mountainous region of Derkar and in Kanimasi. Officials said the operation within Iraq would continue until operations in southeastern Turkey came to an end. One source, who asked not to be identified, pointed out that the logistic support lines of the PKK were being cut and the presence of Turkish forces in the border area, some five kilometers into Iraq, prevented militants from entering Turkey or escaping to the Kurdish-controlled area. Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security personnel including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers and village guards to fight the separatists there. Sources in Diyarbakir said on Monday that new military trucks were arriving in the region every day with weaponry being deployed to the flat areas around the Iraqi border, close to the southeastern province of Sirnak. Meanwhile, a newspaper has said that all military forces in Sirnak were attached to a division under the command of Gen. Orhan Gencler. Sabah newspaper said on Monday that the number of brigades in the region had been increased to four, including one armored brigade. Terrorism experts in the capital, Ankara, believe Turkey's armed campaign in the Southeast will gain momentum until August in the form of a pre-emptive strike against the rebels before they launch their own "summer offensive." Turkish Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures promised earlier that the PKK would be crushed by this summer at the latest and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that Turkey has no alternative but to break the backbone of terrorism. At least 11,000 people, including hundreds of Kurdish civilians, have died in the 10-year-old conflict during which human rights violations have escalated on both sides.
