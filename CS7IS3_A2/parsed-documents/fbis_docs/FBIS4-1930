It was presided over by the convener, Interior Minister Wu Po-hsiung. At the meeting, participants provisionally decided to build a communications equipment station and weather station on Taiping Island [Spratly Island]. However, in discussing the most critical issue of building an airfield on the island, the participants chose to await further assessment before making a decision, arguing the airfield will be restricted by several factors: The runway will be only 1.5 km long; the construction cost is high; the type of aircraft able to land and take off is limited; and the airfield will only serve "non military aircraft."
