The ceremony was attended by FAPC members Home Affairs Minister Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, National Planning and Economic Development Minister Brigadier General Abel, Foreign Affairs Minister U Ohn Gyaw, Attorney General U Tha Tun, SLORC Office Director General Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, and Myanmar [Burmese] ambassadors, directors general, officers, and staff of the Foreign Ministry. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that personnel from the Foreign Ministry know very well that the SLORC has given special consideration to international relations and has accordingly worked for Myanmar [Burma] to have a good image in the international community. The SLORC, which took on the responsibilities of the state on 18 September 1988, in its Announcement No. 3/88 of that day stated that the Union of Myanmar will continue to pursue an independent and active foreign policy. Everybody knows, he noted, that the SLORC has implemented its foreign policy with straightforwardness and dignity in the area of international relations since then. He also noted, that it [the SLORC] has faced and steadfastly overcome -- and is still steadfastly overcoming -- threats, impasses, allegations, pressures, and tensions so as not to deviate from its independent and active foreign policy. [passage omitted on diplomatic principles and rejoining Nonaligned Movement] He remarked that Myanmar has constantly opposed allegations based on the original fixed standard of human rights, which is without any regard to a country's significant historical, cultural, religious, and traditional backgrounds. Khin Nyunt explained that Myanmar has already accepted human rights standards in accordance with its own cultural and traditional background and these standards are the main consideration for the Myanmar people. He noted that, although the contribution of labor is a noble deed in Myanmar tradition, western tradition eyes it as forced labor and a violation of human rights. Next, he observed that Myanmar is working together with United Nations human rights organizations to show Myanmar's sincere desire to cooperate with international organizations concerning human rights. [passage omitted on cooperation with UNHCR, neighboring countries, and international organizations] Continuing, Lt. Gen Khin Nyunt explained that the SLORC, in order to effectively and extensively implement matters relating to foreign affairs, has formed the FAPC with responsible personnel from the government. He explained that the FAPC has been responsible for important policy matters concerning international relations. Next, he noted that the SLORC has reorganized the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control and has stepped up its efforts with increased momentum on drug eradication. [passage omitted on formation of border development committee, drug eradication efforts, and formation of environmental protection committee] He remarked that the damage to Myanmar's image caused by allegations based on human rights, drug eradication, and environmental protection matters can be repaired if the current achievements are made known to the international community. He noted that the main duty of the Foreign Ministry service personnel is to inform the international circle about the accomplishments, the government's stance, and its goodwill. [passage omitted on activities of information committee] He stated, only when one knows the true facts about one's country can one be able to explain it to others. Khin Nyunt urged the foreign service personnel to study more about the country's true facts and to explain those genuine conditions when opportunity arises for the benefit of the country. [passage omitted on national convention, economic reforms, economic plans, personal affairs of foreign service personnel, national objectives, national reconciliation, and border development] He explained that he was saddened to hear that some armed organizations have not only neglected the country's goodwill gesture for national reconciliation but have been planning to create obstacles for the country. He noted that these organizations have accepted assistance from countries and organizations which are trying to influence Myanmar, and are drawing up plans and trying to humiliate and tarnish Myanmar's image on the international stage. He remarked that they have approached foreign governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations and have given them fabricated news concerning Myanmar; they have drawn up and engaged in plans to create difficulties, to exert pressure, to impose political and economic sanctions, and finally to isolate Myanmar from the international community. He said that they are using all kinds of ways to influence various international organizations. In implementing their plans, they have arranged talks and seminars at foreign universities and among intellectuals, and have approached organizations that present awards. Khin Nyunt explained that it can be clearly seen that they have now even reached the international organization level by using human rights as a leading tool. He noted that since these organizations are using diplomatic and other means to implement their plans, the state [Myanmar] will also have to use the right diplomatic approach to let the world know of the state's constructive views. He stated that last year a special delegation was sent to several countries to explain Myanmar's stance, objective, and achievements. [passage omitted on diplomatic code of conduct, and cooperation among departments] Finally, Khin Nyunt urged foreign service personnel to abide by the diplomatic code of conduct in performing their duties and responsibilities, to let the world know about the state's objectives and accomplishments, to uphold the dignity of a diplomat and abstain from activities that would tarnish the country's status, to safeguard Myanmar culture and traditions and to be patriotic, to be loyal to the country and the people, to adhere to the public services code of conduct and to fulfill the national duties of a citizen, and to work for the betterment of the country and the people with a spirit of unity. The ceremony concluded at 0900.
