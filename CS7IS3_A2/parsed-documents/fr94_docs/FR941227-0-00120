ACTION: Final rule. _ SUMMARY: This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to implement provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;329, September 30, 1994). The Act eliminates the fixed statutory ceilings on mileage reimbursement rates for advantageous use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) on official business travel, and allows the Administrator of General Services to establish the rates based on cost investigations. This amendment is intended to provide equitable reimbursement to a Federal employee for advantageous use of a POV on official business travel by increasing the mileage reimbursement rates to reflect current costs per mile of operating a POV; and by increasing the mileage reimbursement rates for use of a POV in lieu of a Government-furnished vehicle (GFV) to reflect current costs to an agency of operating a GFV. DATES: This final rule is effective January 1, 1995, and applies to travel performed on or after January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Clauson, General Services Administration, Transportation Management Division (FBX), Washington, DC 20406, telephone 703&hyph;305&hyph;5745. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to establish increased mileage reimbursement rates for use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) while performing official business travel. Mileage reimbursement rates for advantageous use of a POV have been constrained by statute at 25 cents per mile for a privately owned automobile (established in June 1991), 45 cents per mile for a privately owned airplane (established in October 1980), and 20 cents per mile for a privately owned motorcycle (established in October 1980) even though cost studies have indicated that higher reimbursement rates were necessary to adequately reimburse the cost of operating a POV. Section 634 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;329, September 30, 1994) eliminated the fixed statutory caps and allows the Administrator of General Services to establish mileage reimbursement rates based on cost investigations which the General Services Administration (GSA) is required under 5 U.S.C. 5707(b)(1) to periodically conduct and report to Congress. Under the new law, the mileage reimbursement rate for advantageous use of a privately owned automobile may not exceed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) business standard mileage rate in any year the IRS establishes such a single rate. GSA has reported the results of its November 1994 cost investigation to Congress and indicated that the governing regulation would be revised to increase the mileage allowance for advantageous use of a privately owned automobile from 25 cents per mile to 30 cents per mile, for use of a privately owned airplane from 45 cents per mile to 88.5 cents per mile, and for use of a privately owned motorcycle from 20 cents per mile to 24.5 cents per mile. Additionally, based on updated data reflecting current costs to an agency of operating a GFV, GSA has increased the two-tiered reimbursement rates for use of a POV instead of a GFV from 18 cents to 23.5 cents per mile and from 9.5 cents to 10.5 cents per mile. GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993. This final rule is not required to be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.
