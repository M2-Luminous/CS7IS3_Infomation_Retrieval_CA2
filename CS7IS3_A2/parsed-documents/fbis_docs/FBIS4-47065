The Question of Moving the Republic Capital to Akmola (the Former Virgin Lands Capital) Is Brought to the Level of the Supreme Legislative Body"] [Text] It was Nursultan Nazarbayev who last Thursday asked people's deputies to make this decision. His main argument: "It is much more convenient to run the republic from the center rather than from the southern outskirts." The president pointed to the overpopulation of Almaty and the adverse ecological situation. It is true that the current capital already has one and a half times more inhabitants than it is designed to accommodate, plus tens of thousands of visitors daily, including from the far and near abroad. Considerable areas of agricultural land that previously fed the city already have been allocated for Almaty's development. As to the environment, over the past year the oxygen content in the capital's atmosphere has decreased by 2 percent. According to specialists' calculations, Almaty needs an additional 1 million trees to maintain optimum air quality, but the number, unfortunately, continues to decline. The capital's "lungs" are sick, negatively affecting the condition of even healthy people. There is also growing concern about potential destructive earthquakes, since the formation of the relatively young Alatau mountains continues. All this is true, but let us return to the key point--the need to relocate the republic leadership headquarters from the southern outskirts closer to the center. One can discern not only administrative-economic aspects in this, but also serious political ones. Moving a capital had been and continues to be part of world practice. Recall how Lenin moved his headquarters from Petrograd's Smolnyy to the Moscow Kremlin. In the united Germany the capital is now returning to Berlin. But in our case the analogy is hardly appropriate, since Akmola at this point is no more than an oblast center. True, this was the potential intention of the great liberalizer Nikita Khrushchev. He was not able to see it through, however. Now at the new stage of Kazakh history, in the conditions of national sovereignty, the question of moving the capital to Akmola is being brought again into the realm of practical decisions. At this point it is hard to predict what the position of the people's deputies will be, and whether they will support the president's proposal or will try to find a compromise solution. We, on the other hand, would like to recall that ABV ("Akmola Is More Dear to Us Than Berlin to the Germans," No. 43, 2 November 1993) has already discussed the issue of moving the capital of Kazakhstan. And emphasized at the time that this very costly undertaking will cost our taxpayers $10 billion at minimum. If we compare these figures with the revenue part of the republic's budget last year, our compatriots will have to work hard for at least five years just to pay to move the capital to Akmola. But in addition to financial problems a whole set of other issues arises, which cannot be left out, either.
