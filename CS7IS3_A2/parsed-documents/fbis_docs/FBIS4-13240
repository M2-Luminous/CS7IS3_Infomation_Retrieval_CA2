[passage omitted] Responsible government sources have told AL-HAYAH that the government "had decided to close Hamas' offices in Amman" and ban its informational activities before Rabin made his threats. The sources pointed out that the government considered that step "an internal matter in harmony with Jordan's policy which sees the PLO as the only party empowered to speak for the Palestinian people." They stressed that the official authorities "have not and will not take any measures" against Hamas representative in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal or its official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, "because the two are Jordanian citizens who abide by the country's current Constitution and laws." The same sources pointed out that "despite Jordan's affirmation that neither Nazzal nor Ghawshah had anything to do with the planning and execution of military operations in the occupied territory, we will allow no one to exploit their statements in the media to undermine Jordan."
