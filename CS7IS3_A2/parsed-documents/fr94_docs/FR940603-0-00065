FR940603-0-00065 FR940603-0-00025 Response: The regulations state that ``critical habitat shall not be designated within foreign countries or in other areas outside of the United States jurisdiction'' (50 CFR 424.12(h)). The critical habitat designation falls within the 200 mile exclusive economic zone of the United States, and therefore is not outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Furthermore, critical habitat designation may impact the activities of Federal agencies, which are defined as ``all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas'' (50 CFR 402.02). Comment 10: Several commenters suggested that the northern boundary of the critical habitat, as recommended by the Recovery Team and proposed by NMFS (58 FR 29186, May 19, 1993), be extended further northward to 32 â—‹ N latitude, approximately the mouth of the Savannah River. Based on data examined since the Recovery Team reviewed and recommended the critical habitat boundaries that were proposed in the critical habitat designation, the commenter stated that sightings corrected for effort (i.e., the number of right whales counted per survey mile since 1984) indicate that the number of right whales per mile of transect off St. Catherines Island, GA, was comparable to the number observed off Melbourne and Daytona Beach, FL, and greater than that off St. Augustine, FL, areas within the proposed critical habitat. Several other commenters requested that no extension of the critical habitat include the mouth of the Savannah River be incorporated into a final designation until verified information on the presence of the right whale is publicly provided and a public hearing is held in Savannah, GA, so that the public can have an opportunity to comment. They further urged that any boundary modification be justified on firm scientific grounds, showing significant benefits to right whale recovery. Response: NMFS believes that the most important winter/calving areas known are within the boundaries identified as critical habitat in the proposed rule. The greatest number and highest densities of right whales have been observed in the Cape Canaveral region, with the second highest number occurring at the Georgia-Florida border. It is clear, however, that northern right whales occur outside this area, including near the mouth of the Savannah River, during the winter calving period and during their late-winter/spring migration northward. The monitoring conducted around the mouth of the Savannah River during 1992/1993, and the near-daily monitoring conducted during the winter of 1993/1994 from Savannah south throughout the SEUS to approximately Jacksonville, FL, can be used to examine this issue. In these 2 years of monitoring near the mouth of the Savannah River (total approximately 90 days, 20 in 1992/1993 and approximately 70 thus far in 1993/1994) only four right whales have been sighted. The first sighting, on December 12, 1993, was of three whales moving south. These whales were resighted the following day near Brunswick, GA. The second and third sightings were also followed by resightings off Brunswick. In these cases, the time between resightings was only a few days, indicating that the whales were not remaining near the Savannah River but traveling through the area toward the core of the sighting distribution. Based on these data, NMFS sees no need to include the area as critical habitat at this time. NMFS recognizes that the sighting data is based on only 2 years of information, and that distributions between years can vary dramatically. NMFS will continually examine sighting data and may modify critical habitat boundaries in the future if warranted by additional sighting information. Comment 11: One commenter suggested that there is a lack of data offered by NMFS supporting the presence of a substantial right whale population off the Cape Canaveral Florida coast (south of False Cape). The commenter cited information in the Recovery Plan for the Northern Right Whale, which indicates that only four sightings within the 5nm proposed habitat have been recorded south of the False Cape area prior to 1989, and questioned whether this is sufficient data on which to base a designation. Response: The lack of sightings at the southern end of the designated SEUS area is explained, at least in part, by low sampling effort in that area. Sightings corrected for effort indicate that the area around Cape Canaveral may be used by right whales to a greater extent than presented by Kraus and Kenney (1991) and discussed in the Recovery Plan. The data do not support removal of the area from consideration. Given the need to monitor and manage activities that might impact northern right whales in the area of Cape Canaveral, NMFS believes that it is appropriate to designate this area as critical habitat. The seasonal use, and extent of use, of any area will be considered during the ESA section 7 process on a case-by-case basis, but at present the area in question represents the southern limit to the only known calving area for this species, and is therefore considered critical. Comment 12: Another Federal agency supported the proposed designation and submitted comments from the particular perspectives of the Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS) and the recently designated Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS). The GRNMS lies to the north and east of the proposed critical habitat boundary in coastal Georgia; and the commenter recommended that the boundary of the proposed critical habitat be extended northward and seaward to include GRNMS. The commenter stated that Grays Reef is particularly vital to the critical habitat designation because the waters off Georgia and northern Florida serve as calving grounds for this species. The commenter also stated that personnel at GRNMS could provide additional resources for observing and monitoring these whales as part of the Sanctuary's routine operations, as well as provide substantial support to the education and outreach objectives listed in the Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan. The commenter continued by stating that the recently designated SBNMS overlaps slightly with the proposed critical habitat area (at the northern end of CCB). The commenter felt that the proposed designation, in conjunction with the implementation of the SBNMS, would provide additional opportunities for coordinated efforts to enhance the potential for recovery of this critically endangered marine species. Also, some or all of the ``special management considerations or protections'' identified in the proposed designation as being potentially required to protect and promote the recovery of the northern right whale population using the Stellwagen Bank environment (i.e., vessel traffic, fishing, pollution, mining and gas exploration) are also addressed by the SBNMS management plan. With the exception of fishing, these activities are currently either regulated directly, or are listed as subject to sanctuary regulation.
