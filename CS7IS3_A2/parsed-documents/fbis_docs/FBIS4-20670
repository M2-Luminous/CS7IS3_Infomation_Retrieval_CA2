It stabilized an electron beam in orbit and achieved the world's highest level storage ring current of 1,215 milliamperes. Productivity can be increased when the radiation is used for semiconductor fine processing applications because, the larger the current value, the stronger the radiation that can be obtained. It is expected that, when the related technologies are made ready, processing at a higher speed than that of the current ultra-violet exposure method can be done. The experiment was done at a 16.8 meter-circumference small-scale system called "Super-ALIS," installed in NTT's LSI research facility. An electron beam accelerated to a high speed was deflected by superconducting magnets, causing the emission of radiation. Up until now, the current value was 500 milliamperes. This improvement was made by such measures as (1) removing the excess electromagnetic field made by electrons that had completed the prior orbit and (2) devising the structure of the magnets to control the adverse effects caused by residual gases inside the system. As a superconducting, small-scale system, this has the highest current value in the world, even including the large-scale systems using ordinary conducting magnets. It is comparable to the system at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States, which has 1,200 milliamperes.
