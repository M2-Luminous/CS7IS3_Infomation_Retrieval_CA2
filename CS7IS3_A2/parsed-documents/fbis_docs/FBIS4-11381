FBIS4-11381 "drlat080_m_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Brazil Ipen Employees Reportedly Contaminated by Radiation Ipen Employees Reportedly Contaminated by Radiation PY2604013394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 23 Apr 94 p 8 PY2604013394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] Sao Paulo -- The Sao Paulo State Attorney's Office will investigate charges that 11 members of the Institute for Nuclear and Energy Research (Ipen) in Sao Paulo have been contaminated by radioactive material while working at one of the Ipen laboratories, which is controlled by the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN). The Association of Ipen Employees (Assipen) and the Federal Employees Union in Sao Paulo (Sindisef) have stated that the Ipen employees -- five women and six men who operated machinery at the pharmaceuticals laboratory -- were contaminated by breathing Iodine- 131. Ipen employees' representatives have reported that the contamination was detected through tests last month. Assipen Director Claudio Manoel Constancio said that the employees had a hormonal dysfunction in their thyroid glands, and that some of them had nodules and cysts in their glands. According to Constancio, Iodine-131 causes thyroid hyperactivity. CNEN Radioprotection Director Laercio Vinhas yesterday reported by fax that the thyroid dysfunctions detected in the employees have no relation whatsoever with their work at the laboratory and that this problem is detected in 3 percent of the overall population. Vinhas added that only seven workers, and not 11, have been given sick leave because medical literature does not prohibit people with thyroid dysfunctions from working with iodine mixtures. The affected employees refused to comment on the issue and, according to the Assipen director, fear retaliation by the company. Constancio said that the CNEN and Ipen have maintained absolute secrecy about the subject. Prosecutors who work for the Job Accidents Division of the Attorney General's Office have already summoned the company's superintendent, Spero Penha Morato, to clarify the situation during a meeting to be held on 2 May. The employees' representatives want doctors and experts of the Fundacentro, an organization linked to the Labor Ministry that is responsible for controlling workers' health, to examine the Ipen facilities at the Sao Paulo University campus.
