The news analyst says: It was Japan that responded to the South Korean puppets' call most nimbly. The South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries seek a sinister political purpose in crying for the creation of the "forum". Through the "forum" and "dialogue" they intend to create the impression that the DPRK is isolated internationally and impair the image of our dignified republic. The very ones posing a grave threat to the peace and security of Northeast Asia are the United States, and Japan and South Korea. Beefing up aggression forces in and around South Korea, the United States is screwing up tensions and threatening a military attack on the DPRK. And it is well known a fact that the South Korean puppets are zealously joining the United States in this racket. The Japanese reactionaries are speeding up the conversion of Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and employing every conceivable means to stage a comeback to Korea. The ASEAN members and Asian and Pacific nations are expressing concern over this situation. Through "forum" and "dialogue", the South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries intend to cover up their criminal acts in threatening the peace and security of Northeast Asia and inveigle other Asian and Pacific nations into the anti-DPRK campaign. What is needed for the peace and security of northeast Asia is to check the U.S. moves of aggression and war in the region as well as the Japanese reactionaries' drive for the conversion of Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and its reinvasion moves, and the South Korean puppets' anti-DPRK campaign.
