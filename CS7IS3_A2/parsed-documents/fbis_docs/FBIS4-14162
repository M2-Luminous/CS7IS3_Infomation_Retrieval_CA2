He was met at Cairo Airport by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Embassy staff. As soon as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived, a ceremony was held at Cairo airport to deliver vehicles, given as the first part of American assistance to the Palestinian police force. The vehicles were received by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, in the presence of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and senior Palestinian Embassy staff. In a speech, Musa said: Christopher's presence gives us a chance to welcome him, especially at this important stage in which we are working to end the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. Musa said he was happy to be joining the U.S. secretary of state and representatives of the Palestinian people in celebrating the delivery of the first American contribution to the Palestinian police. The celebration indicates that all parties are ready to put the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles into practice, he said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he was glad to return to Egypt. I am looking forward to meeting President Mubarak again and also 'Amr Musa, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, he said. He added that he was happy with the arrival of the first American contribution to the Palestinian police. The police, he said, will be a basic factor in implementing the Declaration of Principles. He said the United States is sure of this and will help the Palestinian police force perform its duty in Gaza and Jericho. Christopher pointed out that the American assistance includes 200 vehicles and spare parts, 100 pickup trucks, 50 personnel carriers, and 50 bulldozers. He said the rest of the equipment will arrive in the next few weeks. Christopher said the donation, which also includes 2,300 blankets and 1,800 pair of shoes, shows that the implementation is taking place. It is also a good sign that the Israelis and the Palestinians are moving ahead with the negotiations to reach agreement for peace in the region, he said. During the implementation, Christopher noted, the tragedy can be forgotten and the creation of a new climate based on mutual respect can be started. This step will be the response to attempts by the extremists to harm peace, he added. He thanked the Israeli Government for giving the donor states the chance to provide assistance to the Palestinian police. He also thanked and hailed President Husni Mubarak for his important role in the peace process and the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. In conclusion, Christopher said he hoped the Palestinians would use the equipment to achieve its objective of bringing about peace and reconciliation in the region. Dr. Nabil Sha'th delivered a speech. On behalf of the PLO and the Palestinian police, he thanked the United States and Christopher for their valuable assistance. He noted the importance of that assistance for implementing the agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, on the entry of the police force to Gaza and Jericho. Sha'th said: We will remember 13 September 1993, the day the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and will remember that two weeks later, the U.S. President invited the donor states to meet. Those states pledged to provide $2.4 billion to the Palestinian authority to implement the agreement. He added: As a representative of the Palestinians, who for a long time lacked peace and freedom, I would like to emphasize that these vehicles will be used to ensure security for the Palestinians so that they can work in peace to build their homeland, of which they are proud. He stressed that the Palestinian police will respect human rights, freedom, and democracy, and will serve as a factor of peace and stability to ensure the well-being of the Palestinian people. Sha'th thanked President Mubarak and the Egyptian people for Egypt's great support for the Palestinian people, backing of the Palestinian negotiators, and help in deploying the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho. He also thanked Norway for its role and the U.S. secretary of state, who came to deliver the assistance. He stressed the Palestinians' pledge to achieve the peace that serves the Palestinian people and the peoples of the region.
