"This is an ordinary crime," the press service said, relying on a conclusion made by competent interior officials. At 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, an explosive device went off in a Zhiguli car parked in the yard of a house located in the Osenny Boulevard, 12, block 2. The explosion killed a driver of the "Oton" trade company who lived there, and "a criminal boss" was injured. The criminal was hospitalized. Two more girls, aged 8 and 10, were injured. The explosion was presumably targeted at the "criminal element", interior officials said. The incident occurred at a distance of one kilometer from a new city residence of the Russian president. Neither Boris Yeltsin, nor his family are living in the new house yet.
