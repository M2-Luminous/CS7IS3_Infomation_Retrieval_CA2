Imports charged to these category limits, except Category 218, for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive. Goods in Category 239 which are exported in excess of the 1993 Group II limit shall be charged to the 1994 limit for Category 239. In a subsequent directive, CITA will direct the Commissioner of Customs to deduct these charges from the 1994 limit for Category 239 and charge these same amounts to the 1994 Group II limit. Import charges already made to Group II for Category 239 for the 1994 monitoring period (see directive dated December 2, 1993) shall be deducted from Group II and charged to the limit established in this directive for Category 239. For goods exported and imported during the period January 1, 1994 through February 28, 1994, you are directed to charge 231,566 square meters to the limit established in this directive for Category 218. The conversion factors for merged Categories 359&hyph;H/659&hyph;H and 638/639 are 11.5 and 12.96, respectively. In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). ␣␣Sincerely, Ronald I.
