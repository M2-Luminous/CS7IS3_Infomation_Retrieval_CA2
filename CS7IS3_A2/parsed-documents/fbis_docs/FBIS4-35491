During a news conference today, Intelligence Minister 'Ali Akbar Fallahian said: Since implementation of the new policy on foreign currency, eight gangs involved in the illegal purchase, accumulation, and smuggling of hard currency abroad have been arrested and handed over to the judicial officials. Referring to Iraqi provocations to create terror inside Iran, he said: During the past four months, the Iraqi Ba'thist regime, in pursuit of its particular objectives, has exported some sabotage gangs and has resorted to planting bombs in Iran, in particular. However, thanks to efforts of the intelligence forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, two high-ranking Iraqi intelligence officers have been arrested inside our country. He added: These two intelligence officers, named Ra'd Mustafa Fattah and Arkan 'Abd al-Amir 'Ali, have confessed to their mission, including the import of explosives to Iran. The intelligence minister pointed out: Four Iranians who have been cooperating with the Iraqi intelligence officers have been arrested and have confessed that they were involved in intelligence work. Stressing that the Iraqi regime intends to depict our country as insecure by detonating bombs in Iran, Mr. Fallahian went on: During the past four months, 22 bombs have been imported into the country by Iraqi elements. In addition to the arrest of the above people, 14 bombs have been discovered. About the latest investigations on the discovery of a microphone in our country's London Embassy, the intelligence minister said: The dimensions of this espionage affair are not limited to the discovery of a microphone alone, and we have not divulged all of the issues yet. A country's embassy is regarded as its territory in accordance with international regulations, and they have violated our sovereignty while the British press unanimously presents the issue as a normal occurrence. Another issue mentioned by the intelligence minister was the return of the Iranians living abroad. He said: Iranians living abroad can take advantage of the facilities we have provided for them. About the plot to assassinate the President on 1 February 1994, marking the anniversary of Khomeyni's return to Iran, Intelligence Minister Fallahian said: Investigations on this matter are still continuing.
