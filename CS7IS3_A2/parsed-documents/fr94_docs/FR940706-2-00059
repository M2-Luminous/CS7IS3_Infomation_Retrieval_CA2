Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure by Respondents to comply with this Order. B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A of this Order, MMD shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authorities, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of MMD, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If MMD has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to MMD of the identity of any proposed trustee, MMD shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to enter into an Agreement as specified in Paragraph II of this Order. 3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, MMD shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to enter into the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order. 4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph III.B.3 to terminate any prior Agreement and to enter into the Agreement specified in Paragraph II of this Order, which Agreement shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve (12) month period the trustee has submitted a plan or believes that the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order can be entered into within a reasonable time, the twelve (12) month period may be extended by the Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission my extend the twelve (12) month period only two (2) time and for no longer than twelve (12) months each time. 5.

Respondents shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's ability to enter into the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order. Any delays in entering into the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order caused by Respondents shall extend the time under Paragraph III.B.4 for entering into the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for the court-appointed trustee by the court. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to MMD's absolute and unconditional obligation to enter into the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order at no minimum price. The Agreement shall be made in the manner and with a Potential New Entrant as set out in Paragraph II of this Order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one Potential New Entrant, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such Potential New Entrant, the trustee shall enter into an Agreement as required by Paragraph II of this Order with the Potential New Entrant selected by MMD from among those approved by the Commission.
