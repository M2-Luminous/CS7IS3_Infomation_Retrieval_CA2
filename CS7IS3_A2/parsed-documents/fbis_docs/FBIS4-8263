He said that he had signed the new labor law amendment into law on Saturday because it did not hurt employees nor conflict with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or any international agreements. He said he'd received numerous letters asking him not to sign the law "from various unions, the Helsinki Committee, and other institutions," but decided he "could sign this law with a clean and peaceful conscience." Union objections, he said, would unleash "mistrust in the independence, self-awareness, and responsibility of people, of employees," and added that collective agreements between employees and employers existed to further protect workers' rights. Havel also pointed out that this was the 17th amendment to the labor law overall and already the tenth since November 1989, "so that if this or that one doesn't pass the test, it can be changed with the help of more amendments."
