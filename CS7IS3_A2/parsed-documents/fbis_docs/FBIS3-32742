Otherwise, he said, the president must assume this responsibility. [Begin recording] [Belmont] I am calling on the government to carry out these projects. I also want to challenge the government: If Legislative Decree No. 776 is repealed, I will complete and dedicate all promised projects before 1995 is over. If the municipality does not carry out these projects, then the government must do it, because these funds belong to Lima citizens. The people of Lima have made great efforts to pay their taxes to complete these works, which will help Lima become the great city we all dream of and want to see. [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility of charging the government if it does not carry out the projects already under way? [Belmont] If the government refuses to carry out the projects already awarded and behaves like a dog in a manger, which does not eat nor lets anyone else eat -- not the mayor, because in this case he is not pocketing the funds -- Lima will lose, because the government does not want Lima to be successful.
