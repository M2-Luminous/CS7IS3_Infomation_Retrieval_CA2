The Lebanese official sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. request was in fact a hint and that the Lebanese officials just listened to the U.S. requests and hints and only said that they were waiting for matters to become clearer on the other tracks and for the situation to calm down on the military front and for an end to the Israeli escalations. Official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. reaction to that Lebanese position was advice "not to wait" because the waiting policy is futile. The sources added that the U.S. side did not conceal its view that the Lebanese policy of waiting for progress on the Syrian track is "provoking the Israelis." The official sources pointed out that the Americans believe that matters are proceeding acceptably on the Syrian and Jordanian tracks and are making some progress and that, therefore, it would be natural to resume negotiations on the Lebanese track. The Lebanese officials, however, prefer to make sure that all is well on the Syrian track before taking any stand on the resumption of negotiations on the Lebanese track. The Lebanese official sources said that the U.S. side has for some time been asking Lebanon to revive the negotiation sessions in Washington but Lebanon's policy has been one of waiting until progress is made before taking any steps in that respect. The official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. request, which was passed on along with the Israeli ultimatum that "a relentless war" would be waged on Lebanon and all Hizballah positions in Lebanon if the latter retaliated to the raid on al-Biqa' with suicide operations inside [Israel] and abroad, was what prompted President Ilyas al-Hirawi to say in a speech last Thursday that "we will not single anyone out and will not allow anyone to single us out," and which prompted Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri to say yesterday that Syria was the target of the aggression on al-Biqa', and also prompted Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to declare the rejection of separate peace. Official sources say that there is increasing pressure on Syria in connection with the negotiations, the aim being to isolate it in order to soften its position by luring Jordan into the bilateral negotiations, but that would in practice be very difficult to do with Lebanon.
