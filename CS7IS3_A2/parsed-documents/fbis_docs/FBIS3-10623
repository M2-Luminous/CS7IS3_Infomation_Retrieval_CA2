Through this document, which is normally used when one is in the middle of negotiations or to discuss political subjects, Brazil is already consulting Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay about their disposition to extend the trade liberation system to other countries in the region like the Andean Pact (Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia) or individual partners like Chile. This suggestion will be discussed on 9 March during a Mercosur meeting in Buenos Aires. Ever since it was launched last October and presented as a proposal during the Aladi [Latin American Integration Association] meeting in February, the proposal has been discussed openly (and apparently well received) by the governments of Colombia and Venezuela. The argument for the proposal is that Mercosur must be open and not exclude anyone and that, if discussed within a legal framework similar to the European Common Market, the solution of commercial issues among South American countries will allow a rapid increase in trade. The Brazilian Government's proposal is to create a free trade zone that will be ruled by the principle of promoting the liberalization of "substantially all trade" [preceding three words in English], an expression used by GATT: It includes all products in general, excluding only those regarded as sensitive by two parties. The Brazilian proposal covers an estimated 80 percent of goods and services. According to the explanation Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim gave those attending the ALADI meeting, ALCSA's objective would be to rapidly free trade between the region's countries in a period of not more than 10 years, between 1995 and 2005. "According to the Brazilian proposal, the ALCSA agreements would basically consist of programs for direct, automatic, and progressive tax reductions and cover substantive trade areas. In our opinion, tax reductions must necessarily take place in differentiated deadlines and paces that must be in keeping with the degree of economic development. We also believe free trade talks should be focused on merchandise and the tariff and non-tariff fields," Amorim said then, adding that negotiations would thus become more agile and the accords would be approved in order to allow the liberalization of trade starting in January 1995. Brazil, for example, could negotiate specific agreements alone where its Mercosur partners do not have direct interests. The Brazilian Government believes its proposal will be accepted because it simply extends to other partners a practice used constantly during the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations, where Brazil upheld the principle of accepting or rejecting proposals by other countries only after consulting its Mercosur partners. The proposal also aims at repeating, with other countries and groups in the region, the Mercosur "miracle" that allowed the country to increase by three-fold its exports to the region between 1990 and 1993. Itamaraty believes the key to Mercosur's success lies in the decision to give up discussing the tariff issue product by product for a broader direct tariff reduction. What remains to be done now is to broaden the area of action and reap the benefits. At dawn on 6 March, during the program "Critica & Autocritica" ["Criticism and Self-Criticism"] (produced by GAZETA MERCANTIL and aired by Television Bandeirantes), Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: "South America is the priority issue of Brazil's foreign policy." If South America had a geopolitical importance in the past, according to the foreign minister, it now also has an economic importance: Brazilian trade with the region (including Mexico) already represents 25 percent of its total trade, which is equivalent to the trade with the entire European Union and more than the 20 percent trade with the United States and 16 percent with the Asian and Pacific countries. Brazil, unlike Argentina, does not intend to reveal any intention to join NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Last week Argentine President Carlos Menem announced that in June he will begin negotiations in this direction. During the "Critica & Autocritica" program, Foreign Minister Amorim clearly stated that the Brazilian Government regards the Argentine Government's initiative as a political initiative. Technically, he explained, any negotiation for a Mercosur member to join NAFTA should be carried out by the four Mercosur member countries, according to the "Four Plus One" principle. The foreign minister again insisted that there is no disagreement with Argentina. Even the recent increase of Argentine military expenditures with the purchase of weapons (particularly the Skyhawk aircraft from the United States) -- which according to Argentina is to replace old equipment -- did not cause any concern. Amorim commented that "if rivalry did exist we would have not reached a nuclear agreement," referring to the four-party, all-encompassing nuclear safeguard agreement between Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, an agreement for mutual control signed in 1991 in Vienna and approved in early February by the Brazilian Senate. This same agreement, which sets the ground for a better relationship with Argentina as well as Germany, may have played an important role, according to Celso Amorim, in solving problems on another front, bilateral relations with the United States. Expressions of greater confidence in the country, such as that by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who last week suspended U.S. investigations regarding Brazil under the so-called Super 301 law after acknowledging the Brazilian commitment to approve its intellectual property protection draft bill, represent a more broad-minded tendency, the foreign minister believes. "The United States wants the Brazilian economy to be successful. It is the largest Latin America country, with which the United States has the greatest trade volume after Mexico, and where U.S. exports have increased significantly," Amorim commented. The fact that Brazil is trying to stabilize its economy also had its impact on this change of attitude by the United States, which gave signs that commercials sanctions would be applied until a few days before the final decision. The minister said: "The effort to stabilize the Brazilian economy was decisive."
