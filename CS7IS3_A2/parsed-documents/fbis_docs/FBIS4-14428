Nekrasov, chairman of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Electoral Commission, has made a sensational statement: In District No. 3, where, among other candidates, Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor D. Bednyakov was running for the Oblast Legislative Assembly, facts concerning the falsification of the election results have been uncovered. Furthermore, this was done with the participation of D. Bednyakov and other officials. Staffers of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office are now investigating this unusual case. District No. 3 for the elections to the Oblast Legislative Assembly has 30 electoral precincts; 65,000 voters live here. On the day of the elections, 27 March, 17,611 ballot papers were given out; the voter turnout was over 27 percent. But, as we know, the definitive results of the ballot are determined by the number of ballot papers which are deemed to be valid. Unfortunately, there was a "shortfall" here, and this district clearly did not reach the necessary 25 percent. "In all, for various reasons, 1,655 ballot papers were deemed invalid, that is, almost one-tenth of the number issued," A. Nekrasov said. "Incidentally, we had obtained all this information by computer communication from the district electoral commission the day before, and that is why the elections here were deemed invalid." There followed actions which can not be called anything except the most gross violation of legality, A. Nekrasov went on. Under pressure from D. Bednyakov and with the active participation of G. Sokolnikov, head of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon Administration, his deputy, Zh. Bolshakova, and Ye. Boyarintseva, head of the organizational section at the rayon administration, all the ballot papers were unpacked. Of course, the officials, trying to please their chief at any cost, were primarily interested in the ballot papers which were deemed invalid the day before. They were all laid out in piles again, and essentially a recount took place. At the same time the previous protocols of the precinct electoral commissions were destroyed, and this documentation was essentially filled out anew. The number of valid ballot papers was raised first to 25.1 percent as a result of the aforementioned manipulations, and later even higher -- to 25.2 percent. It must be noted that the original count of the electorate's votes was conducted in the presence of persons empowered to act for the candidates and numerous observers, and there were no complaints or censure on their part. In short, this is a matter of the most flagrant arbitrariness by officials and an attempt by D. Bednyakov, leader of the city authorities, to achieve the desired results during the elections.
