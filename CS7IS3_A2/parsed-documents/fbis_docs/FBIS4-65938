However, this does not necessarily mean that the permanent complaints by U.S. politicians about the Bundesbank's tight credit policy will now be silenced. But it would also be wrong to overestimate its importance. In Washington, economic and financial policy measures in other countries are examined only seldom for their respective causes, but more predominantly for their effects on the U.S. economy. From the Washington viewpoint, that seems understandable. Since most U.S. politicians, for reasons of reelection, are growth-oriented rather than stability-oriented like their German counterparts, high interest rates in an important target country for U.S. exports, such as Germany, constitute a brake for the U.S. economy and are thus an evil worthy of criticism. This attitude is essentially based on the opinion that the economic policy of industrial countries--for instance, within the framework of G-7--should best be guided by the necessities of U.S. economic policy. The German finance ministers and presidents of the Bundesbank, who on innumerable occasions had to listen to such U.S. lamentations, when in doubt have always turned a friendly deaf ear and presented what they saw as right in the interest of their own country. That was, and probably is, the only appropriate reaction.
