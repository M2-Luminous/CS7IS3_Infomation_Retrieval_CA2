Addressing the Second Congress of the movement that opened in Moscow today, its leader Gavriil Popov said the movement prioritises the development of a "platform of reform, alternative to the western model and ensuring the country's transition to a post-industrial society," as well as "the neutralisation of the most dangerous measures and laws of the western model of reform." He also said that the movement will seek to initiate debates on the new concept in the parliament and make amendments to the new constitution. In order to promote the stability of power in the country, Popov called for reopening the constitutional assembly and establishing a Council of Nationalities of Russia and several other corporate organisations. He believes the main result of the December 1993 elections in Russia is that Russia rejected the "post-August pro-western stage of reform" and the shock therapy policy. The fact that none of the political forces received the support of 15 per cent of the electorate proves this point, he added. The Russian Democratic Reform Movement set up about two years ago had rated among top ten political parties and movements in Russia, but failed to clear the five per cent threshold at the parliamentary elections in December last year. Popov explained the failure by a mistake in strategy planning. The movement had failed to foresee that the voters would reject the post-August concept of reform so soon. "We believed that the majority would support the presidential course and did not put forward our own alternative," Popov said. The movement has criticised the Russia's Choice bloc for its inability to "pass the most elementary test of political maturity." However, it is ready to cooperate with the "healthy" forces of Russia's Choice and the Democratic Russia Party. Popov did not rule out the possibility of cooperation with the Communists and the Agrarian Party "if they embark on the path of social democracy," but excluded any cooperation with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia which he described as a "party of aggressive nationalism." There is much positive in the platforms of the Civic Union and the Yabloko bloc, Popov said. The Congress has begun debates on Popov's report. The participants will also consider changes and amendments to the movement charter and discus the establishment of its coordinating bodies.
