FR940803-1-00058 FR940803-1-00011 6. The requirements proposed by this NPRM would exclude air-braked vehicles that were not subject to FMVSS No. 121 on the date of manufacture. (Vehicles not subject to the requirements are listed under Paragraph S3 of ยง571.121, and include certain types of limited- or specialized-use vehicles such as wide trailers, vehicles equipped with an axle with a gross axle weight rating of 29,000 pounds or more, any truck or bus that has a speed attainable in 2 miles of not more than 33 mph, heavy hauler trailer sets, and load divider dollies.) Should specific types of CMVs, or CMVs used in unique operations, (i.e., CMVs that are not subject to the requirements of FMVSS 121, but are subject to the FMCSRs) be exempt from a requirement to be retrofitted with ABAs? Should these specific types of air-braked CMVs manufactured on or after October 20, 1994, be required to be equipped with ABAs prior to being placed in operation in interstate commerce? Please provide details. 7. What are the costs associated with retrofitting an ABA compared to replacement of an MBA? Please include the cost of the device, the time required to complete the installation, and a representative hourly salary of the mechanic performing the installation. Please also include a ``loss of use'' cost figure if a CMV were to be taken out of revenue service for retrofitting at some time other than a time when a brake adjuster would normally be due for replacement. How often do tractors and trailers visit a facility where retrofitting could take place? 8. Should the FHWA consider a retrofitting requirement for hydraulically-braked CMVs? Please address the cost questions asked in Question 7. The FHWA requests that commenters address the specific questions above. However, the FHWA encourages commenters to include a discussion of any other issues that the commenters believe are relevant to the use and/or retrofitting of automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment indicators on CMVs. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing date will be filed in the public docket and will be considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file, in the public docket, relevant information that becomes available after the comment closing date. Interested persons should continue to examine the public docket for new material. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. This rule would, if adopted, provide a companion operational standard for brakes in the FMCSRs to make them consistent with the manufacturing standards in the FMVSSs 105 and 121. It would require automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment indicators installed on newly manufactured CMVs in accordance with those manufacturing standards to be maintained by the motor carriers operating those vehicles. Based on the NHTSA studies, the FHWA believes that operation and maintenance costs of the automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators required under the new FMVSSs will be lower than costs of the devices previously required. Although the FHWA requests information concerning the possibility of requiring these devices to be retrofitted to CMVs placed in operation prior to the effective dates of FMVSSs 105 and 121, no rule to require such retrofitting is being proposed at this time. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. If the FHWA proposes retrofitting of these devices at some future date, a regulatory evaluation of the effects of that action will be prepared at that time. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this proposed rule on small entities. This rule would modify the operational standards for brakes in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to make them consistent with the manufacturing standards in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) numbers 105 and 121, which now require the installation of automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators on certain newly-manufactured CMVs. As stated above, the FHWA believes that operation and maintenance costs of the automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators required under the new FMVSSs will be lower than costs of the devices previously required. Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ) and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment.
