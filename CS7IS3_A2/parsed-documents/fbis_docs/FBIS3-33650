The source added that the extent of security measures at the bridges and inspection points and Israel's powers in this regard took 36 hours of fruitless discussions. The source told AL-DUSTUR that the Israelis insist on putting an observer at the crossings who will have the right to talk to and interrogate those who arrive at and those who leave the crossings prepared for the residents of Gaza and Jericho. This constituted a departure from their previous stands by which they demanded a special crossing which will be subjected to remote electronic surveillance, he said. The source said: A new condition has been presented over the past two days by the negotiating delegation dispatched by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The Israeli condition is that the Israelis should have the right to interrogate directly and independently every suspect and to search him thoroughly without interference from the Palestinian authorities. The source added: The Israeli delegation was very uncompromising concerning basic issues on the agenda in an attempt to transfer controversial issues to the ['Arafat-Peres] Davos meeting in Switzerland. Answering a question, the source said: The 12 points of difference have been reduced to four after difficult sessions of negotiations. However, the remaining issues are more important and complicated and we do not know if the Davos meeting will succeed in tackling them. The source said: Differences over the Jericho area are still continuing but the Israelis have agreed on a compromise giving the Palestinian side special "passageways" to the Dead Sea, al-Nabi Musa, al-Maghtis, and the River Jordan without Israeli interference in order to prevent any connection between Jericho and Jordan. [sentence as published] AL-DUSTUR has learned that the Israeli side proposed "joint investments" in the area located between Jericho and the Dead Sea but the Palestinian position on this proposal has not yet been revealed. The source said: The Israelis went back on their agreement to have a symbolic Palestinian presence on the entry posts to the West Bank--a policeman or a flag--and presented to us a new stand pertaining to a symbolic Palestinian presence immediately after, and not at, the entrance of the bridge. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa carried positive signals from his Israeli counterpart after a brief visit to Tel Aviv four days ago dealing with basic issues in general and recommending compromise solutions, but these signals disappeared at the negotiating table and the Israeli side appeared to be most uncompromising.
