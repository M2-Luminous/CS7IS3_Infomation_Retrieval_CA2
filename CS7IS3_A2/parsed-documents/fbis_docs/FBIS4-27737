In a video taped message to the delegates, Timorese rebel leader, Jose Ramos-Horta calls for negotiations to resolve the conflict in East Timor which Indonesia annexed in 1976. Horta was one of the foreign participants who were barred from entering the country. The conference has been discussing alleged human rights violations in East Timor. During the conference the conveners also discussed the peace plan drafted by Horta and was earlier presented to the European Union in Brussels, Belgium in April 1992. The peace plan states that the people of East Timor hope to build a society based on democracy and where the citizens are conscious of their responsibilities. The peace plan also envisage three phases that should be undertaken upon withdrawal of Indonesian armed forces from East Timor. First, the first two years will be set for the holding of Indonesia-Portugal talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary General and with the participation of the East Timorese people. Phase two is anchored on a five-year transition stage in which East Timorese would govern themselves democratically through having their own local institutions. And phase three is defined as the stage of East Timor self-determination whereby the East Timorese may choose between free association or integration into Indonesia or independence.
