The same number of jobs seekers were newly registered during the month of March as in February, i.e., 29,600 persons. A total of 41,700 people were removed from the register (i.e, 9,700 more than in February], 31,500 of whom (75.7 percent) found application on the labor market. For reasons of noncooperation with the labor offices, 3,800 persons were deregistered, and 6,300 persons were removed from the register because of maternity leave, retirement, etc. The number of districts in which an unemployment increase was registered substantially declined in March in comparison with February. With the exception of four districts--Teplice (increase of 3.31 percent), Most (2.62 percent), Prague-East (0.25 percent), and Kladno (0.15 percent)--all districts of the Czech Republic registered a decline in unemployment of between 6 and 18 percent. The relatively largest drop was recorded in the districts of Prachatice (18.0 percent), Tabor and Uherske Hradiste (12.9 percent), and Ceske Budejovice (12.8 percent). In 11 more districts, the drop was larger than 10 percent. Women had a larger share of the total unemployment (55 percent) than men, and also the rate of unemployment of women was higher (4 percent) than of men (3 percent). At the end of March, there were 101,524 women registered at the labor offices, which is 5,000 more than in February. Unemployment benefits were paid to 91,500 job seekers in March, which is 49.6 percent of all people registered. The rate of registered unemployment, calculated on the basis of labor available on 31 December 1991, also marked a decline and decreased from 3.73 percent in the previous month to 3.5 percent. At the same time, the interdistrict differentiation continues. The highest rate of unemployment is maintained in the districts of Bruntal (8.74 percent), Novy Jicin (8.56 percent), Znojmo (8.09 percent), and Louny (8.04 percent). A rate of unemployment higher than 5 percent was registered in another 16 districts of the Czech Republic, which is four districts fewer than in January and February of this year. On the other hand, a rate of unemployment lower than 1 percent was registered only in the Cheb district (0.85 percent) and the capital of Prague (0.30 percent). The number of vacancies reported by employers and registered at the labor offices rose by 5,600 from the end of February. There were 66,300 vacancies at the end of March. Of the total, 22.3 percent (14,800) was registered in Prague. Among the vacancies, the blue-collar jobs continue to dominate (66 percent). On 31 March, there were an average of 2.8 job seekers per vacant position. Similarly to the rate of unemployment, there are also significant interdistrict differences here. While the demand for labor force exceeds supply--there are almost seven vacancies per applicant--in Prague, in the districts of Bruntal, Novy Jicin, Karvina, and Frydek-Mistek, there are on the average approximately 11 to 17 job seekers per single vacancy.
