According to the president, the fact that not everybody is on strike and not everybody should pay for strikes should be established through negotiations and by a social agreement so that the trade unions are not suprised. Walesa stressed that it should not be allowed that the strategic elements of the economy be paralysed since it also is dangerous for the country.
