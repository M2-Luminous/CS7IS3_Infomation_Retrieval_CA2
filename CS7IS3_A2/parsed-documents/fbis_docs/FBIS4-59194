He received ministers Marwan Hamadah, Elie Hubayqah, Muhsin Dallul, Jean 'Ubayd, and Walid Junblatt at 2000 today. After the meeting, Minister Junblatt stressed that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants to give new momentum to cope with the political, security, and refugee problems. He said: [Begin recording] [Junblatt] In my view, the prime minister is not deliberately staying home but he complains, as we do, of certain aspects of the government's performance. We joined this government with hopes of becoming involved in development, reconstruction, housing, refugees, and security. We succeeded in certain areas and did not quite succeed in others, especially in the social area, where there are considerable shortcomings. I would like to remind you that I was the first official to call for a reshuffle or change in this government. All that the prime minister wants is to reach this goal, to give this or any other government a new momentum to cope with the political, security, and refugee problems. I would like to remind you that through the security agencies and the Lebanese Army we have succeeded in quelling a major sedition in the country. The judiciary is doing its work independently of any pressure. All that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants is to continue. Perhaps there are certain circumstances that I cannot disclose now [sentence left incomplete] [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Do you expect a partial solution to the prime minister's decision to stay home? [Junblatt] I have just given my views on this issue. It is up to the prime minister. [end recording]
