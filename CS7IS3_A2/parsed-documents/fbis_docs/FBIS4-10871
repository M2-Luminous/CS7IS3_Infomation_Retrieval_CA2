The decision does not allow any kind of appeal or reconsideration recourse. A class action suit was filed with the Supreme Court several weeks ago, against Article 255 of the Electoral Code. The provision states that the winner of the election is the candidate who receives a majority of the votes. The court has just handed down its decision on this unconstitutionality claim. [Begin Chief Justice Arturo Hoyos recording] The court has decided, in a plenary session, that Article 255 of the Electoral Code is not unconstitutional. Therefore, there will be no run-off election for the 1994 presidential election. For several decades now, the word majority in the text of Article 172 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that only a simple majority is required. [end recording] Chief Justice Hoyos explained that the Constitution must be reformed in order for there to be a run-off election. He added that there will be no appeal or reconsideration of the court's ruling, which was reached unanimously and is deemed definitive.
