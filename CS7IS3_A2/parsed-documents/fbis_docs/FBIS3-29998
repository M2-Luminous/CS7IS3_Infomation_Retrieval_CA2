The official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), speaking on condition of anonymity, said some Japanese officials do not understand the seriousness of U.S. discontent over Japan's failure to meet Washington's demands. He emphasized Japan should take strong measures to reduce its huge trade surplus by stimulating the economy and opening its auto market. The official said the yen is staying where it is against the U.S. dollar on the foreign exchange market, only because of the Bank of Japan's intervention to support the dollar. He said the yen could rise sharply if the central bank stopped its selling of the yen.
