The co-defendant Tian Ye, the deputy director of the office of the foreign affairs bureau of the People's Bank of China, had his original sentence of 15 years imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for three years confirmed. Xi Yang, on assignment for the newspaper MING PAO, went to Beijing last June and July purportedly to cover the Sino-British talks and the establishment of the preliminary working committee to prepare for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The court papers said that he did not apply to the authorities for coverage as was required in accordance with state regulations. Instead, he sent Tian Ye to steal and pry out state financial and economic secrets. Tian Ye stole classified documents involving sample banknotes, information on the sale of gold by the central bank in the international market, and on the adjustment of the exchange rate as well as documents on raising the interest rate by the central bank. The court papers noted that he illegally offered Xi Yang the documents which were, in turn, included in articles published in MING PAO, an action causing great economic damage to the state. The court said that the crime committed by the two defendants was undeniable and there was solid evidence to justify the sentence.
