The mining complex uses Brazilian technology and employs over 100 workers. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 10 May reports that 1,630 caballerias of tobacco in Pinar del Rio will be financed by the Spanish Tobacco Company. The southern part of Pinar del Rio Province, including San Luis and Consolacion del Sur Municipalities, was chosen by the Spanish Tobacco Company for financing in a project that will bring in hard currency. The financing is excellent because Cuba can use the money however it deems necessary -- e.g., for fertilizers, herbicides, shoes, or clothing -- so as to ensure that the land produces maximally. A local official said the financing will be repaid in tobacco. Radio Reloj at 1400 GMT on 11 May reports that workers from the Sergio Soto Refinery in Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province, have produced, experimentally, the first few tons of oil for electric transformers. This will mean a substantial contribution to the national economy. This oil, produced from crude extracted from deposits in the vicinity of Cristales and Pina, is essential for electric transformers. The Sergio Soto Refinery also produces other important petroleum by-products, such as basic oil. Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 12 May report that following significant improvements, the Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery in Santiago de Cuba has attained a production capability that allows this refinery to take up the slack while the Nico Lopez Oil Refinery in Havana undergoes general maintenance. Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 11 May reports that potato production in Pinar del Rio Province increased by 30,000 quintals in 1994 as compared to 1993. More than 203,000 quintals have been harvested. According to the Pinar del Rio Province Agriculture Ministry office, the country's cold-storage facilities contain enough potatoes to supply the population for the rest of the year. Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 12 May reports that there are approximately 10,000 self-employed people in Matanzas Province, or 15 percent of the national total. "Of these 10,000 people, 60 percent are men; 2,000 are women; 2,000 are retirees. Some 1,500 of the women are housewives, and almost 5,000 people are current job-holders." There are approximately 100 applications for self- employment permits weekly. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 13 May reports that since its reorganization, Cubanacan Incorporated has a new transport company called (Veracuba). The report adds that the transport management in 1993 obtained an income of more than $13 million and projects an income between $16 and $17 million in 1994. This will represent an increase of between 20 and 25 percent over the same period the previous year. Thus, after six years of work, the company has achieved an increase of between 30 and 40 percent. The new company is prepared to provide more and better services with a very young, efficient, and trained personnel who can speak several languages. In the same newscast Radio Rebelde reports that 140 houses have been built in Holguin to shelter agricultural and livestock workers. These are the first of 1,000 houses to be built in the province this year. The report adds that tobacco production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 quintals in Pinar del Rio.
