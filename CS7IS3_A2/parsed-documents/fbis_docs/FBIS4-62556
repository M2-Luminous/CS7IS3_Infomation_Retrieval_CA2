The official, Ho Chushen, said the future belonged to major trade and industrial associations capable of ensuring high-quality deliveries. The Chinese diplomat said there was no ground behind allegations that China is implementing "expansionist plans" in Russia through its numerous individual traders. "We are striving exclusively for the development of trade and to our mind there is nothing bad about it," he said. Trade between Russia and China amounted to 5.6 billion dollars in 1992 and rose to 7.68 billion dollars in 1993. This growth can be accounted for by the complementary character of the two countries' economy, Ho Chushen said. The Chinese leadership considers the Russian direction a priority one and China imposes practically no restrictions on export-import operations with Russian partners. "The Russians are hardly likely to find a more capacious market for their goods than China," Ho Chushen said. Chinese modifications of the Russian airliners and transport aircraft, the Il's, the Tu's and the yak's, are in high demand in present-day China, as are Kamaz trucks, Lada cars, steel and timber. Russia is now delivering 12 power units for Chinese thermal power stations with a total capacity of 5.4 million kilowatt, worth 1.8 billion dollars. Work continues on designing and building a nuclear power station in northern China with Russian assistance, although some financial questions have yet to be resolved. The Chinese diplomat said it was expedient for Russia to adopt a law on investments to stimulate the establishment of joint Russian- Chinese ventures, particularly in the production sphere. Barter trade is being replaced with trade for hard currency, which both countries consider to be more promising. Last year it reached between 30 and 50 per cent of the total bilateral commodity exchange. Although favourable tendencies prevail in the Russian-Chinese commercial relations on the whole, the volume of trade diminished by half in the first two months of this year as compared with the same period last year. According to Chinese specialists, this is partially due to the delay in the signing of the intergovernmental agreement on mandatory deliveries of goods, the growth of Russian customs duties and the expansion of licensing of export commodities. One of the main reasons for the reduction is a tougher approach to the issue of visas in both countries. There have been failures in the execution of contract obligations by both sides. Ho Chushen thinks it necessary to involve banks and insurance companies in Sino-Russian trade relations to provide necessary guarantees of commercial operations. China is concerned about the problem of ownership in Russia, where the Chinese, as well as other foreigners, are hard put to understand who owns what and who is responsible for what. In a broader context this question relates to the country's social and political stability. China and Russia do not have open political contradictions, like those which complicate China's trade with Western countries. The main problems for the two countries are transportation and finances. Another acute problem is security of railway haulage. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming visit to China this month and China's Chairman Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia scheduled for the third quarter of this year will undoubtedly facilitate the development of mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, Ho Chushen said. According to experts, the value of bilateral trade is likely to exceed 11 billion dollars by the end of the century.
