Korea's Nuke Development" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] called a press conference for domestic and foreign reporters here today and published a memorandum on the promotion of nuclear arms development in a planned way in South Korea and systematic abrogation of the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization. The memorandum says: The North and the South of Korea, in the joint declaration on denuclearization, solemnly declared at home and to the world that they would use nuclear energy only for a peaceful purpose and not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium-enriching facilities. But South Korea, contrary to the declaration, has extracted plutonium in secrecy with disguised nuclear reprocessing facilities and purchased nuclear material from third countries and systematically diverted it to nuclear arms development. Worse still, it is now openly claiming that the joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the North and the South has become invalid in actuality. The memorandum further says: Though South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test facilities in the Taedok complex as peaceful atomic facilities, all the data available prove that they are reprocessing facilities. South Korea, regarding the introduction of reprocessing facilities as "one of the two main axes" of the strategy of nuclear bomb development, concluded a contract on technical services and supply for the building of reprocessing facilities with the S.J.N. Company of France in the 1970s. When the contract got infeasible, the "Fifth Republic" introduced post-irradiation test facilities from the company under the crafty cloak of "chemical treatment substitution program." They completed the building of the facilities in November 1985 and put them into full-dressed operation in 1987. The post-irradiation test facilities are, to all intents and purposes, reprocessing facilities equipped with the structure and processes necessary for the extraction of plutonium, that is, facilities designed to put spent fuel strong in radioactivity into the shields, transport, dissolve and cut it by remote control and analyze and separate it. The South Korean authorities, in league with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], have systematically reprocessed at the post-irradiation test facilities insufficiently spent fuel discharged from the pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor and extracted a large amount of plutonium every year. According to preliminary data, the total quantity of extracted plutonium amounts to 50 kilograms. Nevertheless, the IAEA has closed its eyes to the post-irradiation test facilities of South Korea, while making a case of our radiochemical laboratory which is peaceful nuclear facilities. South Korea has also imported in secrecy plutonium necessary for nuclear arms development from long ago. No sooner had the chief executive of the "Sixth Republic" issued "declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and building of peace" on November 8, 1991 than he concluded a "joint agreement on reprocessing" with the United Kingdom and allowed a special office of the UK to be set up in Seoul. The "agreement" stipulates that spent nuclear fuel discharged from atomic reactors of South Korea should be transferred to reprocessing plants of the UK to extract plutonium, which should be carried back to South Korea. Under this "agreement," South Korea is shipping in [word indistinct] dioxide of plutonium and uranium. Foreign media express strong concern over this move of South Korea, saying it is evident that South Korea is going to follow in the footsteps of Japan which intends to stockpile as much as 84 tons of plutonium by 2010. South Korea is trying to legitimize and enlarge the introduction of plutonium from abroad. The South Korean authorities began to promote the development of a fast breeder reactor entering the 1980s and recently chose a remodeled light water reactor and announced that they would complete the designing by 2001 and put it into operation by 2007. By the development of "a remodeled light water reactor using plutonium as nuclear fuel" they mean to continue to produce and introduce a large amount of plutonium by diverting world public attention elsewhere. They have also laid artificial hurdles in the way of implementing "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" which the North and the South adopted and effectuated reflecting the unanimous desire and will of the entire fellow countrymen. Especially, the present South Korean authorities have worked in a planned and systematic way to destroy it. They first argued for "nullification in principle" of the joint declaration on the denuclearisation over the "nuclear issue" of the North and then asserted that it was "abrogated in fact" and at last declared it "practically null and void," reducing it to a mere sheet of paper. The South Korean authorities are calling for "nuclear sovereignty" and "counterdevelopment of nuclear weapons" and resorting to despicable acts to conceal the reality of their nuclear armament. The South Korean authorities must open to the public the amount of plutonium they have illegally secured and immediately shut down the post-irradiation test facilities, that is, reprocessing facilities. The memorandum strongly protests with the IAEA against its application of a double standard.
