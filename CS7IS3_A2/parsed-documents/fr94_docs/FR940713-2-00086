FR940713-2-00086 FR940713-2-00053 (e) Affirmative Action. Revision of the Department of Labor regulations on affirmative action requirements for Government contractors (including lessees) has been deferred, pending review of those regulations (see Federal Register of August 25, 1981, at 46 FR 42865 and 42968). Should changes become effective at any time before the issuance of leases resulting from this sale, section 18 of the lease form (Form MMS&hyph;2005, March 1986) would be deleted from leases resulting from this sale. In addition, existing stocks of the affirmative action forms described in paragraph 5 of this Notice contain language that would be superseded by the revised regulations at 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.5(a)(1) and 60&hyph;1.7(a)(1). Submission of Form MMS&hyph;2032 (June 1985) and Form MMS&hyph;2033 (June 1985) will not invalidate an otherwise acceptable bid, and the revised regulations' requirements will be deemed to be part of the existing affirmative action forms. (f) Ordnance Disposal Areas. Bidders are cautioned as to the existence of two inactive ordnance disposal areas in the Corpus Christi and East Breaks areas, shown on the map described in paragraph 13(a). These areas were used to dispose of ordnance of unknown composition and quantity. These areas have not been used since about 1970. Water depths in the Corpus Christi area range from approximately 600 to 900 meters. Water depths in the East Breaks area range from approximately 300 to 700 meters. Bottom sediments in both areas are generally soft, consisting of silty clays. Exploration and development activities in these areas require precautions commensurate with the potential hazards. (g) Archaeological Resources. Bidders are advised of the Notice to Lessees (NTL) affecting the historic shipwreck requirements published December 20, 1991, in the Federal Register pages 66076&hyph;66082 with an effective date of February 17, 1992. This NTL details the survey methodology, including a more intensive survey with line spacing 50 meters apart, and report writing requirements. A Letter to Lessees (LTL) of November 30, 1990, lists those blocks identified as having a high probability for encountering historic shipwrecks. Copies of the NTL and LTL are available from the MMS Public Information Unit. See paragraph 14(a). (h) Proposed Rigs To Reefs. Bidders are advised that there are OCS artificial reef sites and planning sites for the Gulf of Mexico. These are generally located in water depths of less than 200 meters. While all existing and proposed sites require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, this ``Rigs to Reefs'' program is implemented through State sponsorship through the following State Coordinators: Alabama: Mr. Walter M. Tatum (205) 968&hyph;7578. Louisiana: Mr. Rick Kasprzac (504) 765&hyph;2375. Mississippi: Mr. Mike Buchanan (601) 385&hyph;5868. Texas: Ms. Jan Coulbertson (512) 389&hyph;4863. For more information on artificial reef sites, prospective bidders should contact the above listed State Artificial Reef Coordinator for their areas of interest. (i) Archaeological Surveys and Reports. Bidders are advised that a Proposed Rule has been published in the Federal Register dated Tuesday, October 12, 1993, which proposes to grant specific authority to each MMS Regional Director to require archaeological surveys and reports (under 30 CFR 250.26). This proposed rule specifically states the authority of MMS and conditions for requiring lessees or operators to conduct archaeological resource surveys and submit the reports prior to exploration, development and production, or installation of pipelines. This rule, when adopted, may apply to all blocks leased in this sale. Dated: June 27, 1994. Tom Fry, Director, Minerals Management Service. Approved: Nancy K. Hayes, Acting Assistant Secretary_Land and Minerals Management. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16901 Filed 7&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR&hyph;P
