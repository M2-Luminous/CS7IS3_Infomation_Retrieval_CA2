SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 et seq. ) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.

APHIS has concluded that issuance of a veterinary biological product license for the veterinary biological product referenced in this notice will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement.
