FR940617-0-00080 FR940617-0-00017 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 233 Removal of Provision Providing 10-Day Maximum Period for Giving Inventory of Property Seized for Forfeiture to Party Whose Property Was Seized AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends Postal Service regulations on forfeiture procedures by removing the provision requiring the agency to provide a receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture to the party whose property was seized within 10 days of the seizure. This amendment is intended to make the inventory notice precedure of the Postal Service consistent with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Postal Inspector-Attorney Frederick I. Rosenberg, (202) 268&hyph;5477. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Postal Service regulations concerning inventory procedures for property seized for forfeiture are published in title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as §233.7(c). The last sentence of that section establishes a 10-day maximum period for the agency to give a written receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture and the identity of the Postal Inspector who conducted the seizure to the party from whom the property was seized. Section 233.7(c) is amended to remove the 10-day limit to make the inventory notice procedure of the Postal Service consistent with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency when the party whose property was seized cannot be readily identified.
