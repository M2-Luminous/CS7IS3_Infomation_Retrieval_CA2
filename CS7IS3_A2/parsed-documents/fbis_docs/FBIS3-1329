Addressing the party's first anniversary meeting on Thursday [25 March], Mr Dumbutshena said the government was derailing the noble cause of giving land to the homeless by allocating land instead to senior officials of the ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front]) Party. The government last month announced it would lease designated farms to individuals. Tenants would be resettled because some designated farms would be put to best use if not divided into smallholdings. But so far senior government officials, including cabinet ministers, have benefited most from the programme. About 110,000 rural families are still waiting to be resettled on five million hectares of land which the government has yet to acquire, the ZIANA news agency reported. FPZ Vice-President Washington Sansole said the resettlement programme was a failure. He said the government rushed to give people land, but failed to provide roads, schools, clinics or water supplies. Mr Sansole said some government officials benefiting from the tenant resettlement programme had "absolutely no idea about farming" and treated the farms as holiday resorts.
