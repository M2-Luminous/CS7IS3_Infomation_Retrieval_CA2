The said the U.S. proposal, dubbed "Partnership for Peace," was adopted on the first day of a two-day summit aimed at building a new security order for Europe after the Cold War. The scheme would offer Russia and its ex-satellites cooperation in planning, training and other activities as well as crisis consultations. It would be considered an essential but not automatic step towards NATO membership.
