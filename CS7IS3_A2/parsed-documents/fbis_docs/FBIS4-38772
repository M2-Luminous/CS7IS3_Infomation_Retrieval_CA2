Derzhavin towing a bright red Turkish fishing schooner. The fishermen, who had full black moustaches, were resignedly sunning themselves, lounging on coils of nets. A mountain of fish, protected from the sun by a covering of straw, rose up in the middle of the schooner. The border guards had marked their professional day (which, by the way, is not officially celebrated in Ukraine) by arresting the first violator of the economic border since 1991. The great power has collapsed. We can't even sort out our internal borders, let alone the external ones: The Japanese pilfer the sea stock off Sakhalin while the Turks run the show in the Black Sea, treating it as if it were their own little pond. "The Turks know that we don't have enough fuel or seaworthy ships to patrol and so they become brazen," Captain Third Rank Grigoriy Zubov, deputy chief of the border brigade, told me. "Then fuel appeared. We make our first trip out and come back with a `catch'." There are a lot of fish in the coastal waters today. The economic crisis has helped: The kolkhozes have no money to buy toxic chemicals, which the rain later washes out to sea, while the industrial giants and heat and electric power stations, which polluted the water with their discharges, are idle. And so flounders, beluga, and mullet are returning to their native coastal waters. While Turkish schooners, having laid in kilometers of netting, sail in pursuit of them. The poaching by the schooner Mekke [name as transliterated] in the Black Sea's coastal waters is not the first documented case of violation of the country's maritime area this year. At the beginning of May, a fleet of 24 Turkish ships essentially blocked off the spawning routes of the flounder with their nets in the Skadovsk area. A small fisheries protection vessel which went out to investigate the violation was attacked by the Turks. Border guard vessels summoned from Balaklava and Odessa to seize the foreign fishermen were unable to do so, as the latter escaped into neutral waters. This time the border guard vessel spotted the poachers' marker buoys east of the island of Zmeinyy. It was immediately obvious that they were not local fishermen's nets: Under Ukrainian legislation, it is forbidden to take flounders in the Black Sea; this fish was on the verge of extinction until quite recently. After a while the owner of the nets -- a Turkish schooner, calmly making its way towards its haul -- appeared. It transpired that the Turks were using around 3 kilometers of net, in which 740 flounder, beluga, dogfish, and skate quivered. More than 20 dolphin caught up in the net suffocated to death. The damage caused to the Black Sea's ecology, even at modest Ukrainian prices, comes to several thousand dollars. Estura Bogadina [names as transliterated], the captain and owner of the schooner Mekke, now awaits trial in Odessa. The vessel and nets will remain in the port of Odessa until a fine is paid.
