[Jiyane] Hello. [Venter] Thanks for joining us there Dr. Jiyane. Dr. Jiyane, the most serious of the allegations to my mind, that is being put by Mr. Naidoo there is that there are 10 voting stations, that he calls pirate stations, and we presume by that he means not under control of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], but he says they are under the control of the KwaZulu Government and the KwaZulu Police. What do you say to that? [Jiyane] I would have said most ridiculous allegation. You see, first of all, when would we get ballot papers to use there. But in any case it would be illegal. There is a state of emergency here. They would immediately close those down. This is red herring again by Jay Naidoo, who finds every opportunity now to desperately besmirch the name the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which is surprising them beyond their expectations with the popularity and the turnout of its voters. This is a lie. He has been attacking the Zulu police when in fact there is a state of emergency here, they brought all the soldiers to do everything. The fact is, they are panicking. The IFP is about to deliver a resounding victory. [Venter] Mr. Jiyane, Mr. Naidoo goes on to say the ANC wants the results from those stations, their existence of which you deny, to be discounted. Now let's just assume a hypothetical case: say a chief in some remote area of KwaZulu has launched out entirely on his own and he's put up a voting station that shouldn't be there, if that should be the case in cooperation with the IEC and a proper investigation has found that has happened, would you then agree with the ANC that those, whatever votes that were cast there, should not be counted? [Jiyane] It is obvious there is nothing like that that can happen. First you must know that the IFP was not involved in the IEC formation and the delivery of the ballots. We know for a fact that now there is an alert by police because they found in PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] votes at a regional level that were marked ANC. Those are the ballots that are missing. We have 22 million missing ballots, and those were the reason to believe that there are some of them in the hands of the ANC. Now, in KwaMashu a car, an Isuzu car drove away with 10 boxes from an area that is predominantly IFP. Those were stolen by ANC people. [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, I'd like to clear up [words indistinct] you have 2 minutes to do that. But just before, what is your source for saying that 22 million ballots are missing, because Judge Kriegler denied that last night? [Jiyane] Well, he said that they are hoping to find them in some 10,000 little stations. The fact is, at Cape Town, a million of them were found and a person, his life was threatened, when he wanted to reveal this. In Empangeni, here in Natal, boxes were found in Royal Hotel in Empangeni, and our leader there, IFP leader Mr. Gwala [as heard], was asked to come and see the boxes, and nobody has collected those now because they have been revealed. Now it was not IFP and we can know who brought them there. Also children, throughout the night yesterday in KwaMashu, were hired to make Xs on ANC name on the ballot papers. Those are the missing ballot papers which the ANC is using, which it also uses its own cars to steal away ballot boxes. [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, in the one minute left to us, let me put another accusation that is made just so that we for the purposes of our viewers can strike some sort of a balance. Mr. Naidoo talks about the display of weapons, party political propaganda which presumably is inside the perimeter of the voting stations, amounting I imagine here saying to intimidation. Is that happening, isn't it? Well, that is all red herring to try and shift the focus from where the problem is. There is nothing of the sort. The fact is our people, from the old people, they were threatened by youngsters with guns, not just knobkerries, throughout this vote, and the police have intervened. In fact, they have arrested some of the ANC people who have been doing this. This is all red herring. They are panicking because IFP is about to deliver a resounding victory. [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, thank you very much for joining us and taking the trouble to come to our remote unit in Umlazi.
