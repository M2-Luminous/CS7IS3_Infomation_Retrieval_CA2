That is one of the most serious problems that await the Palestinians--and, therefore, us as well. As it appears from the outside, the leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is not ripe for the transition from leading an underground to leading a state or a self-rule"--warns MK [member of Knesset] Efrayim Sne, with regard to the day after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Sne, who holds the title of doctor of internal medicine, was the chief of civil administration in Judaea and Samaria and the commander of the security region in Lebanon. [HA'ARETZ]A key question in the conduct of the negotiations for the Cairo agreement was the strengthening of 'Arafat and the members of his circle. Too good an agreement from our viewpoint was liable to weaken 'Arafat, and in that situation it would not be honored by the Palestinian population. [Sne] We are interested that the side that reached the agreement with us will be able to return to the Palestinian public, which it represents, and to show it achievements--as long as these do not impair sovereignty. We were flexible on those symbols that do not have security implications. [HA'ARETZ]Can 'Arafat flourish any achievements at all following the Cairo agreement? [Sne] The achievement is that they are partners in the management of the crossing points, without receiving responsibility on the subject of security. If they would hurry up and prepare administrative institutions, they would have first received the money from the international community, and would display achievements in economics and infrastructure. To my sorrow, they are not doing that. We cannot compensate them generously on the security issue for what they cannot ensure for themselves in the financial and material spheres. [HA'ARETZ]Can the Cairo agreement as it stands, without the freeing of prisoners, without the returning of expellees, and without the transfer of civil authority, be accepted by the Palestinian public in the territories? [Sne] When the agreement is translated in the field, the Palestinian public will be able to see with its own eyes what is most important to it: a certain withdrawal, that will herald larger withdrawals in the future by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. But according to the surveys that are appearing, even today the support for the Palestinian opposition is not high. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] won about 15-percent support, and the left fronts are winning a few percent, so that the picture is not so bleak. [HA'ARETZ]What is your opinion of the two approaches that prevail among us--one, that the PLO will serve us as a shield against fundamentalist Islam, and the other, which is based on fears of cooperation against us between Hamas and the PLO? [Sne] There are among us persons who, out of lack of knowledge of the Palestinian reality, err with illusions. There are those who get caught up in fear and those who get caught up in false optimism. There are those who fear that the PLO will try to outfox us by secret cooperation with Hamas, and that while it is the contractor of peace, Hamas will be the contractor of terror. Those who believe this do not understand that the antagonism between the secular PLO and the religious Hamas is sharp and cannot be resolved, because it stems from a diametrically opposed conception of the nature of the future Palestinian society. There is no compromise here, and the Palestinians must make decisions tomorrow morning. For example, how much religious studies will be in the schools and how much secular studies, what will be the religious content in the Palestinian schools, what will be the dress of the female employees of the Palestinian administration, will a female clerk in the driving license office in Bethlehem come to work in jeans. The battle will be fought over such things. On the other hand, there are those who see in their mind's eye how the Palestinian police keep apart for them the Ez a-Din al-Kassem gangs and the settlements of the Katif Bloc. That is without any foundation. In the entire Palestinian family, there are three sons, the Fatah, the Popular Front, and another one that is the Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. They will be ready to fight each other over the control of the Palestinian street, but not in order to protect Avi Farhan or Tzvika Hendel. [HA'ARETZ]Will a war of all against all break out in the territories after the withdrawal of the IDF? [Sne] The fear of 1936-39 is still in them, the fear of civil war is rooted among them, and, of course, this depends on the question whether a vacuum will be created between the rule of the IDF and Palestinian rule. But, in my opinion, the key question is rooted in the quality of the self-rule that the Palestinians will establish. If it will have the correct balance of authority and efficiency without despotism and corruption--it will be able to impose its authority. If the balance is disturbed, it will be difficult for that rule to exist, and the proof of that is given in Algeria. A corrupt Palestinian rule will encourage, more than anything else, the rise of Hamas, and even today part of the support for Hamas stems from lack of trust in the manner in which the PLO establishment is running things. Here the question is: how will the senior Palestinian administration be appointed. They have both in the territories and in the diaspora enough excellent individuals to staff these positions. The question is whether they will choose the good persons, or perhaps other considerations will guide them. Today they have a big advantage compared with Third World states: they can build their administrative government system from the bottom up and on a healthy basis. But if the beginning is bad, this system will crumble very quickly. The countries that are donating $2.2 billion to the Palestinians will require only the slightest excuse in order to cancel their donations. If they do not see that an efficient apparatus is receiving the money, spending it efficiently, and supervising it, they will renege." Sne says that he bases his statements on conversations that he had recently with those responsible for this in the European Community, and, according to him, they are aware of the problem. [HA'ARETZ]The question is not only for the Palestinians, it is also ours, because we will be tied together after the signing of the agreement. [Sne] We cannot impose either efficiency or democracy. At the same time, they have lived alongside us for 27 years and learned from us the good and the bad. They, for example, watch our television in the evening, and see that because of a discount in a hotel some want to change the inspector-general of the police. [HA'ARETZ]The leadership that will come from Tunis to lead the residents of the territories does not watch our television, and in the social mixture that will be created in the territories between the "inside" and the "outside," tension will arise precisely due to the different way of relating to what can be termed corruption. [Sne] That is one of the most serious problems, if not the most serious one of all. As it appears from the outside, the leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is not ready for the transition from the leadership of an underground to the leadership of a state or an independent entity. They have different criteria and different norms. If they think that they can run the West Bank of Gaza as they ran western Beirut and southern Lebanon, there will be ungodly disturbances here. It will inspire a harsh response both regarding brutality and corruption. As the commander of the region of southern Lebanon in the early 1980's, I still remember the extent of the cruelty with which the PLO ran things there. But it may be that they will pull themselves together and make the correct decisions. There is no doubt that the failure of self-rule will also be the failure of the agreement. In any event, we will take care that in any situation, the security key will remain in our hands. [HA'ARETZ]In your opinion, is 'Arafat interested in holding elections and in a democratic system? [Sne] They say not. [HA'ARETZ]And is Israel? [Sne] We are interested in a democratic Palestinian system, but we do not have the possibility of establishing fully the internal processes there. But to wish that there be totalitarian rule there that would ensure short-term stability and cause the population to revolt in the long run, that is a mistaken desire. It is the nature of despotic rule to become stagnant, and then the internal opposition that would be there would come out against them and against us. [HA'ARETZ]However, is there not something real in the assertion that general elections will establish officially the demands of Hamas, if they win, for example, 30 percent? In that way, it will have a significant right of veto, and we ourselves will place the veto in their hands. [Sne] If they will be 30 percent, it is preferable that they be 30-percent represented, rather than 30 percent fighting from the outside for their place. Look at the smart calculation of King Husayn in this matter. The real obstacle to Islamic fundamentalism is economic progress. An educated and satisfied society successfully curbs Islamic radicalism. Therefore, here our interest and that of the PLO leadership come together. An agreement that works would bring with it investments, foreign money, and economic development, and then radical Islam would retreat. If there will not be a successful agreement, it will not be accompanied by all those things, and fundamentalism will get stronger. That is bad for them and bad for us. Due to this intersection of interests, there is room for optimism."
