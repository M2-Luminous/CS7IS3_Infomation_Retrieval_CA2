"It is impossible that anyone in Poland could agree to such transactions," stress the interlocutors of RZECZPOSPOLITA. According to them, Poland has never had the Soviet military technology of the newest generation. It is possible, however, that the Soviet arms were purchased by the West in the Near East, or that Polish products got there through Cenzin [company licensed to transact arms deals]. "Poland was a crevice in the Soviet arms," stated the Monday [14 February] WASHINGTON POST, quoting anonymous intelligence sources. "In the 1980's the United States purchased in Poland the newest systems of the Soviet arms which they could not obtain in any other manner. With the help of CIA, the Pentagon tried to make such purchases in all the states of the former Warsaw Pact, but the greatest number of arms was obtained in Poland," claims the author of the article, Benjamin Weiser. The weapons were bought for intelligence purposes -- the Americans wanted to get an idea of how advanced Soviet military technology was. They bought in Poland the newest Soviet air defense systems, radars, helicopters, torpedoes, tanks, and self-propelled guns; they paid for all this between $150 million and $200 million. According to Retired General Edward "Shy" Meyer, who supervised the purchase program from 1979 to 1983, it was the cheapest way to obtain the newest systems of the Soviet arms. The Americans made the transactions by means of middlemen; they paid money by means of letters of credits to bank accounts in third countries. In the case of Poland, the money was sent to Cenzin, which deals with the sale of arms. According to the Washington daily, even though there is no direct evidence that General... Wojciech Jaruzelski Was Involved in the Transactions ...they had to be made with the tacit approval of the Polish defense minister. There were too many transactions and they always went off very smoothly, overcoming any bureaucratic obstacles. This proves that the order was given up high, claims the anonymous intelligence source of THE WASHINGTON POST. General Wojciech Jaruzelski denied that such transactions could actually happen; he called them "almost entirely improbable" and risky. According to Jaruzelski, the Russians guarded their newest arms systems which they had sold to Poland, and the Polish Government would not have agreed that they be sold to the United States. However, the general did not rule out the possibility that the arms leaked to the United States through third countries. The CIA spokesman refused to make any comments; however, other intelligence sources confirmed that in the 1980's Poland was the greatest source of Soviet arms for the United States. The Americans started this operation in late 1970s, when they bought moving anti-aircraft systems in Romania for $40 million. The transaction was arranged by brothers of the dictatorial Nicolae Ceausescu -- one of them was the Romanian defense minister. CIA made its first purchase in Poland in early 1980s; it paid between $20 million and $30 million for over 1,000 hand anti-aircraft rockets which were later on given to... the Afghan guerrillas (this was before they were equipped with the American Stingers). Poland also sold the Americans anti-chemical equipment, which was used by the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan; thanks to this the Americans knew what weapons were being used there by the Russians. One of the main transactions came in 1987: the purchase, through the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, of 12 T-72 tanks, which the Pentagon had not been able to obtain in any way before. Another important purchase was also the newest Soviet air-defense system, bought by CIA at the time when power in Poland had already been taken over by the Mazowiecki government, but Jaruzelski was the president and MON was still controlled by the communists. The arms, which later reached the United States, were often supposed to be destined for Syria or Libya. It once happened that officers met in Western Europe with CIA agents and discussed the conditions of the transactions, writes THE WASHINGTON POST. The daily claims that the main motive of the Poles was either the desire to obtain hard currency, or perhaps also the desire of some highly- placed employees of MON to "protect themselves for the future." The purchases that the Americans made in Poland were of great intelligence value for them. It is enough to say that after they saw the details of the newest Soviet radars, they greatly improved the "Stealth" technology, which made it possible for them to build aircraft undetected by radars. In the meantime, Colonel Marian Moraczewski, Polish military attache in Washington, told the correspondent of RZECZPOSPOLITA that he knows nothing about the transactions described in THE WASHINGTON POST and that he has nothing to say about this matter. "Perhaps Cenzin, as a trade company, made some kind of transactions; however, it is very unlikely that this happened on such a scale." According to Colonel Moraczewski, the Polish Government could not take part in such operations; these transactions, in turn, were not possible if the government did not know about them, because "the Defense Ministry is a highly centralized structure." "The fuss that is being made about it is unnecessary now," said Colonel Moraczewski; he added that such a publication would certainly make Poland's eastern neighbors more suspicious. "No one knows anything certain in this matter," RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from its interlocutors, while trying to obtain some comments on the publication in THE WASHINGTON POST. "We Can Only Speculate" ...we were told by a high official connected to the authorities in the 1980's, who wants to remain anonymous; however, the entire affair seems improbable. "This is total nonsense," RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from General Tadeusz Kusmierski, who fulfilled the function of the main inspector of the technology of the Polish Army for some time beginning in 1989. "I am just wondering who is interested in advertising the affair and for what reasons. Nothing definitely came out of the Polish Army; now, it is simply impossible to say whether or not some arms were obtained by the West indirectly. Foreign intelligence services use various methods. Never, I will stress this word, never," said General Kusmierski, "did the Soviet Union sell the newest weapons to Poland or to other states of the Warsaw Pact. When we bought weapons from the Soviet Union, we were always aware of the fact that we were purchasing arms of an older generation and that the Soviet Union had newer technology at its disposal. Now, what Poland was manufacturing was no great revelation," he admitted. The former MON employee told us that in the 1980's Poland had only one company equipped with T-72 tanks; in general, it had only T-55 tanks at its disposal. Moreover, the rocket weaponry and combat aircraft that Poland had were much more obsolete in comparison with the Soviet Union. All our interlocutors were unanimous in saying that the only way that the Soviet arms could reach the United States was through... The Original Sale of Them to Third Countries According to our informers, there were two ways the West could come into possession of the weapons used by the Polish Army: First: The intelligence services of a Western state, not necessarily those of the United States, were able to skillfully approach the proper Polish establishments. By presenting a fictitious company, they, or rather the company, could argue that the weaponry was needed by some independence organization, some liberation movement in the Third World. In the opinion of our interlocutor, it could have been then that the political decision concerning the sale could be made. In such a case, only Cenzin's predecessor and the military special services could know about the possibility of exporting the arms. The second possibility, which is considered to be the most probable, is access to the Soviet and Polish weapons in countries outside of Europe, mainly in the states of the Near East. "The Americans had access," stated General Kusmierski, "to Soviet weaponry mainly in Israel, Syria, and Egypt, where it was left as a result of the warfare between Israel and Arabic countries. Poland exported tanks and helicopters to Syria and Libya. The former MON employee told us that the Near East and India usually had more modern Soviet equipment than Poland did. Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a close aide of Wojciech Jaruzelski who maintains contacts with him, as well as the interpreter during the interview with the author of the text in the American daily, remembers the general's statements very well. Jaruzelski assured Weiser that he did not know anything about whether or not MON gave anyone in the West any weapons or technical and technological blueprints. "However, in his interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, the general did not rule out the possibility," we were told by Lozinski, "that the weapons could be exported to third countries and were intercepted by the Americans." In view of the fact that the author of the article quotes CIA sources, it is difficult to polemize with him. MON Spokesman, Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki told the television "Wiadomosci" that the ministry had been taken aback by the publication in THE WASHINGTON POST, and as a consequence, it was not prepared to respond to the article. He does not say, however, either "yes" or "no"; he must first verify everything.
