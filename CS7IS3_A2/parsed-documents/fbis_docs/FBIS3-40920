Russian missilemen also have a headache over the launchers stationed in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. They have plenty of trouble with this whole "nuclear missile business." Missiles, which are packed full of electronics and fuel and have nuclear warheads, require constant surveillance and care, particularly in the event of the aging and the malfunctions which are making themselves felt increasingly clearly today, given the meager funding, depleted spare parts, tools, and accessories kits, the destroyed collaboration within the former Union, the customs obstacles.... In these conditions specialists locally and at the operational-technical control center of the Strategic Missile Forces, which our correspondent visited, are operating a "first aid" system. Operational-technical control centers appeared in the Strategic Missile Forces High Command and in missile large strategic formations and combined units several years ago. They proved their viability in auspicious times, and in the present times -- with universal shortages -- they have proved simply essential. "Such a center in the Strategic Missile Forces High Command," Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, believes, "is the eyes and ears of the forces' leadership. Here measures are taken to rectify the simplest fault in missile hardware and, if necessary, major technical decisions are worked out." The center itself is housed in small, well-equipped premises. Nothing here is superfluous. Showing me round his facility, Lt. Colonel Mikhail Poludnitsyn, the center's chief, drew attention to the alert-duty personnel's posts and the collective electronic panel. The latter highlights information on the faults which have arisen, down to each individual launcher, gives their characteristics, and shows the time of reinstatement of "indisposed" missiles and protection systems. All this is conveyed via a computer link to the display units of chiefs of directorates and services. The alert-duty personnel are headed by Col. Yuriy Surnin, who is assisted by two Alekseys -- Captain Kotlyarevskiy and Senior Lt. Klychnikov. Col. Vladimir Bezgreshnov, preparing to take Surnin's place, unhurriedly bones up on the situation. Engineers are on duty round the clock, being operationally subordinate to the Strategic Missile Forces Central Command Post. I asked Surnin to assess the condition of the missile armament and hardware over the past 24 hours. "Twenty launchers (more than half of them outside Russia) required prompt [operativnyy] intervention," he said. "On one, for example, an instrument has failed." On this score he reported: Measures have been taken, and the instrument is being delivered to the launcher by courier from a store in one of the divisions. The alert-duty personnel knew the train's number and were monitoring the officer's time of arrival in the unit and the hardware's readiness to receive him. "We strive for stability, operational efficiency, secrecy, and continuity in the center's activity," Lt. Col. Poludnitsyn emphasized. This is achieved not only by constant alert duty but also by means of the planning meetings conducted on a daily basis by Lt. Gen. Anatoliy Perminov, chief of the Main Directorate for the Operation of Missile Armament, and on Saturdays by Lt. Gen. Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, directly at the operational-technical control center Invited to the meetings are leading specialists of main directorates and officers of the state technical supervision, communications, the motor vehicle service.... Such representation has entirely justified itself. This staff of professionals resolves all problems. It is only when these fall outside the competence of the deputy commander in chief that direct application is made to the commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces himself. The Saturday conference at the center was held in a calm working regime, but you could sense the anxiety and inner tension of the people gathered there. There are quite a few problems in Russia, so it turned out, and things are still more difficult in the event of equipment malfunctions in Ukraine. There are more malfunctions in just two missile divisions there than in all the Missile Forces. Technical decisions on them have been worked out in good time, and the Ukrainian side has not rejected them; but it cannot implement them. There are not the material and financial means or even the fuel to enable the routine inspection and maintenance crews to travel to the launchers. Problems also arise in the divisions in Kazakhstan. For example, instruments intended for the automated systems for the protection of nuclear weapons are not allowed through customs. Whether they like it or not, the "technical personnel" are also required to be diplomats and prepare requests to the Main Customs Administration. On visiting the operational-technical control center I saw for myself that an unwritten law exists among the missilemen: Don't leave a missile until a malfunction has been rectified. Those on duty in the control center and those who work with a wrench directly in a combat position really are like "first aid" for nuclear missile weapons.
