The announcement of the allocation was made only a few days after the BN formed a new government in the state. The allocation proves the BN government feels that efforts to develop Sabah can no longer be delayed. It is up to the state government under the leadership of Tan Sri Sakaran Dandal to speed the process of preparing a project proposal paper, which needs to consider the overall benefits to be enjoyed by the people of Sabah. In our view, although the money may be available, it should not be spent indiscriminately or without careful study. We should not be too greedy, as though money were "falling from the sky." The money is the people's money and needs to be channeled to the people wisely. Therefore, each proposed project should consider local economic and social interests in order to avoid waste. Waste will bring disaster. To ensure efficient management and administration, social and economic research should be conducted first. Considering the present condition of the Sabah people, we agree with the view of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim that projects for supplying water and electricity need to be given priority. These two basic facilities are normally the absolute measure of poverty. Naturally, the focus will be on rural residents, who lived in helplessness under the previous government, which was led by the Sabah United Party (PBS). For members of the state legislature (led by the BN) in an area like that, it is their duty and responsibility to make detailed recommendations on what the government needs. They can get information immediately from development officials of the state or from the respective divisions and districts. The most effective thing for them to do will be to visit the people and see their helplessness for themselves, instead of receiving information while they occupy soft seats in their offices. That is not the kind of BN member that the people of Sabah are expecting. BN legislators must serve the people in the best possible way. We need for them to prove to the Sabah people that they were elected because of their ability to serve the people and state of Sabah. For those who left their original parties and joined the BN, this is their time to prove that, having no confidence in their original parties, they did not transfer for their own interests but for the interests of the people. If, as the BN has charged, the PBS could not develop Sabah because of its unwillingness to cooperate with the Central Government, the time has come for BN legislators to prove the truth of that statement. They need to prove that the PBS has indeed been an obstacle to progress. Thus, they need to prove that through the BN the situation will be greatly changed. We do not want BN legislators to be negligent in taking action, to give opportunity to the PBS, or to return "unripe fruit" to the BN. The BN will be tested at least once every five years. We do not want Sabah to return to its original condition, which will make it more difficult for us to take power. The experience of the last election should be a lesson on how hard it is for the BN to eradicate the state-centered sentiment created by the PBS. We realize that from now on Sabah needs to act more appropriately in order to be on an equal footing with states administered by the BN. Despite enthusiasm, however, we do not want the BN to slip or follow erratic impulses that cannot benefit the people as a whole. We also agree that the government should speed up its effort to establish a university in Sabah. It is only through building such a university that we will see all the people of the state, whether rich or poor, receiving equal benefit. As long as they have the qualifications, all the people deserve to occupy Sabah's grand ivory tower.
