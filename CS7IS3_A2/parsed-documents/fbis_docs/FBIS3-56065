In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Moshe Shahal, minister of police, energy, and infrastructure, noted: "With regard to our state's participation in the structure of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation meeting [ChES] on the basis of an associate member as Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, had proposed during a visit to Israel, Tel Aviv believes in such interaction, and considers that real grounds exist for fruitful regional cooperation in the Black Sea basin. [no closing quotation mark as received] Israel took part in the last ChES that was held in December in Sofia. As competent persons from Ukraine's Foreign Economic Relations Ministry added, the foundation of the ChES international community is still in an organizational stage of being founded, and participation in it by new members, apart from the 11 real members (Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, Armenia, Romania, Moldova) in particular, of Poland and Israel, is highly probable. At the end of January a consultative meeting is planned between the Ukrainian and Turkish side, possibly with the participation of other states that will ascertain this and other prospects for continuing cooperation in the region. According to preliminary information from Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Ukrainian initiative on creating a coastal trade zone will be put on the agenda. At the moment, this is being discussed by the appropriate structures of the ChES member countries.
