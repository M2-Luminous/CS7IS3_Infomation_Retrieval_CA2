In memory of those who perished, I ask you for one minute of silence. [minute of silence observed] Cartagena de Indias awoke today in a festive mood. There is excitement in the Bay of Souls [bahia de las animas] and rumors of fandango in Chambacu. The word is being spread from balcony to balcony. The local residents, as is true of all Colombians, are happy to have you here, chiefs of state and heads of governments. We hope that your stay among us is pleasant, advantageous, and that the protection of our Lady of the Candelaria of Popa will descend warmly on all of you. Lets us attempt to hear the faithful, who under the mudejar [multicolored decorations of Islamic influence] of San Toribio Church, mouth their prayers with a faint Andalusian accent, while outside the first notes of a ballenato [Colombian folk music] drowned the cry of a black female street vendor. These are the sounds of this marvelous cultural unity that is manifested in a new voice -- that of Ibero-America. Cartagena de Indias, the same as Guadalajara, Madrid, or Salvador de Bahia, reflects the rich blend of cultures and races that today brings us together for the fourth time. Here we must stop, look at where we came from, and see where we are headed, and we must share our experiences to continue constructing a better future for our people. We are living in times of change. The mere disappearance of global bipolarism has not given us the feeling that peace, progress, and justice is nearer or is now more feasible. With the conclusion of the confrontation between the two blocs that antagonized one another for so long, we unfortunately are witnesses to old and unfriendly nationalisms. These are fanaticisms that threaten peace and stability as much as the presence of extreme poverty and social injustice in many nations of the world. While we are assembled here, thousands of human beings continue dying, victims of racism, xenophobia, fraticidal wars, resentments shaped over the centuries, territorial disputes, or the simple and terrorizing incapacity of mankind to offer what is promised to all -- namely, liberty, justice, and equality. Nevertheless, I also believe we are living in times in which there is a place for the [word indistinct] hope. In recent years, we have initiated the making of a new world order, marked by signs of interdependence. In recent years, my dear friends, we have been able to make possible the hope of replacing a phase marked by domination [word indistinct] by cooperation. I dream about the Americas being integrated from North to South, a place where a free trade zone from Alaska to Patagonia will be more than a great expression. Likewise, I dream about the Americas, as Europe, being united not only economically, but also scientifically, technologically, and political, and enjoying a rich and diverse culture. I also dream about the Asia-Pacific region being consolidated and expanding. I dream about a Middle East that is conscious of the need for peaceful coexistence and conscious of the benefits of converting to a common market. And, of course, I dream about Africa remarking its boundaries, overcoming old disputes among brothers, and progressing with the solidarity cooperation of the international community. We are gathered here today to create this future dream much closer to all of us so that to travel through Ibero-America no other document is needed than the language we inherited from our parents, Spanish and Portuguese. We need to make it possible for anyone to work in a profession or a trade in any part of Ibero-America; it would suffice to show a diploma issued in any one of our nations; to encourage investments to flow from one side of the Atlantic to the other... [Gaviria clears his throat] excuse me, from one side of the Atlantic to the other, taking advantage of the open markets and distributing the benefits that emerge from the innovation of technological development and strategic alliances; to make Ibero-America an economic and cultural bloc open to the rest of the world; to have Ibero-America interact and enrich its relations with other communities; and, in order to lead, to assume the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that the third millennium offers. Let no prejudice or obstacle hinder our authentic brotherhood. This dream may have many interpretations, but it is essentially one dream -- an Ibero-America that does not need bridges across borders, because there are no borders in the souls and the minds of the people. We are here because there is a vision we can dream about here today, in Cartagena de Indias, the site where another dream took root 500 years ago -- the meeting of cultures. If we look beyond the abyss of time and peer into the future, all of this appears as something that is finally possible. It depends on us to turn a horizon full of options into a future of wellbeing for our people. Dear friends: During the days that have preceded this summit, I have been constantly asked about its importance. I have given a simple answer: I believe that in any relationship there is nothing like a handshake and a frank dialogue. Three Ibero-American summits have taken place. Much progress has been made in reaching political agreements, and many useful exchanges of experience have taken place. The ambitious index of the Ibero-American summits now includes science and technology, education and training, sustainable development, human rights, support for the Indian population, social policies, and, on this occasion, economic matters such as investment, development, commerce, integration, and the consolidation of reforms that many of our countries have promoted in recent years. Regarding issues that form part of this meeting's agenda, it is necessary to acknowledge that the economic situation of the majority of the Ibero-American countries during the past 10 years has not been free of trauma. The debt crisis, with all of its repercussions, made evident the vulnerability of our economies and the worn-out condition of the economic development system then in vogue. We believed that by substituting imports we would strengthen our autonomy, but we crashed against insufficient domestic markets and found an omnipresent state, lack of competition, and excessive protectionism. This is why in many of our countries we had to make, in varying degrees, significant structural changes to our economies. Increased fiscal discipline; inflation controls; free markets; the rationalization of the state's size; the creation of opportunities in the private sector; the adoption of competitive frameworks for attracting new foreign investments; the introduction of labor, currency exchange, financial, and tax reforms; and other things have encouraged trends toward renovation. I think we have seen a profound change of attitude that allows us to increasingly incorporate ourselves with the rest of the world and at the same time leave behind the miserableness whose only promise was the perpetuation of our backwardness. At the same time, we are practicing commercial policies that now are no longer designed to separate us, as they were before, but are designed to unite us. For many of us, free trade and integration, of course, are probably the best antidote against the poverty that still exists in our nations. How are we going to consolidate the reforms through which many of our countries overcame the lost decade? What should accompany the economic adjustments and the opportunities that free trade and integration open in order to secure the social benefits that we are searching for and that our people have wanted for so long? What can we do to make the reforms last and, especially, generate egalitarianism? We must acknowledge the fact that adjustment policies alone have not produced growth in all countries and that these adjustment policies have not guaranteed a better distribution of income. Economic reforms could in some cases have weakened the state, and in some countries, it is an obsolete solution for today's problems. Finally, everyday it becomes more evident that the commercial liberalization effort we have made must aim at harmonizing the agreements that have been reached. These are some of the challenges we have ahead of us. This is why this fourth summit's agenda responds to the urgent need for jointly exchanging opinions on how to face these challenges. Fortunately, the current international framework is more suitable for meeting these challenges. Never before in the history of mankind have so many human beings enjoyed democracy and liberty. Never before has there been such an ambitious multilateral trade system as that which emerged a few weeks ago following the culmination of the GATT Uruguay Round. The principal economies of the industrialized world are gradually recovering. There is a growing wave and a massive awakening of consciences in the quest for sustainable development. We have based our hopes on our own economic performance during the next few years. Here I refer not only to the fact that our countries will be perceived as attractive new markets but to the structural conditions of many of our economies, which have transformed us, without considering what Spain and Portugal would add, into what will be the region with the most dynamic growth in the coming years, second only to the Asian Pacific region. Messrs. chiefs of state and government; following those statements, perhaps I should very briefly mention something that is an internal part of each country and which I truly believe will be a vital topic on the Ibero-American summit agenda in the next couple of years. I speak of the strengthening of democracy. Without flexible instruments for popular participation in principal group decisionmaking, without strong judicial organizations approved by the citizens, without security for citizens and their properties, without efficient mechanisms to promote and protect human rights, without pure electoral systems, without both governors and governed being held responsible for their actions and omissions, without efficient public organizations, and, above all, without an exact redefinition of the roles of the public and private sector in search of public equality, without all this, there cannot be true democracies among us. Last, what brings us together here is the necessity to consolidate economic reforms in such a way that they will guarantee a better distribution of income, stimulate savings, and increase investment, thus spurring economic growth. What has brought us this far is our desire to make inroads into political reforms that will strengthen the state, enable greater democratic participation, and defend human rights. What has brought us here is an imperative need to make trade serve as a bridge for the welfare of our peoples. Of course we hope that free trade and expanded markets will also benefit the smaller countries. Your Majesties, Esteemed Presidents, Messrs. Chiefs of Government, friends, everyone; we are Ibero-American. We represent the voice of Ibero-America and here we are. It is my heartfelt wish that the tradition initiated in Mexico and enriched in Spain and Brazil will continue during these two days, providing us a new opportunity to dream as a group. Within these streets of Cartagena, a place where everything is possible, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, our Nobel prize winner, always says, in these walls which served one day to defend the city from pirates and corsairs, within the castle walls, where the dreams of our forefathers came true, we have the opportunity today to again take up the reins of our countries' destinies, to forge a more dignified, prosperous, and peaceful life for our peoples. I declare this Ibero-American summit of chiefs of states and governments inaugurated. Thank you. [applause]
