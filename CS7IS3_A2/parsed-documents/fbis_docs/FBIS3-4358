The ongoing round of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) resumed here Tuesday morning after a one-day recess. SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu said after the morning session that the two sides again discussed several essential points, including the use of binding arbitration to resolve cross-strait fishing disputes, "automatic repatriation" of illegal mainland immigrants and exemptions to repatriation of mainland or Taiwan residents who hijack planes from the other side of the Taiwan Strait to their homeland. "As Beijing is still reluctant to recognize Taiwan's legal jurisdiction, the two sides failed to narrow their gaps on these key issues during the morning talks," said Hsu, who is heading the Taiwan delegation to the current round of talks. Taiwan is hoping to automatically repatriate illegal mainland immigrants while Beijing insists that prior consultations be held before each repatriation. The large number of illegal mainland immigrants, some of whom have been in Taiwan detention centers for more than one year, has placed a huge financial burden on Taiwan. SEF delegates and their mainland counterparts agreed to meet again Wednesday morning. However, Hsu said he believes the chances are slim for the two sides to reach any agreement on the three issues during the current round of talks. ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Sun Yafu said the Wednesday session will be devoted to putting final touches on this round of talks and discussing the timing for the next meeting. The current round of talks began last Friday and are scheduled to end Wednesday. This is the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three issues since the heads of the two organizations met in Singapore last April. The two sides have not reached any accord on the issues in subsequent talks held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei during the second half of last year. The SEF delegation is scheduled to leave here for home Thursday.
