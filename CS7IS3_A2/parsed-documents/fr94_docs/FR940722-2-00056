FR940722-2-00056 FR940722-2-00036 [OPPTS&hyph;00155; FRL&hyph;4868&hyph;3] Dry Cleaning Industry; Notice of Availability of Comparison Study of Conventional Dry Cleaning and an Alternative Process AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: EPA is announcing the availability of a study entitled ``Multiprocess Wet Cleaning: A Cost and Performance Comparison of Conventional Dry Cleaning and an Alternative Process.'' The study is the result of a joint EPA/industry effort that demonstrated the viability of an alternative non-solvent ``wet'' cleaning process which relies on soaps, heat, steam and pressing to clean clothes that are traditionally dry cleaned. ADDRESSES: The document is available at a cost of $12.00 from the Government Printing Office (GPO), 732 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20401, telephone (202) 783&hyph;3238. Ask for document number EPA 744&hyph;R&hyph;093&hyph;004. This document is also available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5258 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, telephone (703) 487&hyph;4650; ask for publication PB94&hyph;108030. The cost is $27. Free copies of the Executive Summary can be obtained by contacting EPA's Pollution Prevention Information Clearinghouse (PPIC), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Mail Code 3404, Washington, DC 20460, telephone (202) 260&hyph;1023, Fax (202) 260&hyph;1678. A brochure on multiprocess wet cleaning is also available from PPIC. Ask for document number EPA 744&hyph;S&hyph;94&hyph;001.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency's Design for the Environment Program within the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics formed a partnership with the dry cleaning industry, universities, and environmental, labor, and consumer groups to explore ways to reduce exposure to perchloroethylene (PCE), the chemical solvent used by most dry cleaners to clean clothes. In November and December 1992, a short-term, high volume demonstration project was conducted to compare the cost and performance of the alternative non-solvent process with traditional dry cleaning methods that use PCE. Results of the project indicate that the wet cleaning process appears to be economically competitive and acceptable to consumers. The new wet cleaning method, which can reduce the public's exposure to toxic dry cleaning chemicals, may be a viable alternative for some of the nation's dry cleaners. Dated: June 28, 1994. Mark A. Greenwood, Director, Office of Pollution, Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17911 Filed 7&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
