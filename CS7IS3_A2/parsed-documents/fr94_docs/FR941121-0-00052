FR941121-0-00052 FR941121-0-00006 III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment. 1. 225 ILCS 720/2.02 Contents of Permit Application Illinois proposed revisions to 225 ILCS 720/2.02 pertaining to the Illinois Small Operator Assistance Program (SOAP). a. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois proposed to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from 100,000 to 300,000 tons. On November 5, 1990, the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 amended section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants to 300,000 tons. Therefore, the Director finds Illinois' proposed revision at 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b) is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart provision in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. b. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois also proposed the deletion of existing program services at subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) and the addition of the following new or enhanced program services at subsections (b)(1) through (b)(6): (1) The determination of probable hydrologic consequences, including the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the determination; (2) the development of cross-section maps and plans; (3) the geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings; (4) the collection of archaeological information and any other archaeological and historical information required by the Department, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby; (5) pre-blast surveys; and (6) the collection of site specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values required by the Department under this Act. On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA by adding substantively the same new and enhanced program services at paragraphs (A) through (F). The Director finds that the provisions for program services at 225 ILCS 720/2.02 (b)(1) through (b)(6) are consistent with and no less stringent than the provisions for program services at section 507 (c)(1)(A) through (c)(1)(F) of SMCRA. c. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois also proposed the following SOAP assistance reimbursement requirement: A coal operator that has received assistance pursuant to this subsection shall reimburse the regulatory authority for the cost of the services rendered if the program administrator finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during the 12 months immediately following the date on which the operator is issued the surface coal mining and reclamation permit. On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended SMCRA by adding section 507(h) which contains substantively the same reimbursement requirement as the Illinois proposal for services rendered under section 507(c)(1) or section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. The Illinois proposal is consistent with section 507(h) of SMCRA with one exception. It does not require reimbursement for services provided under section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. OSM currently interprets section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to require that the Secretary of the Interior, and not the State regulatory authority, provide or assume the cost of training coal operators. In accordance with that interpretation, Illinois is not, at this time, obligated to propose statutory provisions consistent with section 507(c)(2) and section 507(h) of SMCRA with regard to training assistance. Therefore, the Director finds the new provision at 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b) is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart provision at section 507(h) of SMCRA as it relates to reimbursement of costs for services rendered under section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. 2. 225 ILCS 720/3.15 Vegetation Illinois proposed to amend 225 ILCS 720/3.15 by adding two provisions at new subsection (e) pertaining to the responsibility period for successful revegetation on lands eligible for remining. a. Illinois proposed to add a provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) which requires that the responsibility period for successful revegetation on lands eligible for remining shall be two full years after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation or other work. On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended SMCRA by adding section 515(b)(20)(B) which contains a substantively identical requirement for lands eligible for remining. Therefore, the Director finds that the provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart provision in section 515(b)(20)(B) of SMCRA.
