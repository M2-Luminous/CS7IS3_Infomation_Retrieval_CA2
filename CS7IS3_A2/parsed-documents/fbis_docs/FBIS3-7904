Speaking at the conference, organised by the foundation of the International Centre for the Development of Democracy and attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Olechowski said that this cooperation is designed to secure Poland and Russia a "worthy place in the group of highly developed democratic states." Olechowski explained that the key issue of this partnership will be a better use of traditional trade ties in order to fill in the vacuum left after the dissolution of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Olechowski claimed that Poland and Russia should support each other in creating new trade law, compatible with international standards, form a system of bilateral trade preferences and cooperate in the development of banking and transport services. He added that Poland has drawn up the concept of an East European trade initiative aimed at organising such cooperation. The Polish minister noted that stabilization of the situation in the region would be assisted by the Partnership for Peace project as well as the development of bilateral and multilateral cooperation on many planes. In his address to the conference, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented a new Russian initiative of all-European partnership. Kozyrev claimed that this partnership should be based on the hitherto cooperation within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). According to the minister, the political and military cooperation should be concentrated within the North Atlantic Cooperation Council which would coordinate the efforts of NATO, the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Western European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Russian politician stressed the necessity to strengthen cooperation within the North Atlantic Council and to implement the "Partnership for Peace" initiative on an equal footing. Kozyrev emphasized that Russia's security guarantees would be included in the all-European partnership plan, along with guarantees extended by western European states. Kozyrev noted that if only some states of Central and East Europe were admitted to NATO, this could create new political barriers and make Russia take countermeasures, especially if this led to Russia's isolation. Speaking to reporters during a press conference held after their talks Wednesday, both ministers said they had largely convergent views on questions of European security. Olechowski added, however, that the talks had revealed differences concerning the road leading to that security. Kozyrev declared Russia would join the Partnership for Peace project, but this would take some time. Olechowski said that an effective system of European security had to include Russia, irrespective of whether NATO existed or not. Kozyrev said the recent arrest in the United States of a high-ranking CIA staffer charged with spying for the USSR and Russia would not undermine the partnerly relations between Russia and the USA. The Russian minister dismissed statements by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as unimportant, saying he did not represent anyone in Russia. Kozyrev confirmed he had accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Poland. The present two-day stay in Krakow was a working visit which ended Wednesday.
