During an official visit to Chile, Peres discussed in the Chilean Chamber of Deputies the Middle East peace process. In his speech the Israeli minister stressed that his country has chosen peace, and has engaged in the quest for the required agreements with the Palestinians. He added that after the historic agreements that have been achieved, Israel hopes to do the same with its Arab neighbors. Shim'on Peres emphasized that it is necessary for all nations to support the peace process, which is "the only way to build a new Middle East." In his visit to the Chilean Congress, in the port of Valparaiso 125 km west of Santiago, Peres also met Senate President Gabriel Valdes and Chamber of Deputies President Jorge Schaulsohn. Peres's visit to Chile was the last leg of a Latin American tour that also included Mexico and Colombia. Peres returned to his country today. The tour is part of the Israeli authorities' policy of enhancing ties with Latin America. According to Peres, the Israeli authorities view Latin America as having great economic and trade potential. During his visit Peres engaged in many activities, including a meeting with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and working meetings with Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, and Agriculture Ministry officials. Before visiting Congress, Peres met with Chilean entrepreneurs, with whom he reviewed the possibilities of increasing trade and mutual investment. After his arrival on 31 May, Peres held a news conference in which he confirmed Israel's decision to pursue the Middle East peace talks. He announced that after the agreement reached with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), these talks would be pursued with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. The Israeli minister expressed his optimism over the Palestinian process of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. Nevertheless, he described as "painful and old-fashioned" the language recently used by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and his hints at a "holy war." Peres stressed that the PLO is not now carrying out any terrorist actions. He said he trusts this situation will not be reversed. Peres emphasized that, in the long agenda that is still pending, "the wind is blowing favorably." Shim'on Peres and his Chilean counterpart, Carlos Figueroa, signed an agreement removing the visa requirement for the two countries. This agreement will especially facilitate the visits of entrepreneurs. Visits by entrepreneurs and bilateral trade have both increased. According to official figures, in the past two years Chilean exports to Israel grew from $5.3 million in 1992 to $13.6 million in 1993, a trend that remains unchanged. Peres offered his country's full cooperation for a program to reclaim desert land in northern Chile and for technological and scientific transfers.
