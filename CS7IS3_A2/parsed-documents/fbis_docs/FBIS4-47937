A letter apparently drafted by the Empangeni sub-region of the IEC and leaked to SAPA's Durban office said "pending the commissioner's decision our impression of elections in this sub- region is that they were not free and fair". Electoral officer for the lower Umfolozi area, Jan Riekert, told SAPA late on Thursday night that in his opinion the election in the area had been free and fair. Mr Riekert said reports of irregularities in the electoral procedure had not been substantiated and he was satisfied that complaints that ballot boxes had been tampered with had been satisfactorily resolved. The ballot boxes had been set aside and had not been included in the count. Mr Riekert conceded, however, that local IEC staff had expressed reservations about the freeness and fairness of the elections in that area at a confidential meeting on Wednesday. "It was purely an opinion poll among ourselves...And was not a specific resolution that was formed," Mr Riekert told SAPA. He denied knowledge of the letter, which was reportedly sent to IEC headquarters in Johannesburg.
