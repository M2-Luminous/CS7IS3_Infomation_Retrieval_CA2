Instead, Sir Percy specifically stated from London: "There was no secret undertaking in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), no protocol in which we agreed on public debt. I did not sign any secret deal nor enter into agreements on such issues." Britain's denial enflamed a dispute with Lu Ping China's top Hong Kong man, who claimed the existence of such an understanding in setting a $5 billion limit on airport-related debt to run beyond 1997. Mr Lu, the director of Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on Thursday [27 January] that he and Sir Percy, former foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister John Major, had struck a deal in June last year. Yesterday, Mr Lu stood firm behind China's position and criticised the British remarks, which he said amounted to opening new issues and violated the MOU. Mr Lu challenged the British side to go ahead now to borrow money for building the Chek Lap Kok airport and the railway project in the absence of China's consent. "If the British side thinks...the loans raised by the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and the MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation] are not covered by $5 billion ceiling on Government debt, then there is really no need for them to discuss with the Chinese side. "They can simply go ahead to borrow money. But we will thank God if they can raise the funds," said Mr Lu. The British Foreign Office and Hong Kong Government issued separate statements, denying China's claim that there was an understanding on what borrowings were included in the Government debt written into the MOU. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said the Government was "astonished" by Mr Lu's statement. The Foreign Office statement said: "There is no truth in these allegations." The renewed bickering comes as top Hong Kong officials offered to put forward a fourth financing package addressing China's concerns when the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee meets again. Chief Secretary Mrs Anson Chan Fang On-sang would not say what the package contained, but it was expected to be a further substantial increase in the Government's capital injection. The previous offer was to pump $45.3 billion into the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). Recalling details of the airport talks on the MOU. Mr Lu said Britain had never mentioned the size of debts to be borne by the PAA and the MTRC. "If they had touched upon that (the size of PAA and MTRC debts), it would certainly had been clearly stated in the MOU," he said after a meeting of the PWC political sub-group. The Foreign Office statement said: "The text of the MOU makes clear that the Hong Kong Government will be free to borrow as necessary, while informing the Chinese Government of borrowings up to HK$5 billion. "This clause refers only to borrowings by the Hong Kong Government, not borrowings by the MTRC or the PAA. "During Sir Percy Cradock's negotiations with the Chinese Government which led to the MOU there was no discussion about extending the reference to the Hong Kong Government in this clause to cover also the MTRC and the PAA. "We and the Hong Kong Government continue to attach importance to reaching agreement with the Chinese on airport financing including borrowing by the PAA and MTRC." Expressing astonishment of the report Mr Macleod questioned why such an understanding should suddenly come out from a Chinese official. "It seems strange that this reported secret understanding has not been mentioned before, neither in public nor in private, during the two-and-a-half years that have elapsed since the MOU was published." He cited the former Governor Sir David Wilson's words on the document: "I mean all has been agreed is here on that piece of paper (the MOU) in front of you, nothing in addition to that at all." Sir Hamish said the $5 billion debt ceiling was agreed at the same time China requested an assurance that the reserves to be left for the future Special Administrative Region would not be less than $25 billion. "Both sides realised that, without a limit on Hong Kong Government borrowing, this would be meaningless because it would leave the Hong Kong Government free to borrow enough to make the reserves up to $25 billion.
