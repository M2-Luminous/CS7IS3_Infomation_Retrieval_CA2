FBIS4-42003 "drsov126_d_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-126 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 Regional Affairs Moscow City Official on Protection of Property Rights Moscow City Official on Protection of Property Rights LD2906163894 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1214 GMT 29 Jun 94 LD2906163894 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Sugak] [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The Moscow government's decision "on the protection of the property rights of Moscow residents in view of the expiry of the validity of privatisation cheques" is in no way interpreted as an extension of the validity of the Russian voucher (cheque) on the territory of Moscow, Konstantin Buravlev, first vice-premier of Moscow, told the press centre of the mayor's office in comment on the decision. Buravlev said the measure is aimed only at upholding the property rights of Muscovites who failed to put to use their privatisation cheques before July 1 for reasons that did not depend on them. On July 10 the privatisation cheques issued in Moscow and not put to use during the cheque privatisation campaign are to be accepted by the Moscow savings bank branches for responsible custody. In exchange, the privatisation cheque holders will be given special certificates (registered receipts -- form 31). Privatisation cheques, issued by the Moscow savings bank, are to be exchanged for F-31 receipts on presentation of a passport which should have a notation about residential registration in the capital at the date of issue of the privatisation cheque (one per bearer). Underage children's privatisation cheques are to be accepted on presentation of the passport of one of the parents. The passport should have the name of the child entered in it. The exchange of unclaimed privatisation cheques for F-31 certificates will continue until January 1, 1995. Within a month, the Moscow authorities are to finalise and endorse a programme tentatively named Cheque-Moscow. After that, the Moscow government will offer the Muscovites the shares of Moscow-based enterprises and foundations and, probably, other securities backed up by Moscow property. The Cheque-Moscow programme will be based on current laws with due regard for the overall economic situation in the country. Every holder of F-31 certificate will have several options to exercise his or her property rights. The programme will be implemented so as not to infringe the property interests of Muscovites, who have already put their privatisation cheques to use, or the interests of investors in Moscow property.
