Shavgulidze; UDC 621.391.15] [Abstract] The use of concatenated systems as a coding standard for telemetry channels recommended by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (KKSKD) whereby the code system consists of identical external Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and a single convolutional code with memory and free distance is discussed, and the possibility of realizing an additional energy gain in such systems using generalized concatenated codes is investigated in the case where there are eight external Reed-Solomon codes, and the total concatenated code length is 32,640 bits. The study shows that generalized convolutional block codes with different external Reed-Solomon codes are much better from the energy viewpoint than simple convolutional concatenated block codes. The structures based on quaternary phase modulation (FM4) which employ the property of signal system embedding and two different internal convolutional codes result in an additional energy gain, and the total energy gain compare to the CCSDS standard in the most optimum simulation and analysis points reaches 0.9 dB. The findings point toward the expediency of using the proposed generalized concatenated structures in channels with white Gaussian noise, particularly in space and satellite communications systems.
