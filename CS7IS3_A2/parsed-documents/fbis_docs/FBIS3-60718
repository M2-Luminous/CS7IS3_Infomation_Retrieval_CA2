Rosen told UKRINFORM they came to the plant as the international community is concerned with its work, including the functioning of the fourth power unit under sarcophagus. Another reason is international assistance to Chernobyl. In his words, the team was given all information about the plant operation. Asked about the IAEA attitude to the on-going operation of RBMK reactors at Russian and Lithuanian nuclear power plants, Rosen said there is certain concern. However, they know about the situation at plants with RBMK reactors and did not have enough information about Chernobyl after the Ukrainian parliament decided to halt the plant. ``We are interested in enhanced safety of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and in giving the international public objective information on its current state. In February a new IAEA team will come to the plant to fully estimate the situation,'' Chernobyl nuclear power plant's general director Nikolay Sorokin told UKRINFORM.
