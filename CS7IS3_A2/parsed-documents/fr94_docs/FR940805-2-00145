FR940805-2-00145 FR940805-2-00073 ``Subjects should be provided an explanation about the extent to which they will be responsible for any costs for medical treatment required as a result of research-related injury. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b. Specific Requirements of Gene Transfer Research Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). Reproductive Considerations ``To avoid the possibility that any of the reagents employed in the gene transfer research could cause harm to a fetus/child, subjects should be given information concerning possible risks and the need for contraception by males and females during the active phase of the study. The period of time for the use of contraception should be specified. ``The inclusion of pregnant or lactating women should be addressed. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2). Long-Term Follow-Up ``To permit evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy of gene transfer, the prospective subjects should be informed that they are expected to cooperate in long-term follow-up that extends beyond the active phase of the study. The Informed Consent document should include a list of persons who can be contacted in the event that questions arise during the follow-up period. The principal investigator should request that subjects continue to provide a current address and telephone number. ``The subjects should be informed that any significant findings resulting from the study will be made known in a timely manner to them and/or their parent or guardian including new information about the experimental procedure, the harms and benefits experienced by other individuals involved in the study, and any long-term effects that have been observed. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(3). Request for Autopsy ``To obtain vital information about the safety and efficacy of gene transfer, subjects should be informed that at the time of death, no matter what the cause, permission for an autopsy will be requested of their families. Subjects should be asked to advise their families of the request and of its scientific and medical importance. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(4). Interest of the Media and Others in the Research ``To alert subjects that others may have an interest in the innovative character of the protocol and in the status of the treated subjects, the subjects should be informed of the following: (i) that the institution and investigators will make efforts to provide protection from the media in an effort to protect the participants' privacy, and (ii) that representatives of applicable Federal agencies (e.g., the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration), representatives of collaborating institutions, vector suppliers, etc., will have access to the subjects' medical records.'' B. Amendment to Appendix M&hyph;VI of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments Appendix M&hyph;VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments, will read as follows: ``Appendix M&hyph;VI&hyph;D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review for all gene transfer protocols; therefore, submission of the Points to Consider is required.'' C. Deletion of Appendix L of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Release into the Environment
