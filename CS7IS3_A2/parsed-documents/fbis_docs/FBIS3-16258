Tbilisi also continues to discuss this topic. [Vasilidze] The unanimity with which the resolution was adopted leads one to think that either a solution to the Abkhazian question already exists, and everything is ready for its implementation, or that it is one of those purely academic issues at the level of juridical law making. Having spoken to officials, the opinion remains that the whole affair is most probably within the realm of the second alternative. Inter alia Vakhtang Goguadze, the speaker of the [Georgian] Supreme Council, replied to the question of how the decision will be implemented, saying: [Goguadze] It depends on the further development of the situation, the general circumstances; what things are like in Russia, Georgia, our mutual understanding and relations -- it depends more on this than directly on the decision adopted. [Vasilidze] Regarding the question of the possible renewal of military actions in Abkhazia by the Georgian leadership, Vakhtang Goguadze replied: [Goguadze] For our part, for the part of the leadership, this is in no way permissible. Therefore, Abkhazia should be demilitarized, and then we have to restore police order, and live according to the language of the Constitution. [Vasilidze] Zurab Erkvania, the chairman of the council of ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, which by the Supreme Council's decision received the status of the temporarily evacuated and only legal body of authority in Abkhazia until elections are held, spoke about the situation in Abkhazia. [Erkvania] The confederation, which is calling the tune on the temporarily occupied territory of Abkhazia is virtually, in essence, a terrorist, illegal organization that was formed on the territories of independent, sovereign states -- the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia. It is evident that this resolution gives a legal evaluation of their criminal activities. [Vasilidze] At the same time, the Georgian Supreme Council's decision clearly arouses increased interest by Russia as well. There is no doubt that today's confidential meeting between Vladimir Zemskiy, the Russian ambassador to Georgia, and the Supreme Council's speaker, touched on this theme. Izark Vasilidze from Tbilisi, specially for NTV. [Announcer] Certain very confidential sources claim that Eduard Shevardnadze secretly met the Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba in New York, and it is not ruled out that this information made it to the Georgian Supreme Council, causing such a harsh reaction.
