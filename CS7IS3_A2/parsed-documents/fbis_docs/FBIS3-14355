He noted that Kuwait previously announced lifting the second- and third-degree boycott against companies dealing with Israel. In a statement on the sidelines of the Arab League Ministerial Council meeting in Cairo this evening, the Kuwaiti official said his country cannot lift the first-degree boycott before an Arab League decision is issued in light of the developments in the peace process. On Kuwait's position on the Libyan-Western crisis, al-Sabah said: We support Libya provided that the UN Security Council resolutions are implemented. He pointed out that the embargo against Libya was a Security Council resolution and that Kuwait had nothing to do with its issuance. He said he does not know what difference it will make if the Libyan suspects are tried in Scotland or any other place.
