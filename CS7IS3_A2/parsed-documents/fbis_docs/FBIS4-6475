According to the article, Kim Chi-hyon is a daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, a soldier of the Korean People's Army who was engaged in guerrilla activities in Mt. Chiri during the fatherland liberation war. Kim Pyong-chu was born in Musan County, North Hamgyong Province, in the northern half of the country. While serving in the People's Army during the Korean war, he was active in Mt. Chiri together with Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army who is now widely known as the incarnation of faith and will. He was arrested in 1954 and should have been returned home as a prisoner of war already long ago. But he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in South Korea for the reason of his guerrilla activity. After being released from prison, he was married to a lonely woman and they came to have two sons and two daughters. Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is their first-born daughter. When Yi In-mo was at death's door as an inpatient of the Pusan University Hospital after a cerebral haemorrhage, Kim Chi-hyon got a leave and attended on him with utmost care for two months. Now, the fragile girl is unhappy with a disease. She was hospitalized in June, 1992, her illness diagnosed as lymphatic tuberculosis. Last year, she had her ribs cut off in an operation, attacked with costal tuberculosis, and the inflammation has spread to the region of the vertebra. She cannot get on without the help of painkiller. She has no relatives to support her in South Korea. Yet, she is more concerned for her family, for the living of her brothers and sister than her own pain. Her father's friends, long-term prisoners who spent scores of years in prison, sympathizing with her, formed a "Society for Saving Kim Chi-hyon" and has been helping her. In her article Yim Su-kyong says attention of many people is needed to save the girl who had to feel keenly the sufferings from division and the cold treatment for the mere reason that her father was a guerrilla who dedicated his youth to the cause of national reunification, the girl who is now fighting against a disease, being little different from a lonely orphan.
