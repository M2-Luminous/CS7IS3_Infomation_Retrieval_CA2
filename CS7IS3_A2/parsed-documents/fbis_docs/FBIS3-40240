In Sarajevo, they really believe in the strength of the army they have created under difficult conditions. That is, the Muslim side has managed by great effort and in spite of numerous difficulties, thanks also to their own resourcefulness, to essentially strengthen over the last few months the main body of armed units in both materiel and personnel. Even as recently as a year ago the Muslims were fighting in shifts, because the total number of light weapons and infantry equipment were sufficient only for 10,000 soldiers, although the number of men ready to fight was 30,000. Today, the 3d Corps of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina (command headquarters in Zenica) alone has 30,000 men, officers, and noncommissioned officers. The leading troops in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina trying to penetrate the positions of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] are the 7th Muslim Brigade, the 17th Krajina (refugee) Brigade, and the 325th Hill Brigade. In all these units, there are volunteers from several Islamic countries who have reached Bosnia and Herzegovina through various channels, mainly with authentic, but also forged, passports of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Most of the Arab-Islamic volunteers have gone through military training in their own countries or have war experience, regardless of whether they fought in their mother countries on the side of the guerrillas, in the ranks of the Islamic fundamentalists, or in the forces of law and order and the regular army. Trained and Fanatical What is particularly dangerous for the Croatian side in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fact that these are not adventurers, but men trained as soldiers who are convinced to a fanatical extent that they are the "sword of Islam," and their main driving force is "holy rage." Whether they come from fundamentalist Muslim groups dominant at universities in Egypt (Cairo) and Algeria or have been recruited from the lower middle class and rural environments in the Arab-Muslim countries where there are few places for education--they are all Islamic militarists for whom the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complete way of life. These men between the ages of 20 and 45 were disappointed not only in Nasser's type of socialism (which suffered a defeat in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, and to some extent Syria), but also in the Arab type of capitalism: the inflow of foreign capital to open luxury hotels and tourist resorts of the closed Western type, which imports "debauchery and feverish consumerism" (and along the way it denudes women and turns them into prostitutes), and creates a corrupted new domestic elite whose ideology is: "When you earn your first million dollars, you have your first rabbit, and then you cannot stop the rabbits from multiplying." Given the demographic explosion which has seized Egypt, for example, and Palestinian Gaza (at the rate of one inhabitant per minute), for the poor and disenfranchised strata Islam has become the last refuge, exit, and chance of success: Personal frustrations are turned into virtues. Compensation and a defense mechanism have been found within the framework of the religion. For many extremist Islamic groups, Iran was the ideal until recently, and Israel and the United States were the main enemies. Today, their ideal is shifting to defense of Islam in Bosnia (Sarajevo is becoming the mute witness of "Islamic perseverance" abandoned by the West), and the list of enemies (main devils) is being extended to include the Serbs and Croats. The Export of Fundamentalists Numerous Arab countries, aware of a possible fundamentalist eruption, so that Algeria and Egypt have been turned into bombs with a very short fuse, are trying to walk the tightrope. So, however opposed to Islamic fanaticism they may be officially, they will not have anything against simply exporting elsewhere all those who want to work out their frustrations and wage "holy war," as far from their own borders as possible and in places when order and law are to be found in a rifle barrel. Bosnia and Herzegovina is an ideal place where an equal sign can be written between fanaticism, religious ecstasy, and bravery. And because in the parliaments and political circles of a majority of the Arab-Islamic countries almost everyone verbally supports the Muslim side and the course of Alija Izetbegovic, "Islamic Bosnia and Herzegovina" is becoming not only a strong instrument for social mobilization, but also a point of contact between the frightened regimes and the strengthened and extremely dynamic fundamentalists (who are making skillful use of the domestic economic problems and the intensified social division). A Threat That Is Altogether Serious It can therefore be predicted that as war flares up in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the inflow of Islamic volunteers will only increase. The Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina will direct this international flood mainly toward Croatian areas of central Bosnia, which for the present are still offering a tough defense. The Islamic "jihad warriors" will bring with them new weapons, still more up-to-date systems for infantry warfare, better equipment coming from both east and west, and they will also be the nuclei of the leading "shock" troops, who do not need any special morale-building or interpretation of what they are fighting for. The volunteers from the Arab-Islamic world, then, should be taken extremely seriously. Neither in Zagreb nor in Grude is there any room for naive reflections about the purpose of the imported "jihad fighters." After all, they are more than ordinary soldiers, and they are not conventional mercenaries. They did not come to Bosnia and Herzegovina because of the astronomical pay. They are all the product of their own frustrations, which might be described this way: "They envy, but at the same time they also hate." The violence in which they are taking part is for them only a favorable instrument for spreading their own ideas, to which they will certainly win over a large portion of members of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Over the long term, they can be effectively opposed only by organized and trained military knowledge. In translation, this means that Croatian defenders should have a better survey of the situation, make better use of intelligence, promptly get their bearings in space and real time, move and reorganize their units astutely according to the situation, throw fresh reserves into combat in good time, issue orders which are comprehensible and not contradictory, respect the chain of command, maintain iron discipline in units in which commanders and officers enjoy inviolable authority because of their deeds, not their words. [Box, p 10] Principles Governing the Offensive in Central Bosnia The tactical principles of the Muslim offensive against Croatian areas in central Bosnia (to use the official military vocabulary of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina) are as follows: 1. Attack requires strict command, careful and complete preparation, and at the same time action by all arms within combat units and simultaneous action of all arms within combat units and with neighboring units; an understanding of the objectives of the operation and moral preparedness of the troops are a priority. At the same time, every attack offers the possibility of free initiative and resolute action by everyone down to the level of the individual soldier.... 2. Direct cooperation between all arms and all commanders from the front to the rear and from the rear to the front and flanks is necessary.... Only that kind of cooperation ("combined action") allows the superior command to take the necessary steps in time.... 3. The objective of the attack is to penetrate as deeply as possible into the enemy position, aiming above all at the line of firing positions of cannon and howitzers, which must be taken the first day.... The first breakthrough is relatively easy to achieve. The problem lies in bringing up reinforcements at the right time and to the right place. The enemy, surprised, must not regain balance. His countermeasures must be repelled with rapid development of the offensive. Everything depends on the speed of penetration achieved by the leading troops, confident that they will get protection of their flanks and rear and fire support from the rear. 4. There is a high risk of the offensive smothering itself. The critical point must be overcome through the energy of commanders who are out in front and thanks to the stream of fresh reinforcements from the rear. 5. The decisive factor is not the number of troops, but the firepower of artillery and infantry. Excessively numerous forces can hinder one another and complicate the problem of supply. Everything depends on the rapid and independent action of all staffs as part of a whole, and also on the ability of artillery and the logistic chain to keep up. 6. The higher the mobility of the attack, the further forward the place of the superior commands is moved, often on the "backs" of the leading troops.
