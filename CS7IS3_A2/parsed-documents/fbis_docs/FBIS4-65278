This has been agreed by Horst Koehler, president of the German Giro Association (DSGV), and Oleg Yashin, president of Rossberbank, at a meeting in Bonn. As the DSFV announced, the Russian savings bank, which has 42,000 offices, 200,000 employees, and a balance sheet sum of about 2 billion German marks, is among the five largest Russian banks and is the only Russian bank that has a nationwide network of offices. According to the DSGV, other fields of cooperation are a small-loan program for the newly developing medium-sized industry in Nishniy-Novgorod, participation in financing housing construction and in leasing business, advice for the establishment of a savings bank association, as well as joint ventures with the Central German Handicrafts Association (ZDH), whose Secretary General Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer also attended the meeting in Bonn. Already, the German savings banks and land banks are participating in the establishment of a decentralized, market economy banking sector in Russia via the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation.
