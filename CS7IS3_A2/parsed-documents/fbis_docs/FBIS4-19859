At the 1994 HANDELSBLATT economic forum on the occasion of the Hannover fair, which was held under the heading "Ways Out of the Crisis," the demand met with rejection by FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany); Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group; and Saarland Minister President Oskar Lafontaine (Social Democratic Party of Germany); Federation of German Industry [BDI] President Tyll Necker; and Eberhard von Koerber, chairman of the Asea Brown Boveri AG board of directors. IG-Metall Chief Klaus Zwickel announced that in the 1995 wage negotiations the working people cannot be expected to accept any further losses in income. FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt objected to the demands of Gesamtmetall and IG-Metall with particular vehemence. "We are already very intensively subsidizing investments, in particular those of small and medium-sized companies." There subsidies are appropriate for structural reasons. They are based on the idea that these companies function as an engine for the overall economy. "However, if a general allowance for investments is under discussion, I clearly say no." In Rexrodt's view, an investment allowance would require an extended period to have any effect at all. At the moment there is the danger that the companies would adopt a wait-and-see attitude. It is very likely that already existing plans for investments would be relegated to the back burner. For this reason the demanded investment allowance would have a counterproductive effect at the moment. [passage omitted] Rexrodt admitted that, despite the economic upswing, considerable problems on the labor market are still to be expected in 1994. This development is, however, primarily due to structural problems. Among the positive factors of the economic development is the fact that the inflation rate is declining and that the interest level in Germany is at a historically low level, Rexrodt added. Foreign orders are rising, and the minister also believes that a slight recovery can be felt regarding domestic demand. "The situation is more favorable than many people predicted just a few weeks ago." BDI President Tyll Necker compared the economic development with a multistage rocket. The first stage, which is foreign demand, has been sparked, the second state, which is domestic demand for investments, is not yet working with full thrust. Only in individual fields some improvement can be seen, Necker noted. There are not yet any positive effects on consumption and on the creation of new jobs, which used to improve only later in all economic cycles of the past, too. [passage omitted]
