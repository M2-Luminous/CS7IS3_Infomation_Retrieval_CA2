At a news conference today, he said that the next round of talks will begin on Sunday, voicing his hope that it will be the "last." Sha'th pointed out that the Security Committee settled satisfactorily all pending issues, such as water, regional planning, and the electromagnetic field. Regarding the agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, Sha'th said that only five paragraphs remain to be worked out. He noted that this agreement, which is considered the key to the detailed agreements, has 24 clauses. He said that both the Palestinian and Israeli parties have come close to reaching an agreement on the legal jurisdictions that meet the Palestinian needs and the contents of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Dr. Sha'th noted that there are still issues pending on the release of Palestinian detainees, noting that there is an agreement to release 5,000 detainees. He said that the Palestinian delegation will continue negotiations on a timetable for the release of the rest of the detainees. Dr. Sha'th stressed that the meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Bucharest today has helped push the negotiations forward, noting that he telephoned 'Arafat this morning on this issue. He pointed out that the talks he held with the head of the Israeli delegation, General Amnon Shahaq, yesterday after his return from Israel helped propel the negotiations. He expressed hope that PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will come to Cairo to be close to the negotiations. MENA has learned that Abu-Mazin and Peres will arrive in Cairo next week to attend the next round of talks, which is likely to be the last. Dr. Sha'th stated that an agreement was reached in principle with the Israeli delegation that the first Palestinian flight route will be between Gaza and Cairo, noting that an international airport will be established in Gaza soon. Dr. Sha'th said he expected the agreement on implementing the self-rule powers in Gaza and Jericho will be signed in Cairo between 2 and 5 May. He noted that 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin will arrive in Cairo in the next two days. On the first day they will negotiate over the remaining issues, including the size of the Jericho area, and will sign the agreement on the next day. He stressed that the main issues will not be postponed until after the agreement is signed but certain secondary and detailed issues will be left until after the signing.
