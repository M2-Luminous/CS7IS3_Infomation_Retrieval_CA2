The deputies have elected the council chairman and his two deputies, decided to form ten parliament committees, approved their structure and elected chairmen of six committees. Regulations on maintenance of Federation Council deputies and other documents were adopted. The next meeting of the Federation Council will be held on January 31. Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told ITAR-TASS the first meeting of the Federation Council was calm and businesslike. "There is no hysteria, confrontation or sharp division between the center and region, administration heads and other deputies as some had predicted," he stressed. The president denounced attempts to oppose the State Duma to the Federation Council. The more they try to separate the Federation Council from the State Duma and present it as pro-presidential, the more negative reaction of the Federal Council members they will provoke, he noted. Federation Council member Boris Nemtsov told ITAR-TASS the newly- elected leaders of the upper chamber "quite correspond to the level of authority given to the Federation Council by the Constitution". The Nizhni Novgorod administration head shared fears the Federation Council may become a pocket pro-presidential body. "If the Federation Council chairman is a wise man he will try to get rid of this image in the near future," he added. In the opinion of Nemtsov, the upper chamber should form the 1994 budget, monitor the implementation of the federal treaty and complete the formation of constitutional, arbitration and supreme courts in the immediate future. Opposition-minded member of the upper chamber Aman Tuleyev told ITAR-TASS "approximately 60 per cent of Federation Council members vote to a command and some 40 per cent have their own opinion". But "there will be less differences when the Federation Council starts to discuss specific economic and legislative issues, the common sense will win," he added.
