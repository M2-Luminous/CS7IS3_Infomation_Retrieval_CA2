Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in Kepala Batas that reports that several Western countries wanted to withdraw their peacekeeping troops from Bosnia were the most serious development. As such, he said Malaysia does not want the withdrawal to cause a vacuum which could be detrimental for the Bosnians who are under Serbian insurgency. Datuk Abdullah added that Britain, France, and Canada were among several countries which had warned that they might pull out from UNPROFOR if the chaotic situation continued in Bosnia and was endangering their forces. He said Malaysia viewed the statements with concern and hoped the UN would not allow the Bosnians to be left without any means to defend themselves. Any vacuum, apart from complicating the security situation, would also jeopardize UNPROFOR's role in the dispatch of food, clothing, and medical needs. He also urged the UN to lift its arms embargo imposed on former Yugoslavia to enable the Bosnians to secure weapons to defend their nation.
