In his statement, the leader of the main opposition party blamed the failure on the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, saying the cabinet relied on the bureaucracy to settle the trade talks and abandoned its political responsibility. Kono, rejecting Hosokawa's tacit criticism against past LDP governments, said it was a denial of cooperative ties between Japan and the United States built up while the LDP was in power. At a press conference with President Bill Clinton in Washington, Hosokawa said, "in the past, Japan and the U.S. sometimes have reached ambiguous agreements which can gloss over the problems at the time only to find them sources of later misunderstandings between our two countries." Kono said Hosokawa's remark "insults the Japan-U.S. relationship." But the opposition leader also called it "natural" for Japan to reject the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to measure the openness of Japanese markets to imports.
