FBIS4-8148 "dreeu070aa_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS UN `Surprised' About NATO Planes at Tuzla UN `Surprised' About NATO Planes at Tuzla LD1204100494 Belgrade TANJUG in English 0907 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204100494 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] New York, April 12 (TANJUG) -- No one at the United Nations headquarters could confirm or deny on Tuesday reports that a NATO aircraft bringing special troops and war equipment had landed at Tuzla airport in eastern Bosnia. The report surprised even U.N. peace missions spokesman Fred Eckhard. He told TANJUG that he did not know anything about it, but that it was possible that the report was correct and that the troops and equipment involved could be those intended for securing the airport. The Bosnian Serb army general staff accused NATO on Monday of having used its aircraft for a synchronized action with Bosnian Moslem infantry against Serb positions at Gorazde and of having brought its rapid deployment force units to Tuzla airport. The Bosnian Serb army general staff also said a NATO C-130 transport aircraft landed at Tuzla's Dubrava airport at 16:50 hrs local time on Monday, bringing members of the NATO Rapid Deployment Force and a considerable quantity of ammunition, weapons and military equipment for a coordinated action with Bosnian Moslem units against Bosnian Serb units. The synchronized attack in the Gorazde area and the use of the Tuzla airport for military purposes (the airport has not been reopened for relief aid deliveries yet) indicates that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has overstepped its mandate and that it will be fully responsible if the conflicts in former Bosnia- Herzegovina escalate, the general staff said. Bosnian Serbs have opposed the reopening of Tuzla airport, justly fearing that it might be used as a conduit for supplying Moslem units with military equipment. They have demanded that Serb observers and Russian peacekeepers be deployed at the airport.
