FBIS4-5502 "dreas070_a_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Government Approves Product Liability Bill Government Approves Product Liability Bill OW1204051394 Tokyo KYODO in English 0504 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204051394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The government Tuesday [12 April] endorsed a bill to provide consumers with greater protection against accidents and injuries caused by defective products. The product liability bill would require consumers seeking compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty, instead of having to prove negligence by the maker which is necessary at present. But the bill failed to include a provision holding makers liable for damage or injury through assumption of a link between the damage or injury and a product defect. The bill also limits the duration of liability by corporations to 10 years after products are put on the market, differing from the 20 years stipulated under the civil code. Speaking before a regular news conference Tuesday, Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota said the bill marks "a big turning point" for Japanese consumers. Consumer protection in this country has improved to levels of the European Union, she said, terming the bill "the biggest reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood under the current cabinet." The bill is basically in line with recommendations made by the social policy council, an advisory body to the prime minister, in December last year. The measure will be introduced in the parliament later Tuesday and could be implemented by the middle of 1995. It took almost 20 years for the bill to be finalized since the council first began debate on better consumer protection from defective products in 1975. Under the bill, a product is regarded as defective if it lacks the safety that a user is entitled to expect. Judgment on the safety will be made according to three criteria -- the nature and normally expected functions of the product, the timing of the product's shipment and whether or not it was in normal use. This is down from nine criteria recommended by the council. The scope of products subject to the proposed law is defined as manufactured or processed products. As a result, blood products, some of which were infected with the virus that causes AIDS, will be covered by the law. The council originally proposed that blood products be excluded. The bill says those held liable for damage or injury are not only makers and importers but companies indirectly engaged in manufacturing, such as those indicated in a label of the product. But makers will be cleared of responsibility if they can show that defects could not have been foreseen even with up-to-date technologies available at the time of the product's distribution. This provision is intended to avoid discouraging manufacturers from pursuing technological innovation, which would eventually work to the disadvantage of consumers, an EPA official said. International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai described the bill as "well balanced" in light of the overall framework of Japan's civil code and the current global trend toward better protection of consumers. The Trade Ministry will make efforts to establish legal and other frameworks to upgrade products' safety, Kumagai told a regular press conference.
