Only inexperienced people, unaware of how the world and U.S. society operate, would propose such a shortcut. By the way, this is a typical feature of PT programs like the one that will distribute land to landless people without even realizing that farming calls for capital, expertise, machinery, and a market -- modern features that educated people have known since the time of Adam Smith (1723-1790), the father of economists. The Brazilian foreign debt is not owed to the U.S. President but to private banks, most of which are European or Asian. U.S. banks coordinate creditors, but they cannot impose anything on them. To summarize, the Brazilian foreign debt is a private matter. Since the time of Joao Figueiredo's government, no Brazilian Administration has understood how to manage the debt, and Washington has already tried to facilitate agreements. The most noticeable effort, which the Brazilian Government accepted after repeatedly promising that it would never do so, is the Brady plan, designed by George Bush's Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Under this plan, indebted countries can buy their own debt certificates with discounts of up to 35 percent, substantially reducing the principal and postponing capital repayment through payment of interest. After faltering under the economic leadership of several amateurs, Brazil became a Brady plan client. If the teams of [former Presidents] Sarney and Collor were unfit -- just as Franco's team is -- one does not have to be clairvoyant to imagine the type of person Lula would select to contact bankers, considering the PT's exotic ideas on the subject. Brazil's largest creditor is the Bank of Brazil branch in New York, which can take the burden and remain silent. Lula seems not to have even the slightest idea of our real debt situation. Negotiations call for endorsement by the IMF. Without that any arrangements are merely provisional and "initial accords" that are advertised as solutions but which -- months later -- appear to fail like everything that has been negotiated since the political opening in 1985. The IMF will back Brazil but only through a drastic reduction in our public deficit and with an accelerated policy of privatization that may reduce inflation to a single-digit figure (less than 10 percent monthly). Candidate Lula is against everything the IMF wants. If Lula is elected, the impasse will continue and -- what is even more serious -- Brazil will remain outside the international capital market, which is flourishing from Mexico to China.
