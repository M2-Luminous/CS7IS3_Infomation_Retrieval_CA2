FR940106-1-00080 FR940106-1-00011 (d) It has been suggested that the need for a trigger might be eliminated by setting a criteria at a location further upstream. Both USFWS and USBR have suggested developing a criteria at Middle Ground (at roughly km 68). At this location the criteria would be triggered in all but critical years and would thereby provide an increased level of protection overall. Even though a Middle Ground criteria would require more days of protection than the Roe Island criteria, the upstream location means that the water supply impacts would be less than for the Roe Island criteria in years when the Roe Island criteria would have applied. It is likely that a shift of the downstream requirement from Roe Island to Middle Ground would have higher water supply impacts on average but lower impacts in particular years. At the same time, however, this shift in the downstream location would mean that the criteria would no longer be directly tied to salinities in San Pablo Bay that have been identified as biologically important for starry flounder, longfin smelt, and the shrimp, Crangon franciscorum. 7. Several participants in the State Board hearings stressed the importance of avoiding consecutive years of poor habitat conditions for short-lived species, such as Delta smelt and longfin smelt. For example, Dr. Moyle recommended that relaxations of the Roe Island standards to Chipps Island during dry and critical years be limited to two consecutive years. Similarly, during the course of the Agency's discussions with USFWS and NMFS about the potential effects of these proposed criteria on threatened and endangered species, a question was raised about whether the proposed criteria would adequately protect the listed Delta smelt in an extended drought. Recent extended droughts in the Bay/Delta watershed have lasted six or seven years, but there is scientific evidence that droughts as long as fifty years have occurred and could happen again. Although droughts of this magnitude are unlikely, such a drought would have serious adverse impacts on the estuary's fisheries resources, and especially on fishes with short life cycles such as the Delta smelt. At the same time, water project operators have suggested that extended droughts impose special constraints on project operations and deliveries, and have recommended that EPA propose relaxations of the Estuarine Habitat criteria during extended droughts. EPA is soliciting comments on whether it is necessary to promulgate special criteria to deal with the issue of consecutive dry or critical years or extended drought. EPA is particularly interested in comments on the biological requirements of threatened and endangered fishes during these periods, and on the operational impacts of special protection measures during these periods. 8. In this proposed rule, EPA is relying on the Estuarine Habitat criteria to protect the tidal wetlands bordering Suisun Bay. Tidal wetlands provide habitat for diverse marsh, aquatic and wildlife species, as well as special status species such as the Suisun song sparrow, Delta tule pea, black rail, clapper rail and soft-haired bird's beak. EPA's proposed criteria have been developed to protect aquatic species and to provide salinity conditions similar to those in the late 1960's to early 1970's. Therefore, many of the aquatic species that inhabit the marsh channels should be better protected under our proposed criteria. In addition, the proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria are designed to provide substantially better dry and critically dry year springtime conditions than the recent year conditions that have caused adverse effects on the tidal marsh communities bordering Suisun Bay. EPA therefore believes that these criteria will provide substantially better conditions in the marshes, but is soliciting comment as to whether additional criteria are necessary to fully protect the marsh resources. Although EPA does not believe that there is a sufficient scientific record at this time to establish specific numerical salinity criteria for the tidal wetlands, it may be possible to set narrative criteria which could be developed into numerical criteria in the near future as additional information becomes available. To be consistent with EPA guidance, such narrative criteria should include specific language about conditions that must exist to protect a designated use, and must be quantifiable so that numeric standards can be developed (USEPA, 1990). Examples of possible narrative criteria for the Suisun Marsh are: (1) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to support high plant diversity and diverse wildlife habitat throughout all elevations of the tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay'' (2) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to assure survival and growth of brackish marsh plants dependent on soils low in salt content (especially Scirpus californicus and Scirpus acutus ) in sufficient numbers to support Suisun song sparrow habitat in shoreline marshes and interior marsh channel margins bordering Suisun Bay.'' EPA welcomes any information or recommendations on criteria to protect the Suisun Bay tidal marshes.
