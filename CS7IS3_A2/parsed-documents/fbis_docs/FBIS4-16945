In an interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday, he said the government was seeking to raise extra funds to be able to clear arrears for gas imports from Russia. Bulgar said the cabinet was working hard to try to resolve the problem of a trade deficit with Russia. At the same time, he said the problem of gas imports from Russia was of general concern from government officials down to ordinary consumers. In his view, the mechanisms of a market economy will push energy consumers towards unusual decisionmaking. On Tuesday, one other Vice Premier Valentin Cunev whose area of responsibility covers transport, construction and energy said that gas supply to industrial consumers would be reduced by a third. He called on consumers to stick to the principle of "reduce consumption if you cannot pay."
