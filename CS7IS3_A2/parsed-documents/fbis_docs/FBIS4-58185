For the first time, Rabin presented the Americans with the details of the three stages of withdrawal on the Golan Heights. He did not go into full details, but the plan known as Majdal Shams First -- the plan of handing the Druze villages over to Syrian control as one of the stages of the arrangement -- was definitely mentioned. Remarks of this nature have been made before in very small and closed forums, such as Rabin-Clinton or Rabin-Peres-Christopher meetings. This time, the remarks were made in a very broad forum, which is a message in itself. The Golan withdrawal is formally being taken out of the closet. According to the plan Rabin presented, the withdrawal will be conducted in three stages. The Israeli settlements will be removed in the second stage, and the withdrawal will be completed in eight years, without specifying the line of withdrawal at this time. [passage omitted]
