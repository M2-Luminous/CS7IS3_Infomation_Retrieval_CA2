Ian Eliasson, head of the Minsk CSCE group; Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs; James Collins, assistant to the U.S. Secretary of State and the State Department's chief coordinator on the CIS countries, have shuttled actively between Baku and Yerevan in an effort both to coordinate the sides' positions and to bring closer the approaches of the intermediaries themselves. Bad weather in the region has prevented their flying in to Stepanakert. According to Vladimir Kazimirov, much has been achieved, and never before has peace been so close at hand as now, and today everything depends on the conduct of the opposing sides: "It is to dispel the widespread opinion that the sides in the conflict are incapable of achieving a cease-fire or observing it on their own." The Russian diplomat stated that Moscow remains committed to the idea of a peacemaking action with the forces of an international military contingent. In his opinion, subdivisions of neutral European countries -- Austria, Sweden and Finland -- could take part in the operation. On the other hand, no one has yet expressed such readiness. Nonetheless Vladimir Kazimirov believes that Russia will not agree single-handedly to disengage the Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces. For his part Armenian presidential press secretary Levon Zurabyan stated that some hopes are being pinned on the quadripartite meeting of defense ministers in Moscow which, he expects, will make it possible to transform the lull into a stable peace. At the same time Mr. Zurabyan denied reports by some media that the Moscow meeting between Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Heydar Aliyev is already a foregone conclusion. "There is no specific decision on this count," the press secretary stressed. This was also confirmed by Vladimir Kazimirov, who added however that it is essential to work out a substantive, legally binding agreement on terminating the conflict and overcoming its consequences. This agreement could be signed by leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia as an intermediary. Possibly, Kazimirov added, this document will be also joined by Swedish diplomats who are now presiding over the CSCE Minsk group. Meanwhile fears are mounting in Armenia that the transition from war to peace will not only be very complicated but could also entail unwelcome implications. In particular Suren Zolyan, a deputy in the Armenian Supreme Soviet, said that "the peacekeeping troops could very easily turn into occupiers" and therefore it is vitally urgent to consider the limits of powers of both observer and disengagement units in areas of their disposition. Unless all the intermediaries' powers are defined clearly today, tomorrow any provocation will serve as cause to introduce these units into the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh proper, which could lead to a repetition of the 1920 situation. At that time the Russian army also entered Karabakh as a neutral force to reconcile the warring sides but soon transferred that region under Azerbaijan's control. In this connection there are doubts that Moscow will agree with the CSCE proposal whereby international observers are to monitor not so much the actions by sides to the conflict as the activity and movement of the peacekeeping forces. This leads to the conclusion that Russia will try to thwart the CSCE efforts and will start forming a CIS troop contingent (also "international" in name), which will naturally require some time and at best delay a settlement.
