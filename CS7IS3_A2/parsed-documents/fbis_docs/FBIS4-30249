Some railroad workers left their work sites and as a result, railroad operations have been repeatedly crippled, thus causing confusion in society and to the national economy. In view of the fact that this has a serious impact on overall national affairs, the NRA issued "an emergency service directive" on the morning of 24 June, and made a decision for such deprivation. The NRA has estimated that the number of workers who belong to the council and will not return to work by the deadline will reach approximately 400. [The newspaper adds in another article, that the NRA reports trains are operating at 12 percent capacity as of the morning of 24 June.]
