FBIS3-46840 "dreas004__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan MPT Reportedly Favored Ex-Officials in Bids OW0601140894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0601140894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] As a result of investigations conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN, it was learned on 4 January that technical officials retiring from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] to join private construction firms formed an OB [old boys] association called "Yukenkai," and companies employing members of this group had a monopoly over major construction projects, such as the construction of post office buildings. Companies employing ex-MPT officials received public work orders from the MPT amounting to nearly 90 billion yen in fiscal 1992 alone. It was also learned that members of the Yukenkai petitioned with incumbent MPT bureaucrats to win bids, and they also helped in compiling lists of supporters for Diet members who were formerly from the MPT. This is another indication of the long established collusion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses." The Yukenkai is said to have been organized in the second half of the 1950's, and its membership had remained a secret. MAINICHI has been able to uncover membership details for the first time after obtaining an internal document. Only "individuals who have worked with the MPT, and who are presently employed by construction firms" were qualified to join the group, and membership had to be approved by a general meeting of the association after an applicant personally expressed an intention to join. The membership fee was 4,000 yen a year, and the total number of members was over 100. One ex-MPT official had even joined the Yukenkai while he was still an employee of a life insurance company, prior to his eventual transfer to a construction firm two years later. There is a rule that bureaucrats cannot join a company related to his area of jurisdiction within two years after retirement. Apparently, he was nominally affiliated to another company for the duration. Companies employing ex-MPT officials did not include the big four general contractors (Kajima, Taisei, Shimizu, and Obayashi-Gumi), but consisted of around 70 second-tier, middle-ranking, and local construction companies, such as Sumitomo Construction Company, Fujita Corporation, and Muramoto Construction, which virtually went bankrupt in November 1993. The chairman of Yukenkai was traditionally a former head of the MPT's Building Department, who is the top technical official in the ministry. According to a list of orders placed by MPT or local post offices for projects to construct or renovate post office buildings and other government offices, companies employing ex-MPT officials were given almost all the orders, except for small-scale local projects. These projects cost around 70 billion yen each for fiscal 1991 and 1992. Furthermore, nine out of the 10 companies participating in the JV (joint venture) to build the Osaka Parcel Post Office, an ongoing large-scale project extending over several fiscal years, are construction firms employing ex-MPT officials. Adding the appropriations for this Osaka project, the annual cost of orders placed would be around 90 billion yen each for the two fiscal years. Since the MPT's total annual budget for construction projects is estimated to be just over 100 billion yen, employers of Yukenkai members took up the lion's share. A managing director of Kochi-Gumi, who used to be a Yukenkai member, says, "as part of marketing operations, there were instances where we would request incumbent MPT senior officials to include our company in the bid winners," admitting the existence of close links with incumbent bureaucrats. A vice president of Tokyu Construction Company, also an ex-Yukenkai member, reports that he was once directly asked by an incumbent MPT senior official to make arrangements to acquire land to locate a post office building, and land was subsequently bought from a company affiliated with Tokyu, with Tokyu pocketing the construction contract. This vice president also testifies that "when I was Yukenkai chairman, we were asked by Diet members who were formerly MPT officials to compile their lists of supporters." This shows that ex-MPT officials were also involved in elections. As our investigation of the Yukenkai was in progress last October, the group was suddenly disbanded. The only explanation given by Choichiro Kurokawa, then chairman, was: "It was my personal decision to disband the association." On the other hand, Isao Ojima, head of the MPT Construction Department, says, "Requests for inclusion in bids come from former ministry officials as part of regular marketing activities. However, I believe there has been no "dango" [bid rigging] in the bidding process. Moreover, it is quite impossible that the MPT would have asked its former officials to arrange for land purchases."
