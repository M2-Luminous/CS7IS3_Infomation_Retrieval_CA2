FBIS4-63317 "drsov099_n_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Turkmenistan Moscow TV Interviews President Niyazov Moscow TV Interviews President Niyazov LD2205231094 LD2205231094 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 1120 GMT on 22 May carries in its "Live Dialogue" program a 40-minute interview from Ashgabat with Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and members of the republic's leadership. The program is hosted by Ostankino Television announcer Andrey Skryabin. Niyazov is shown seated at a desk in a large room with journalists seated at two rows of tables. After greeting the viewers, President Niyazov answers questions put by a number of journalists on, among other things, the the development of Turkmenistan, a Euro-Asian union, cooperation within CIS and bilateral relations, debts, social protection for the population, economic plans in the near future, privatization, trade unions, relations with the East, and state support for agriculture. Niyazov welcomes the journalists and thanks them for showing a keen interest in the political and economic changes taking place in Turkmenistan. He then says: "It is important that we see Russia not as a state that has already become separate, but as the main and leading force of the CIS, whose position strikes us very much by its equality, by mutually beneficial cooperation, by respect for the sovereignty of the independent states that have been formed. Therefore, we -- all members of the government present here -- cordially welcome you to Turkmenistan, and I am ready to reply to your questions." Skryabin asks the first question: "What development concept do you adhere to? Which is the most acceptable to you for the development of your state?" Niyazov replies: "We chose a secular, democratic path of development, which is laid down in our constitution. The constitution was discussed nationwide and was adopted by the mejlis after a referendum." The next question is asked by Andrey Polishchuk from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed not that long ago that a Euro-Asian union should be formed. I would like to know your personal point of view on that proposal." Niyazov replies: "What is that Euro-Asian union? Does anybody know what sort of union that is? Is it just a sign to replace the CIS, or is it a new, natural kind of commonwealth or a new confederation? What is it? I simply do not see the mechanism, function, or task of that Euro-Asian union, and I fail to understand why a group arose immediately that supported it, a group that rejected it. But I can say just one thing: the CIS has begun to be formed as a community of independent states. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was very difficult to form independent states, to acquire political independence, economic independence, to establish every state. And the process is difficult now since we are so bound together by 70 years of economic ties we cannot tear ourselves away from one another. But that process must happen now. History cannot be turned back to its original stage. It's my opinion that everybody should cooperate with each other on equal and mutually beneficial terms, of course, without harming each other. It even occurs in families that brothers can have their own economic calculations, but one does not get by at the expense of the other. "We support the strengthening of the Commonwealth of Independent States but on equal terms. Therefore, I think at the first stage there should be more concrete bilateral cooperation, bilateral agreements between the states of the CIS, and the CIS itself should through framework agreements determine overall direction. Therefore, objectively, it is simply unable to create strict structures now. We must take account of the realities. The Commonwealth should exist, but it has to go through a transitional stage in which each of us has to overcome difficulties and not on the basis of mutual accusations but taking account of the real interests of each. In this connection, I would like to say an economic court of the Commonwealth was formed. Today, the countries of the CIS owe Turkmenistan 1.3 billion dollars. Ukraine owes around 800 million dollars; Georgia owes more than 200 million dollars. Many countries owe us, but we are not issuing ultimatums, nor are we appealing to any courts to have a concrete solution to that. We realize all countries are going through an economic crisis. We simply ask that the debt is acknowledged and formulated through state agreements, that there is accountability. The former Union no longer exists. Today we are buying goods at world prices from all countries of the CIS, but when fuel and energy resources are at issue, a more casual approach is taken. Therefore, there should be equality in everything." Correspondent Albert Belyayev from "Kultura" asks Niyazov about the role of culture in the political course pursued by Turkmenistan, and what percentage of the national budget is allocated for cultural purposes. Niyazov replies: "I will tell you briefly that we must develop our national culture, and for that purpose, we allocate seven to 10 percent of the budget to culture." He adds that Turkmenistan had great respect for the Russian culture, which has had a very strong impact on it, but in his view every country should be able to absorb those aspects of the world culture that are the most appropriate to its traditions and customs. He then is asked by Natalya Polezhayeva from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA whether the fact that there were numerous streets, villages, towns, and monuments dedicated to him did not indicate a beginning of a personality cult. Niyazov replies: "I would like you to understand that a personality cult cannot emerge in a free society, with a market economy, private property, and other systems. There is no such thing. But I can tell you that since I started working in Turkmenistan in 1985 there was not a single arrest for political dissent. There is not a single political prison in Turkmenistan. There is no violence. Right now we are going through a transition period. And during a transition period there is a need for a national leader who, together with his like-minded allies, must carry out all these major state and social changes. I am not talking about myself. Maybe if there was someone else, the attitude would have been the same." Correspondent Skryabin asks Niyazov about his portrait on the national currency and about his attitude to the celebration of his birthday as a national holiday. Niyazov says: "I must tell you that we have had lengthy discussions about bank notes. There were proposals from the rank and file, but I was against it for a long time. There have been enough major figures in the 800-year history of Turkmenistan who could have been depicted on banknotes." He adds that unfortunately no realistic portraits of these figures have been left. And when a meeting of more than 1,000 Turkmen elders proposed to have his portrait on the national currency, Niyazov "took it as an honor, not flattery." "There is no need for false modesty. It was an honor for me that the elders have proposed to have my portrait on the national currency." He then adds that in fact it was not his portrait that was important to him, but rather the exchange rate of the national currency. As for his birthday, Niyazov says he did not want and does not want any celebrations. He says he had even drafted a decree that would have banned the celebration of his birthday for the duration of his term in office. However, parliament has rejected it. He said he would still try to pass another law that would allow people, if they so wish, to celebrate his birthday after the end of his term in office. Asked by Anatoliy Yurkov from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA about social protection provisions in Turkmenistan, Niyazov says: "From the first day of the creation of an independent Turkmenistan, we have decided to carry out reforms, state and structural changes only if they have no negative effect on the majority of the population. This is our main criteria. In the process of political and economic reform, we always measure everything against the social protection of the population. Within the first year we said to the people that everyone would have free gas and electricity. This is what we produce here, and this is what we can offer to other countries without depriving ourselves. "The same thing with water. We have water and the possibility to provide the population with good drinking water free of charge. This is not luxury. Once we freed our people from this burden, it had the opportunity to use its income for other needs. At the same time we also had the opportunity to increase people's wages. But the state is not wasting the money either. We have cut our investment in the industry. We have told the industry to develop itself through profits. We only provide assistance to projects of national importance and profitability, such as the building of a railway from Turkmenistan to Iran, another railway from western Turkmenistan along the coastline to Russia, and another one from eastern Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, the building of new airports, new sea ports, and communications systems. I think that Turkmenistan will continue to develop its infrastructure, but only by using local raw materials, such as textiles, gas refining, chemical products, and agriculture. As for heavy machine-building, it does not make sense to build a tractor or a car plant, or an aircraft plant in Turkmenistan. It simply does not make economic sense." Anatoliy Druzenko from IZVESTIYA then asks why, since all leaders of new independent states come from the socialist past and could have gotten together and sorted everything out, this is not happening. Niyazov replies: "One must be a realist. There is no turning back. If we say that we are all independent, be it politically or economically, let us then have proper relations, rather then having a union and someone as a coordinator. It does not work anymore. There is no turning back. We may come to some sort of integration, but right now everyone must live through this disintegration. This is the most effective disintegration." Niyazov then says everyone must live through this difficult period, but there must be a joint effort to make it work, rather than look for something new in the light of present difficulties. He says: "We favor joint spiritual values, economic links, political links. We need them. But they must be civilized. I must tell you that the latest CIS meeting went very well, and many good decisions were taken. There was a divergence of opinions, however. We must take into consideration various opinions. We cannot force everyone to have the same opinion. I, as a representative of my nation, may have a different opinion on one or other question. So, why must I sign something I feel will not be accepted here? This is why we must not rush. The CIS is a slow process and will not spring up from a single resolution. It must remain voluntary and mutually beneficial." Dmitriy Murzin from FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA then asks Niyazov to outline his vision of the economic structure in Turkmenistan. Niyazov says: "As for the internal economic structure, we are not in a hurry to implement privatization. We are afraid to privatize trade outlets in the first instance, as you did it in Moscow, because then state resources have to be pumped into these trade outlets since there are no producers. We have decided to create producers of goods in the first instance. We have already started privatizing public catering outlets and communal services. As for factories and plants, all works of up to 500 employees will be sold through auctions, to both foreigners and our own people, but with a guarantee to provide their own raw materials and to improve production for the next five years. They will have to abide by Turkmen laws and pay taxes. This suits us, because it creates jobs, the state receives an income, and like this the industry will be fully privatized. As for large enterprises of more than 500 to 1,000 employees, 50 percent of their shares will be sold off, while the state will retain the remaining shares for the next five years. We will sell off 49 percent of shares. "We already have a large number of land owners, and we have also distributed more than 150,000 hectares of land. I am a land owner myself. I have 58 hectares of land. I plant and grow there. We have allowed members of the government and ministers to have private property." He then adds that they have developed a number of laws to prevent ministers and other individuals in positions of power from using state assets and funds for personal gain. "We are not destroying cotton growing and cattle breeding collective farms, some of which are very profitable, where employees have a high standard of living. These ones we will keep. However, all the unprofitable ones will be sold off. We are setting up new agricultural units. We can give up to 50 hectares of land to those who want new land. If an individual wants up to 500 hectares, he must sign a declaration that he will produce something on this land for at least two years, rather than leaving it to his children, while the money is there. No, this is not allowed." Yuriy Sovtsov from TRUD asks then whether Niyazov envisages the role of emerging trade unions as his opponents or his supporters. Niyazov replies: "It is true that trade unions had no tangible influence on every day life of workers. They may have had some political influence, but as far as workers' lives were concerned, this was well known all across the Union... [pauses]. There were no decent canteens or accommodation or any other proper service on factories, but no one took care of this. Instead, everyone was busy politicking. The link between grass route level trade unions and workers was severed. When the financial support disappeared they disintegrated somewhat as well. But a new trade unionist movement has been set up through membership contributions, which is self-sufficient, and workers have also become more demanding. Individual trade unions have been given new functions. They are in the process of being set up. We are supporting them, not financially but as a body that takes care." Niyazov is then asked by Valentin Simonov from KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA to tell -- honestly, if he can -- whether he regards the absence of criticism of him in the local press as an advantage or as a hindrance to his state activities. Niyazov says: "Not only I, but many others have difficulty accepting public criticism. We must be honest with ourselves. I do not accept personal criticism of, say, my tastes, but if I am criticized as a public figure for some mistakes in the economic or political management, I can accept it easily. These are two different things. "But when personal insults are used to pad out public criticism, this is not normal criticism. Criticism must be civilised." He then says that from his experience of traveling abroad, he can say he has never seen anywhere else the kind of criticism mated out by the media in Moscow. He goes on to say that this confused kind of intermingled criticism of personal and public qualities in political figures comes from the 70 years of Soviet rule. In his view, only when his ministers will not have to worry about their financial future -- for example, become private owners of industrial or other estates -- will they be able to think independently. He says: "Even if I encourage criticism right now, they will not criticize me. Maybe five or 10 will. Therefore, it would be silly to artificially create criticism of myself. Does this mean that if I want to be called a democrat, I must create an opposition, pluralism, set up a multiparty system, create a group that will try to get to the top on the basis of the right to criticize, rather than on the basis of its own program, a program that would be to the benefit of the people?" Nail Bikkenin from the journal SVOBODNAYA MYSL then asks him to explain how the specific characteristics of the East apply to Turkmenistan. Replying to the question, Niyazov says that East and West had different cultural traditions and often did not understand each other. There were good and bad people both in the East and West, and it would be wrong to let the Russians' opinion of Turkmenistanis be influenced by stereotypes. Aleksandr Lisin of VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA tells Niyazov that Muscovites are interested to know more about his personality and asks whether there is a politician or some other famous man whom he regards as his role model. Niyazov says there is no single person who has influenced him in this way, but adds: "Since my childhood I have regarded as my ideal only the ideas of the Communist Party, and people should not be judged too severely for being impressed by them. But then I discovered that these ideas cannot be be implemented at the present stage and that our real mentality is very unlike the things we say." He goes on to say that equality, peace, and cooperation will always remain mankind's great ideals. Niyazov then says that when he joined the USSR Politburo in 1985, he used to admire Mikhail Gorbachev, but his attitude to that leader gradually changed by 1989-90. "I like certain things about Churchill's politics, some things about Mitterrand's, and some about Li Peng's. Generally speaking, for some reason, my only ideal is Friedrich Engels: when I read his works, I think they are logical and consistent, and he impresses me as a philosopher and political economist; he rather than Marx. That's about it." The last question is from Aleksandr Kharlamov of SELSKAYA ZHIZN, who asks about Niyazov's attitude to state subsidies for agriculture. Niyazov replies: "In Turkmenistan, we know that at this transitional stage, agriculture will not survive without subsidies. Profits from the sale of oil and gas should be redistributed. This happens in all civilized states. We should not say: this branch is not profit- making, so we shall close it down." Skryabin then thanks Niyazov, who says in conclusion: "Our way of political and economic development, our moral and cultural values are typical of our own people. I am not imposing them on you and not preaching them to you, just telling you about us. At the same time, we respect all states and their form of development, their political and economic reforms." Thanking the journalists who attended the meeting, he adds: "We regard Russia as a great country with which we shall maintain friendly relations whatever may happen. It is our long-term policy to respect the policy Russia has chosen and to cooperate with it on a mutually beneficial basis."
