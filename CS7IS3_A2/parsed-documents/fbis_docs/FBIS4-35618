In an interview on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, radio he said that "as long as there is democracy, participation, freedom of expression, and a free press," in addition to "our open society which allows all sides to be heard and to put forward their points of view, this prevents any form of extremism." Sa'dun was replying to a question on whether Kuwait fears Islamic extremism. He said that Kuwaiti society "adheres to religion and abides by Islam, but in this case you are talking about political organizations which are actually present throughout the Arab homeland." He stated that the present National Assembly "represents all strata of Kuwaiti society and all political, social, and other groups." He said that there is a trend toward widening the electoral base in Kuwait through a number of proposals "which have been on the table for some time and on which views differ," such as granting women the right to vote, lowering the voting age to 18, giving naturalized Kuwaitis the right to vote, and granting the right to vote to certain nationals who are resident abroad because of the nature of their work, such as ambassadors, members of the diplomatic corps, students, and military personnel. He said: "We are a democratic country" and accept what is adopted by the majority. "Whatever the trend on any of these issues, I personally am not concerned when the vote in the National Assembly goes against my own preference." [passage omitted] The National Assembly speaker said that the greatest achievement in Kuwait since its liberation from Iraqi occupation has been parliamentary elections and the restoration of democracy. He said that this emphasized "the nature of the situation in Kuwait, the nature of the ruling system in Kuwait, and the nature of the Kuwaiti people, who must have a role in managing the affairs of their country and in self-determination."
