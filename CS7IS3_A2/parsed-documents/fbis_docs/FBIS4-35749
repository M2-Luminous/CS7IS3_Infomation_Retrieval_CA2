Nevertheless, going by the number of seats it has won in the by-elections, the Congress can afford to be in a triumphant mood although the defeat it has suffered in certain constituencies points to the long way it has still to go to make its position sound and strong. The party can certainly pat itself on the back for bagging five of the seven Lok Sabha seats and five of the 10 Assembly seats. Its triumph in the Ahmednagar and Baramati constituencies in Maharashtra signifies Chief Minister Sharad Pawar's political clout in the State whereas in Madhya Pradesh, where it has bagged both the Rajgarh Lok Sabha seat and the Chachoda Assembly seat, the architect of victory is in a large measure Chief Minister Digvijay Singh himself. In Punjab, Chief Minister Beant Singh's hands have been strengthened by the party's creditable performance in Nakodar. The Bharatiya Janata Party can draw some comfort from its victory in the Meerut Lok Sabha constituency in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and in the Rajakhera Assembly constituency in Rajasthan. But it has reason to feel disturbed over its dismal performance in Madhya Pradesh and its loss of the Hamirpur Assembly seat in Himachal Pradesh to the Congress. The limitations of Hindutva card should dawn on the party. Though the Left parties have not been put to a severe test, the Revolutionary Socialist Party has fared well by winning the Barampore Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal. Similarly, the Left Front in Kerala can celebrate the triumph of the Independent candidate backed by it in the Guruvayoor Assembly constituency. But it was mainly Muslim politics rather than party politics that decided the outcome of the by-election. What a pity that in a state like Kerala both the Congress and the Left parties unabashedly depend upon the communal forces for their survival and votes! From Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh where the Congress has defeated its Telugu Desam rival with a reduced margin, the message is clear: Unless the Congress sets its house in order, it will face a serious challenge from Mr N. T. Rama Rao's party. The Congress has only itself to blame for finding itself in a hopeless situation in Tamil Nadu. It remains to be seen whether the party can regain in the near future even partly the ground it has lost. In the Perundurai Assembly constituency where the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] has registered a spectacular victory, the Congress came only fourth. The same is the story in the Mylapore Assembly constituency. The Congress is thus highly vulnerable in the southern States which were once its fortress. In Tamil Nadu, the party has paid a heavy price for its dilemma whether it should align with the DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kzhagam] or the AIADMK or stand on its own. The sooner it adopts a united stand and spells out a definite strategy, the better it is for the party. In Kerala, where Chief Minister K. Karunakaran is becoming more and more a liability to the Congress, a change in leadership may be worth considering.
