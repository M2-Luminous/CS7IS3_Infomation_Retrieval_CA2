Because of this, there is no possibility that a retaliation list, which the United States prepared, will be disclosed. Since the mobile telephone issue was not included in the agenda of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks, which ruptured, attention was focused on recent discussions. The discussion over the phone issue was a part of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive talks. However, we positively appraise the fact that retaliation has been avoided for the time being. The intention of the United States, which tried to solve the issue of economic friction by introducing strong measures, was to open up the Japanese market, and the marketing strategies of Motorola Inc., which wanted to make inroads into Japanese market by riding on the wave of the government's attempt, combined into one. It seems that Japanese businessmen, who were troubled from beginning to end by the offenses of the United States, just could not help but feel that the U.S. demands were unreasonable. In the field of mobile telephones, Japan and the United States have intermittently had friction over the past ten years. Japan liberated the communications market in 1985. The United States immediately decided to treat the mobile telephone issue as a main theme of the Japan-U.S. Market-Oriented Sector Selective (MOSS) talks and demanded that Japan open up its market to the Motorola method. In 1986, the United States managed to obtain a pledge from Japan. From the beginning, Japan was lacking individuality in its countermeasures and, without clarifying problem points, adopted the NTT and the Motorola systems, which are not compatible with each other, in this small country. Succumbing to the hard-line stance of the United States, Japan continued to make inconsistent compromises one after another, even after acceptance of the Motorola system. However, causes of friction continued to exist. In 1989, the United States pointed out that the Japan had violated the MOSS agreement for mobile telephones and named Japanese goods which are subject to retaliation based on the strength of the 301 provision of the trade law. After this, Japan, in addition to the NTT method, allowed Motorola to introduce its system in Japan. At that time, the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said "there are no more available frequencies." But the ministry allotted frequencies to Motorola at the last moment. The friction over the mobile telephones was created by the fact that Motorola's share in the Japanese market did not grow as they expected and that the United States assumed a hard-line stance due to its fear that it would lag behind Japan in introducing a digital system. As far as the United States is concerned, the share did not grow because Motorola "was not given market access equal to that of the NTT." In comparison, Japan actually assumed a passive stance. Japan repeated hasty negotiations as it did several years ago. Since Japan did not have firm conviction at the beginning of the negotiations, it continued to negotiate with the United States without serious commitment. Due to such an optimistic stance, the electric communications field became a main target at negotiations over trade friction. As a result, Nippon Ido Tsushin Corp. (IDO) was forced to make a major compromise. Japanese businessmen, who sat at the negotiating table while feeling that U.S. demands are unreasonable, were once again obliged to bow to U.S. pressure. Now, IDO has to make a significant increase in the number of base stations for the Motorola system. Motorola successfully managed to win more frequencies as well. However, it was progress that Japan and the Untied States became more willing than before to settle issues on a private-level. Both countries need to study the differences in feelings about "equal market access" and to deepen mutual understanding. We hope that Japanese and American businessmen will attach importance to their conversations to prevent public intervention from becoming excessive.
