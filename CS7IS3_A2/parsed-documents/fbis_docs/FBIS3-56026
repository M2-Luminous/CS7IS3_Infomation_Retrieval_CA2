In the opinion of several experts it will still take much time for the conflict to be finally settled; after all, it is not for nothing that people say that it is enough for there to be a single shot for a war to last 100 years. But nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, a Russian Federation MVD operational inquiry group investigation team is working fairly fruitfully. It is taking measures to search out criminals, people who have disappeared without trace during the conflict, to establish the identity of unidentified corpses, free hostages, and establish the possible sites where dead citizens have been buried. In the space of only one month the group has established the fate of 25 citizens who disappeared without trace, operations to detain particularly dangerous criminals have been mounted, and possible locations where hostages are being held and dead citizens are buried have been checked. For example, acting on fresh information, the investigation team led by Lieutenant Colonel of the Militia Petr Baranov discovered two illegal burial sites containing 11 corpses in the region of the settlement of Oktyabrskiy. They were all identified and handed over to the relatives of the deceased. Staffers of State Motor Vehicle Inspection Administration subunits have also had their work cut out in the state of emergency zone. Suffice it to say that they have examined more than 10,000 motor vehicles at checkpoints, and have checked serial numbers on the units and assemblies of more than 3,000 vehicles against the Russian MVD Information Center data base. Some 43 vehicles have been impounded, mostly of foreign production, which were being sought. While checking and examining motor vehicles, 46 rifles, two live grenades, as well as 17 cold-steel weapons were discovered and confiscated. In order to step up preventative and preemptive work in the fight against hijacking, a raid was carried out on the territory of the Republic of Ingushetia 6 January. In the space of six hours, eight vehicles were impounded, which were being sought. Upon examining them, various firearms and cold steel weapons were discovered and confiscated.
