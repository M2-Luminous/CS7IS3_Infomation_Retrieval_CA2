FR940406-2-00146 FR940406-2-00090 One commenter requested HUD to allocate unused funds from the 1992 NOFA using the 90/10 formula in the statute, rather than giving all unused funds to technical assistance grants. The Department has decided to allocate unused funds using the 90/10 formula. Another commenter sought clarification of the exact amount of funds available from 1992 NOFA and how these funds will be divided. Because the 1992 NOFA is active, and will be for several months, the Department cannot know exactly how much will be available once the 1992 NOFA is terminated. 6. Applicant Selection Several commenters felt that the application review should include review of the financial viability of the property and an analysis of the development team, rather than a simple review of the applicant itself. One commenter was concerned that resident support would override strong underwriting criteria. The Department has chosen not to amend this selection criteria, but will also instruct intermediaries reviewing Predevelopment grant applications to conduct a review on the feasibility of the purchase, including a review of the development team. One commenter requested that if any award is made by an intermediary or HUD, the procurement requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 should be deemed to have been met. This would permit continuity of service for consultants who were identified by grantees prior to the availability of Federal funds. The Department finds it unnecessary to address this in the NOFA. However, if the organization is currently meeting the OMB requirements, the Department anticipates that the organization will continue to do so under another grant. A commenter pointed out that the NOFA says grants are awarded within 30 days, and that this should be specified as 30 calendar days. Another commenter requested that the NOFA specify the appeals process to HUD. The Department has adopted both of these suggestions in this NOFA. Several commenters recommended requiring intermediaries to explain why an application was not funded or why items within an application were not funded. The Department has adopted this recommendation. One commenter suggested that applicant resident groups should be able to request the intermediary to provide expertise and assistance in grant activities. Because the Department does not wish to have intermediaries performing activities inconsistently across the country, it has not made this a requirement of intermediaries. Eleven comments were received regarding the NOFA's guidance on competing applications. One area of concern was the time by which another application could be received. Several commenters suggested allowing an applicant 30 days to gain support, others suggested 20 days, another 14 days. Several commenters also suggested giving the intermediary additional review time should two applications be received. Several commenters felt the intermediary should attempt to resolve the situation or require that competing applicants meet and attempt to come to a resolution. Three commenters suggested that in the case of dual applicants, a clear priority should be for resident groups and resident councils over Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. The Department has decided if a second application is received within 30 days of receipt of the first application, the intermediary will have an additional 20 days to complete the review of both. If the applications are for a Resident Capacity grant, the intermediary will give funding preference to a resident group or a Resident Council over another applicant. If there are competing Predevelopment grant applicants and both are otherwise acceptable, the intermediary will send back the applications and give applicants an opportunity to meet, explain differences to tenants, and come to a resolution/compromise. If no compromise is reached the intermediary would fund the applicant that it found most capable of performing grant and nonprofit sponsor activities. The fact that a nonprofit developer is receiving a Predevelopment grant would not preclude a separate resident group from getting a Resident Capacity grant. B. Selection of Intermediaries 1. Fee Structure Twelve commenters were concerned that the proposed fee structure for intermediaries would not yield sufficient funds to cover the scope of services listed in the NOFA. The proposed NOFA contemplated a $5,000 start-up fee, plus 2 percent of the grant awards for the State or States in which the intermediary administered grants. Suggestions ranged from 4 to 5 percent of the grant awards. One commenter suggested that the minimum start-up fee should be $15,000 so smaller States will participate. Several others suggested that the fee should vary according to the level of activities that the intermediary is performing. The Department considered seriously the appropriateness of the fee and awarding a different level of funding to intermediaries performing a higher level of activities. The Department has chosen a processing fee structure through which each intermediary will receive a $15,000 start-up fee and five percent of each technical assistance grant it administers, which will be allocated as the grants are disbursed. Each intermediary will also receive a flat fee of $500 for each grant application rejected. If a selected intermediary receives no grant applications, it will receive only the start-up fee. 2. Intermediary Selection At least one commenter felt that the Department should give preference to local intermediaries, then State and regional intermediaries, over national intermediaries. The Department has decided to allow sub-State intermediaries in areas where there appears to be enough preservation activity to justify a sub-State intermediary. However, any sub-State intermediary must apply to administer grants in a geographic area covering at least one HUD area office. In most States, any economies of scale would be lost if there was more than one intermediary. In its review of intermediaries the Department will review and rate all local intermediaries before reviewing State and regional intermediaries. However, the Department will consider the capacity, experience, and point scores of all local, State and regional intermediaries before making final intermediary selection. National intermediaries will be chosen for those areas for which no other acceptable intermediary has applied. Concern from eleven commenters lead to suggestions that outside parties, particularly resident groups, should be able to comment on the applications and selections of intermediaries. Because the selection of intermediary grantees is competitive, the disclosure of grant applications would be in violation of section 12 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537a), and, therefore, the Department cannot implement this suggestion.
