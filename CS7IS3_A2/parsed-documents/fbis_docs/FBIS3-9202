Fifty-five percent of company owners, managers, chairmen, and their deputies do not approve of Pawlak's performance, while over one-third has no opinion on the issue. The prime minister enjoys only a marginally better approval rate from the state-owned sector (12 percent in favor, 49 percent against), whereas, with regard to the cooperative sector, the approval rate is more or less the same as the average. Such are the results obtained from a poll conducted in February by the Social Research Institute, despite the fact that evaluations of the climate for making money are getting better and better. The results of this research involving a group of more than 500 managers of companies, which is another in a series (fourth in a row), are clearly different from responses obtained during a survey conducted among Poles generally. During a poll of citizens at large conducted in mid-February, 36 percent agreed with the way the prime minister performs his job, whereas 35 percent disagreed. In March, the prime minister's approval ratings suffered a slight deterioration (33 percent approve, 37 percent do not), but these results are definitely better than those obtained during polls of economic leaders. The prime minister's social support basis consists of senior citizens, residents of rural areas, farmers, and the least educated people. The business community is against him, and so are people with higher educations, the young, and city residents. They Would Prefer Another Prime Minister So it is no wonder that, while responding to another question of the survey (which is Poland's only representative poll of company owners and managers), only between 10 and 20 company managers (3.5 percent) said that, in their view, Pawlak would be the best prime minister from the standpoint of the entire economy and of their respective companies. In February of this year, the top consisted of Kwasniewski and Suchocka (each with 11 percent of the voters) and Balcerowicz (9 percent). Apart from them, Pawlak was beaten by Olechowski (7 percent) and Borowski and Korwin-Mikke (4 percent each). The current prime minister suffered a loss compared with December 1992, when 5 percent of the polled company managers were in favor of him. Olechowski and Balcerowicz clearly suffered their own losses in that time period (by a few percentage points); Suchocka suffered a minor loss, while Kwasniewski gained the most (a jump from 2 percent). Government Is Not Approved, Either The rate of approval, or rather of disapproval, for the government is (in the poll of company managers) identically the same as for the prime minister (within the statistical error)--that is to say, it is also very low. Ten percent of company owners, managers, chairmen, and their deputies approve of the way the government does its job, whereas 53 percent do not approve. In this case, managers of companies in the private sector are the most critical, but the differences are minor, and they are mostly due to an increased percentage of the undecided among managers in the cooperative and state-owned sectors. Also in these sectors, it is hard to find signs of approval. It is a characteristic trait that neither Pawlak nor the government as a whole is approved of by those managers who voted for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left Alliance in the September elections. Because there were relatively few company managers who voted for the PSL to begin with, the margin of error may be slightly higher than usual, but there is no doubt that the business community is satisfied neither with Pawlak nor with the government. Those managers who during the elections voted for the parties currently in power are not satisfied, either. At most, there is a somewhat greater confusion for that reason among managers who are left-wing, compared with the rest of the managerial group. Economy Opposed to Authorities The question arises: What is the reason for this phenomenon? Our research provides plenty of data in that regard, requiring thorough analysis--and we will do that. What can be seen immediately is the fact that company managers are critical of the prime minister and the government, despite a positive assessment of the economic climate, generally speaking. Currently, as many as 61 percent of the polled company managers think that there is a climate for making money in Poland. In June 1993, the proportion was 53 percent, whereas, in December 1992, it was 49 percent. The improvement in the economic microclimate, which can be seen in forecasts of higher sales or higher profitability of the managers' companies, among others, is accompanied by current views of worse prospects for the entire Polish economy than was the case in the middle of last year. So the company managers are most probably convinced that their companies will be developing in spite of the authorities that are making mistakes and conducting policies not conducive to the economy as a whole. There are more reasons to think the proposition is true--namely, in response to another question, those polled expressed their concern over the government's economic policies more often than they did a few months ago (22 percent currently, 17 percent in June 1993). But, in all fairness, that was not the issue that was listed as the most important. More often, there was talk about the companies' internal problems, inflation, and the changing legal provisions. Barriers for Development But, with regard to another question, one about what the greatest obstacles are to developing businesses, there were increases by a few more points regarding the changing legal provisions and the high taxes; these, after all, are issues that are directly up to the government to decide. They were listed most frequently already in the past, but right now the percentage of company owners who complain about them reached 70 percent, when it comes to the changing legal provisions, and it exceeded 50 percent with regard to tax levels. Perhaps it is the wave of changes in legal provisions associated with the new team coming to power (these changes were partially prepared by the previous government) and more tax raises that are the reason for the reluctant attitude toward the authorities in power since the fall of last year. We also asked company managers about their approval or disapproval regarding a few specific issues relative to the economy. Only government measures in issues like privatization enjoyed a higher approval rating than a disapproval rating (57 percent and 34 percent, respectively). Regarding other issues that we asked about, lack of approval clearly prevailed. And so the ratios of approving managers to disapproving ones, regarding government measures, were as follows on the following issues: taxes--15 to 79 percent; customs duties and compensatory payments--31 to 55 percent; price policies and inflation--18 to 73 percent; and salary policies--20 to 66 percent. More Than Just Numbers From the standpoint of election arithmetic, the results of the poll are not very significant. In Poland, there are fewer economic units (including one-person partnerships) than there are agricultural farms, whereas there are slightly over 100,000 companies employing at least five persons (which is the kind included in our poll). Despite that, it is obvious that the poll results constitute a serious warning to both the governing coalition and the prime minister personally, and that is due to the specific position and power enjoyed by entrepreneurs and company managers, the economy's leaders. * * * The poll was conducted by the Sopot-based Social Research Institute between 14 and 26 February, using a sample of 516 managers (as chiefs or their deputies) in companies employing at least five persons. Seventy percent of the respondents were managers in charge of privately owned companies, while managers in charge of state-owned and cooperative companies constituted 15 percent each.
