The send-off ceremony itself, scheduled for 31 August, has unexpectedly caused certain difficulties. In a personal letter to Yeltsin six weeks ago Kohl proposed starting the send-off in Weimar, one of the centers of German culture, and continuing it in the grounds of Berlin's Treptow Park. The leadership of the Western Group of Forces categorically rejects Weimar. The former Buchenwald concentration camp is in the vicinity of the city of Goethe and Schiller. In addition, Weimar was liberated by the Americans. A compromise will most likely be found. After all, the farewell could also take place in Wuensdorf, near Potsdam, where the Russian troops' headquarters is located. On 1 July Germany will take over the presidency of the European Union, and Helmut Kohl has already promised Boris Yeltsin that he will promote the question of Russia's joining the Council of Europe, using all his economic and political clout for this. Helmut Kohl constantly urges the West to treat Russia as a great power. Everyone in Germany has made his own preparations for the Russian president's arrival. On the eve of it DER SPIEGEL published extracts from his book "On a Knife Edge," NEUES DEUTSCHLAND carried a lengthy interview with Aleksandr Rutskoy, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE printed an article by Gorbachev aide Anatoliy Chernyayev, and television's second program invited Nikolay Portugalov, a former CPSU Central Committee adviser, to speak. The official program has ended up tightly packed, but it has repeated the route of one of Gorbachev's trips: political meetings in Bonn, a cultural program in Speyer with a visit to the famous cathedral, a brief private visit [uyedineniye] with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his native Oggersheim, in Rhine Palatinate, and then Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Councillors at the German Embassy in Moscow have said that the visit should be rated a "nonconflict" visit or, as people used to say, a "friendship visit." Because there are no unresolved problems, still less disputes, between Germany and Russia today. All possible treaties and agreements have already been signed. Now it is only necessary to fulfill them and exchange opinions. But, whereas all is in order with the treaties, it is evidently too soon to speak of a shortage of problems in bilateral relations. Almost 90 billion marks in aid has gone on nobody knows what. Economic ties are developing according to the old scheme. Trade remains monostructural. Russia exports mainly gas and petroleum products, while machine tools, motor vehicles, and food go in the other direction. According to the data for last year, more than 1,000 joint ventures have been registered -- which is approximately 12 percent of the total number of joint ventures in Russia (the FRG occupies second place after the United States in terms of this indicator). In the foreign policy sphere Russia and Germany have more reasons to strive to improve cooperation. This time Boris Yeltsin will not be able to avoid questions about the new concept of relations with NATO, as Pavel Grachev announced on the eve [of the visit]. People in Bonn and other European capitals have already been pondering the riddle set by the Russian minister of defense. What will a partnership of two very great military structures be like in real life? A great deal must be cleared up during the talks between Yeltsin and Kohl.
