Our request is for a pause for thought, because we maintain that in this way the governability of the country will be guaranteed, but only within a framework of democracy and liberalism." The statement was made by Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League. "The League," according to the communique, "is favorable to the division and not the concentration of powers." Only if this principle will be adhered to "will the League continue with the negotiations." For the time being Silvio Berlusconi has not replied directly to the communique. He did say: "We are here to work, and we hope the others are here to do the same."
