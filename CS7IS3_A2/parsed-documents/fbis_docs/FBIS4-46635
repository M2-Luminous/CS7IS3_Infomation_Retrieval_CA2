Is everything truly taking place the way it is being presented in the sensational newspaper reports we have been reading? [Kostyukov] In my view, the authors of many published materials on the Guardsmen lack objectivity in their approach and treatment of the issues surrounding the Guard's vital activity in Crimea. The problem lies in the fact that they make little effort to ascertain whether or not the facts they report on the pages of the newspaper conform to reality. On the other hand, no one forgets to saturate his material with sarcastic commentary, hang insulting labels on the soldiers and officers without justification, and make every possible "prediction" with respect to their future service on the peninsula... Time and again I have been able only to marvel as I read the missions supposedly assigned the troop unit under my command. I could not even imagine that our brigade was to put its foot down somewhere or take the city by storm, that extended operation would cause our automatic weapons to burn out... Although I am far removed from the journalism profession, as an individual entrusted with great responsibility I am directly concerned with seeing to it that truth alone prevails in the treatment of events taking place with respect to us. In developing their subject material, certain writers truly forget to look before they leap and simply throw out their report. Can it be permissible to relate to this issue in such a manner? I want to tell everyone desiring to write about those under my command that the door to my office, and the doors to the offices of my deputies, are always open to receive editorial personnel. "Come in, be our guest!"--as they say. We are always happy to show you how we live and serve. We will answer any question of interest to you. [Krol] What in your view are the reasons behind the appearance in the press of all kinds of attacks against the Guard? [Kostyukov] I will tell you quite frankly that it is no accident all of this is taking place. Standing behind this flow of filthy propaganda is a certain political or other force whose agenda welcomes the newspaper accounts purposefully directed towards slandering our Guardsmen, accounts that intentionally create a negative impression of them among the local populace. The Guard is standing in the way of certain destructive forces of society striving at any price to achieve the implementation of their plans to destroy the unity and integrity of Ukraine. These forces see us as a threat to themselves and are therefore fighting us with lies, aspersions, and mudslinging. [Krol] In particular, there have been reports concerning a number of conflicts... [Kostyukov] This is the way it happened. On 15 May, three soldiers in a special missions company, on leave, went into a cafe for something to eat. An intoxicated man came up to one of them and started taunting him, to the effect of--what are you doing here soldier, you with the Ukrainian uniform insignia? The soldier had to endure an abusive verbal assault, but decided not to get into a fight and did absolutely nothing in response to the insulting provocation. Only when the man put his fists in motion did the soldier respond with a professional rebuff. The servicemen sat in the cafe a while longer, then went for a walk in the city. However, they were soon subjected to attack by a militia group of eight men armed with automatic weapons. Not understanding what was going on, the Guardsmen were forced to defend themselves from a group that constituted in fact their comrades-in-arms. In this regard, the latter acted without any explanation whatsoever... The soldiers were beat up and accused of involvement in a drunken brawl, although a panel of experts confirmed their absolute sobriety. After all was said and done, they were released to their unit. I do not understand why the militia had to act in this manner, and under a false accusation to boot. Would it not have been wiser to report the incident to the military headquarters and have a patrol sent out instead of conducting an armed assault against innocent comrades? [Krol] What kind of impression can such fabrications impart to people, especially if they do not have accurate information? [Kostyukov] You can only imagine. If I were in their position I would feel far from good about it. I am horrified at the thought of such "defenders." But this has already become the system. God help us if people believe lies. As people used to say in bygone days: The truth cannot even manage to get started in the time it takes a lie to travel the world over. [Krol] What is the military collective of the brigade doing today? [Kostyukov] There is a great deal to be done in resolving problems concerning the rear, making the living conditions of the soldiers suitable. The main portion of our training time, naturally, is devoted to combat and special training. But the most important aspect is the official detail, operating five times a week, aimed at preserving public order in the city. We may assert that we have managed to attain fairly good results in the fight against crime, especially this year. We are assigning more and more military details to assist the militia. This is how citizens are afforded security with respect to criminal attempts on their lives and property. Since the beginning of the current year, soldiers have detained more than 3,200 individuals for administrative violations, seven persons for crimes. Three firearms have been confiscated. A few nuances emerge here, however. In my constant inspections of duty performance procedure, I often discover that not all the internal-affairs personnel comprising a joint militia-Guard patrol treat the performance of their official duties in a fully responsible manner. But I see my most important task as brigade commander in ensuring that all my subordinates become true Guardsmen representing the elite of the Armed Forces, that they serve as an example to all military servicemen. Experience shows that wherever National Guardsmen are stationed and whatever missions they are carrying out, they have always earned the prestige of the local populace. Is there any reason for certain people to fear us? Yes--those who have decided to break the law, to profit from others' good deeds, to raise a hand against the weak... By virtue of our calling, we have been and always will be found where conditions are the most difficult, where people need our help. The people of Crimea can put their complete trust in us, can rely on us for anything. We will not let them down.
