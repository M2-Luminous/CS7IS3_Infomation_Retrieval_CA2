It had been opened by Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who only two weeks ago headed the Russian president's Committee for the Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons. As expected, the organizers did everything possible to exclude critics of official chemical disarmament programs from the forum. However, three dissident scientists--namely Lev Fedorov, Vladimir Uglev, and Vladimir Petrenko--managed to get in, in the capacity of unofficial guests. But only representatives of the press were able to discover their point of view: All three were refused a place on the rostrum. Vladimir Uglev said in conversation with TRUD's correspondent that this was dictated by the Russian authorities' wish to dodge a decision on fundamental questions. In his words, whereas our American partners are attentively monitoring the quantitative indicators of the destruction of toxic substances, the methods of destroying these substances, which themselves present a serious threat to human beings, are still being kept secret and are monitored by no one. The reasons for Kuntsevich's dismissal from the chairmanship of the president's committee are still unknown. Many link it to the fact that the academician's stance on chemical disarmament questions had started to encroach on Defense Ministry interests. His approaches required additional expenditure, and this displeased many people. As for Kuntsevich himself, he said in conversation with TRUD's correspondent: ``I do not know why I was fired. As an ex-military man, I refuse to comment on the fact.''
