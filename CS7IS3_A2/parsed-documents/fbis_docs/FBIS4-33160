In an article published in the latest issue of the magazine PRISMA, Foreign Minister Robaina says there is an idea of adding an economic dimension to the association of all those nations. After saying that Cuba has always been in favor of a united Latin America, Robaina noted that it is necessary to coalesce all the ongoing subregional processes. He added that concurrently, we must defend common positions on political, economic, and social matters, especially matters dealing with regional integration and the participation of the subcontinent in international relations on a just basis. As Robaina sees it, for this to happen, it is necessary to progressively engage the integration of the production and services sectors without disregarding science, technology, health, or education as vital tools for an irreversible and permanent integration. Robaina said this process could be a suitable framework for Cuba to make available its achievements and experiences in social development matters to the region, disregarding ideologies, to resolve common problems requiring urgent solutions. Robaina said his country will go to the Cartagena de Indias summit with the intention of contributing to the strengthening of that important forum at a moment when the hemispheric summit convoked by the United States works against the Ibero-American conferences. Robaina said the Ibero-American Summit remains as a mechanism for concerted actions. The new U.S. democratic Government is trying to exploit the successful approval of NAFTA to protect a good image on the continent and to recover lost ground, Robaina said. After cautioning that Latin America and the Caribbean know they cannot have too many illusions about the results of Washington-called summits, Robaina explained that such meetings make a lot of fuss and yield little. The Cuban foreign minister noted that the hemispheric meeting must be used not to serve the specific interests of the United States, but those of the participant countries and for this reason, the date, site, agenda, and participation for the meeting should be the result of a common agreement and not a unipolar mandate by Washington.
