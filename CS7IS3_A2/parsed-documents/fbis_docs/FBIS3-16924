Thereby Zorkin, in an interview with Interfax on Monday, expressed agreement with a statement by the other CC members, who Monday accused him of breaking the law on the status of a judge by pursuing political activities and demanded that he choose between politics and the judiciary. Zorkin told Interfax he would make his choice very soon, but said his CC colleagues should hardly have slammed him for doing something "aimed at restoring the constitutional system." Dismissal of any CC judge would make no sense these days anyway, for the court "hasn't been operating for the past half year," so "the judges have been suspended anyway. It seemed to me that the signing of the appeal for the new movement, Accord for Russia, would bring forward the moment when the Constitutional Court started to operate again," Zorkin said. Meanwhile, acting CC chairman Nikolay Vitruk told reporters Monday that the CC judges had unanimously qualified Zorkin's step as political and contradicting his status as a judge. Thereby "Zorkin again tried to create a conflict situation in the court. But he didn't manage to do that. We are not against his act as such, because it is aimed at conciliation in society, but one must act by legal means," Vitruk said. He said most of the judges who had formerly supported Zorkin "this time suggested that he resign." Vitruk said the law made no provision for dismissing a judge, but expressed the hope that Zorkin would quit voluntarily.
