Based on the results obtained from the implementation of tasks for the first four months of the year and on the projected developments of the situation till June, we can point out the following outstanding traits: First, the positive financial and economic changes of the past few years have been sustained and developed in the first six months of 1994, thus producing rather comprehensive progress in the areas of economic production, goods circulation, finance, money, and external economic relations with a higher growth rate compared with the corresponding period in the past few years. The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest output so far, up one million tons compared with last year (or an increase of 10 percent). The structure of the rural economy has been reformed in the direction of increasing industrial and special crop yields as well as of promoting animal husbandry, especially aquaculture, and non-farming occupations. The industrial production in the first six months of the year is expected to increase by 12 percent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year (the target put forth for the whole year is 11 percent), with the rather harmonious development of all economic sectors, cities, and industrial centers, a number of major electricity-generating and transport projects have been completed and put into operation. These include the last group of generators of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant, the turbine power plant in Ba Ria, the 220-kilovolt powerline between Ba Ria and Long Binh, the highway section between northern Thang Long and Noi Bai, and so forth. The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt powerline, has been completed as scheduled following two years of countless difficulties and obstacles. This required the greatest efforts to ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operations started on 20 May 1994 and the network will be officially switched on by early June to supply electricity from north to south, thus exerting an overall impact on the national economy and the people's lives. The export value is estimated to increase by 27 percent (the projected yearly target is put forth at 20 percent). Import value is expected to increase by 23.4 percent. The foreign Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first quarter of this year has nearly doubled the 1993 amount. Direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first half of 1994 totalled $2 billion in registered capital, or two-thirds of last year's figure. The amount of capital actually put in use increased by 60 percent over the same period in the previous year. The total value of retail sales is expected to increase by 37.76 percent, meeting the diversified demands of the population with higher incomes and purchasing power. Goods and passengers transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other services have reached new heights. Price indexes of retail sales and services in the first four months of the year increased by 5.4 percent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during the Tet holidays. Since March, prices have stabilized. According to reports from the Statistics General Department, the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent over April with food accounting for 1.1 percent, non-food and foodstuffs 0.2 percent, and services 0.4 percent. If we compare May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has increased by six percent with food and foodstuffs accounting for 11.1 percent, other goods for one percent, and services for 5.9 percent. In short, though prices this year increased more rapidly than the same period in the previous year, they mainly affected food and foodstuffs, a trend that suits the government's policy of not letting the prices of food and foodstuffs fall too low. Regarding domestic budget revenue, it is expected to increase by 50 percent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The annual increase was put forth at 31.5 percent. Phase two of the new wage policy, which would introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage fund, has been developed since early this year in a way that will not cause unexpected price fluctuations but ensure smoother cash flow and prevent cash shortages. The currency exchange rates and gold prices did not show any major fluctuations. The credit system was expanded a step further and the loan payment surplus was estimated to increase by 23 percent compared with the corresponding period in late 1993. The rate of credit loans to the non-state sector -- mainly to peasant households -- increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in the first half of this year. However, positive elements to ensure economic stabilization and favorable conditions for new development steps are not very stable in many aspects. The state budget balance is facing difficulties. Internal and foreign credit resources to cover national overspending are still limited. Monetary circulation still carries unstable factors, and the amount of foreign currencies circulating outside state control is still fairly great. Policies and measures on mobilizing more capital only meet the current demand at a low level. Several agricultural products, industrial commodities, and consumer goods are facing difficulties finding a market. Planning for state investment has been executed at a low level due to lack of capital. Projects funded by loans and several foreign joint venture projects do not have enough capital to get off the ground. The reorganization and rearrangement designed to improve management in the state economic sector and in handling public property, guide and promote domestic investment, improve foreign investment procedures, and establish order and discipline in economic activities in the market mechanism have not scored significant progress. Second, together with economic development and increasing incomes, cultural and social activities have progressed with more students registered at all education levels and better teaching and learning quality; the tertiary education system has been reorganized with the formation of national universities and regional universities; science and technology research has been concentrated more on key programs; management of product measurement and product quality is in progress, and environmental protection activities have been implemented according to the recently introduced law. The information and cultural work have been directed more at the grass roots level. Many activities have been organized to preserve historical traditions and national cultural characteristics and to broaden cultural exchanges with foreign countries. Activities to mark the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory have been held in many diversified and vivid forms, satisfactorily cultivating encouraging and educational effects on different generations. National programs to generate more jobs, prevent and fight contagious diseases, provide family planning services and mother and child care, support sports and physical education activities, eliminate starvation and alleviate poverty, and repay favors to people who have rendered meritorious service to the nation have been implemented widely and become more socialized. The fight against social evils has received better guidance and coordination from the government, mass organizations, schools, and families. The government has supplemented and carried out practical lines and policies to support socioeconomic development in the mountainous areas and in ethnic areas. Many mountainous provinces and districts have established their own economic structure to increase commodity production on the basis of exploiting their local advantages. The government is directly providing guidance to one pilot province and district to draw experiences. State investment in mountainous areas, including allocation to local budgets and projects funded by different ministries, is double the 1993 amount. Since the beginning of this year, many construction projects and investment programs for mountainous areas have been executed. They include projects to build more public roads, provide electricity and water for production and living, expand primary health care, fight against malaria and goiter, restore and build more schools and classes, construct boarding schools for ethnic students, and improve cultural and information services. The state trading sector has been entrusted with the duty of purchasing all commodities and supplying staple goods to mountainous areas. Apart from continuing to grant subsidies to the transport cost of seven types of goods, the government has decided to provide free four types of goods to upland people. These goods are iodized salt, diesel, medicine, and stationery for students. The past progress has prevented the degradation and scored new development steps in some fields. However, the improvement is not great compared to the requirements of our human development strategy in the transitional period for the national industrialization and modernization. The advancement steps are not powerful enough to push back and prevent social evils and to help the spiritual life, morality, and social environment improve and become more useful for economic development in these areas. Commodity production, goods circulation, and material and cultural life for the mountainous people still face many difficulties. Third, our international relations are expanding and consolidating continuously in the direction of diversification and multilateralization. During the first several months of the year, exchange visits of our high-ranking leaders with leaders of a number of countries, especially regional countries, have contributed significantly to improving mutual understanding and accelerating multifaceted cooperative relations. The resumption of normal relations by international monetary organizations with Vietnam, and the lifting of the trade embargo against us by the United States administration early this year have created favorable conditions for normalizing relations between Vietnam and the United States, as well as encouraging cooperation between international organizations and other countries with us. Our international relations are progressing at a relatively fast pace in a positive direction and are contributing to consolidating peace, stability, and cooperation for the sake of national construction. There still, however, were some complicated incidents on the borders, such as recent violations of our economic privilege zone and continental shelf. The situation in Cambodia also contains elements that cause concern. National defense work continues to be consolidated in the recent past, territorial integrity was well safeguarded, all sabotage plots and activities were discovered and suppressed, lawbreakers were subdued, and social order and safety were maintained. The new situation requires the state and people to strengthen their support and create better conditions for the national defense forces so that they can cope with their heavy responsibility. Also, the state management mechanism has achieved good progress in terms of leadership and managing tasks. While consolidating its leadership role and dealing effectively with urgent issues for the short term, the government has also tried to study and resolve essential issues which are strategically important in the new situation, such as the comprehensive plan to combine economic renovation with administrative reform, building up the legal system, planning for major industry sectors and economic zones and for major projects that should be implemented from now to the year 2000. Coordination among the legislature, administration, and judiciary agencies, and with mass organizations in a number of fields have gradually regulated, thus guaranteeing better performance. The pace of reform of the state management mechanism, however, is still too slow. The administration reform has not genuinely functioned yet in reality. The contingent of cadres in many agencies and at various sectors and echelons is displaying the ineptness which makes them unable to catch up with the demands of the renovation. Improper discipline, degenerated morality, and, worst of all, corruption, embezzlement and waste of public property, and extortion, are still popular. Enforcing the law at one's own convenience, or not obeying government decisions is still rampant at not only the grass roots level, but also at some provincial administrations. Several party and state policies, therefore, could not reach the people, or have been misled and made inefficient. These flaws within the state mechanism are the major obstacles in the renovation undertaking and national development. Generally speaking, the socioeconomic situation in the first several months of the year has been developing in a positive direction, ensuring a good possibility to fulfill and even exceed all 1994 tasks as determined by the resolutions of the National Assembly. Difficulties, however, are numerous and serious because of the slowness in rectifying weaknesses we have had for a very long time, and also by the greater demands of the new development stage as well as new complicated developments that affect the protection of national order and safety.
