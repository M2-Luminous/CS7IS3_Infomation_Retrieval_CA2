FR940727-1-00037 FR940727-1-00014 States/tribes are in the process of incorporating these new municipal solid waste landfill standards into their permitting programs and applying for EPA approval of their permitting programs. EPA is currently evaluating these State permitting programs to determine their adequacy in incorporating the new municipal solid waste landfill criteria (40 CFR part 258). As of June 30, 1993, EPA approved thirty-six State municipal solid waste landfill programs. In addition, EPA is actively reviewing numerous State permitting program applications and expects to approve the remaining State landfill permitting programs by April 1994, well before this proposed rule would become effective as a final rule. EPA expects to issue ``partial'' program approvals to some States because their landfill permitting programs may not fully address all elements of the EPA municipal solid waste landfill criteria. For purposes of today's rule, EPA would consider ``partial'' program approvals, as well as ``full'' program approvals, to be ``EPA-approved'' State municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs. Further, States with ``partial'' approval have agreed to an EPA approved schedule for full approval. The Agency believes that limiting today's proposed exclusion to landfills that are permitted by States that have incorporated EPA's new municipal landfill standards will provide further assurance that spent lamps will be safely managed in municipal solid waste landfills. EPA requests comment on this approach and any alternative approaches. The second condition, which limits the proposed exclusion to lamps managed in State permitted, licensed, or registered mercury reclamation facilities, is also consistent with the Agency's support for environmentally sound reclamation of waste. EPA believes that with adequate State oversight, mercury containing lamps can be safely recycled and the mercury reclaimed from them. However, EPA is concerned that, in States without oversight over recyclers, recycling activities could pose a threat to human health and the environment because of inadequate or non-existent waste management controls. Therefore, the Agency is requesting information on recycling operations and practices. EPA is aware that several technologies are available to recycle lamps and recover mercury from them. However, the Agency does not have complete information on which technologies are currently being used by recycling companies and if these technologies can address all different kinds of lamps (e.g., tube, U-shaped, compact, etc.). The Agency also seeks information that tracks mercury as it moves through the recycling process. Further, EPA would like to know the operating capacity of existing or planned reyclers of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency is also requesting information on what markets exist for the mercury and other materials recovered from lamps. This information will be useful to the Agency in understanding and assessing possible risks to human health and the environment as well as to determine the potential or actual use of the materials recovered from lamps in the market. Under the conditional exclusion, regulated lamp generators (i.e., those that generate more than the conditional-exempt small quantity generator (CESQG) limit of 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month which would be about 350 mercury-containing lamps) would not be able to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal. EPA does not propose to extend the exclusion to lamps disposed in municipal waste combustors because of concern over mercury air emissions from these sources. However, this proposed option would not affect municipal waste combustors' ability to continue the combustion of traditional municipal solid waste which contains limited quantities of unregulated household or CESQG mercury-containing lamps. Because mercury-containing lamps do not burn, it is unlikely that truck loads of mercury-containing lamps (i.e., containing more than 350 lamps) would have been acceptable to most operators. The exclusion would assure that this disposal alternative is not considered in any situation. The Agency requests comment on the proposal to limit the exclusion to permitted municipal solid waste landfills (i.e., regulated lamp generators would not be allowed to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal). EPA also requests comment on adding to the exclusion handling requirements to minimize mercury emissions during storage and transportation (e.g., packaging to reduce breakage). These management controls could be the same as those proposed in the universal waste management system. The Agency is interested in data on the cost of and human health protection provided by these handling requirements for lamps.
