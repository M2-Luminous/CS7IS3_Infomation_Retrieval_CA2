The agreement was signed in Ljubljana on December 4, 1993. Peterle and Uhde pointed to the dynamically-growing relations between the two countries. Peterle said at the meeting that no open problems existed between the two countries and described the Czech Republic as a friendly country with strategic importance to Slovenia, for which the Czech Republic is the most important partner. He said that Slovenia and the Czech Republic shared views on entering the European Union as sovereign countries wanting to share in the making of Europe. Uhde criticised attempts at dividing Europe into spheres of interest. Peterle said that the idea "leads to Bosnia-Herzegovina," adding that if particular pressures had not been at play there, the country's problems would have been solved a long time ago. "We want a Europe and not a package of interest spheres," Peterle added.
