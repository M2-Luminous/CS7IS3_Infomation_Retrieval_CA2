FR940810-2-00011 FR940810-2-00008 [A&hyph;307&hyph;809] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Phthalic Anhydride From Venezuela AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly Hardin, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0371. Final Determination The Department of Commerce (the Department) determines that phthalic anhydride (PA) from Venezuela is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination on May 27, 1994 (58 FR 27532), the following events have occurred. On May 27, 1994, we issued a deficiency letter to Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A. (Oxidor), respondent in this investigation, regarding its response to Section D of the antidumping questionnaire. (Section D requests information on cost of production and constructed value.) On June 6, 1994, Oxidor informed the Department that it would no longer be participating in the investigation due to the cost and time required to fully respond to the supplemental cost questionnaire and participate in the verification. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is PA, an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually produced from a primary petrochemical called orthoxylene, although it is sometimes produced from naphthalene. PA is predominately used in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which in turn are generally used to produce plastics and paints. This investigation covers PA sold in either flaked or molten form. PA is classifiable under subheading 2917.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. Our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation is May 1, 1993, to October 31, 1993. Best Information Available As noted in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Oxidor informed the Department that it would not reply to the Department's Section D deficiency letter and that it would not participate in verification. Section 776(c) of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department shall use the best information otherwise available (BIA). We have done so in this investigation. In assigning BIA, the Department applies a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of a respondent's cooperation. Under this methodology, the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise significantly impede the proceeding. See Final Determination: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (1989). The Department's two-tiered methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ( See Allied-Signal v. U.S., 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (CAFC) (June 22, 1993); see also Krupp Stahl AG et al. v. U.S., 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993).) Because Oxidor refused to reply to the Department's deficiency questionnaire and refused verification, we find it has been uncooperative in this investigation. As BIA for Oxidor, we are assigning the highest margin alleged in the petition because that margin is higher than the only calculated rate in this investigation. The highest margin in the petition is 52.00 percent. ( See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Phthalic Anhydride from Brazil, Hungary, Israel, Mexico and Venezuela (58 FR 60847, November 18, 1993), for a description of the United States price and foreign market value used to calculate the above-mentioned margin.) Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 735(c)(4) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of PA from Venezuela, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the margins below on all entries of PA from Venezuela. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Margin percent Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A. 52.00 All Others 52.00 International Trade Commission Notification In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determination. As our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days. If the ITC determines that material injury or threat of material injury does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. However, if the ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officers to assess antidumping duties on PA from Venezuela entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of suspension of liquidation. Notification to Interested Parties This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility covering the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)), and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4). Dated: August 3, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19540 Filed 8&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
