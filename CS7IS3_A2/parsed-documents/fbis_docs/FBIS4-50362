The officials said the strike, which rocked the wholly owned subsidiary of Mabuchi Motor Co., ended after the company agreed to a 45 percent wage increase. They said about 6,000 of the company's 7,000 workers participated in the strike, which began on the night of March 24 with female workers walking out of the workshops. The factory's operations came to a complete standstill for the following two days, they said. Workers demanded an average hike of 300 yuan (23 U.S. dollars) in their monthly salaries, but agreed to a compromise proposal worked out by municipal labor authorities, calling for a monthly wage hike of 135 yuan (10.50 dollars) to an average of about 435 yuan (33.80 dollars), the officials said. They said the demand stemmed from the inflation rate exceeding 20 percent recently. The company offered a regular raise of about 10 percent in April in recent years. In a related development, a Hong Kong newspaper reported Saturday about 2,400 local workers at a home appliances manufacturing firm in Dalian, which is partially owned by Japanese precision instruments maker Canon Inc., have threatened to walk out. A strike was averted when they accepted a raise of 135 yuan (10.50 dollars) in their monthly salaries.
