The BIZNES-TASS correspondent was informed of this in the Ministry of the Economy of the Russian Federation. However, the proportion which this money represents in the total amount of the population's deposits in Russian banks is declining, and today comprises about 60 percent. In the first quarter of 1994 the monetary incomes of the population of Russia were 8.8 times greater than the level in the first quarter of last year and amounted to R53.8 trillion. In comparable prices this amount corresponds to 60 percent of the monetary incomes of the population of Russia in the first quarter of 1991. The population spent R37.5bn (69.8 percent) of the total on consumption -- buying goods and services. This is 5.9 percent less than in the same period last year. The proportion of expenditure on acquiring foreign currency increased more than six-fold to 11.6 percent. In the opinion of experts of the Ministry of Economy, this shows that a stratum of the population has been formed which has a very high and constantly increasing level of income. If one excludes from the population's total income the expenditure on acquiring foreign currency, it turns out that the monetary incomes of the overwhelming majority of the population in the first quarter of 1994 were 7.9 times greater than in the first quarter of last year. However, because of inflation the real incomes showed virtually no increase.
