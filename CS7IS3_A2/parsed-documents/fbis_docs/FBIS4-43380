The economic miracle and the return to the international community were brought about within a very short time. Today, following the European elections, the stress must be on "sense." It is true that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] are unhappy about their serious losses, but the whole of Europe can only be happy about the behavior of the German voters. The Germans have rejected the rat catchers and the terrible simplifiers more clearly than the voters in other countries. The Republikaner (1990 -- 7.1 percent) are no longer in the European Parliament, the "German mark above everything else" party of Manfred Brunner got no more than 1 percent, and the National Democratic Party of Germany stays where it belongs -- at 2 per mill. Even the Christian Social Union [CSU], which conducted a hidden anti-European election campaign in a regionalist disguise, had 1.5 percent less than in 1990. The conclusion is that, in view of these election results, our friends' concerns about the "renationalization" of the Germans are unfounded. The known fact that basically, the European elections are local elections of a national nature changes nothing about this. Even though the Germans (like all the others) have voted on themselves, the outcome is doubly good news for our neighbors. Helmut Kohl, the man with the large Europe button on his lapel, has been clearly confirmed and the Federal Republic has proved to be a model of internal stability, compared with France, Italy, and Britain. The problem child rather is France, where the tickets of outsiders -- bankrupt people like Bernard Tapie, genuine reactionaries like Philippe de Villiers and racists like Le Pen -- have collected a total of 34 percent. If we add the 8 percent of the communists, we have a 42-percent bloc of those who cannot be forced under one flag, but tell people with their ticket that they do not want this system. Britain? It is true that John Major's Conservatives were defeated by Labour, but this is instability of the good kind. A change of power following 15 years of Tory rule is taking shape, which is no reason for concern for any sensible democrat to whom the permanent domination of any political party must be a thorn in the side. What is more, the strong enmity of the British left wing toward Europe has long ebbed away; a Tony Blair would not have to permanently soothe a powerful nationalist wing, as John Major must do. Italy? The ominous fog over Rome has not yet cleared up. What is clear is this: Berlusconi has made considerable gains (10 percent), the neofascist voters do not show any remorse (the percentage of the Alleanza has remained the same), the old parties had substantial losses. Perhaps the 10-percent gains will make it easier for Berlusconi to bring the neofascists down to earth again. However, this would not change the general picture of Italy. With the confirmation of Berlusconi and company, a strong anti-European group is moving into the Strasbourg parliament. Pars pro toto, this is also the 1994 European message: It is not the mild shift to the right, which is of importance, but the strengthening of the European sceptics -- in France and Italy, in Denmark and Belgium. This has also been indirectly confirmed by the low voter turnout -- 56.5 percent is the lowest ever percentage, which signals indifference. In the fourth direct elections, the Europeans have apparently seen how weak the parliament is, compared with those who really wield power -- the Commission and the Council of Ministers. Formulating it more sharply, Europe's fate will not be decided by its parliament in the fourth legislative period either. What is more important is the larger field of forces. The strongest figure in the European structures is Helmut Kohl, but perhaps this is only so because the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU has recently distanced itself one or two steps away from "Maastricht." In European policy, France, the "driving force of Maastricht," could block itself and thus also the German-French "tandem," which has seen itself as the spearhead of accelerated merger. There is an additional decisive event that happened to coincide with the European Union [EU] elections -- Austria's audible yes to European membership. This will at first encourage the "imitators" in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, and subsequently, it will greatly advance the enlargement of the EU by the Eastern European reform states. Looking beyond the European horizon, Euro skepticism, the reluctance to go to the polls, and the EU enlargement may become a historic watershed behind which a light Europe emerges -- a larger but loose integrated system. The more sovereign states seek to become members of the exclusive club, the more sovereign it will be. This is a natural law of international politics, and not even the best intentions can change anything about it. Classical federalists will deplore this. However, what is the alternative? An "axis" between Bonn and Paris? Small European special alliances? What the Six and Twelve failed to achieve in the Cold War, they will be even less able to achieve now. Moreover, following the end of the division of Europe, the principle should be -- "less with many" is better than "much with few."
