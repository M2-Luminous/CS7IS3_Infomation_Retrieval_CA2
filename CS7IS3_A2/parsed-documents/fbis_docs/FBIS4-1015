Police East Rand spokesman Lt Deon Peens told SAPA police were not intervening in the conflict. "The ISD was not back there. Police are doing normal police work, driving around in their bakkies [pickup trucks]," he said. He confirmed the NPKF had requested the assistance of the South African Police [SAP], and directed all enquiries to the NPKF head office. An NPKF soldier could not confirm a report that the force had fired a mortar round into Hostel No 2 in the township. He said it was "very, very busy" in Thokoza. Inkatha Freedom Party Spokesman Ed Tillet said: "The NKPF are totally out of control. They are firing indiscriminately at everyone." Mr Tillet said the car in which IFP Transvaal Political Director Themba Khoza was travelling in the township had been petrol bombed, but this had yet to be confirmed. Police were on Tuesday investigating a rocket-propelled grenade attack on No 2 Hostel in Thokoza. A police spokesman said the RPG7 attack caused little damage and no one was injured. Three people were killed earlier in the day and several others injured in crossfire between township residents and hostel residents, police said.
