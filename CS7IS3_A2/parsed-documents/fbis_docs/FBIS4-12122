FBIS4-12122 "drnes066_l_94005" FBIS-NES-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Beilin: Possible Ramon Exit From Labor `Tragedy' Beilin: Possible Ramon Exit From Labor `Tragedy' TA0604060894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0500 GMT 6 Apr 94 TA0604060894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon is expected to announce on 10 April whether he will run on an independent list in the Histadrut elections. Our correspondent reports that Mr. Ramon invited Likud MK Me'ir Shitrit to fill the second slot on his list. MAPAM [United Workers Party] has agreed to join Ramon's list, while Meretz is yet to decide its stand. MK Me'ir Shetrit said he was still undecided whether to make the move. The Likud candidate for Histadrut chief, MK Ya'aqov Shamay, said Hayim Ramon's announcements might be designed to pressure Yitzhaq Rabin to reinstate him as cabinet minister. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said it would be tragedy for the Labor Party if Hayim Ramon left it to run independently for the position of Histadrut chief. He believed the public health issues over which Ramon had waged a struggle are valid, but the thinking that these issues could be solved outside the party was erroneous. Yosi Beilin leveled criticism at senior Labor officials for showing Ramon the way out, as he put it. I would do everything possible to prevent his secession from the party, the deputy foreign minister told our correspondent this morning.
