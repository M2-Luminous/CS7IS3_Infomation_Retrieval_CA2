He held the United States responsible for the Zionist massacre in Hebron. There is no point continuing the negotiated settlement until the U.S. position becomes clear, he said. Al-Surani assailed demands by Clinton and Warren Christopher that the two sides demonstrate self-restraint, as though Palestine was the aggressor against Israel. He said: I pray God to remove the scales from the eyes of those who imagine something good will come of the U.S. position. It is the United States that provides weapons, aid, and all forms of support for Israel. Al-Surani said the settlement option leads nowhere with the racist usurpers who are embraced by the United States. He called for a prompt meeting by the Arab foreign ministers, or else the Arabs will be colluding against each other. An Arab summit to react to the massacre must be held, he said.
