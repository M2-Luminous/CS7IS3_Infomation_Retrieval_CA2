FR940426-1-00015 FR940426-1-00004 Moreover, a global marketplace has unfolded, characterized by a proliferation of multinational securities offerings. Many foreign issuers now conduct concurrent offerings of their securities in the United States and abroad as well as solely in the United States. This rise in the supply of, and demand for, multinational offerings has required careful coordination of the interaction of the Trading Practices Rules with foreign distribution practices and regulatory requirements. 26 26 See, e.g., Letter regarding Distributions of Certain SEAQ and SEAQ International Securities (July 12, 1993), [1993] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶76,707. B. Commission's Response to Market Developments The Commission and its staff have responded to these developments in the markets and distribution techniques through the exemptive, no-action, interpretive, and rulemaking processes. 27 In 1983, the Commission adopted comprehensive amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;6 in response to changes in the securities markets during the quarter century following their adoption. 28 Among other things, these amendments codified and clarified staff positions that had been developed to deal with various transactions on a case-by-case basis. 29 Further refinements to Rule 10b&hyph;6 were adopted in 1987 to address certain issues left open by the Commission during its comprehensive review and revision of that rule in 1983. 30 More recently, the Commission has issued exemptions to the Trading Practices Rules that recognize the increasingly global nature of the securities markets 31 and enhanced surveillance capabilities. 32 In addition, the staff maintains its active program of responding to telephone inquiries requesting guidance on the application of the Trading Practices Rules and antimanipulation principles during offerings. 27 The Commission is authorized to grant exemptions from the requirements of the Trading Practices Rules. 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6(j); 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;7(p); and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8(g). 28 1983 Release.

It continues to be true that the activities relating to distributions of securities are ``highly technical and complex, and [are] conducted under limitless varieties of circumstances frequently requiring the application of instantaneous business judgment.'' 33 Indeed, the developments discussed above have magnified the challenges to issuers, distribution participants, and the Commission to apply and adapt the Exchange Act antimanipulation provisions and their underlying principles. 33 Foshay, supra note 5, at 919. IV. Purpose of This Release The transaction-driven nature of securities offerings means that antimanipulation rules cannot address every situation that may arise. Although the Commission continues to be responsive to the industry's requests for interpretive guidance and relief from the present regulations, the considerations discussed above suggest that a comprehensive reexamination of the rules is warranted. Some securities industry participants suggest that the Trading Practice Rules can be simplified. Others argue that the rules are unnecessarily restrictive and apply to situations where the manipulative potential is highly attenuated. It has been suggested that alternative regulatory structures may achieve the underlying legal and policy goals of the Exchange Act and address the issues raised by market activities conducted during securities offerings. Accordingly, the Commission is undertaking this review of antimanipulation regulation of securities offerings with a view toward incorporating the above developments and simplifying its regulatory structure. This release is intended to provide a forum for commenters to discuss the current structure as well as alternative approaches to governing trading during distributions. As focus points for analyzing the pertinent issues, the following sections identify the concepts that underlie the present regulations and raise a variety of questions on the implementation of those concepts.
