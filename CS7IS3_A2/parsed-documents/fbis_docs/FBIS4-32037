It sees a way out of the deadlock in a settlement before the next assembly session, and it predicts early elections. This is a brief summary of a news conference held today by the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party], the HNS [Croatian People's Party], the HSS [Croatian Peasants' Party], the SDP [Social Democratic Party], the HND [Croatian Independent Democrats] and the IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly]. Jasnka Dudic reporting: [Dudic] Opposition representatives denied the HDZ's claims that the opposition was less cooperative yesterday than usual and said that the HDZ was inflexible and unwilling to accept any compromise. They stressed that the opposition had decided not to put forward any candidates for the position of vice-presidents, suggested that it would abandon the issue of legality, but demanded that it be allowed to vote on the dismissal and election of the president of the assembly. Since this was rejected, we came to a deadlock, Ivica Racan [SDP chairman] said and announced a meeting of the opposition for Monday [20 June]. [Begin Racan recording] At the meeting we will discuss the possibility of the opposition offering resignations from all its positions in the Croatian Assembly. We will also decide in which way we will take part in the further work of the assembly, but I do not think that we will attend the sessions scheduled for Tuesday. [end recording] [Dudic] The opposition believes that the situation in the assembly does not need to be solved through early elections, but if no agreement is reached, the opposition is ready to accept even that challenge.
