In a survey of the French economy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said output growth should now resume after last year's recession which cut GDP by an estimated 0.8 percent and boosted France's jobless rate to a record 12 percent. It projected growth at a modest pace of 1.1 percent this year, with domestic demand remaining weak and price and wage inflation on a steady downward path as a result of both high unused capacity and high unemployment. Stronger domestic demand in 1995, including a recovery in business investment, would help raise the rate to about 2.5 percent, the OECD said. Even so, it stressed, growth would be too slow to check a still-worsening jobless rate, likely to peak at 12.5 percent by year-end, for an annual average of 12.4 percent both in 1994 and 1995 against 11.6 percent in 1993. The OECD also warned that recovery in France "hinges on a turnaround of activity in the rest of Europe." "There is a risk that it will be delayed again or be weaker than projected," it said. The OECD's projections assumed that French monetary authorities would stick to the "cautious" stance they adopted after the widening last August of the bands of fluctuation in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). On this basis, the OECD said, French short-term interest rates were expected to decline further "in line with German rates" to about 4 percent by end-1995. However, it said, if German rates fell less than projected -- because of a worsening German inflation outlook or similar hitches -- "French authorities would have to consider how to continue their policy of gradual interest rate reductions while maintaining their stable currency strategy" -- aimed at keeping a steady franc-German mark relationship in the ERM. "As no room for fiscal manoeuvre is left, this would be the only way to support demand," the report stressed. Lower short-term rates and positive wealth effects could stimulate activity, and with inflation under control and the exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals, there would be "little risk of adverse impacts" on long-term rates, it pointed out. Making their point clearer, OECD economists said a "crucial" issue for French monetary policy in the new ERM environment was "whether and how a greater degree of monetary autonomy can be achieved" without upsetting ERM currency stability. They suggested a new set of "clear objectives and rules" for monetary policy, tying short-term interest rates not only to exchange rates but also to such indicators as money supply, a range of inflation data, the yield curve and the level of long-term interest rates. If a "credible" framework was achieved along these lines, long-term rates could "durably decline below German levels," they said. The OECD also warned that in the absence of a "sufficiently strong European-wide recovery," France would have to further rebalance its policy mix "in order to make rapid progress" in cutting the towering budget deficit which reached 5.8 percent of GDP last year. While most of the deficit widening since 1991 was cyclical, the structural component had also worsened, and the overall deficit was now "clearly unsustainable" because it entailed a rapid rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The report welcomed government moves to tighten fiscal policy this year, its longer-term programme aimed at cutting the state's deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997, and last year's structural measures to put the social security system on a sound financial footing. But it said action towards these targets was needed "without delay," and reform of the social protection system must be completed even at the cost of "short-term hardship" for some groups. With deficit-reduction risking to dampen recovery, the OECD said, continued cuts in interest rates were all the more warranted.
