According to Grzegorz Dziemidowicz, press spokesman of the MSZ [Foreign Affairs Ministry], for the time being, the text of the treaty is secret, and, until it is initialled by the foreign affairs ministers of both states, the MSZ will not say anything about the issue. OKOPW Chairman Ryszard Szawlowski said at a news conference in Warsaw today that there were reservations about both the preamble to the treaty and the lack of provisions protecting the interests of Poles resident in Lithuania. Although, in accordance with earlier announcements, no persons or dates are mentioned in the preamble, according to him, its provisions clearly refer to specific historical events. The statement about the tragic past and losses of both peoples caused by the Nazi totalitarianism means that the MSZ is giving the Lithuanians "false moral testimony." According to the committee, through their policies toward the local Poles, the Lithuanian authorities violate international standards and decisions contained in the Polish-Lithuanian Declaration, while the present text of the treaty "gives the Lithuanian authorities an instrument to morally finish off the Poles in Lithuania." The Polish authorities have not bothered to ensure that the treaty contains provisions protecting the interests of the 300,000 Poles in Lithuania, including the return of land to Polish farmers or property to public organizations, nor is there an entry concerning a Polish university in Vilnius. The treaty is to be initialled next Friday [18 March], during Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys's visit to Warsaw. The committee representatives said they found out the text of the treaty from "reliable sources" in the Vilnius area. They told journalists that they had talked about the treaty with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak but that he did not say anything about its possible renegotiation. [passage omitted]
