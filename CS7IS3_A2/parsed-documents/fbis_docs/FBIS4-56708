We are here with Mr. Roberto Alfredo Lombana, with whom we will be speaking about what is going to take place with the National Vote-Counting Board. Mr. Roberto Alfredo Lombana, this afternoon, in just a few minutes, the National Vote-Counting Board will be installed. The representatives of each of the political parties are already beginning to arrive. What will the board's main duty be? Basically, what is the National Vote-Counting Board responsible for? [Lombana] Of course. The National Vote-Counting Board is an autonomous body appointed by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] and made up of representatives of the 15 political parties participating in the election process. Our responsibility lies in counting the 40 electoral districts covering the total number of votes of the 5,310 voting tables located throughout the country and to proclaim the president of the Republic. [Cogley] With respect to the vote count, when precisely will the process begin? [Lombana] If the TE continues on schedule as it has been operating thus far, we will be receiving the first circuit vote tally sheets at 2300 [0400 GMT on 9 May]. At that time we will also start receiving the other vote tally sheets. We expect that in four or five days we will proclaim the election winner. [Cogley] How does the National Vote-Counting Board assess the work done by the TE? [Lombana] It has been quite positive. We have received excellent support from the TE and they have helped us to organize this event to such an extent that today, at 1400 this afternoon, we will begin operations. [Cogley] What can you say about the populations' participation? [Lombana] I believe that we are not only witnessing admirable participation by the presidential candidates, but also from the population in general. The mood has been quite festive. [Cogley] Thank you very much Mr. Roberto Lombana for your statements to Telemetro Panama.
