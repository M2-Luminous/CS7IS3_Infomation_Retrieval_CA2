He is expected to sign with Moldavian [Moldovan] President Mircea Snegur a treaty on friendship and cooperation between the two states. The two heads of state will also discuss conditions for large Turkish investments in the Moldavian economy, most of which will be used to develop the southern regions, inhabited by Gagauz, an ethnic group of Turkic origin. The agenda of Demirel's first day in Moldavia includes meetings with President Mircea Snegur and parliament speaker Petr Luchinskiy. The Turkish president is also expected to address Moldavian parliament members. On the next day, together with the Moldavian president, Demirel will visit the southern part of the republic, inhabited mainly by Gagauz. He will be shown several enterprises and farms there. On the last day of the visit Demirel will attend the opening of the Turkish embassy in Moldavia, which will be followed by the signing of Turkish-Moldavian treaty. "Moldavia and Turkey have every chance to pursue a policy of rapprochement, to promote cooperation, and the current visit will turn a new page in the development of relations between the two countries," Demirel stated. "We back the process of negotiations now under way between the Gagauz population and the Moldovan central administration," he added. "It is intended to make our brothers live in their native land with due respect for the territorial integrity of Moldavia, to give them a legal status, contributing to their development. These negotiations are Moldavia's internal affair. The Gagauz, for their part, can serve as a solid bridge of friendship between our two countries." "The treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two countries will give a fresh impetus to bilateral relations and will help overcome the difficulties of the transition period now experienced by Moldova," President Snegur stated today. "Problems linked with the creation of a Black Sea economic cooperation zone will also be discussed during the visit." Snegur noted the Turkish leadership's balanced and well thought out policy towards separatist tendencies in some regions, which threaten peace. "Proceeding from the fact that the Moldavia top leadership is also confronted with this problem, we move to discuss all the possible ways for its effective settlement. We hope that the granting of a special legal status to populated localities inhabited by the Gagauz population will create a precedent for districts on the left-hand bank of the Dniester river, where the centrifugal tendencies are even stronger. The development of relations of kinship with Turkey will allow the Gagauz population to safeguard and pass on their extremely rich traditions and culture to the rising generation." Much hope is pinned on the current visit by the head of the Kamrat (Gagauz) administration Viktor Volkov. He said that the Turkish side had assumed a commitment to make investments in the construction of telephone lines and roads, and in the re-equipment of the Gagauz processing industry. The Turkish president is accompanied by representatives of Turkish legislative bodies, government, business circles, and public organisations.
