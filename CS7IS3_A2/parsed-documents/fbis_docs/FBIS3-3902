Henan Governor Li Changchun applauded the outflow of the surplus labor force from underdeveloped rural areas, describing the results of peasants' job hunting in the following terms: "Obtaining food, coupons, ideas, and connections and finding the path to get rich." Sichuan Governor Xiao Yang called migrant workers China's third great phenomenon after the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and township and town enterprises, saying that these workers gave a hint of what was going on in the labor market. In 1993, 10 million Sichuanese marched out of the basin and sent back to the province over 10 billion yuan. Labor exports have become one of the major sources of income for peasants in the province's poor areas. Guangdong views the vast inflow of migrant workers with mixed feelings. Tens of thousands of migrants are snapping up jobs that are dirty, physically demanding, and shunned by city residents, unwittingly accelerating urban development. The many services they provide for urban residents in their lives and work have become essential to the cities. However, the vast influx of migrant populations have increased the pressure on transportation, urban administration, and the already insufficient infrastructure. Eighty percent of crimes in Guangdong involved migrant workers. At the current NPC session, the Guangdong deputies tabled a motion calling for strengthening migrant population administration. Guo Lin, NPC deputy and vice minister of railways in charge of transportation, called "migrant worker tides" an inevitable result from the market allocation of labor force. When the decades-old "grain rationing" and "work-point system" that tied the peasantry to their land were revoked, peasants could no longer be content with farming drudgery and the leisure imposed on them by the farming rhythm that left them "nothing to do for eight months." They certainly wanted to go out "to get a piece of the action" and earn money wherever they can. The swelling "migrant worker" tide had a tremendous impact on the railway when it was already running above capacity. During this spring season, trains carried 3.08 million passengers a day, 20,000 a day more than the same period last year. With huge passenger flows packing into crowded cars, trains had to carry twice the capacity number of passengers. To ease migrant flows, the Ministry of Railway provided an additional 5,036 contingent trains and cut 10,000 freight trains. Railway bureaus in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Chengdu were forced to use freighters. The rise of township and town enterprises has enabled 110 million of the 400 million-strong rural labor force to quit farming. There are still close to 200 million idle laborers, with 10 million joining their ranks each year. These people need to eat, make a living, and get rich. And the widening scissors gap for "agricultural products" and the lowering comparative advantage of agriculture inevitably set enormous rural surplus labor in motion. It has been forecast that by the year 2000, there will be 100 million peasants joining the "migrant worker" force; that is to say, the "migrant worker" tide is destined to rumble on for many years to come. The appearance of migrant workers carries profound historical significance and indicates the direction of the times. It signals China's reform and opening up and changes ushered in by market economic reforms, and is a by-product of China's transition from an agricultural country to an industrial one. As Gu Shengzu, a CPPCC delegate in Beijing for the session, said: Migrant workers can only be channeled, not blocked. Because the migration of tens of millions of peasants represents in fact the choice of tens of billions of peasants behind them. Such a choice represents an irresistible historical force. Certain disorder and negative phenomena arising from the choice should be seen as the price for reforms. One school of thought holds that the day when the whole rural surplus labor force is successfully transferred to nonagricultural occupations is the day of success for China's reforms. Though this viewpoint may sound a little too extreme, it nevertheless states the essential truth. Without a doubt, once the peasants are freed from the entanglement of the old system and the constraint of the old order, they will certainly become a powerful propelling force for China's move toward a market economy.
