The Chinese Government will introduce a number of major reform measures in the systems of fiscal charges, banking, planning, and investments, which will inevitably promote the overall progress of Chinese society, but will also bring up new problems in public security work in China. A TZU CHING magazine correspondent recently had a special interview with Chinese Public Security Vice Minister Tian Qiyu and asked him to elaborate on how to strike more forceful blows against serious criminal offenses, how to strengthen security control, promote public security structural reform and strengthen the public security contingent itself, and how to build closer cooperation between the police forces of the Chinese mainland and of Hong Kong. I. Jiang Zemin Seriously Puts Forward Requirements on Various Localities Taken as a whole, the present public security situation in China is normal, and this plays the role of guarantor for reform and opening-up and developing the economy. However, criminal cases are still on the rise, and especially prominent are major and malevolent cases. There are, indeed, some places where the public security situation is not good, with criminals running wild and the masses lacking a sense of security. Serious criminal activities have been one of society's hot spots in recent years. Discussing this problem, Tian Qiyu told the correspondent that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to fighting criminal activities, which the masses hate bitterly, and once again have asked law enforcement departments at various levels to increase the strength of their attack. General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee recently asked major party and government leaders and departments of political science and law of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to seriously study the problem of increasing criminal offenses, asked them to study the law, take measures, and do their utmost to contain the momentum of increasing criminal activities. II. Constantly Increase the Strength of Blows Against Criminal Offenses Public security organizations at various levels have attached great importance in recent years to fighting serious criminal activities, and constantly increased the strength of their attack against them. Last year, aiming at criminal activities, they organized and developed extensive and varied modes of attack, rectification, and control. From January to November, public security organizations throughout China cracked over 1.04 million criminal cases, seized illicit money and stolen goods equivalent to 4.08 billion yuan, and captured 3,950.82 kg of heroin. In striking blows against various criminal activities, the public security departments resolutely upheld the dignity of law, laid stress on strict enforcement of law, punished criminals severely and quickly according to law, and successfully investigated and handled a number of major criminal cases and economic cases of great impact. For example: The Yu Zuomin case of Da Qiu County, Tianjin; the Beijing-Moscow No. 3/4 international train case which involved criminal gangs from the eastern region of Russia; the especially big theft of cultural relics in Kaifeng County, Henan Province; and the case of the $10 billion [figure as published] spare credit card of the Hengshui District Central Sub-Branch of the Hebei Agricultural Bank, retrieved huge economic losses for the state. After reviewing the work against criminal offenses in 1993, Tian Qiyu said that in 1994, with "cracking major cases, striking blows at gangs, and pursuing escaped criminals" as the focus, and suiting measures to local conditions, we should struggle to achieve special purposes, and carry out rectification and control over crucial cases. In places where security problems are prominent, we should organize centralized and unified city-wide, county-wide, or even larger operations and seriously battle murder, robbery, theft, and organized crimes. We will continue to challenge bandits and despots along railway communications lines. 1994 is a year of crucial importance in the work of seizing firearms and narcotics in Yunnan, Guanxi, and other southwest frontier areas, and we should spare no effort. The objective is to block firearms and narcotics at the borders and prevent them from coming into the interior. We should struggle unremittingly against smuggling and illegal emigration in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions along the coast, exploit victories, and strictly guard against setbacks. Various localities should strike severe blows at the vicious forces of hooligans in towns and townships. We should maintain sharp vigilance against the infiltration of triads from outside China, must never allow them to set up organizations and recruit members inside China, and will resolutely fight their criminal activities inside China. Moreover, aimed at the increase in major economic and fraud cases, we should step up work to ensure that state and collective property is not lost, or less is lost. Public security organizations at various levels should carry out reform and step up criminal investigation work, increase strength, increase input, improve equipment, step up the building of basic vocational work, and combine modern advanced instruments with the initiatives of the broad masses of cadres and policemen in detecting and solving cases. Presently, it is necessary to emphasize increasing the number solved cases, especially major cases; emphasize the work of prosecuting cases after solving them; raising the efficiency of handling cases; emphasize strict law enforcement and make full use of all available legal weapons; punish severely and quickly serious criminal elements according to law; and resolutely overcome the problems of imposing a financial penalty instead of imprisonment, bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, and lowering the standard of punishment. III. Improve the Legal System, and Strengthen Security Control Relevant data shows that public security departments are actively creating relevant laws and regulations. Last year, the "Announcement on the Prohibition of Using Military Firearms for Business Shooting Activities," the "Announcement on Striking Severe Blows at the Criminal Activities of Theft, Sabotaging Railways, Oil- Fields, Electric Power Plants, and Communication Equipment," and the "Methods of Taking In and Educating Prostitutes and Persons Visiting Prostitutes" and other laws and regulations were submitted to the State Council for release. Public security organizations in various localities also promulgated quite a number of local control laws and regulations and strengthened various public security control positions according to law. Tian Qiyu believed that this year, with rapid development of the economy as a whole and the upgrading of marketization, the growth of various markets will quicken, tertiary industry will further develop, and a great deal of insecurity will continue to exist in production and operations. Therefore, public security control and safety precautions will be needed for new situations and problems. At present, it is important to strengthen social security comprehensive control. Relevant regulations of the State Council and the Ministry of Public Security should be strictly carried out, and security control, traffic control, fire control, entry and exit control, and other spheres should be strengthened. Problems driven by economic interests should be resolutely put right, and public security personnel taking part -- directly or indirectly -- in the operations of trades under their control by use of powers or authority should be strictly prohibited. We should step up the building of local police offices, especially those in the rural areas, build up sound public security organizations at basic levels, and pay attention to bringing their role into play. This year the floating population will continue to increase, and management of these people will be one of our emphases. We should actively study ways to manage the floating population. The contingents who protect and control the masses have played an important role in safeguarding public security, and we should continue rectifying, consolidating, and strengthening them, and actively develop "safety small district" activities, and popularize people's defense, material defense, and technology defense measures. We should educate and help those who have been released after serving sentences or have been relieved of education through labor, and step up the control of key people. It is necessary to actively explore new approaches to strengthening enterprise security work under the new situation. Locality, railway, communications, civil aviation, forestry, and public security organizations should coordinate closely with each other, strengthen security in railway stations, wharves, airports, and forests, and should develop centralized rectification and control in places where problems stand out sharply. In short, we should increase efforts to wipe out evil social phenomena, and make sure we achieve actual results. IV. Carry Out Public Security Structural Reform On this subject, Tian Qiyu declared that public security work must also constantly enhance the strength of reform under new situations and conditions. Building up the people's police patrol system in cities is a major reform of public security work which meets the new situation of reform and opening-up and economic development. In June 1993, the Ministry of Public Security called the "All-China Working Conference of People's Police Patrol in Cities," and developed, on a preliminary basis, the work of the people's police patrol in a number of cities. Shanghai, Tianjin, and some other cities started work on an institutional, standardized, and systematic basis. The rapid development of this work enabled public security organs in large and medium-sized cities to greatly enhance their control of social order, and to frighten criminals, which prevented crimes and built close relations between the police and the people. In 1994 the Ministry of Public Security demanded that various localities should consolidate and strengthen this job in terms of hardware and software. According to the requirement of the State Council, the Ministry of Public Security last year set up a working group in charge of organizational reform, and public security departments and bureaus of the great majority of provinces, regions, and cities also did a great deal of exploratory work. Through repeated study and by pooling the wisdom of the masses, the organizational reform plan of county-level public security organs was worked out, experimental work was gradually spread out in various provinces, regions, and cities, and many localities even began reform experiments in some of their vocational departments. While performing structural reform, it is also necessary to pay attention to the building of the public security contingents, and great efforts should be made in anticorruption work and instilling honesty. Concerning this, Tian Qiyu stated that, in August of last year, the Ministry of Public Security set up a special working group to fight corruption; called an anticorruption telephone conference of public security organs throughout China; stipulated the "Regulations on 10 Not-Alloweds for Public Security Organs and Public Security Cadres and Policeman," and "Decisions on Abolition of 16 Items of Indiscriminate Fee Collection"; and sent out investigation teams to various localities for supervision. This year, on the basis of summarizing last year's anticorruption struggle, we should continue investigating and dealing with major cases; resolutely punish corrupt people; overcome the problem of people knowingly violating the law; and punish those who break the law while enforcing it, bend the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, and encroach on the interests of the masses. We should further build up a sound internal supervisory and constraining mechanism of public security organs, and actively explore and develop a supervisory system that conforms with the vocational characteristics of the people's police. We should strengthen the management of public security contingent, and build up and improve various rules and regulations. We should firmly grasp the opportunity to implement public servant regulations and start building up an entire set of rules and regulations on contingent management that links with the public servant regulations and police regulations and conform with the characteristics of public security organs, so as to make contingent management more standardized and in line with the legal system. V. Cooperation Between the Police Forces of Both Sides Is Fruitful Discussing the present situation in which Sino-British negotiations have broken down as a result of the fact that the British side adhered to a wrong position and practiced the "three violations," Tian Qiyu, as a member of Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, declared: The disruption of Sino-British cooperation is what we and the broad masses of our compatriots in Hong Kong are unwilling to see. We hope that Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable, and the Chinese police force hopes that Hong Kong will experience fine social security order. After the establishment of the meeting system in 1984 between the public security organs of the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong police force, both sides held working meetings every year in Beijing and Hong Kong and cooperated in battling criminal offenses involving firearms, smuggling, narcotics trafficking, economic crimes, and triad criminal offenses. Cooperation between the police forces is fruitful. To my knowledge, the police forces of both sides achieved splendid results in recent years in pursuing crimes involving the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Since 1991, public security organs in the Chinese mainland have handed-over 60 recovered luxury cars stolen in Hong Kong, and 24 such cars were returned last year alone. In recent years, mainland public security organs have delivered dozens of criminals to the Hong Kong police force: 15 in 1992, and 17 in 1993. They joined efforts against crime, and forcefully frightened criminals, which obviously reduced serious criminal cases of gun robbery and car theft that took place recently in Hong Kong. Auto theft cases in Hong Kong dropped by 46 percent, and crimes involving guns dropped by nearly 50 percent, which played a positive role in stabilizing social security in Hong Kong. Representatives of public security organs from the Chinese mainland who went to Hong Kong for investigation and to deliver evidence also won enjoyed the positive cooperation of the Hong Kong police force. Such cooperation is advantageous to maintaining the public order of both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Tian Qiyu said: We hope such cooperation will be further strengthened and developed during the later stage of transition. To further promote the understanding between the police forces of the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, we will enlarge exchanges in police vocational work, education and training, technological equipment, and culture and sports through working meetings, exchange of visits, and friendly contacts. We also welcome friends of the Hong Kong police force to come to the mainland for tours, vacations, and to visit relatives. We not only welcome visits from the upper and middle levels, but also visits from the lower level. We not only welcome Chinese, but also welcome those of non-Chinese descent. We welcome them to visit the Chinese mainland mainly for the sake of increasing understanding and strengthening friendship, so that both sides will coordinate more smoothly and more effectively in the preparatory work during the later stage of transition. When the correspondent asked about the appraisal of the Hong Kong police force and its use after 1997 -- a general concern of Hong Kong police circles -- Tian Qiyu calmly replied: We have talked about this issue on many occasions. The overall quality of Hong Kong policemen is quite good, they are highly efficient in handling affairs, and they have played a proper role in maintaining the social security of Hong Kong. They not only play an important role in ensuring the smooth transition of Hong Kong during the later stage of transition, but will also be an important force for maintaining the public order of Hong Kong region after 1997. During the later stage of transition, the social security of Hong Kong remains the responsibility of the British-Hong Kong authorities. The great majority of Hong Kong policemen "love their motherland, and love Hong Kong", and after 1997 they will not be discriminated against politically because they worked for the British-Hong Kong Government. The Hong Kong police force is an important component of the Hong Kong civil service. The policy of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong civil service naturally applies to the Hong Kong police force. We hope that the police force will dispel their misgivings, be relieved, and keep their mind on their work. We are convinced that the police department of the SAR government will continue to use and promote them according to their personal qualifications and record of service, experiences, abilities, and their actual performance in maintaining the public order of Hong Kong during the transitional period. With the approach of the return of Hong Kong in 1997, we hope that the police force of the Chinese mainland and that of Hong Kong will continue to strengthen cooperation, and work with concerted effort for the smooth transition and successful return of Hong Kong.
