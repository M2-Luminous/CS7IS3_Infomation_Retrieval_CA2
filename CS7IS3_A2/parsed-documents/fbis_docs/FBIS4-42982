This was stressed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand at the conclusion of their 63d summit in Mulhouse, Alsace, on Tuesday [31 May]. Both men emphasized that the EU must not become an "elevated free trade zone" because of enlargement. "This was not the intention of the founders. This is not our intention," Mitterrand said. "For me enlargement and deepening is no contradiction," Kohl stressed. The chancellor stated that Mitterrand's announcement that he will invite the Eurocorps and those politically responsible in the participating countries for the military parade on 14 July, the French National Day, is a "wonderful gesture."
