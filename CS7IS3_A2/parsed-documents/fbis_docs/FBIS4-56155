The economic team has been working with several ideas involving the curtailing of credit immediately after the implementation of the real. They are concerned, however, about the need to prevent people from creating a consumption escalation as a result of a sudden drop in the inflation rate, because that would cause prices in the new currency to increase. The dilemma now is to figure out the population's demand for currency. Once the economy is stabilized, there will be a remonetization phenomenon, that is, the exchange of money invested in certificates for currency. No one knows the volume of certificates that will be converted into money. All everyone knows is that if demand and supply are big, there will be strong inflationary pressure on the recently created currency. Gustavo Franco, director of the Central Bank International Area, has already warned that the monetary base (currency in the hands of the public plus bank reserves) will not double. In February, the monetary base totalled 0.6 percent of the GDP. This is equivalent to $2.5 billion. Franco added that there will be a significantly tight money supply. It must be recalled that the market has invested nearly $100 billion in the banks. This money crutch will be enough to ensure that only a small portion ends in the pockets of the people. To give an idea of the amount of money invested in the banks, it must be said that more than $20 billion were invested in the savings pass books in February. The money invested in private certificates totals $30 billion. Before defining the money crutch model to be adopted, the team wants to ensure budget balance because without this, it will be useless to control credit. The objective is to prevent the government from issuing money to finance common expenditures of the public machinery and then issue certificates to collect this money, thus creating sources for price increases.
