A senior Hezb spokesman Nawab Saleem while commenting on the foreign Office statement, said in Peshawar on Wednesday that the claim was not understandable. "It is rank unawareness of the realities," Saleem said. A Foreign Office spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad on Wednesday that the Hezb-e-Eslami was not taking part in the current war in Kabul. The spokesman further said that fighting was continuing between the forces of Commander Ahmed Shah Mas'ud and Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostam. The Hezb spokesman said that the statement was in clash with the previous impartial stand of Islamabad on the Afghan issue. "The fact of the matter is that the Hezb was attacked by the Rabbani forces and Shoora-e-Nazar in Kabul without any provocation." Saleem said, adding, "the Hezb had to retaliate in its defence. The other forces, who were already fed up with the dictatorial policies of Rabbani and Mas'ud, also took up arms to get rid of such a rule, Saleem explained. He said that his party was not able to understand the motive behind the statement against the Hezb-e-Eslami.
