He used the words in a context in which he stressed how U.S. President Bill Clinton has successfully achieved important tasks, such as the enactment of NAFTA, despite great political obstacles. Apparently, Christopher has tacitly called on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to similarly take "political risk" in exercising leadership. One of the greatest reasons for the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit talks held last month is said to be that the United States was disappointed that Japan would implement income tax cuts -- aimed at boosting its domestic demand -- strictly for one year only. In some quarters of the ruling coalition parties, voices can now be heard saying that "the prime minister should have said income tax cuts would be carried out not for only one year, but for three years." If he had an accurate grasp of the situation, the prime minister, as the highest-ranking official in charge of Japanese politics, certainly should have been able to express his "determination" to carry this out. This, then, must be what it means to take "political risk." Regarding political reform, Prime Minister Hosokawa said immediately after his inauguration that he would "take political responsibility if it cannot be carried out by the year-end." In this regard, there seems to be a considerable gap in his political stance then and the stance he is currently taking. However, it is also true that should the prime minister have made such a remark, there would again have been great turmoil within the ruling coalition government. This is because regarding the consumption tax issue in particular, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is the largest among the ruling coalition parties, would persist in expressing "opposition" to it, considering it wholly as a domestic issue -- and as a rather short-sighted election campaign slogan, at that. Even now, there are "opposition" headquarters against the consumption tax set up at the SDPJ headquarters and its local chapters. Regarding consultations among the ruling coalition parties on tax system reforms, circumstances are such that in some quarters of the SDPJ, there have emerged voices expressing pessimism about implementation of tax system reforms by the end of the year. The party thus fails to see such matters in relation to Japan-U.S. ties. Recently, the official party organ of the SDPJ carried a statement by Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, who said: "During the days when the SDPJ was an opposition party, it would suffice, in many aspects, for the party to chant the line, `Japan-U.S. relations are the most important among bilateral relations.' Now, that is not enough." However, the SDPJ never even chanted such a "line" when it was an opposition party. What it has historically advocated was a "pro-Soviet, anti-U.S." policy. Even now, the party still has not formally withdrawn its opposition to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It remains indifferent to such concerns as that deteriorated economic relations could eventually affect security ties. At a time when the post-Cold War situation continues to drift, political parties -- regardless of whether they be ruling or opposition parties -- bear the responsibility to decide on policies and determine the course of their political action, not looking only at domestic affairs, but also opening their eyes to view the rest of the world. The Diet, which, under normal conditions, should be conducting serious deliberations toward restoring strained relations with the United States, has been unable to hold budget committee meetings. This situation is nearly tantamount to political parties' failing to fulfill their responsibilities. In view of the upcoming July Naples summit, the government is currently hastening compilation of a package of measures to appease the United States. However, voices have emerged pointing out that Prime Minister Hosokawa seems to have little part in the process. It is believed the prime minister should come forward and fulfill the responsibilities which accompany his saying "no" at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting.
