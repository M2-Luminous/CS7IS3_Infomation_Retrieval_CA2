NODONG SINMUN in an editorial titled "Invincible Is the Korean People's Army Advancing Under the Party's Leadership" says: The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on April 25, 1932, 62 years ago. It was a historic event which gave birth to the revolutionary Armed Forces of the Workers' Party of Korea, true revolutionary Armed Forces of chuche type. The founding of the KPRA meant the brilliant realisation of the ages-long desire of the Korean people to have their own strong army and the beginning of the proud history of the heroic Korean People's Army (KPA). Our revolutionary Armed Forces which were founded and have covered a glorious course of victory under the guidance of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song are now on a new, higher stage of development with general Kim Chong-il, a great iron-willed brilliant commander, as their supreme commander. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said: "Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and grit, outstanding wisdom and commanding art as befits the supreme commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees a constant strengthening and development of our revolutionary Armed Forces and their invincibility." The immortal exploits performed by our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il in the cause of building our revolutionary Armed Forces are, first of all, that he propounded the most correct and unique military idea and theory, clearly indicating the road ahead of our People's Army. His military idea and theory cover all theoretical and practical matters arising in the building of revolutionary Armed Forces in our time, ranging from the mission of the Army of the working class to the principle and way of Army building and the unreserved demonstration of the Armed Forces. With this chuche-oriented military idea and theory, our revolutionary Armed Forces will firmly maintain their revolutionary character as the Army of the leader, the party and the people and reliably defend our cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation under whatever conditions. His exploits are also that he strengthened our revolutionary Armed Forces with his outstanding and tested leadership into a matchless Army firmly prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique. The entire officers and men of the People's Army are upholding the leadership of the respected comrade supreme commander and performing heroic feats and working miracles in military service with the revolutionary will to defend him with their lives as rifles and bombs. Our People's Army is displaying its proud looks as invincible revolutionary Armed Forces with powerful means of attack and defence and unique tactics of chuche. His exploits are also that he consolidated the ideological unity between the Army and the people through a thorough application of the idea of Army-people unity. The officers and men of our People's Army always love the people and devote everything for their interests. Our people actively support and encourage the People's Army both materially and morally. Thanks to the singlehearted unity of the Army and the people around the respected comrade supreme commander, we can defeat any formidable enemy. The leadership of comrade supreme commander is the life and soul of the People's Army and a decisive factor for victory in army building and military activities. The entire people and the KPA officers and men must uphold the leadership of the respected supreme commander General Kim Chong-il with loyalty and filial piety with the conviction that they will certainly win because he is leading them, and defend the party and the leader with their lives in singlehearted unity. An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that the KPA and the Korean people will as ever demonstrate its ever-victorious might under the leadership of the great General Kim Chong-il.
