American Business Continues To Explore the Russian Market"] [Text] "We want to begin a new era of cooperation between the United States and Russia based on growing possibilities for trade and investment," as U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown defined the goal of his visit to Moscow. And although it is still early to speak about the approach of a new era, Brown's mission can mobilize business connections of the two countries which are lagging much behind the level of their political dialog. The American delegation included representatives from such world-renowned companies and corporations as Motorola, Occidental Petroleum, Litton Industries, Oil Capital Limited, Macdermott International and Allen And Associations International. In the opinion of the Clinton administration, the flow of investments into the fuel-energy complex, space science, the creation of telecommunications systems and the production of medicines will allow the Russian to see more graphically the fruits of reform and to accelerate their implementation. One of the tasks of Brown's trip, which is being called the economic continuation of Bill Clinton's and Boris Yeltsin's Moscow meeting, is to urge American investors to enter Russia more boldly. The level of American investments in Russia today comprises one billion dollars [$] out of a total volume of American investments of $490 billion. By comparison, Americans invested $239 billion in Europe, $68 billion in Canada, $26 billion in Japan and $13 billion in Mexico. Testing the soil for possible investments in Russia, Brown's team visited the Urals, the region where 80 percent of the largest defense industries are concentrated. Of these already 250 have undergone conversion. The great possibilities of the Ural region and its well know independent economic policy attracted the Americans. It is no accident that in recent years more and more foreign investments are pouring into the region and that Western businesses are more often looking at it, justly evaluating it as a prospective trade partner. During the course of Brown's visit a number of agreements were signed, one of which provides for opening American business centers in a number of Russian cities, mainly in the Urals and Siberia. These centers will not only help American firms arrange business matters in a specific region, but will also aid in the development of Russian firms which wish to cooperate with American colleagues. In addition, along with Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, the head of the U.S. Department of Commerce signed a statement which views the main task as opening up access to the markets of both countries. While ongoing plans for Russian-American economic cooperation were being further worked out in Moscow, the end of COCOM was officially registered in The Hague. However, as U.S. State Department representative Michael [McCarey] stated, until a new system of export control is created Washington will continue to maintain a strict licensing plicy regarding trade in goods based on high technology. Therefore it is no accident that in the bilateral trade relations between Russia and America the emphasis is on consumer goods. However, the list of prospective products delivered to Russian from the U.S., which was drawn up by the American side, includes machinery and equipment for the oil and gas industry, fertilizers, equipment for the food industry, medicines and medical preparations, medical equipment, computers and many other items. At the same time, the Russian market will not see American high-tech products except for telecommunications. Therefore Brown's mission has special significance. It would like to prove that this is the first swallow [bird] of large-scale Russian-American economic cooperation and not a smoke screen intended to hide existing problems and contradictions in bilateral cooperation. The 52-year old Ronald Brown is a lawyer by education and has the reputation of being "a strong and independent advocate of American business interests. He arrived in Moscow with his "team" of 29 large industrialists representing four sectors: oil and gas, aeronautics, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.
