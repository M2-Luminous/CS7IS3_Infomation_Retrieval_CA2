FBIS4-60771 "drsov084_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Latvia Reportage on President, Prime Minister's Moscow Trip Reportage on President, Prime Minister's Moscow Trip Troop Withdrawal Agreement To Be Signed WS2904193494 Tallinn BNS in English 1607 GMT 29 Apr 94 WS2904193494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 29, BNS -- Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia will sign an agreement Saturday [30 April] on the withdrawal of 12,000 Russian troops from the Baltic country by Aug. 31. The Latvian president will be accompanied on the visit to Moscow by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs and other officials. The key to the accord was an agreement this week by negotiators in Jurmala, Latvia, on the issue of social guarantees for 20,000 retired Russian servicemen living in Latvia. A special protocol on the military pensioners will be attached to the main withdrawal package, chief Russian negotiator Sergei Zotov said Friday. According to Russian and Latvian officials, the protocol says both sides will help servicemen who want to leave Latvia, and will set up a special fund to assist them. "This document removed the last objections which the Latvian side had regarding the whole package. Therefore, the road was cleared for the visit of Latvia's president to Moscow," Zotov told the Interfax news agency. Officials in Moscow and Riga confirmed that Ulmanis will sign the entire package -- the main agreement, three related accords and the Jurmala protocol -- in the Russian capital. The accords would include one on social guarantees for the Russian military for the period until the final withdrawal of the troops, a rent agreement for the Skrunda radar station that Russia is going to keep under its control during the next 4+1.5 years, and an accord on social guarantees for the retired servicemen. Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers declined to elaborate on the concessions his country had made to reach a consensus with Russia. He said it would be difficult to properly understand the nuances without reading the whole text of the agreements. Ulmanis' political adviser John Eichmanis said the amount of rent that Russia will pay for the Skrunda base was the last issue that remained outstanding. "We expect it to be settled in Moscow," he told The Associated Press. But Eichmanis expressed doubt whether the withdrawal package would be raftified by Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, which has a large percentage of Communists and nationalists, or the equally nationalist Latvian parliament. Latvian chief negotiator Aivars Vovers said the issue of the amount of rent to be paid by Russia for the Skrunda station was to be settled before the meeting of the presidents in Moscow. The leader of the Russian delegation, Sergei Zotov called the latest negotiations a waste of time that Latvia had forced upon Russia. He accused Latvia for lacking flexibility since the very beginning of the talks, despite what, he added, an agreement was reached. The Russian Ambassador to Latvia, Alexander Rannihk, in a conversation with the Latvian president said that a number of foreign countries had indicated Moscow would be held responsible if the talks with Latvia ended without an agreement. Moscow officials also say it is possible that the presidents on Saturday will sign only the main agreements and that the rest of the documents would be signed by the prime ministers in the presence of the heads of state. Yeltsin has said he is ready to sign all four documents in the package. About 130,000 former Soviet soldiers have pulled out of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia since the Baltics' regaining of their independence in 1991. None are left in Lithuania, but about 12,000 remain in Latvia and 2,300 in Estonia. After Latvia has signed the accords on Saturday, Estonia will be the only Baltic country not to have reached an agreement with Russia on troop withdrawal.
