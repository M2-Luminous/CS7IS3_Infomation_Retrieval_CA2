FBIS4-52022 "dreas088__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-088-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Ministers, U.S. Officials To Meet on Trade Ministers, U.S. Officials To Meet on Trade OW0305205994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 May 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0305205994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] In hopes of resuming the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Japanese cabinet ministers and deputy ministers will meet their U.S. counterparts one after the other towards the latter part of the consecutive holidays in May. Being a minority government, the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata finds it difficult to hammer out a strong trade policy. On the other hand, the United States is faced with the problem that further appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar could have an undesirable effect on the U.S. economy. Since a prolonged dispute could shake the very foundations of both the Japanese and U.S. Governments, there is a possibility that both governments may take this opportunity to try to move towards each other. Japanese and U.S. officials plan to meet informally, taking advantage of international conferences they are scheduled to attend. On 6 May, Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, is scheduled to meet Ronald Brown, U.S. secretary of commerce, in Warsaw. Subsequently, Sadayuki Hayashi, vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], is scheduled to meet Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state (in charge of economic affairs), during an OECD meeting in Paris to be held 9-10 May. As a minister in the new administration in charge of the framework trade talks, MITI Minister Hata hopes to gain U.S. understanding by explaining the administration's intention to promptly carry out deregulation and other plans even while its faces difficulties in trying to work out differences between ruling and opposition parties. During his meeting with Spero, Hayashi is expected to listen to, among other things, specific U.S. requests in connection with conditions for resuming bilateral trade talks that were recently indicated by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech. Regarding Japan's new flexible approach, the United States considers the approach to be "merely a temporary deferment," while the United States plans to "watch how Japan will now handle the situation." However, the U.S. Commerce Department and other government agencies have shown growing concerns that the bilateral trade friction may lead to depreciation of the U.S. dollar, stocks, and securities. Thus, there are indications that in some quarters of the U.S. Government, there are some officials calling for reconsidering the hardline policy the United States has taken against Japan. As the series of meetings among Japanese and U.S. officials are to be held under such circumstances, it is believed that these meetings may turn out to be an opportunity in which both Japan and the United States, while taking into consideration their respective problems, can coordinate their opinions toward an early resumption of the trade talks.
