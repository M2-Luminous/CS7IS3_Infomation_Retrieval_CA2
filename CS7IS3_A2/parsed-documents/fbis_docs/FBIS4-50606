"We will seek to buy existing banks run by Chinese in Indonesia and establish leasing companies to provide financial support for the Taiwan businesses there," Liu said. Taiwan-invested businesses in Indonesia mostly rely on foreign banks and the Jakarta office of the China Trust Commercial Bank for loans. Liu, during his visit to Jakarta in April, approached several leading conglomerates with the plan and reached a preliminary agreement with a South Korean bank in May. Liu also said that in addition to Indonesia, the KMT is also planning to buy a bank in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer to Mainland China in 1997. He said that the plan to run banks and other financial businesses is only part of the party's "all-out" overseas investment policy. Manufacturing and trading industries, he added, will follow.
