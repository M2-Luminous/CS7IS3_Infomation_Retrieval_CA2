It has been ascertained that Talabani is already on his way. It has also been ascertained that Turkey has been trying to convince the two sides to end the clashes in northern Iraq and that these efforts have begun to yield positive results. It has been reported that Talabani and Barzani have conferred by telephone several times during the past three days and agreed to a cease-fire. There is a very strong possibility the two leaders will meet in Silopi in a few days. Sarcil Kazaz, Jalal Talabani's representative in Ankara, is currently in Damascus. He has replied to the questions HURRIYET put to him by telephone. Kazaz said: "We have been in constant touch with the Turkish officials during the past few days. Turkey is a friendly and neighboring country and we take its views very seriously." Kazaz also asserted that Talabani left for the region after reaching an agreement with Mas'ud Barzani by telephone. Stressing that he will travel to northern Iraq through Turkey, Kazaz said: "A meeting could be held in Turkey. However, that has not yet been finalized." The Turkish officials have confirmed Kazaz's disclosure. Ankara Warned the Two Leaders It has been reported that Turkey has decided to take certain steps because the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has gained significant strength as a result of the clashes between the supporters of Talabani and Barzani. Ankara has warned the two leaders--who have been trying to find allies against each other--not to cooperate with the PKK. The Turkish officials are reported to have warned Talabani and Barzani that Turkey will support the opposite side and provide it with arms and logistical support if any of them decides to cooperate with the PKK. It has also been reported that Talabani reacted positively to Ankara's warning. That has dispelled the relatively chilly atmosphere that existed in his relations with Ankara for a rather long time. Meanwhile, Ankara continues to be worried about the emigration of Turkey's Kurdish citizens in southeastern Anatolia to northern Iraq. In fact, it is expected to make a disclosure on the condition of the Kurdish citizens who have been forced to emigrate by the PKK. It has been reported that it may call on them to return and guarantee that the Government will consider their complaints.
