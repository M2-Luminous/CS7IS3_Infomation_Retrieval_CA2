Orientation in just one direction is not advantageous for our country and will not yield the desired results." Lithuanian Head of State Algirdas Brazauskas stated this in his customary Monday interview on national radio. "In my view, a very important and one of the main priorities in Lithuania's foreign policy activity is close cooperation and unity with the Baltic states," he noted. "I do not see the sense in and reasons for revising relations between Lithuania and Russia which, I am convinced, should not deteriorate in the coming year. We hope that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the democratic forces which are forming or have already formed in the new parliament will correctly understand this tendency in the Baltic countries to have a benevolent attitude toward the Russian Federation as a neighbor country, and will be agreeable to maintaining normal relations," the head of the Lithuanian state stressed.
