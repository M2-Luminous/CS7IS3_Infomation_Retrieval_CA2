With the exception of the traditionally-inclined Istiqlal [Independence] Party, which has previously called for the absorption of these groups, the other opposition parties, especially the Socialist Union and Democratic Action, have viewed with discomfort the growth of the role of the Islamic groups. Their political bases in Moroccan universities, especially in Fes and Casablanca, have clashed with Islamic movements, while the Party of Progress and Socialism (formerly the Communist Party) has not ceased calling for resistance to these groups, which had virtually overwhelmed Morocco's universities, in return for a drop in the influence of the traditional parties. Its leader, Ali Yata, brought up this question in political and official meetings, demanding an end to the exploitation of the universities by extremist Islamic groups. The same is the case with the imams of some mosques, who oppose the existence of a communist party in the country. While the opposition parties' campaign in defense of Shaykh Yacine is part of the process of bringing up the problem of human rights conditions in the country, and to obtain the political and financial support from these groups in support of opposition aims, it is noteworthy that some political parties have recently raised the issue of working together with the Islamic groups. Their condition is a commitment to a political plan based upon legality. According to opposition politicians, there are dozens of Islamic organizations in Morocco at work raising religious awareness. Some of them bear a political stamp, which imposes a formula for dealing with them, particularly as the Islamic groups have shown their presence in the large demonstrations held during the Gulf crisis and in labor holiday festivities. The Socialist Union's acting leader, Mohamed Yazghi, said that these groups had voted for the opposition parties in the recent legislative elections in major cities such as Rabat, Sali, and Fes. Lawyers affiliated with opposition activities have defended members belonging to the Justice and Charity Society led by Shaykh Yacine in several trials in 1990. This was not the case in the 1984 trials, when a plan to disturb the country's security, led by extremist groups linked with foreign parties, was uncovered. In this context it may be mentioned that the Moroccan Government is formulating a plan for confronting the extremist Islamic groups, typified by its ban on mosques engaging in political activity. It has stopped the imams of some mosques who had been engaging in these activities. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs undertook the opening of a dialogue with the Islamic groups committed to admonition and guidance rather than forcing themselves into political controversy. It is noteworthy that the leaders of Islamic movements in several Arab and Islamic movements participated in demonstrations held in Casablanca as part of what was known as the Islamic Awakening Community. It has been decided that Morocco will, in the coming weeks, host a conference of ministers of Islamic affairs from the Arab and Islamic worlds, to discuss the idea of coexistence and reconciliation among Islamic sects. The Islamic Awakening Community will focus, in a conference to be held this month, on studying this question and other related problems, in cooperation with Islamic groups. Concerned persons believe that the call of the opposition parties, whose agendas diverge from the direction of the Islamic parties, has to do with putting political pressure on the government, by putting thorny problems before the recently-created Ministry of Human Rights. The least of these would be the studying of the conditions of detainees belonging to Islamic groups, and urging international organizations to show renewed concern for the state of human rights. Those who follow these developments say that the political goal in raising this issue appears obviously through their presentation in Parliament, where it was possible for the Consultative Council on Human Rights, concerned with the defense of human rights, to study it. Opposition party circles themselves do not hide their discomfort at this trend, which could backfire on the opposition itself, as the affiliates of the Islamic groups mistrust the role of the traditional parties, and go farther than they do in the field of implementing Islamic law. There is nothing indicating the possibility of agreement between the agendas of the two sides, though they both agree in opposing the government.
