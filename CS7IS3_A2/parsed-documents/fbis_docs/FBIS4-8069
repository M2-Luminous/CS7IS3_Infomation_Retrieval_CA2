The seven-strong highly specialised unit gave precise locations of Serb forces surrounding the enclave. Two U.S. F-16s joined the NATO attack and destroyed at least two Serb tanks. Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, called for the action after Serb forces reached the outskirts of the town where some 65,000 people have been holed up by the fighting. Several patrol groups from the Hereford-based SAS regiment were ordered into a number of Muslim enclaves following a specific request from Gen Rose, himself a former SAS officer and commander. Trained to operate in small self-sufficient patrol teams they are the ideal reconnaissance troops to feed back information on front line positions and weapons. UN military sources in Zagreb said of the SAS soldiers: "They were providing information on the ground which would have a bearing on air support." The decision to mount the attack came after a crisis meeting in Sarajevo between Gen Rose and his superior, General Bernard de Lapresle, the commander in charge of all UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, an United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said. Gen Rose had earlier been en route to Brussels but turned back in Split because of the gravity of the situation. U.S. planes have engaged Serb air forces over Bosnia in the past but this was the first premeditated strike of its kind. It was also the first time NATO had launched air strikes to deter Serb forces from attacking a UN-declared "safe area" in Bosnia. The threat of air strikes forced the Serbs to withdraw their guns from Sarajevo in February. Major Dacre Holloway, the UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, said the airstrike operation was "still on-going" and damage assessment was under way. He said no British planes had been involved in the strike. "They are NATO aircraft involved -- we do not discriminate between them," he added. "Damage assessment is taking place. The whole operation is on-going at the moment," he added.
