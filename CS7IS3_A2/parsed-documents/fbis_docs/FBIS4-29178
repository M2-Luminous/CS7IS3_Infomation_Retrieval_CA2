Although the act was meant to oppose an IAEA resolution to freeze technical aid to the country, it runs counter to the international community's hope for nuclear nonproliferation. Thus, it is very regrettable. It is unclear whether this is Pyongyang's final attitude toward the problem of the country's suspected nuclear weapons development. But its withdrawal from the IAEA will not bring a solution to the issue. We again call for the country to hear the opinion of the international community. Prior to Pyongyang's announcement, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa visited South Korea and China to discuss the DPRK's suspected nuclear program with his counterparts. In Japan-ROK talks, the two countries agreed that the time has come for the UN Security Council [UNSC] to take appropriate measures, including economic sanctions, and that such measures should be aimed at encouraging North Korea to change its attitude. Meanwhile, in Japan-PRC foreign ministerial talks, China questioned the effectiveness of sanctions and stressed the need to resolve the issue through dialogue. In this sense, China has not changed its cautious approach toward imposing sanctions. However, considering the fact that the PRC did not express clear opposition to sanctions, and that it abstained from a vote on the IAEA resolution calling for the freeze of technical aid to the DPRK, it can be said Beijing has indicated some flexibility in dealing with the issue. In talks with the United States, Japan has asserted implementing phased sanctions. It said the United Nations should first adopt a "resolution of warning," and then it should lay an embargo on the export of weapons and suspend technical aid to the DPRK, and finally it should implement all-out sanctions, including the suspension of remittances to the country. Some U.S. newspapers reported the Japanese assertion, commenting: "Japan is reluctant to carry out economic sanctions against North Korea." The Japanese Embassy at Washington strongly rebutted it, saying: "The report is inaccurate." In a series of talks, Foreign Minister Kakizawa reiterated Japan's position that although it strongly hopes for resolving the issue through dialogue, "Japan will take responsive measures within the limits of the Constitution if the UNSC makes a decision." Japan has taken a position against nuclear proliferation. Thus, if the DPRK promotes nuclear development, it will affect the basis of Japan's security policy. Japan, the United States, and the ROK should not be in disarray over a basic policy toward the DPRK. Otherwise, Pyongyang will continue to take a hard-line attitude. It is very regrettable that when the nuclear issue has entered a serious situation, Japan has made no in-depth discussions on the matter. The government has failed to discuss fully the nuclear issue because of opposition parties' attempt to nail cabinet ministers down with a slip of tongue to urge them to step down. At the same time, the government has avoided discussions on detailed measures to deal with the issue. This is problematic. At a 13 June House of Councillors' Budget Committee session, officials of concerned ministries and agencies were asked about the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK. Without exception, they all answered: "We are studying measures, but we cannot disclose them." If the government continues to take such an attitude, there will be no progress in discussions on the nuclear issue. It will also remain unclear what the "within the limits of the Constitution" means. Senior officials of both ruling and opposition parties are concerned about what will happen after the budget bill is enacted. They are only arguing whether they should submit a motion of no confidence against the cabinet or the cabinet should resign en masse. Such an attitude is tantamount to the evasion of responsibility to be assumed as people's representatives and will endanger the nation's future.
