The document, titled "Let's Become Guerrilla Warriors," tells in detail about how the extremist group spend their daily lives and engage in training as guerrillas. The document is about 140,000 words long. The document was likely written before an agreement last September between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied territories. The Red Army has been working under the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a more militant arm of the PLO. The paper describes the group's military training and daily lives in camps where they said they can watch international satellite news programs such as Cable News Network. They wake up at 6:00 a.m. and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. and when there is a holiday or a member has a birthday they make Japanese traditional foods such as rice balls and "kamaage-udon," the document said. The extremists, always carrying handguns and wearing military uniforms mainly made in South Korea, live in block-like huts in the summer and winter and live in tents the rest of the year. The group calls for more support from Japan, saying "the day will come when the world will be united as one. It depends on us, and your way of life and strife." Japanese authorities, noting there is a plan by supporters in Japan to publish the document as a book, said the paper was written in a more gentle manner than previously done and that the group aims to appeal to a larger audience. The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series of hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.
