The unit of the coalition's Tax Reform Consultation Group also urged an early enactment of a basic law to promote the decentralization of power. The decentralization of power and local administrative reforms should be pursued before tax reforms are implemented, according to the report. The proposal is intended to promote local administrative reforms and the consolidation of local communities, the officials said. The proposal is expected to be incorporated into a package of recommendations a subcommittee on administrative and fiscal reforms under the consultation group will make within the month, they said. Government ministries, however, are expected to resist the proposed abolition of regional bureaus, government sources said.
