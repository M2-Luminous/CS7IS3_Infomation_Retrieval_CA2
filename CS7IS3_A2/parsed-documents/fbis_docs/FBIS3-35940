This is an all-time high in Russian-Chinese trade since 1991. According to Bely, China holds second place after the FRG in trade with Russia. Bely believes that China is a very profitable partner for Russia. Last year's trade balance between Russia and China was 2 billion dollars in Russia's favour. True, Bely admitted, there is Moscow's clearing debts to Beijing and also, as he said, "we owe China one billion [currency not specified] for goods credit granted to Russia in 1991-1992". Bely also noted that the problem of quality of Chinese goods imported in this country remains. "But if we were not keen on cheap goods, Russia could also purchase high-quality Chinese commodities supplied to Europe and America," he added.
