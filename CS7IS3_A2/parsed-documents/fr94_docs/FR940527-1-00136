FR940527-1-00136 FR940527-1-00014 Under §412.348(d), the amount of the exceptions payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to that system. Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period. New hospitals are exempted from the capital prospective payment system for their first 2 years of operation and are paid 85 percent of their reasonable costs during that period. A new hospital's old capital costs are its allowable costs for capital assets that were put in use for patient care on or before the later of December 31, 1990 or the last day of the hospital's base year cost reporting period, and are subject to the rules pertaining to old capital and obligated capital as of the applicable date. Effective with the third year of operation, we will pay the hospital under either the fully prospective methodology, using the appropriate transition blend in that Federal fiscal year, or the hold-harmless methodology. If the hold-harmless methodology is applicable, the hold-harmless payment for assets in use during the base period would extend for 8 years, even if the hold-harmless payments extend beyond the normal transition period. IV. Proposed Rate-of-Increase Percentages for Hospitals and Hospital Units Excluded From the Prospective Payment System The inpatient operating costs of hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system are subject to rate-of-increase limits established under the authority of section 1886(b) of the Act, which is implemented in §413.40 of the regulations. Under these limits, an annual target amount (expressed in terms of the inpatient operating cost per discharge) is set for each hospital, based on the hospital's own historical cost experience trended forward by the applicable rate-of-increase percentages (update factors). The target amount is multiplied by the number of Medicare discharges in a hospital's cost reporting period, yielding the ceiling on aggregate Medicare inpatient operating costs for the cost reporting period. Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a hospital that has Medicare inpatient operating costs in excess of its ceiling is paid its ceiling plus 50 percent of its costs in excess of the ceiling. Total payment may not exceed 110 percent of the ceiling. A hospital that has inpatient operating costs less than its ceiling will continue to be paid its costs plus the lower of_ •Fifty percent of the difference between the inpatient operating costs and the ceiling; or •Five percent of the ceiling. Each hospital's target amount is adjusted annually, at the beginning of its cost reporting period, by an applicable rate-of-increase percentage. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1994, section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act provides that the applicable rate-of-increase percentage is the market basket percentage increase minus the lesser of one percentage point or the percentage point difference between 10 percent and the hospital's ``update adjustment percentage'' except for hospitals with an ``update adjustment percentage'' of at least 10 percent. The rate-of-increase percentage for hospitals in the latter case will be the market basket percentage increase. The ``update adjustment percentage'' is the percentage by which a hospital's allowable inpatient operation costs exceeds the hospital's ceiling for the cost reporting period beginning in Federal fiscal year 1990. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994 and before October 1, 1997, the update adjustment percentage is the update adjustment percentage from the previous year plus the previous year's applicable reduction. The applicable reduction and applicable percentage are then determined in the same manner as for FY 1994. The most recent forecasted market basket increase for FY 1995 for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system is 3.7 percent.
