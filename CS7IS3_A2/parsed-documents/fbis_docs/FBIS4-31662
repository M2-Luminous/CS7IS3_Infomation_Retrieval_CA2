In reply to a question from SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA on whether he thinks it is democratic for foreign states to influence Slovak voters, he said that these countries have the right of veto in admitting new members into the European Union and that we cannot prevent them from doing this. In reply to other questions from SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which has obtained information that government members have increased their salaries without the agreement of parliament, he said that this is not true, and, in reply to a question on whether he thinks it is right that the government has exempted the daily NARODNA OBRODA from tax, he said that he knows nothing about it. He did not rule out the possibility of forming a postelection coalition with the Party of the Democratic Left. He said apropos of the HZDS: "A coalition with Chairman Meciar is not being taken into consideration for the KDH."
