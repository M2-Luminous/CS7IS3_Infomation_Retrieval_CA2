Mr Buthelezi said he wanted to talk only peace with Mr Mandela. "There is no question of me being persuaded by him or anyone to ensure the IFP's participation in the elections," Mr Buthelezi said in a memorandum prepared for delivery to National Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys in Ulundi on Monday. "I have nothing further to talk about on this issue, particularly with Mr Mandela...I hope he does not waste his time by trying to persuade me to accept this." Mr Buthelezi said Tuesday's meeting was a follow-up to their peace summit in June last year when they agreed, among other things, to address rallies together. But this had not happened, he said, in spite of meeting ANC Chairman and Deputy Secretary-General Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma in September, 1993 when they discussed possible dates for the joint public addresses. "I gave them October 16 and 17 as being possible dates...I have heard nothing further from them until last week when Mr Zuma contacted me about tomorrow's (Tuesday's) meeting." Mr Buthelezi criticised Mr Mandela for what he described as an offensive statement that he, Mr Mandela, was prepared to go on his knees to the IFP president to prevent bloodshed. "The insinuation...that I am responsible for the bloodshed, I throw at him with the contempt that it deserves." Mr Mandela was also reported as saying he wanted to persuade Mr Buthelezi to participate in the April poll. "I am prepared to co-operate with Mr Mandela in any efforts that we agree can end or reduce the levels of violence," Mr Buthelezi said. On the election, the IFP leader said his party would not participate because of the interim constitution which did not allow regions to have exclusive powers. He said Mr Mandela had also told him during their June meeting the ANC was opposed to a federal system. "We do not accept the constitution. We do not intend entering the elections. And indeed we oppose the constitution and the election with every democratic means at our disposal." But, Mr Buthelezi said, he alone could not make a decision to participate in the elections. "It is an IFP matter as much as it is a Freedom Alliance issue. I want there to be no illusions about this, and understanding this before our meeting tomorrow will contribute a lot to making our meeting fruitful and meaningful."
