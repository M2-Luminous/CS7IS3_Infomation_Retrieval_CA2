In a statement to AKHIR KHABAR, Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, who recently returned from an official visit to the French capital, said that he, as well as the Arab delegations participating in the Arab-European parliamentary dialogue, were surprised at the official French stand vis-a-vis Jordan. He added that they discussed the matter with the French officials, particularly since we in Jordan are not aware of this matter. Abu-'Alim said: The Jordanian Embassy in Paris is aware of this. I personally met with Mr. Bouchar [name as published] who is currently the head of the Middle East Political Desk at the French Foreign Ministry. He added that the French official admitted that Jordan was mistakenly placed on the terrorism list. The French official said: The French Government will discuss the matter. AKHIR KHABAR has also learned that the [Jordanian] Government is currently holding contacts with the French officials in this regard and that it expects the situation to be addressed before declaring the official French stand which is known to French political figures. The French foreign minister visited Israel three weeks ago and refused the meet the Jordanian deputies who visited Paris.
