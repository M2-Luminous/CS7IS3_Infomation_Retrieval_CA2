[Dallul] The summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian Arab President Hafiz al-Asad was mainly based on the integration between the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Furthermore, I say that this summit--and there is no illusion in what I say--is the result of this physical integration of the Lebanese-Syrian level, and the coordination and consultation with the Jordanian track. This integration of the Arab tracks, despite the deviation of Palestinian brothers from the semi-Arab consensus, forced all who deal with the dossier of the Middle East negotiations to follow a distinguished new approach with the Arab parties directly concerned with the negotiations. In other words, the steadfastness of the Syrian and Lebanese front, and to some extent, the steadfastness of the Jordanian front, have been the basis of the political developments that were crowned by the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva. All those concerned with the Middle East negotiations on all levels became aware that the political breakthrough they made on the Arab tracks, and precisely through the Gaza-Jericho agreement, was not enough to make a settlement, even a distorted one, on the Palestinian track itself, so how can this be the case with the other tracks? The deformed agreement that is called the Gaza-Jericho agreement does not represent even a small portion of the Palestinian people's aspirations, so how can this be the case with our Arab nation's aspirations for comprehensive, just, and real peace? Briefly, I say we and Syria have not been apart in very serious circumstances. Therefore, we will not be apart today after we reaped together the result of our steadfastness and integration. [Faqih] How will the positive atmosphere be translated on the negotiations table? Are there assurances on pressuring Israel in order to advance the Lebanese and Syrian tracks? [Dallul] Our only assurance for employing pressure on Israel is through continued integration of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. This is the only guarantee for reaching a just and honorable solution. Some quarters tried to ignore or even to delay negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, and some international and regional forces tried to undermine the size of Syria and Lebanon in the settlement. They also tried to inflate the size of the Gaza- Jericho agreement in order to overshadow the whole cause, but we, on the Lebanese side as well as on the Syrian side, stressed that Palestine is an Arab cause, therefore, it concerns all Arabs, and no party, whoever they might be, has the right to say that this cause is his particular cause or his area, in which he deals in the manner he deems appropriate. [Faqih] What is the role of the U.S. full partner? [Dallul] We have no illusions about this. The U.S. partner has declared its full bias to Israel. During the main phases of the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the United States financed and even supported all Israel's wars against the Arabs. Furthermore, it provided an international and political cover for the Zionist state. But I speak now about the U.S. interest in all of this, and in this particular stage. Now the United State is the sole superpower in the international political arena, therefore, what interest do the American people have in antagonizing Arabs, who have huge human and economic capabilities? What interest does the United States have in supporting Israeli aggressions against Lebanon, for instance? I ask this question about U.S. interests, and I do not find convincing answers that call for continued U.S. adoption of the aggressive Israeli policy. Therefore, I assume that the United States is heading for a change in its alliances. I do not have facts indicating any major change in this field, but what is needed is to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict with some objectivity. [Faqih] Does Lebanon still stick to its position not to participate in multilateral negotiations unless progress was realized in the bilateral negotiations? [Dallul] Lebanon still sticks to this point in particular and refuses to participate in the multilateral negotiations. We do not have any other formula for negotiations other than the current formula. [Faqih] Suppose Israel proposed a joint committee with Lebanon in exchagne for a commitment to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 425? How would you react? How do you envisage the work of such a committee? Will you approve of the security arrangements? What role would the Lebanese Army play? And what will become of Hizballah and the resistance and the South Lebanese Army [SLA] ? [Dallul] Resolution 425 provides for an Israeli pullout from the occupied Arab territories not linked to security arrangements or a military committee with the Israeli enemy. Lebanon has publicly rejected any security arrangements with Israel. We have made our rejection of any joint military committee known as well. The Lebanese Army is now set to deploy in all Lebanese territories, including those under Israeli occupation. As for the weapons in the hands of Hizballah and the resistance, the areas where the Lebanese military deploys will be off limits to any other weapons. As for what you call the SLA, we have never recognized it. For us, it is outside national legitimacy. We will deal with it accordingly. [Faqih] Assuming Antoine Lahd recognized the l-Ta'if accord and the SLA surrendered their weapons to the state, is it possible that it would end up the way other militias did? Would the other parties and forces agree to absorb some 3,000 agents? [Dallul] There is no comparison between the SLA and other Lebanese militias. These militias have fought each other for many years and for a variety of reasons, each adhering to what it viewed as its own princples. But none of these have strayed outside their Lebanese fold, or sold out to the devil the way the SLA have. In any case, Lebanon has its judicial and legal authorities that will decide the way to handle the SLA. [Faqih] Has a link been established between Israel and the recent explosions in al-Sayfi and the attempt on the life of the Lebanese president? Don't you think such leaks are detrimental to Lebanon's credibility? [Dallul] In criminology, we first look for who stands to gain most from a crime. In the case of a homeland, the evidence is usually more conclusive and damning. Lebanon is going through a state of growth and recuperation, and is emerging from a terrible civil war. There are ongoing attempts to restore credibility in Lebanon, with powerful forces working in the opposite direction. If the military confrontations are over, there is still a more ferocious battle that we have to fight, and that is the struggle for peace in Lebanon, for the Lebanese people's civilizing, cultural, democratic, and economic roles. The rehabilitation effort is attended by compelling and destructive circumstances, pressure, and siege on all sides. In our battle for peace our weapons are not that many. The only weapon we have is the will and determination to build. There are attempts to undermine the confidence we are seeking to restore to Lebanon's security and economy and to kill the saplings before they put forth their leaves, with the object of wrecking all that we have built and scrapping the al-Ta'if agreement. [Faqih] Who will benefit from this? [Dallul] The crime leads to the criminal. In any case, it is not far removed from Israel, although the direct perpetrator is not necessarily an Israeli. [Faqih] Will the negative stands affect the pope's visit to Lebanon? Can the Lebanese security organs protect the pope? [Dallul] There were no negative stands regarding the pope's expected visit to Lebanon. Some political sides declared political stands regarding this visit and expressed their desire that the Vatican maintains a balanced policy vis-a-vis the Middle East issue. However, there were no negative stands in the full sense of the word. With regard to the capability of the Lebanese organs to protect the pope, it is certain that our organizations can provide such protection with efficiency. Those who can protect the entire homeland can protect its guests, even if the guest is the pope. [Faqih] Is the Syrian presence in Lebanon subject to discussion? [Dallul] There is no such problem as the Syrian presence in Lebanon. This presence came in response to an official and popular legitimate Lebanese request to confront the plot against Lebanon and the Lebanese. This presence contributed in a basic fashion to stability in Lebanon and to reaching this situation. I say this presence was a solution, not a problem; it was a solution that stopped the bloodshed and brought an end to the fire that was spreading to every street, house, and village in Lebanon. This presence created a suitable atmosphere to lay down the bases of peace. [Faqih] If Israel withdraws all its forces from southern Lebanon, can the Lebanese Army, with its limited capabilities, control the entire border and prevent infiltrations and fedayeen operations that would renew tension on the borders? [Dallul] First, I would like to assert that the Lebanese Army can protect the Lebanese borders with its capabilities, which we are trying to develop. The capabilities of the Lebanese Army are not as limited as some people might think. This army stood up in the face of the recent Israeli aggressions and resisted them, with its available potentials -- with its hands, weapons, and determination. The army's determination is an important weapon. The decision of steadfastness and fighting is the most important weapon. Yes, this army can protect the Lebanese borders. With regard to the fedayeen operations, these operations are launched because dear parts of our land are still under Israeli occupation. So, when this occupation ends, there will be no need for fedayeen operations. [Faqih] It has been reported recently that there will be government change or reshuffle following the Geneva summit? [Dallul] Why should there be a change or a reshuffle following the Geneva summit? I see no reason for this, although the possibility of a government change in Lebanon exists under less important circumstances. This government will be changed when the reasons for its continuation have ended. This is not an important issue. People are not as important as the policy of the government or the general outlines governing its trends.
