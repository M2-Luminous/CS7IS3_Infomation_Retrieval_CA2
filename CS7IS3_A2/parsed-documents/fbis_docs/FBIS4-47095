An entire 87 percent say they are deeply worried about how they should go about getting a residence permit. A third of them are relying on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to help them. Significantly fewer are depending on Alexander Rutskoy (15 percent) and Vladimir Zhironovskiy (16 percent.) This is some of the information which Estonian academics found out from a sociological study financed by the Olof Palme International Center of Stockholm. The report was made public on Tuesday [7 June] at a press conference held by the Estonia Academy of Sciences in Tallinn. According to a law adopted in 1993 by the Estonian parliament, permanent permission to remain in Estonia will be given only to those retired officers from the old occupation force who have reached age 60, or whose wife or children are Estonian citizens. Those who worked for the KGB or the military intelligence organization (the GRU) will not be allowed to stay. In Estonia there are currently 10,500 retired officers, according to Russian military authorities. But according to Estonian officials these number "at least 11,500," in addition to an unknown number of family members. Russian officials have so far refused to hand over name lists, so no one knows for sure. This has also meant that the opinion sampling is uncertain, and that the results of the study may be open to question. Of the 10,500 officers, around half are believed to fulfill the criteria for having their individual applications approved. Half are under 60 years old, many under 50. Of those interviewed for the study, only 31 percent believe they can get a residence permit. Thirty-five percent do not think they will get one. Thirty-four percent say they don't know or refuse to answer. 78 Percent of Estonians Say Russians No Danger Estonians assert that many of the retired Russian officers may become a dangerous "fifth column." Seventy-eight percent of those queried deny that the Russians could become "dangerous" for Estonia. Only eight percent say they are interested in possessing personal firearms. Estonians have confidence in the UN, US, Germany and Sweden regarding helping solve problems of the retired officers. How many of the former-Soviet officers should be able to stay in Estonia? All, demands Moscow. Only those who the law permits, say Estonians. (Thusly, more than half.) The Estonians are not willing to compromise on this point. This would require amending the law. Neither President Lennart Meri or Prime Minister Maar Laar can promise this, nor is there currently any majority at all for this in the Estonian parliament.[passage omitted]
