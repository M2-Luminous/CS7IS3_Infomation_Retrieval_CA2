In other words, about 800 armed men are still operating in a disorganized manner in small groups. The Army reported that throughout 1993, there were 247 clashes, 137 murders, 105 kidnappings, 254 assaults, 58 burned vehicles, 19 cases of sabotage, 29 group demobilizations, and 1,059 confiscated weapons. It is said that the remaining armed groups are less important and will be fought through Army operations, especially in the coffee zones. Army General Humberto Ortega assessed the actions needed to bring about peace in the country. [Begin Ortega recording] We can surely say that there is greater security now than last year and the year before that. A specific example is that early this year and halfway into last year, tens of thousands of all kinds of weapons were in civilian hands, but they are no longer in their hands because those weapons were destroyed. Between 1992 and 1993, we have destroyed more than 150,000 combat devices of all types. Undoubtedly, removing these weapons has improved security. Moreover, the groups that were here with [word indistinct] legitimacy because they had their enclaves, seven enclaves, and enjoyed the political support from certain sectors, from one side or another, no longer exist. There were several thousand. They included El Indomable [Jose Angel Moran], El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], Pedro el Hondureno [Victor Manuel Gallegos], the revueltos [mixed groups of recontras and recompas], and others. Those people no longer exist. They are no longer there defying the authorities, defying public order, or defying the Constitution. They were disarmed thanks to the amnesty. In this way, actually, we have made, objectively speaking, some progress in offering security to the country. Now, what we have today is a higher crime rate. In other words, the ending of the danger of belligerent armed groups of the political sort, [words indistinct] has coincided with an increase in the socioeconomic crisis and in the crime rate, which is the case in all countries. The only difference is that, in our case, there are still certain individuals who did not take advantage of the peace process and who failed to surrender their weapons. They [words indistinct] criminals who have [word indistinct] those criminals in small groups. They are dangerous because they still have some of these combat weapons. Therefore, this is basically the danger we are facing. Undoubtedly, between 1990 and the present, we have definitely achieved substantial progress in national security. [end recording]
