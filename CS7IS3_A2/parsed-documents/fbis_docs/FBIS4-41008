What Russian Parliamentarians Became Convinced of in Latin America"] [Text] Russia is ready for partnership relations with South America. Convincing the Latin Americans of this was the main task of a Federation Council delegation's official visit to Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador. The purpose of creating a political climate in Latin America favorable to Russia is meant to facilitate the development of mutually advantageous economic and trade relations between our countries. The great potential of the region, which occupies 13 percent of the globe's land mass with a population of around 450 million people, the complementarity of our economies, and the similarity of our economic and sociopolitical processes are preconditions for this. All the leaders of the countries that the delegation visited spoke of the need to organize strategic collaboration with Russia. The Brazilian president, for example, noted that "this is needed to prevent the creation of a unipolar world." The Brazilians let it be clearly known that it is time for Russia to "stake its claims" in Latin America. Unless it lays a long-term basis for Russian-Latin American relations, the region's leading countries will quite soon "reach the peak of the world hierarchy without taking Russian priorities along with them." Meetings with representatives of Latin American countries' business circles demonstrated their readiness to cooperate with Russia primarily in the sphere of private enterprise. Here they stressed the importance of the "sponsorship" of future projects by presidents, foreign ministries, and other official state authorities. The Russian side also believes that relations in the private sector can to some extent compensate for the transitional difficulties in foreign economic ties with Latin America associated with the crisis in the previous model of the Russian economy. In order to facilitate these contacts there must be a renewal of the legal and treaty base of relations with Latin American countries. Treaties have already been concluded with a number of them, and memorandums have been adopted on the principles of bilateral cooperation. Draft agreements on protecting investment and avoiding double taxation are being elaborated with many of them. These questions have been repeatedly raised at meetings between the Russian delegation and their Latin American colleagues and entrepreneurs. They are very important as regards developing trade and increasing the volume of investment in the Russian economy. The Latin American market is also fruitful for Russia from the viewpoint of high technology. Venezuela has great experience in the sphere of oil extraction and refining, and it is recommissioning once-abandoned wells by using the latest technologies. Brazil is ready to cooperate with us in the aerospace and nuclear power generating spheres. Finally, we must not forget Peru, Nicaragua, and Cuba -- Russia's debtors. We must seek a settlement in relations with these countries in order to recover the people's billions: These countries' total debt is estimated at over $20 billion. The changes that have taken place in the world are forcing Russia to look at the former Third World in a different way. The countries of this vast region in the Western Hemisphere will no longer be an arena for rivalry between the "superpowers." At any rate, for as long as a democratic Russia exists.
