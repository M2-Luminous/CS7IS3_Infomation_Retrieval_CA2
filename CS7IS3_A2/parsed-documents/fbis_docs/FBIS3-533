The TEC ordered Mr. Shill to stop the scheme yesterday, accusing the government of abusing its position for electoral gain. However, Mr. Shill said the sole objective of his department was to enable people to obtain adequate housing. Mr. Shill is not required to comply with the order as it has no force or effect on the government. Mr. Shill said the principles and details of the scheme had been negotiated with a wide variety of organizations over a protracted period. The scheme has being implemented within the current budget, and no new money had been allocated.
