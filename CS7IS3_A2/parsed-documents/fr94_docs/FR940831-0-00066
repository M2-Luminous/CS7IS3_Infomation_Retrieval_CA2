FR940831-0-00066 FR940831-0-00025 Petitioners request that RSPA modify the mixture table at 49 CFR 171.8 to provide that copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates with less than 10 percent lead sulfide by weight are not hazardous materials. In the alternative, petitioners ask that the August 29, 1994 effective date of the rule be stayed, and that the docket be reopened for public notice and comment. III. Decision The petition for reconsideration is denied. RSPA's statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) to ``list[] and regulate[] as a hazardous material'' each hazardous substance designated by the EPA under 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) does not give RSPA the discretion to grant the relief petitioners seek. A. History of RSPA Hazardous Substance Regulation RSPA first subjected hazardous substances to regulation as hazardous materials in a May 22, 1980 final rule (45 FR 34560). This rule, issued before CERCLA was enacted, was to assist the transportation industry in complying with section 311(b)(5) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1321(b). Section 1321(b)(2), a forerunner to 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) that remains as an independent EPA authority, directs the EPA Administrator to: (1) Designate as a hazardous substance any material that, when discharged to the navigable waters or contiguous zone, ``present[s] an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare''; and (2) establish as the RQ for each hazardous substance the quantity of that substance that, if discharged, ``may be harmful'' to the public health or welfare or the environment. Section 1321(b)(5) requires the operator of a facility from which a hazardous substance in excess of its RQ is discharged to report the discharge to the National Response Center. The statute imposes cleanup liability on the operator, and criminal and civil penalties for failure to report the discharge. Motor vehicles and rolling stock are ``facilities'' under the statute. 33 U.S.C. 1321(a)(10). The 1980 RSPA rule sought to address transportation industry concerns that a motor vehicle or train operator might be subject to criminal penalties for failing to report a discharge without being clearly on notice that the cargo included hazardous substances. 44 FR 10676&hyph;77 (Feb. 22, 1979) (notice of proposed rulemaking). The rule amended the HMR to designate hazardous substances as hazardous materials, to require that a hazardous substance be identified on the shipping paper accompanying the package, and to impose a package marking requirement. These measures were to ensure the operator's awareness that a hazardous substance was on board. The rule also specified general standards of integrity for the container in which the hazardous substance is transported. Because the FWPCA reporting requirement applies only to the discharge of a hazardous substance in an amount that exceeds its RQ, the rule limited the application of the HMR to hazardous substance transportation in two ways that remain in the rule today. First, a hazardous substance is a hazardous material, and therefore regulated under the HMR, only when the hazardous substance is being transported in an amount (in a single package) in excess of its RQ. 49 CFR 171.8. Second, whether transportation of a hazardous substance in a mixture or in solution is subject to the HMR as a hazardous material is determined by the concentration of the hazardous substance in the mixture or solution. Id. The minimum concentration subjecting the mixture or solution to regulation as a hazardous material is proportional to the RQ of the hazardous substance; the higher the RQ, the greater the concentration of hazardous substance permitted before the material is regulated. These two provisions are those to which petitioners point in arguing that RSPA has the discretion to exclude copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates from the HMR. CERCLA was enacted on December 11, 1980. Pub. L. 96&hyph;510, 94 Stat. 2767. The statute incorporates the FWPCA requirement to report a release of a hazardous substance in excess of its RQ and the sanctions for failing to do so. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a), 9603(b), 9609. It establishes, for discharge reporting and other purposes, a broader definition of ``hazardous substance'' than that under 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2). The definition includes hazardous substances designated by the EPA under 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2), but also specifies as hazardous substances materials of environmental concern listed under the FWPCA at 33 U.S.C. 1317(a); the Solid Waste Disposal Act at 42 U.S.C. 6921; the Clean Air Act at 42 U.S.C. 7412; and the Toxic Substances Control Act at 15 U.S.C. 2606. 42 U.S.C. 9601(14). Section 9602(a) of CERCLA, like 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2), authorizes the EPA Administrator to: (1) Designate as a hazardous substance any other material that, in the Administrator's judgment, ``may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment'' if released; and (2) establish an RQ for that material. Section 9602(b) assigns to those hazardous substances incorporated into CERCLA from other Federal statutes a ``default'' RQ of one pound until the EPA, through rulemaking, specifies a different RQ. Section 9656(a) of CERCLA, as enacted, directed the Secretary of Transportation as follows: Each hazardous substance which is listed or designated as provided in section 101(14) of this Act (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)) shall, within ninety days after the date of enactment of this Act or at the time of such listing or designation, whichever is later, be listed as a hazardous material under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (now codified at 49 U.S.C. 5101 et seq. ). With the enactment of CERCLA, the section 9601(14) definition immediately added to the list of hazardous substances a number of substances with a default RQ of one pound. On March 19, 1981 (46 FR 17738), RSPA issued a final rule to implement the section 9656(a) directive. In the agency's judgment, regulating the transportation of a single pound of many of the listed hazardous substances would not be practical or cost-effective. To comply with the language of section 9656(a), RSPA listed these hazardous substances as hazardous materials, but did not regulate them. In denying a subsequent petition for reconsideration, RSPA explained its authority for listing but not regulating: [I]t was the intent of Congress in enacting [ยง9656] that, once DOT has listed the materials subject to CERCLA as hazardous materials, DOT retain [sic] the discretion provided by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to determine whether, and to what extent, those materials should be regulated.
