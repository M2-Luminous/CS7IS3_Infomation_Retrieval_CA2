Yet another illustration of this has just been provided by the arrest in Marseilles of a 30-year-old Algerian illegal immigrant named Abderrahamane Messaoui. This man, who is presumed to be a member of the FIS, was arrested last Sunday by the 6th Central Division of the French Criminal Investigation Department. Yesterday he was moved to Paris and immediately sent before the antiterrorist judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, before being detained pending further proceedings. Messaoui is suspected of being a "liaison agent" acting as a go-between for Islamic fundamentalists in France and other European networks of fundamentalists. [passage omitted] "Tracked" to Marseilles, Messaoui was apprehended Sunday in the city of Air-Bel, where he was staying with a friend, one Kamel A. Some sources claim that the Islamic fundamentalist was preparing to return to Algeria. He was charged with conspiracy and stealing and receiving forged administrative documents. According to the initial findings of the inquiry, the FIS sympathizer supposedly took possession of forged Algerian documents in Lille, a fact that would explain his presence at the home of Chaid Eddour when the police carried out a check last March. However, the investigators will above all be examining Messaoui's supposed relations with certain Islamic networks established in Europe, more particularly in the Netherlands, and especially in Germany. There are certain indications that Messaoui was in fact constantly in touch with FIS "dignitaries" who are currently refugees in Germany. Pacifist Policy Most of them are gathered together in Aachen, where Rabah Kebir, the former Islamic fundamentalist teacher and professor of chemistry and physics, now turned foreign spokesman for the executive body of the FIS, has his home. Last February, Kebir saw all political activity in Germany banned, and so far his request for political asylum has not been accepted. Of course, the FIS headquarters in Germany maintains that it "represents the pacifist policy of the FIS" and categorically denies any links with the trafficking of arms or forged documents. However, the fact remains that Abdelhakim Boutrif, the FIS "smuggler" apprehended in Meurthe-et-Moselle, was backed by an Algerian known to the German criminal police force (BKA), who also lives in Aachen. Having arrived in Germany in 1993, this man is alleged to be the FIS's most senior figure abroad in charge of organizational matters. In January he already chartered the ship MS-Ibn-Siradj to take on a cargo of arms in Antwerp. Meanwhile, in mid-January 1994, the German Embassy in Algiers sent out a memo announcing that the FIS was planning shipments of arms originating in Central Europe. In actual fact, some sources claim that the watchwords of the Islamic fundamentalists abroad are spelled out primarily by the refugee FIS headquarters in Germany and then relayed by secret networks set up in various European countries, including the Benelux countries and France, of course, where the fundamentalist mosques serve as agreed meeting places. This international dimension of the FIS networks, a vague picture of which seems to be emerging following the arrest of Abderrahamane Messaoui, is an area that the investigation starting up in France could probe further, no doubt in collaboration with the justice departments of the other countries involved.
