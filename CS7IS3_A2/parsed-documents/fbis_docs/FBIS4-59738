At this session, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed his gratitude for the pure sentiments of the dedicated people of Gilan and asked the officials to be more compassionate toward the people. He said that the people fully comprehend the difference between service and work on the one hand and the mere shouting of slogans. Regarding the supply of potable water in Gilan, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that with the construction of the Estur dam, the needs of the province would be fully met. He said: We have approved Anzali port as a protected area; this will naturally cause a major change in Gilan Province. He added: Bandar-e Anzali is certainly one of the focuses for our trade activity in Central Asia. Astara has its own role to play and we are striving to implement massive projects in Astara as well. With the construction of a huge bridge in Astara, we will be able to link all routes to Astara; this in itself will have a great impact on transit and maritime activities. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We have raised the purchase prices of green tea leaves by 14 percent and we pay a further 17 percent to the tea-manufacturing plants. As for the construction of tea-manufacturing plants, we should act in such a way that the people and the private sector stand to gain by participating in this field. We should encourage investment in this country. He continued: At present our factories do not need steel and petrochemicals, and many spare parts are also manufactured in this country. Much of the other materials are also being manufactured in Iran. All this indicates that this is a period of endeavor and construction in our country. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on all 'ulema, Friday imams, clerics, Majles deputies, the Voice and Vision and other public media of the country to motivate the people so that the cash which is hoarded or used to buy foreign exchange and coins is channeled into investments in major infrastructural projects. The president then referred to changing most of the highways of Gilan into freeways, especially the Rasht-Qazvin highway, adding: The Government will provide financial assistance. Coastal highways are also being studied.
