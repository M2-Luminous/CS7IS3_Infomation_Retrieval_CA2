SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, New Mexico, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below 12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 11.1 ppm.), under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. 1 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and three of part D, title I of the CAA. Subpart one contains provisions generally applicable to all nonattainment areas, and subpart three contains provisions specifically applicable to CO nonattainment areas. 1 The CAAA of 1990 made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (see Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAA as amended in 1990, 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. On November 5, 1992, the Governor of New Mexico submitted to the EPA a SIP revision for CO concerning Albuquerque/Bernalillo County that was intended to satisfy CAA requirements due on November 15, 1992. This submittal included the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory, the oxygenated fuels program, and the winter woodburning program. On November 29, 1993, the EPA published the final approval of the emissions inventory, oxygenated fuels program, and the winter woodburning program (58 FR 62535). This action approves CO contingency measures for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, submitted to the EPA by the Governor of New Mexico by cover letter dated November 12, 1993. This submittal satisfies the requirement, as per section 172(c)(9) of the CAA, that all nonattainment area SIPs must contain contingency measures (due November 15, 1993) that are to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress (RFP) or to attain the applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable date. The contingency measures are to be implemented immediately after the EPA determines failure of RFP or attainment of the applicable NAAQS, without further action by the State or the EPA. Analysis of City/County Submission A. Procedural Background The CAA requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing (see also section 110(l) of the CAA). Also, the EPA must determine whether a submittal is complete, and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission. After providing adequate notice, the City of Albuquerque held a public hearing on October 13, 1993, to entertain public comment on proposed revisions to the CO SIP narrative, and on proposed revisions to Regulation 35 addressing CO contingency measures, entitled Alternative Fuels. Public comments were received and adequately addressed by the City/County. Following the public hearings, the revisions to the CO SIP narrative and to Regulation 35 were adopted by the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, and submitted as a SIP revision to the EPA by cover letter from the Governor dated November 12, 1993. The SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria referenced above. A letter dated December 27, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. B. Review of CO Contingency Measures Albuquerque/Bernalillo County filed revisions to Regulation 35 with the State of New Mexico Records and Archives Center on November 10, 1993. Regulation 35 contains the oxygenated fuel provisions for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County. The revisions being approved in this action consist of the implementation of a more stringent oxygenated fuels program in Bernalillo County beginning November 1, 1996, if the County does not achieve attainment of the CO NAAQS by December 31, 1995 (i.e., one or more quality assured violations of the CO NAAQS are recorded in calendar years 1994 and/or 1995). Specifically, the revisions would require gasoline sold in Bernalillo County during the winter control period (November 1 to the end of February) to contain not less than 3.0% oxygen by weight for ethanol blends. The current program requires not less than 2.7% oxygen by weight for all blends. In addition, the revisions mandate that as a contingency measure, all oxygenated fuel would be blended prior to removal by tank truck from primary supply points (such as refineries and terminals). C. Review of Proposed Clean Fuel Vehicle Fleet Demonstration Project The City/County also included in the November 12, 1993, submittal, a proposed demonstration project to convert certain fleet vehicles (select medium and heavy duty passenger vans) to alternative fuel use (e.g., compressed natural gas, electricity). The City/County included a description of this proposed demonstration project in the revisions to the CO SIP narrative. The proposed project is expected to show air quality benefits (e.g., CO tailpipe emission reductions) and fuel cost savings for natural gas conversions. The EPA in this action is approving the revisions to the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County CO SIP narrative to include the proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project discussed above. It is important to note that the proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project is not required by the EPA, and is not being approved as a contingency measure in the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, New Mexico, SIP. The approval of the revised CO SIP narrative acknowledges that the City/County is taking its own initiative in exploring means of obtaining additional, but undefined, CO emission reductions. Final Action This action approves a revision to the New Mexico SIP to include for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, outside the boundaries of Indian lands: (1) CO contingency measures; and (2) a proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project. The CO contingency measures constitute one of the required elements of the complete Albuquerque/Bernalillo County CO SIP. The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the New Mexico SIP and is approving them as submitted. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 5, 1994 unless, by June 6, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action, and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective July 5, 1994. Miscellaneous Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).) Executive Order This action has been classified as a table two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these revised tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived table two and three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for table two and three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
