Brigadier Drago Krpina, head of the ministry's political department, spoke at the conference. Zoltan Kabok reports: [Kabok] The claims by Bosnian Minister Hadzihasanovic that as many as 15 brigades of the Croatian Army with 30,000 soldiers were fighting on the soil of their neighbors are a blatant lie -- according to Brigadier Krpina -- aimed at putting international pressure on Croatia. [Begin Krpina recording] The justification of the failure of the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia and of some defeats of the Muslim army in the vicinity of Prozor -- as I have already said -- is an attempt to bring about the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the Muslim army. [end recording] [Kabok] Speaking about the genesis of Croatian-Muslim relations Krpina said that from the very beginning the leadership of Croatia advocated a single Bosnian state. Croatia, Krpina went on, was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina after the international recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to our information, Krpina said, 2,000 volunteers of Bosnian origin are currently fighting in the neighboring country [Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Over 5,000 mercenaries from Islamic states -- who are encouraging fanaticism and fundamentalism -- are currently fighting on the side of the Muslim army, Brigadier Drago Krpina said at the end of the news conference, also denying all allegations by the Bosnian defense minister about any involvement of Croatian Armed Forces in clashes in the neighboring state.
