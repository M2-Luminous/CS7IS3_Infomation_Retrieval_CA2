Deputies Dream of Rights and Supreme Soviet Property"] [Text] A draft declaration on the new Russian parliament's right of succession as the country's top legislative body is supposed to be submitted to the upcoming plenary session of the State Duma on 4 February. The draft is being submitted on behalf of the Duma committee on legislation while its direct author, to all appearances, is committee head Vladimir Isakov. It is supposed, first and foremost, that the declaration will be a joint document of the State Duma and the Federation Council which, "recognizing the historical responsibility for the fate of parliamentarianism and expressing anxiety at the state of the legal system" of the country, state their claim to the entire legacy of the Congress and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. True, the greater part of the powers of soviets is recognized as forfeited, and the right of succession is being declared only to that part which "does not contravene the Constitution of the Russian Federation." All the laws passed by the Supreme Soviet that do not contravene the Constitution are recognized as "having the same juridical power" as the laws passed by the Duma. As for edicts, Mr. Isakov here goes back to his pet idea of ousting the president and the government from the realm of lawmaking. Edicts and "other normative acts" contravening laws passed by the Supreme Soviet and the Federal Assembly are proposed to be recognized invalid. Claims to "rights of succession" in the legislative sphere, however, is not the whole story. The present deputies also long for the Supreme Soviet's and the Congress' property. Considering the current problem of accommodation for the parliament, one can suppose that what they have in mind first and foremost is the building at 2 Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya, and only then do they have in mind the car pool, the vacation home, and so forth. In addition to the White House, parliamentarians are showing a certain interest in the mass media founders rights remaining from the Supreme Soviet, and in that body's right to representation in international organizations. To be quite fair, it is necessary to say that following a long process of approvals and introduction of amendments, the text would probably lose much of its bite. But it is simply impossible to describe the draft declaration as the first attack "along the president-parliament front of the new convocation." One can only add that the above draft does not quite correspond to the Constitution, which specifies that parliament passes "laws and decrees," and there is no mention of any declarations. Besides, Mr. Isakov's intention to reduce presidential edicts to the level of economic management directives does not agree with the text passed on 12 December. At any rate, the Duma bloc of Communists and Agrarians, to which Vladimir Isakov belongs, is known for its program aspiration to dispute the referendum results.
