He was the political commissar of the Chengdu military region. Zhang, 59, has been transferred to the Academy of Military Sciences in what appears to be the only politically motivated transfer in a large scale reshuffle of personnel in the military regions and commands. The other changes appear to be routine retirements based on age, despite expectations of some analysts that this occasion would be used to carry out a second purge of allies and associates of Yang Baibing, who was removed from his post as secretary general of the Central Military Commission in 1992. The new wave of military personnel changes is the biggest since the reorganisation of the main military leadership in mid-1990. In all, 80 military region and command positions have been changed, analysts said. Zhang was reviled by many Chinese for his role as political department director of the martial law enforcement troops during the 1989 crackdown. In a televised news conference widely broadcast in China after June 4, Zhang claimed that no students had been killed in Tiananmen Square. His claim may have been technically true. No student demonstrators are known to have died on the square in the early morning of 4 June, though there were several civilian casualties within a few metres of the square, and large numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed as the martial law forces pushed their way into the centre of the city from the west. Zhang's appearance on television cemented his image as an apologist for the crackdown. He is being replaced by Zhang Zhijian, deputy commander of Beijing military region. Meanwhile, Deng Xiaoping appears to be taking a less active role in military affairs with the departure of his secretary, Wang Ruilin, who also acted as his eyes and ears on the Central Military Commission. Wang, secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Party's Central Military Commission, is no longer active as Deng's secretary, having left Deng's personal office some months ago, according to Beijing sources. His importance at the military commission was enhanced after Deng's relationship with Yang Shangkun deteriorated over 1991-92. At that time, Wang was responsible for arranging Deng's meetings and appointments, but that job has been taken by Deng's eldest daughter, Deng Rong. The military reshuffle has not affected any seats on the Central Military Commission (CMC), but the post of secretary-general, which has been unfilled since Yang Baibing was dismissed from the post in 1992, may have a new occupant soon. General Chi Haotian and General Zhang Wannian are tipped as possible candidates to fill the long-standing vacancy, Beijing sources said. The power base of the Chinese Communist Party general secretary, Jiang Zemin, is still considerably weaker than that of his predecessors, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Some analysts believe that Chi's appointment as CMC secretary-general would strengthen Jiang's position in the military.
