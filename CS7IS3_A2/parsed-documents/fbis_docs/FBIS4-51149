In an interview with XINHUA in his office today before leaving for Beijing on an official visit, Chernomyrdin said he is expecting his visit to China to be successful. He said Russia and China should maintain a normal relationship of good neighborliness, and the governments of the two countries should create better conditions for developing cooperation in trade and science research. He said the 1992 visit to China by President Boris Yeltsin was a big push for the development of relations between the two countries, and that they have been growing smoothly ever since. "One of the fruits of President Yeltsin's visit to China, was the increase in trade volume between the two countries which reached eight billion U.S. dollars in 1993," he said. Chernomyrdin added that there are a lot of things which link Russia and China and there is a good basis for maintaining a relationship of good neighborliness between the two countries. He suggested that the two countries increase personnel exchanges. "There were a lot of Chinese experts studying in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities once upon a time. Now quite a number of them are in key positions in China. This tradition should be carried on by us. We are glad to see more Chinese delegations visiting and it is also possible that we would like to send university students to China, which is very important," said Chernomyrdin. He emphasized that the two countries should expand cooperation and exchange in scientific research. He said he also expected to sign a number of agreements of cooperation with Chinese leaders on such matters during his stay in Beijing. On trade relations between the two countries, Chernomyrdin said the governments of the two countries should create better conditions for development and simplify the procedures of trade and cooperation.
