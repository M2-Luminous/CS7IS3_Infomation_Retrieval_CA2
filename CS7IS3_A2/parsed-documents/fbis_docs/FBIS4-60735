Consequently, Israel closed the heroic, struggling Gaza Strip. This measure is certainly meant as a punishment for the Palestinian Arab people. However, perhaps because of its numerous and continuous mass punishments of the Palestinian Arab people, Israel, when it recently closed Gaza as a mass punishment, has forgotten that it has been closing the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a punishment for exactly two years and two months. Therefore, the closure of the Gaza strip is a mass punishment. Whether it is fair or wrong and terrorist, like the oppressive Israeli practices, a punishment is supposed to be aimed against those directly responsible for a certain operation or those who failed to prevent the occurrence of such an operation. As for those who carried out the operation -- the Palestinian people -- they are as much experienced in enduring Israeli crimes as they are experienced in meting out the severest punishments to the Israeli terrorism. This is proven by the operation that led Israel to close the Gaza Strip, already closed for two years and two months. As for those responsible for the failure to block the Palestinian resistance men's execution of two Israeli occupation troops, who are they? Evidently, Israel holds the self-rule authority responsible. Therefore, it has closed the Gaza Strip. However, it should be noted that the fedayeen operation was carried out in an area directly controlled by the Israeli occupation army, in accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What does this mean? Despite our rejection of partial solutions, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement, we say those responsible for the failure to prevent Palestinian Arab strugglers from punishing and killing Israeli invasion soldiers are specifically the Israeli occupation troops themselves, not any other authority. Consequently, Israel should punish its soldiers manning the roadblock, which Israel calls the Erez roadblock. [passage omitted] However, Israel does not want to admit the heroism of the fedayeen nor the failure of some of its soldiers. Therefore, it is trying to cover up this failure and impotency by punishing the Palestinian Arab people. Has not Israel understood yet that its mass punishments have prompted the few who remained outside the intifadah to join the resistance, turning the entire Palestinian people into a wave of fire daily scorching Israel's face? Israel has not understood, nor will it understand. We do not want them to understand. This is because there are still many chapters to go in the book of the fair Palestinian Arab punishment of the Israeli terrorism and occupation. Those chapters, which are part of the armed Palestinian struggle, will be written by Palestinian Arab bullets in the body of the Israeli occupation. Avenging Israeli terrorism is another face of the Palestinian revolution of liberation. This fair, well-planned vengeance, whose clear objective is liberation and deterring and punishing the Zionist enemy, is a book with renewable chapters. It will end only with the departure of the last wolves of Israeli occupation and the demolishing of the last Israeli Army camp and last Zionist settlement in the revolutionary Palestinian Arab territory.
