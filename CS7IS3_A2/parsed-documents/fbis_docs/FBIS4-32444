Silajdzic will head a government acting not only as government of Bosnia but also of the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia which will officially come into being as soon as legislative elections scheduled for September are held. There are 11 Moslem ministers including the prime minister and Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, who kept his portfolio, as well as the ministers of the interior, transport, industry and energy, refugees and social affairs, education, environment and three with no portfolios. The six Croat ministers include Jadranko Prlic who was appointed defence minister and deputy prime minister. The Croats hold the finance, justice, health and trade portfolios and one minister has no fixed portfolio. Each minister's deputy will be from the opposing ethnic group. Political analysts say that as the men in both governments are the same, with Bosnian Serbs occupying 70 percent of Bosnia and the ethnic divisions of the country having been radically modified in two years of warfare, the day-to-day management of affairs is likely to remain unchanged. However, what is new is that the zones currently controlled by the Croat forces of Bosnia, that is the central area and practically the whole of Herzegovina, will be managed by Croats within the new government. The existing structures are likely to change name, and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, declared before the Federation, is likely to be diffused into the eight federal cantons: four Moslem majority, two Croat majority and two mixed. The president of the Federation, moderate Croat Kresimir Zubak, and his vice-president, Moslem Ejup Ganic, were appointed in May.
