FR940622-0-00059 FR940622-0-00011 The statute was amended in OBRA 90, however, changing the standard for imposing civil monetary penalties from ``knowingly'' to ``negligently'' for violations on or after May 1, 1991. The term ``negligently'' encompasses the concept of ``should have known.'' Comment: One commenter suggested that ยง1003.114 be amended to read: ``The Inspector General must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the hospital and responsible physician or physicians knowingly failed to provide emergency care as described in ยง1003.102(c).'' Response: Section 1003.114 was substantially rewritten in the OIG final regulations issued on January 29, 1992 (57 FR 3298) to essentially reflect the substance of this comment. Comment: One commenter contended that we should not find any hospital or physician in violation of section 1867 of the Act until we have issued final regulations. Response: We do not agree with this comment. The detailed language of the statute contains sufficient guidance to provide a legal basis for implementing its provisions before regulations are issued. Comment: One commenter contended that the penalties in the proposed rule are too harsh because there are too many emergency department personnel to control all the time. Response: The penalties in the proposed rule are statutory requirements and must be enforced by the Secretary. Additionally, a hospital has always been responsible for the actions of all personnel it allows to provide services on site. Comment: Two commenters believe we should include in the regulations the standards for determining what is a violation that will lead to termination and the procedures to be followed; otherwise, reviewing courts may find termination arbitrary. Response: Hospitals in violation of the statute are subject to termination and civil monetary penalties. Thus, any substantiated violation may result in termination. Once these regulations are published, specific guidelines for assessing whether a case represents a violation will be included in the State Operations and Regional Office Medicare Certification Manuals. While the manuals in no way purport to be exhaustive in their description of potential section 1867 violations, they do provide a sense as to how HCFA intends to interpret this provision. The manuals are sent to HCFA's regional offices and each State agency. They are also available on a subscription basis from the Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161. These manuals are continually updated to reflect new regulations. Comment: Twenty commenters stated that we should not be able to terminate a provider without providing due process such as a hearing before an administrative law judge or some type of summary hearing; nine of the commenters asserted that the final decision should be appealable before a Federal court. Response: This is an issue that has been litigated extensively in the past. The courts have widely held that due process for providers of health services under the Medicare program does not require a formal hearing before adverse action is taken. Our regulations at ยง498.5(b) have long provided for a post-termination hearing before an administrative law judge for providers that have been terminated. Also, in accordance with ยง498.5(c), any provider dissatisfied with a hearing decision may request Appeals Council review and has a right to seek judicial review of the Council's decision. In addition, of course, providers that have been terminated always have the right to reapply for Medicare certification after correcting the deficiencies that led to the termination. Comment: Two commenters believe that we should impose a timeframe on hospitals to obtain reinstatement. Response: The statute at section 1866(c)(1) of the Act provides that a hospital that has been terminated from the Medicare program may not file another agreement unless the Secretary finds that the reason for the termination has been removed and that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur. Thus, terminated hospitals may reapply for Medicare certification whenever they have corrected the deficiencies that caused the termination. We reserve the right to determine an appropriate reasonable assurance period before reinstatement on a case-by-case basis. Comment: Four commenters stated that we should clarify how HCFA will monitor and enforce compliance with the regulations. They recommended that the regulations more specifically explain what constitutes a violation of these provisions and how HCFA will investigate violations and make negligence determinations. Response: We will publish in our State Operations and Regional Office Manuals our investigation and enforcement procedures. Comment: One commenter suggested that HCFA disclose the names of violators to the public and include them in the Medicare Data Base for adverse decisions. Another recommended that we also notify intermediaries and carriers. Response: We agree. This information is published and is included in the Medicare Data Base and is passed on to intermediaries and carriers. Comment: Two commenters suggested that we negotiate with PROs to provide case-by-case monitoring of patient dumping cases, since State survey agencies are not staffed or organized to do this. Another commenter recommended that we require PROs to report suspected violations and that we consider PRO information before concluding an investigation.
