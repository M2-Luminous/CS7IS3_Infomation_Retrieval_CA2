Well-informed sources say that Jordan is disturbed by the economic agreement that the PLO signed with Israel because it contains many points that have overlooked the Jordanian role and the economic agreements that should be signed with it while PLO leaders view Jordan's measures on the residency of West Bankers in Jordan as a step to pull the carpet out from under the PLO's feet and a new Jordanian attempt to confirm its authority over the Palestinians. A ranking Jordanian official believes that mending the Jordanian- Palestinian relationship has become somewhat difficult following the PLO-Israeli economic agreement, which conflicts to some extent with the contents of the agreement on economic understanding between Jordan and the PLO. [passage omitted] A Palestinian official who declined to be named says that the Palestinians major concern during the formulation of the economic agreement with Israel had been how to wrest some gains that will enable them to build the nucleus of an independent Palestinian economy that would depend on neither the Israelis or the Jordanians. The official told Al-BILAD that Israel has agreed to the Palestinians right to directly import from Arab and world markets. The Palestinian official reveals that on his arrival in the occupied territories, President 'Arafat will immediately start building a floating port in Gaza to enable him to import commodities needed by the autonomous region until the Gaza Port is completed in two years. The PLO's move toward direct import greatly worries Jordan. If it materializes, Jordan will not be the lungs through which the occupied territories will breathe and will not be the place through which all commodities will pass. Thus, Jordan will be deprived of the unique economic relationship which binds it to the West Bank and on which Jordan had wagered much to achieve economic recovery. While Jordan has such fears, the PLO also has similar apprehensions, particularly with respect to the recent measures on easing restrictions imposed on the West Bankers. Palestinian officials believe that with its surprise measures Jordan wants to enhance its relations with Palestinians in the occupied territories and reinvigorate them within a legal framework in a manner that will give it historical tutelage over them. However, Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad had emphasized that the recent Jordanian measures and the facilities that were given to the West Bankers have no political connotations. Political observers believe that the recent Jordanian measures would lead to a Palestinian exodus from the territories toward Jordan. Some expect that approximatley 200,000 people will leave. Observers also believe that this exodus will be accompanied by a transfer of captial from the West Bank to Jordan while the prevailing belief had been that Palestinian capital would move from Jordan to the West Bank. These observers believe that the rivalry between Jordan and the PLO to win the hearts of Palestinians will exacerbate, particularly since Jordan enjoys a good reputation among some Palestinian leaders. Palestinian sources told AL-BILAD that President 'Arafat might adopt several measures to tighten his control on the population and to put the Palestinian house in order, such as the closing of the borders with Jordan for a period that could last three months. In any case, the coming days will reveal the dimensions of the dispute and the war between the PLO and Jordan.
