The Honduran Foreign Ministry received a note from this international organization regarding the presence of at least five Honduran-flagged ships off the Haitian coasts that are supplying that country with fuel and other materials. Merchant Marine Superintendent Reynaldo Flores said the ships were identified as Erma, Sea Wind II, Aida Luz, Lady Sandra III, and Rooster. Flores said "we cannot impede" the presence of ships registered under the Honduran flag because they are flagged for legal activities and "we have no way of knowing if they commit illegal activities." One of the ships, the Rooster, had previously been detained for drug trafficking, the Honduran Merchant Marine Office confirmed. Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello of the Innovation and Unity Party warned that the United Nations could penalize Honduras for this event.
