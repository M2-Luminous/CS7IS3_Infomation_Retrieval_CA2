Ahmad al-Zahrani was said to be seeking refuge in the British capital after defecting from his post as second secretary at the Saudi Consulate in Houston. His solicitor, Amjad Salfiti, said the 34-year old diplomat did not want to confuse his case with the former first secretary to the United Nations, Mohammad al-Khilewi, who applied for asylum in the U.S. earlier this month. He suggested that his client's application would present a challenge to the British authorities to show an "even hand when dealing with matters involving serious breaches of human rights in a friendly country such as Saudi Arabia." In his statement, al-Zahrani said that he was joining his voice to the "increasing number of moderate academics" from Saudi Arabia, who no longer are able to tolerate the breaches of basic human rights by the present regime in Riyadh. His personal experience was supported by documentary evidence to prove "beyond any doubt the hypocrisy and double standards which are adopted by the Saudi regime," he said. Al-Zahrani is noted for as a research writer of a book about Saudi politics, which he says has been prevented from being published even though he had obtained all the necessary licences. There was no immediate indication if the diplomat would be joining the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia (CDLR), which moved its office to London in April this year after having many of its members arrested inside the country. The committee, which is becoming the main focal point for academics and intellectuals opposed to the Saudi Government, was approached by al-Khilewi, when he defected at the beginning of June and suggested other diplomats would follow.
