U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel told a selected gathering here that "we vigorously oppose outside aid to the militants." The people in the valley were "tired of fighting and want some kind of reconciliation," she added. Asked about her questioning of Kashmir's accession to India recently, she said, "our focus is not on how the kashmir problem started, but on how it can be ended." A large number of activists from Indian controlled Kashmir staged a demonstration Thursday near the U.S. Embassy to protest against her five-day visit to India, describing her recent statements amounted to interference in India's internal affairs. She expressed her concern over "credible" reports of human rights violations in the region. But she emphasised that U.S. always acknowledged that the militants shared responsibility for violations with the security forces. She said the costs of continued confrontation vastly exceeded efforts of those associated with compromise and peaceful negotiation in the region. The violence in the region has claimed 8,912 lives including 3,794 militants and 2,432 civilians till February this year. She felt the foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan in January were a positive step and hoped they would continue. Raphel also said the U.S. would like India and Pakistan to address the problem of nuclear non-proliferation bilaterally.
