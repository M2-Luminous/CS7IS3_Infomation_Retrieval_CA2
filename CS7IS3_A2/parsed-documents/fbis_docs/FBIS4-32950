Approximately 500 leaders of this territory's enterprises and organizations have been holding a meeting on economic efficiency since this morning, chaired by Esteban Lazo Hernandez, Politburo member and Cuban Communist Party first secretary in the province. Economic recovery is well under way. The shoe industry can reaffirm its pledge to produce 1.8 million pairs of shoes this year, while the metalworking enterprise expects to double its production in the second half of the year and to provide new lines of production -- such as bicycle spokes and nails -- as well as to reap good dividends from the sale of screws. We can add to this network of important industrial centers food production, which will grow considerably compared to the previous year in terms of flour and dairy products, the production of a line of soy yogurts, and the production of Cerelac supplement for the elderly. The production of Santiago de Cuba's liquor and beverage enterprise is also encouraging, since it solved acute problems in the boilers, refrigerators, and filters and now intends to increase beer production by approximately two million boxes, as well as 3.7 million liters of rum, in addition to providing 55 tons of yeast for bread production in Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo Provinces. To this we can add the mango crop, which will triple last year's with a harvest estimated at 500,000 quintals. Lazo also acknowledged that the production of tubers and vegetables in Santiago de Cuba, although production plans are fulfilled every year, remains the Achilles' heel of the province. This is why he demanded more and better work to extract from the earth everything it can yield despite the lack of appropriate resources. He added that there can be no enterprise director whose mind and soul is not pledged to the battle for economic efficiency.
