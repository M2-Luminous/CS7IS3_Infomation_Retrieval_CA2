Then, in the socialist market economy, how is the price mechanism to be correctly used? At Quanzhou County, Lingui County, Zhongshan County, Guijiang City, and Binyang County, we began to understand all sorts of questions concerning grain prices, and this understanding was very rewarding. 1. A contract without an agreement on specific prices is very difficult to implement. In our survey we found that the Grain Bureau of Quanzhou County this year signed a contract with the grain department of a certain province for the purchase of 25 million kg of wheat, but in the contract no specific price was agreed upon. Afterward, the supply side, seeing that the source of goods was tight, set a price of 900 yuan per ton. The demand side maintained that in this locality wheat was sold at 840 yuan perton, but, considering that the quality of this province's wheat was fairly good, it made a counteroffer of 860 yuan, which the other side firmly rejected. As a result, the deal fell through. It is said that the grain economic contracts signed by our autonomous region's grain department with peasants, and the grain economic contracts signed by producing areas with marketing areas, also do not have specific prices agreed upon. Contracts are important to a market economy, but prices are of interest, and without a contract on the price it is naturally difficult to honor the agreement. 2. Fulfillment of contract obligations mainly depends on price. On what does the purchasing side depend to fulfill its obligations under a contract without an agreed specific price? Ideological education, organizational measures, and administrative methods are necessary and have an effect. As for legal measures such as notarization and the contract, will, of course, possess an extremely great binding force, but if the contract does not have a specific agreed price, the two sides will only agree on a time to consult on setting the price, and once the consultations fail, there is no breaking of the notarized contract! One year ramie was in great demand and its price in outside provinces was high. To prevent an outflow and ensure their own needs by forcing purchases at a low price, some places did not hesitate to sent administrative law enforcers to block an outflow, but they could only block the main roads and could not block the mountain roads, could only block in the daytime and could not block in the nighttime, and could only block motor vehicles and could not block portable shoulder-borne transport. In the purchasing of ginkgo, the situation was similar. Commodities go toward places where prices are high, just as water flows toward low-lying places. It is thus obvious that the fulfillment of the obligations of an economic contract mainly depend on economic measures, first of all, in economic measures there is a dependence on price. 3. Commodities on which prices have been released should be bought and sold in line with the market prices. After commodities on which prices have been released are put on the market, they should be dependent on market prices. In the five counties (city) I went to, the purchasing prices of the grain departments (including the ex-value add-on price) in general was two to three yuan lower than the market prices and one to two yuan lower than the individual householder prices; some were even lower. Normally, the ex-value add-on price on the negotiated purchasing price should be in line with the market price. The ex-value add-on price is the price stipulated by the state when a purchasing contract places an order for grain or gives the peasant an award, and chemical fertilizer and diesel oil is charged to the difference between parity and the market price in the form of currency paid to the peasant at the time of the signing of the grain-purchasing economic contract. Our autonomous region stipulates that for every 50 kg of an economic contract the ex-value add-on price is 3.54 yuan, and it is given gratis by the central and local financial administrations and passes into the hands of the peasant through the purchase of grain. If it is lower than the market purchasing price, resistance to it will be difficult to avoid. 4. Form regular market prices through fair competition. In line with market price exchange, regular market prices should be formed under conditions of fair competition, but currently there are distortions in the market prices. On the one hand, some individual grain operators, when selling purchased millet that had been processing into husked rice, give short weight, adulterate (i.e., mix late rice with early rice), or increase the water content. Therefore, if the state-owned grain departments purchases 35 kg of millet, the individual household pays out 36.5 yuan; when the grain department sits back and receives the grain, the individual household itself pays the transport fee to deliver the grain to the door. This unfair competition artificially raises the market's purchasing price. On the other hand, some localities have taken economic and administrative measures to limit the amount of grain coming in from other provinces and regions in order to control demand and stop prices from rising in conformity with economic law. This is also a form of unfair competition, and it artificially holds down the market's purchasing price. Therefore, we must strengthen the quality control of society's grain trade and curb improper competition, and we must also break through regional separation and protect proper competition in order to form regular market prices for grain. 5. What the producer wants is a price that actually can be taken in hand. Even if the price is in line with the market, if there are various deductions will the price be all right? Certain counties and townships have stipulated that when a peasant has an economic contract to sell grain to the state, 11 deductions must first be made from the money paid for the grain purchase: water fee, education add-on fee, health emergency fee, paddy field fee, public security fee, disease prevention fee, militia training fee, military martyrs and dependents fee, "five guarantees" living fee, "five guarantees" sympathy and solicitude fee, and aid to disabled fee. After the deductions are made on the money paid for the grain sold by households that sell fairly much grain, there is not much left; after the deductions are made for households that sell little grain, there is even nothing left or not enough left to cover the deductions. This price is just an "empty price": it can be seen but not obtained. To avoid this "chop," some peasants prefer to sell their grain to individual households. 6. Price rigidity. Except for the natural fall back in price because of market changes, there is a rigidity to the profit on the price obtained by peasants from the sell of grain to the state. The abovementioned ex-value add-on price is based on calculating the difference in the first half of this year between the parity and the market price of chemical fertilizer and diesel oil, and the time for using the fertilizer is between March and April next year; if the price rises, it will be impossible to use this year's price difference to buy back an equivalent quantity of material objects, and the peasants owrrly that they will lose their profit. When the Grain Department of Miaoling township understood this situation, some peasants when delivering grain had strongly reacted to it. They demanded that when one party devlivers grain the other party should give it money and a chemical fertilizer voucher, writing clearly on the voucher the variety, quantity, price, and purchase at the beginning of spring, all of which must be accurate. 7. A price that protects capital while obtaining profit is demanded by the law of value. Protection of capital while obtaining a profit, i.e., a reasonable cost plus a suitable profit, is the monetary manifestation of value. In 1992 in our autonomous region, the average cost of production with tax of every 50 kg of early long-grain rice was 21.64 yuan, but this did not include all sorts of inappropriate expenditures by the peasants that were discovered in the survey, so it was an incomplete cost; even less was it the production cost for rice grown on low-grade land (unlike the value of industrial products, the value of agricultural products is decided by the average necessary time in society to produce on low-grade land). In our autonomous region this year, the protected price per 50 kg of early long-grain rice was 24 yuan, obviously on the low side. Actually, it is also difficult to say that the purchasing price protected capital while obtaining a profit. The producer demands that his capital be protected while obtaining a profit, and the operator, when selling his grain, should also protect his capital while obtaining a profit. If all sorts of limits are put on the operator's selling price, there cannot be a situation in which "the boat goes up when the river rises" -- particular things improve with the improvement of the general situation -- and in this case purchasing will certainly be adversely affected. 8. Set up a price-regulating fund. We must both follow the trade that is put on the market and protect capital while obtaining profit, but if there is a steep fall in the market price, one could get no profit and even lose one's capital, because cheap cereal crops hurt agriculture; if there is a sharp rise in the market price, the operator gets staggering profits, not just appropriate profits, and the people cannot bear the high price. This gives rise to the following questions: when there is a steep fall in the market price, how are the peasants to be compensated so that they protect their capital and obtain a profit? When the market price soars, how is it to be kept within a range in which the operator gets an appropriate profit and the people can bear it. Besides the necessary administrative measures, what is important is to set up and make use of a price-regulating fund.
