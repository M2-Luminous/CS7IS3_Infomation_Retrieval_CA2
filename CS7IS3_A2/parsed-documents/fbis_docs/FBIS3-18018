The participants promised to continue aid for Russia. At the close of the meeting, Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union), who hosted the conference, stated that the preconditions for sustained inflation-free economic growth exist in Germany. During the discussion of the second major topic -- aid for Russia -- the G-7 representatives from the United States, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Canada promised to continue the supportive measures for Moscow to the agreed extent. At the same time, they declared their readiness to support the conclusion of a comprehensive new rescheduling agreement with Russia. However, during their discussion with the Russian delegation, the finance ministers of the Western industrialized nations expressed concern about the lack of progress concerning the stabilization of Russia's economy. They called on Russia to increase and accelerate its efforts to ensure macroeconomic stabilization and to reduce the budget deficit, the creation of credit, and inflation. Structural reforms, including secure legal framework conditions, are indispensable for domestic and foreign investors, because private capital must become the main source for financing the transformation process. The Russian delegation, headed by Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, assured the G-7 representatives of the new government's determination to continue the reform process. "These reforms are irreversible." According to Waigel, the Russian representatives formulated the following goals in Kronberg: A balanced budget, continuing fight against inflation, and an end to the dramatic production decline. The budget deficit of the central government, financed by credits of the Russian central bank, is to be limited to 4 percent of the BIP in 1994, and the monthly inflation rate is to be reduced to 7-9 percent by the end of the year. The ministers and heads of the central banks of the G-7 as well as representatives of the European Commission welcomed the promises of the new Moscow government. Yet they strongly emphasized that a determined economic reform is the only way to ensure the advantages of a free market economy. The G-7 representatives stressed that comprehensive financial aid in the form of rescheduling agreements, export loans, and initial credits by the international financial institutions have already been provided. More funds can only be released once the required preconditions are fulfilled. Opening up the market for Russian products to a greater extent is also an essential element of the G-7 strategy to support reforms. According to Waigel, the Western finance ministers and heads of the central banks agreed that particular attention must be devoted to the social consequences of the transformation process. A credible program of accompanying social measures, designed to improve public acceptance of the reform process, are indispensable. Thus, they agreed to cooperate with Russia to improve the social network and the social infrastructure. They pointed out, however, that the financial means required for these tasks must be provided mainly by Russian sources. Yet the World Bank might play a special role in helping Russia establish efficient social infrastructures.
