FR940622-1-00040 FR940622-1-00011 Under the proposed regulations, the tax consequences of callable preferred stock are intended to reflect the economic expectations of the parties and to afford issuers flexibility to issue stock on terms that reflect their business needs. The proposed regulations are also intended to foreclose corporations from attempting to use issuer calls to create constructive distributions solely for tax planning reasons. However, no inference is to be drawn from the proposed regulations as to the appropriate treatment of such call rights under current law. Such provisions are subject to scrutiny under general tax principles (e.g., substance over form). De minimis exception. Proposed §1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) would replace the ``reasonable redemption premium'' exception under current §1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) with the statutory de minimis rule under section 305(c)(1) for mandatorily redeemable and puttable stock, and extend the statutory rule to issuer calls. Extending this rule to issuer calls differs from the treatment discussed in the legislative history of the 1990 Act, but is appropriate because the proposed regulations limit constructive distribution treatment with respect to issuer calls to circumstances in which the stock is economically similar to mandatorily redeemable stock. In those cases, the call premium cannot fairly be said to be ``in the nature of a penalty for premature redemption.'' Since those cases are outside of the intended scope of the exception in the current regulations, there is no reason to retain current §1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) for callable stock. Conforming changes. The proposed regulations would conform the examples in §§1.305&hyph;3 and 1.305&hyph;5 to the proposed changes described above. In addition, the proposed regulations would conform language in §1.305&hyph;7(a) to the proposed changes described above. Effective dates. Proposed §1.305&hyph;5(b)(6) contains the effective date rules. In general, the regulations are proposed to apply to stock issued on or after the date final regulations are filed with the Federal Register . The committee reports to the 1990 Act indicate that Congress did not intend to limit the authority of the Secretary to promulgate regulations relating to the accrual of redemption premiums on callable preferred stock. However, the reports indicate that Congress anticipated any such regulations would be prospective. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990). Although the proposed regulations do not apply to stock issued before the date final regulations are filed with the Federal Register , the rules of sections 305(c) (1), (2), and (3) apply to stock described therein issued on or after October 10, 1990, except as provided in section 11322(b)(2) of the 1990 Act. The committee reports to the 1990 Act express Congress' intention that the economic accrual and OID de minimis rules generally apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act without regard to when regulations are amended to reflect such rules. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990). The committee reports note that, in general, the OID de minimis rule will not apply to preferred stock that is callable solely at the option of the issuer (unless such stock is subject to a mandatory redemption or is puttable). However, the economic accrual rule will apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act to the entire call premium on stock that is callable solely at the option of the issuer (but not mandatorily redeemable or puttable) if such premium is considered to be unreasonable under the current regulations. In such cases, except as provided in regulations, the entire call premium will be accrued over the period of time during which the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption. It should be noted that the committee reports also authorize the Secretary to treat stock that, in form, is merely callable as being subject to a mandatory redemption or a put if the existence of other arrangements effectively requires the issuer to redeem the stock. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990). Comments invited. The IRS and Treasury invite public comment on the proposed regulations and on any issues involving the implementation of the 1990 Act amendments to section 305(c), including the extent to which OID principles should be adopted in the section 305(c) context and the appropriate treatment of unpaid cumulative dividends. Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for November 14, 1994, at 10 a.m., in the auditorium. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by October 24, 1994, and submit an outline of the topics (signed original and eight (8) copies) to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by October 24, 1994. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal author of these proposed regulations is Kirsten L. Simpson of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), IRS. However, other personnel of the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
