In an interview at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Seoul, Minister Han said, "As can be seen in North Korea's reply today on our proposal for a preparatory meeting, the North Koreans' sincerity seems higher than any other time in the past." Han said South Korea does not oppose any improvement by the United States of its relations with North Korea. "We see no reason why we should oppose North Korea being recognized as a normal country duly fulfilling international obligations and engaging in normal diplomatic activities," the minister said. He added, however, that sanctions would continue to be promoted at the U.N. Security Council until North Korea's "good intention" could be verified through the expected South-North summit and third- round U.S.-North Korea talks. Regarding the issue of delving into the nuclear past of North Korea, Han said the question cannot be overlooked under any circumstances. "This is something on which light should be shed without fail through, for example, U.S.-North Korea talks," he said. Stating that both the inter-Korean summit and third-round U.S.- North Korea talks are important, Minister Han said that if either of the talks fail, there would be no way but to revert to the course of taking sanctions against North Korea.
