FR940119-1-00029 FR940119-1-00009 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300315; FRL&hyph;4748&hyph;4] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AC18 Alachlor; Proposed Revocation of Certain Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to revoke certain tolerances for residues of the herbicide alachlor and its metabolites in or on various raw agricultural commodities. EPA is initiating this action because registered uses of alachlor on certain food commodities have been canceled. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300315], must be received on or before March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA. Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail, Melissa L. Chun, Registration Support Branch (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Westfield Building, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, (703)-308-8318. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document proposes the revocation of tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl- N -(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) and its metabolites in or on the following raw agricultural commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.249: Cotton forage, cottonseed, sunflower seed, pea forage, pea hay, peas with the pods removed, and potatoes. By March 1988, the product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, for the pesticide products containing the herbicide alachlor were canceled for the above-mentioned raw agricultural commodities. Based on the fact that alachlor is no longer domestically registered for use on these food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.249 for residues of alachlor in or on these commodities. Since the product registrations were canceled more than 5 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated, domestically produced commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances because sufficient time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem due to environmental contamination. EPA requests that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S. Within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under FIFRA which contains alachlor may request that this rulemaking proposal to revoke the tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300315]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed regulatory action has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner. Since all registrations for use of alachlor on these food crops were canceled more than 5 years ago, it is anticipated that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances were revoked. Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
