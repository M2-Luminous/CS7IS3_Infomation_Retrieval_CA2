The crowd is responsive to the simplest of slogans and ready to support leaders who zealously demonstrate their closeness to the people. Such was the crowd that voted for Zhirinovskiy. And such was the election of the leader of the Russia bloc to the post of president of Crimea. Supporters of N. Bagrov were not justified in their reliance on residents of the rural localities. Nor were there grounds, incidentally, for the flimsy hope that not enough people would turn out for the election in the event of good weather, when citizens would show preference to their farmstead plots over the polling stations. Journalists sensationalized the matter: "More than a million Crimeans have lost their minds." "People did not vote for the election program of the current president, or even for Yuriy Meshkov, but against the present difficult situation"--explained Nikolay Bagrov, former candidate for president of Crimea, who in all likelihood will also soon become ex-chairman of the Supreme Council. During the final minutes of the session of the Presidium of the Supreme Council he proclaimed: "I consider it impossible to remain in the post of chairman of the Supreme Council following the results of the second round of voting." And then he took leave. "I understand that a difficult life lies ahead of me, but I am staying in the Crimea. I will leave politics for at least two to four years. I will not run for election to any parliament. And I will not head the opposition of the new Crimean authority"--Nikolay Vasilyevich stated in his farewell. He promised to dedicate the time he would now have free to working on an encyclopedia of the Crimea. On 4 February the session will take up discussion of his resignation. That same day the Crimean parliament will administer the oath of the new president of Crimea. It cannot be ruled out that he will swear the oath on the Bible--"my handbook." Preparation is already underway for the inauguration (expected to be rather flamboyant) under the direction of Meshkov's "right hand"--Viktor Mezhak, leader of the People's Party of Crimea, belonging to the Russia bloc. As Yu. Meshkov recently related, incidentally, he conducted his election campaign based on "funds received from commercial structures." And the debt will likely be a pretty sum. But the lives of pensioners and other citizens who fought for Meshkov in the expectation of ruble payments can hardly be expected to change by virtue of Yuriy Aleksandrovich's election. However, as Viktor Bobylev, member of the Presidium of the Crimean parliament, noted, "As early as Monday they have begun demanding pensions and wages in rubles" while dancing victory dances outside the walls of the parliament. If we are to believe the promises of their elected official, ruble payments will only begin being made in the summer. But even this seems hardly likely. Russian specialists attest that there are not enough rubles for everyone. The entry of Belarus alone into the ruble zone is already causing 15-30 percent inflation. Anti-Belarus sentiment is presently building in Moscow. In all likelihood we do not have long to wait for anti-Crimean feelings--"No matter how tempting Crimea may be, we have no need for indigent people." Especially since the "indigent" will ask for 40 billion in pensions and 130 billion in wages. Another reason Russia will not decide to annex Crimea, according to Crimea observers, is the fact that Mr. Clinton would get the opportunity to review the recent trilateral agreement, whose basis comprises guarantees of the inviolability of borders. Therefore, plans of the RDK [Crimea Republican Movement] to lower taxes, create the Central Bank of Crimea--"savior of the Crimean economy," open up Crimea's own currency exchange and branches of Russian banks while shutting down Ukrainian ones, and place purely Russian state requisitions at plants--all this reverberates as harebrained scheming. "The emergence of a republic bank will not rescue Crimea and will not give it increased independence. Such an institution will turn into an ordinary commercial bank"--is the belief of well-known Crimean financial expert Sh. Tsivadze. With the planned Crimean budget deficit (9.9 trillion karbovantsy for 1994), the fist method can hardly be expected to help the situation. Though Yuriy Aleksandrovich will not skip any opportunity to bang his on the table. It is precisely with this gesture that he began his first presidential press conference, proclaiming: "Unification of Crimea is possible only with the emergence of a certain personage. I am that personage..." However, the newly fledged president will not only have to deliver oratory at demonstrations. He will be faced with quite real problems as well: It was reported just days ago that due to the shortage of electric power, Crimea will stop receiving water from the Dnieper. Fuel supplies for just a few weeks remain... But Meshkov assured his countrymen that his bloc has an understanding with the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy, in accordance with which Crimean electric power plants will be converted to gas and it is planned to lay a line across the Kerch Strait which will boost Crimea's energy capacities. This is all well and good, but construction of the line will take about three years. While in the opinion of specialists, Ukraine may cut off energy deliveries to the peninsula of the 10 billion kilowatt-hours presently being consumed. It cannot be ruled out that the question "Who will have a good life in Crimea?" will become a rhetorical one. Perhaps only the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet, to whom Meshkov promised: "The Black Sea Fleet must be a solely Russian fleet. This will constitute one more factor of stability in Crimea." Their share of votes in the victory of the president was fairly significant. Also sounding victory is the Communist Party of Crimea. Although its candidate L. Grach was unsuccessful, an opportunity emerged on the other hand to once again unite in a great and powerful USSR. Incidentally, political experts predict that Communist Grach will not be the lowest ranking figure on Meshkov's team. And it is possible that in time he will come to replace him. With such an array, the next step of the new Crimean authority seems logical--in the spirit of bygone traditions, it has drawn up fairly clearly the outlines of its enemies. Named the first of these is Stepan Khmara, who "came in and riled up the entire Crimean populace." Second in line are the "West-Ukrainian nationalists who are hampering the building of relations with Russia, explaining that 'the Russkies have eaten up all our lard,' 'although Russia feeds many.'" Entered third on the black list, it seems, is the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people. As Yuriy Meshkov clearly explained, "there will not be two organs of representational authority in Crimea." But Majlis leader Mustafa Jemilev stated: "No people can be denied the right to protect themselves." And the Tatars, organized into a fairly significant force, "will resort to acts of civil disobedience--in the event Meshkov continues his separatism. This will be the beginning of the end of his presidency." At that time a declaration will be made of the illegality of the election. For Tatars, the president will be simply a private individual. But for the time being, in its search for support the Majlis is specifying points of contact with all-Ukrainian democratic organizations. A conflict is looming, no matter how hard the new authority tries to hide this with its American-style smiles. In the meantime, the authority's leading figures sometimes blurt things out. In answering a question concerning the Dniester-like prospects of the Crimea, Viktor Mezhak noted: "It depends on what kind of wave [as published] you have in mind--world, civil, or local." Ivan Yermakov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, believes: "If Meshkov takes sudden steps, the situation may become exacerbated." A revision of borders means war--the Majlis and Nikolay Bagrov have stated. While Western observers add that half a year from now they will not risk travelling to the Crimea. They observe that it will be difficult now for Crimeans to escape the syndrome of civil war. One would like to believe that alternatives are possible. Listening to the points made by Yu. Meshkov, which change daily, political experts are beginning to say that the president of Crimea is attempting to refrain from radical measures so that Kiev will not annul the election. He will most likely limit himself to introducing Moscow time and fiscal economic measures. In order to somehow prove himself in the role of reformer. Isolation of the branches of power is expected with time. When each ministry begins to chart its own policy course, ignoring the president, the parliament will be unable to act as an opponent to the government's decisions. Meanwhile, pro-Ukraine oriented Crimeans are relying on the prospect that in the event Meshkov takes sudden actions, L. Kravchuk will just declare these to be unlawful. More than sufficient pretext will be available for this. Some provisions of the Crimean law on the presidency contradict articles of the Constitution. The Majlis attests: "Manipulative irregularities were noted during the first round of the voting. Heads of electoral commissions stuffed ballots into the ballot boxes with the name of the undesirable Bagrov crossed out." The Majlis also warns: Unless L. Kravchuk changes his wait-and-see position, sufficient forces will be found in Ukraine capable of properly sorting things out. In the meantime, an interesting thought is spreading around Simferopol, to the effect of--why drift in the direction of an insecure Russia when a rich historical relative--Turkey--is much, much closer? Would it not be better to set up family ties here? At the same time, Yu. Meshkov, who still has not assumed his presidential duties because of lack of a residence, awaits the pleasant moment when he will be awarded a black Lincoln by Sevastopol billionaire Sergey Shurygoy, who promised to present this to the first president of Crimea.
