What was supposed to be the great meeting to present the League's candidates was in fact little more than a pretext. This was immediately apparent. It was clear later, too, when many people left after his speech. By then the show was over. But [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi did not disappoint those who were expecting further polemics. He spoke for 50 minutes, launching some sustained attacks and, in order to remove any doubts, set his sights directly on [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Democrats. And he was shooting to kill. Following the skirmishes of the past few days, he made his intentions clear from the start: "Berlusconi is the synthesis of the five-party alliance." To avoid any misunderstandings, he added: "Our allies are a creation of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Before dying, the DC decided to create alternative structures that would enable the old leaders to return. But we saw through that. And we stopped them." Before an audience that was full of smiles, applause, and scarves depicting Alberto da Giussano [medieval Lombard knight], the League leader continued with a crescendo of theories, explanations, and attacks. His reassuring, "we will honor the electoral agreement," was not enough to make him softer his tone. This, partly because he issued an explicit and uncompromising appeal: "On your gray ballot papers, the ones for the proportional quota, vote only for our symbol, and encourage others to do the same. Do not look at those of our allies. We must demonstrate our strength and make people understand that we have nothing to do with the others... We will have 200 deputies. We will not become confused with them, and that goes for the presentation of candidates, too: Those initiatives are Christian Democratic jamborees. But we are a force of the people." And the people -- or, at least, his people -- applauded him, interrupting him twice. First, they listened to the long story of the accord that led to the pole for freedoms, then it showed its appreciation of his umpteenth charge against the DC: "We destroyed the DC key which, though held in Palermo, in fact opened the strongholds of the North. and I am not accusing the people of the South; I am blaming the leadership class." In the end none of the League's allies was spared. Berlusconi, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Center Union were analyzed, dissected, and overwhelmed by the torrent of a Bossi in full flow. It is no coincidence that he said not a word about the progressive forces, apart from a few very brief mentions such as, "they are the enemies to be defeated." With [Pact for Italy leader] Segni it was exactly the opposite: "He imagined that he could do whatever he pleased, but we fixed him right away. We forced him to return to grandpa [DC Secretary] Martinazzoli...." So at least for Bossi, the grand coalition of the pole for freedoms was exclusively "a tactical choice." "Fellows," he shouted, "do you remember what I told you? Never lower your guard, do not trust anyone... Well, now I will repeat it even louder! Yes, because this alliance served solely to wreck the plans of those whose sole aim was to restore the Italian Social Movement's [MSI] strength and to crush us. But we saw through that and stopped them. And we will remain suspicious. Our allies will have to accept our idea of federalism; we will not allow ourselves to be enchanted by strange formulas... Have you never wondered why the DC accepted an electoral reform that decreed its demise? The answer is simple: It had already agreed to help the MSI in the South, and it had already given thought to some strange coalitions in the North." [passage omitted]
