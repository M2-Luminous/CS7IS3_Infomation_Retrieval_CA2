"Our assessment is not much different from the Bank of Japan," Saito told reporters, agreeing to earlier comments by central bank governor Yasushi Mieno that the economy is poised to take the recovery path. However, Saito, like Mieno, remained cautious, saying, "We still can't declare with confidence that the economy will head toward a recovery." Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors, "assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be a high possibility that the economy has moved one step toward a recovery." His comments were a step forward from his latest assessment that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out," after the central bank released its quarterly "Tankan" business sentiment survey for may on Friday showing broad-based improvement for the month for the first time in five years. Asked about the effects from continuing 5.5 trillion yen worth of income tax cuts, Mieno said he expects to "support the economy that is showing brightness." But Mieno said he does not know if the economy has moved "two or three steps" forward, noting such prevailing concerns as the yen's rise, corporate capital investment and competition with other Asian nations.
