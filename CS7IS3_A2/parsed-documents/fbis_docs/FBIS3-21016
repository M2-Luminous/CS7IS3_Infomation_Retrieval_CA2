The NRSC has access to over 2 million photographic images acquired over the last 19 years. Panchromatic and multispectral images acquired by Resource satellites offer a best ground resolution of five metres which is sufficient to define streets and buildings, says the NRSC. This is said to be ideal for the generation of image maps for use by cartographers, geologists and urban planners. An oil company recently ordered imagery of the pre-Caspian Basin in Kazakhstan to identify oil wells and roads. The NRSC distribution stems from the formation of WorldMap, a consortium comprising Jebco, Priroda (Russia's leading civilian remote sensing organisation) and Rosvneshgeo (a Russian company associated with geology and mineral exploration). WorldMap is addressing the problems of exploiting Russian satellite imagery, difficulties such as data conversion, cataloguing, prompt delivery, quality, and payment. Resource photographic films are archived by Priroda and WorldMap has embarked on a massive digital conversion project. About 500 scenes a month are being put on 8 mm Exabyte tape. Two Vexcel VX3000 scanners are linked to Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation. The scanners are capable of pixel spacing down to 8.5 microns. All tapes are archived in London. A catalogue allows data search. Delivery from London takes a matter of days, whilst delivery of images not yet available from London usually only takes 10 days. Previously, payment had to be made in advance and delivery often took months. Priroda operates two satellite types, Resource F-1 and F-2. Three or four flights per year are made, each lasting about 30 days, with a maximum of 17 days of photography. Vertical incidence imagery is available at latitudes up to 82.3o and specific areas can be overflown on request.
