This morning at 0530 [0430 GMT] the Chetniks launched a fierce artillery and tank attack on the central part of the Brcko defense. From the direction of Cadjavac, the enemy has been firing from tanks and 120-mm mortars, and with antiaircraft guns and machine guns from several positions. This morning's attack on our positions has just been the continuation of what the aggressor was up to on the Brcko front overnight, when the defense lines were exposed to enemy attacks from recoilless guns, mortars, hand grenades, and antiaircraft guns and machine guns. Djukici and the central part of the Brcko defense were the main target of the aggressor's attacks. The key part of the so-called northern corridor is the reason why the free Brcko territory has been under constant and fierce offensives by the Serbian aggressor ever since the outbreak of the war. That this is not going to end is confirmed by frequent reports on attacks by our forces that can be heard on Radio Bastille [radio bastilja, derogatory term for Belgrade Radio]. This, the central nervous system of Serbian fascism, has been spreading lies about alleged offensives of our units on the temporarily occupied Brcko, and thus calling for a new mobilization of Serbs in the so-called Yugoslavia for the Brcko front. The alertness and combat readiness of our fighters, and the high morale of all the citizens of the free Brcko territory are in line with the seriousness and importance of the Brcko front.
