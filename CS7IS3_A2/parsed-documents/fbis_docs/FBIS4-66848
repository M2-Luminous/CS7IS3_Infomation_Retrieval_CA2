All the political parties will try to test their strength in this by-election as this will be the first election since the November 1993 election that will show which party still has the hold on the people and which party is losing its support. There were seven seats vacant in the state and the Election Commission is holding elections for six of these seats. The election for the remaining seat will be possible only after the Supreme Court issues its decision as several cases associated with this controversial district are being tried in the Supreme Court. The seven districts where elections are to be held are: Hastinapur (Meerut), Nidholikala, Kasganj (Eta district), Jaswant Nagar (Etawah district), Unnao (Unnao district), Manjhanpur (Allahabad district), and Gazipur (Gazipur district). The Commission has suspended the by-election in Jaswantnagar until the Supreme Court makes its decision. Therefore, at present election will be held only in six districts. Among these, Hastinapur (Meerut) and Manjhanpur (Allahabad) are reserved seats. The most important election races will be in Nidholikala and Kansganj because the candidates who later became chief ministers had run for elections here and these seats were vacated because of their appointments. Present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh had run from Nidholikala and former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh from Kasganj. These chief ministers had run for election from other districts also and had to give up these seats because they had won there as well. The national working committee of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has decided that tickets for these seats will be issued to the same candidates who had ran for election here the last time and has decided the names of its candidates already. It will make the announcement after looking at the list of candidates running on the main rival, the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] coalition. If necessary, candidates may be changed in special situations. It is difficult to change candidates once the announcement has been made. Meanwhile, the names of SP-BSP coalition candidates have also been decided. According to their agreement, both BSP and SP will have candidates run in two constituencies. The two major political parties of the state--the Congress and the Janata Dal--will not stay behind. They also consider these by-elections important. The Congress and the Janata Dal will also have their former candidates in those districts run again. However, both these parties need strong candidates with money and power behind them in Nidholikala and Kasganj districts. The Janata Dal will nominate Yadav candidates in both districts because they had Yadav candidates the last time also. Anil Yadav had run on the Congress ticket in Nidholikala last time, however, the Congress Party can also change its both candidates for the by-elections. The Kasganj and Nidholikala districts are more important than others. The political situation in Nidholikala and Kasganj is very similar, because both districts are similar in size and population. The make up of voters is different. In Kasganj vidhan sabha district, there are 45,000 Lodhis, 18,000 Brahmans, 20,000 Banias [trader caste], and the rest is made of other castes. The former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh had ran for election here keeping this distribution of voters in mind. Kalyan Singh was successful because all the votes of higher castes (Lodhi, Brahman, and Bania) went to him. Kalyan Singh got the Lodhi vote because of his caste, and Brahman-Bania votes because of his party. Kalyan Singh had won the election by 45,000 votes. The remaining votes of Harijans, backwards, and Muslims were shared by all candidates. The number of these votes was small. The voter distribution in Nidholikala is similar to Kasganj. The majority of voters (40,000) are Yadavs. There are 19,000 Rajputs, and 10,000 Lodhis. The remaining votes are of other caste members. Mulayam Singh had run for elections considering the Yadav votes as his base. He was successful as he got 40,000 Yadav and some Harijan and Muslim votes as well as 2,000 Lodhi votes. The specialty of these two seats and the two candidates was that both of them were candidates for chief ministership which helped them get the votes of their own caste as well as vote from support groups. The situation in these by-elections is very different. There is no chief minister aspirant who had put the caste pride in the hands of the voters of their own caste, which this had helped remove all in-fighting and differences. Those who were running for vidhan sabha seats could not raise any issue or slogan as caste was controlling everything here. The caste will not control the election this time. The people will focus on development projects and issues, and will votes after analyzing the good and bad deeds of the government. The government has started some work to keep Harijans and Muslims happy. Recently, a confrontational situation had developed between the Harijans and the police over a statue of Amedekar. The state government transferred the police officers from Shergarhi police station and took over the task of installing the statue and finding land for it. In order to charm the Muslim voters, the government changed the name of Kanpur village to Akbarpur. The people there were openly opposing it. The leaders of other parties complained that the government was changing names of places following the policy of appeasement in order to benefit in the by-election. The question is whether the Harijans will vote for the party in power again because the incidence of confrontation between the Harijans and other backward castes has increased after the SP-BSP government was installed. The Harijans have not forgotten it. The officials in the government media are also opposing the government's publicity methods.
