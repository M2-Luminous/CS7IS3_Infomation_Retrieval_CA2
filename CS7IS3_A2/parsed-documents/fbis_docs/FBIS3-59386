Well-Developed Market System Is Basis of a Normal Socialist Market Economy To set up a socialist market economic system, we must nurture and develop a market system. A well-developed, perfect market system is the basis of a normal socialist market economy. Without a well-developed, perfect market system, we cannot begin to talk about converting to the market economy, nor can we successfully develop a socialist market economy. The essence of the restructuring of China's economic system lies in developing the commodity economy and market relationships and expanding the role of the market mechanisms, so that the factors of production can change according to the law of value and the supply and demand conditions and find their own way into the more efficient industries and enterprises, and in turn the in-demand trades and industries and advanced enterprises can undergo rapid development, while the unwanted trades and industries and backward enterprises are squeezed out and even eliminated, so that society as a whole can achieve optimal allocation of resources. A market system that meets the needs of the development of the socialist market economy must necessarily be a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system and a system that is fairly well structured. To be unified, we need uniform market rules and regulations as well as policies. We must smash all types of artificial blockades, overcome market obstacles, and create a nationwide great circulation, great market pattern. To be open, we must open up internally--open up the provinces and municipalities and the localities, and we must open up externally--open up to the outside world and link the domestic markets with the international markets. To be competitive, we must have an environment to accommodate complete and fair competition. We must oppose monopoly, especially administrative monopoly, and oppose racketeering; but at the same time, we must avoid cutthroat competition. To be orderly, all market activities must be put on a standardized, legalized track so that all transactions are open and all deals are fair and there are laws to abide by and rules to follow, creating an orderly market. To nurture and develop the market system, we must set up a proper and complete market structure and develop other types of markets at the same time. Market construction must meet the objective needs of the economy so that "the development of every market enlivens a sector of the economy and enriches some of the people." We must avoid the situation where after we make a great effort to set up a market, there is no market participation and few market transactions. We must rectify the chaotic situation in the market where: "You build a market, then I build one too; since you control a market, I want one too; because you give your permission, I will too; your market is big, but mine is even bigger." We should develop not only commodities markets but also capital goods markets. We must not only help the domestic market flourish but also develop international markets. We must not only develop spot markets but also gradually set up futures markets (We should set up commodities futures market before we set up financial futures markets.) We should develop not only markets for tangibles but also markets for intangibles, and we should set up tender and auction markets. From another perspective, developing the market system involves two areas: One is to set up the hardware system which includes market facilities, warehouse facilities, and railroads and highways. The other is the software system which includes management, information, telecommunications, and laws and regulations. When the government nurtures and develops the market, it should pay attention not only to the hardware system, but more importantly, it should develop the software system and establish a proper framework. II. Price Reform Is the Key to the Formation of the Market System At the heart of the market mechanism is the pricing mechanism. Price reform is the key to market development and the creation of the market system. The market's role in allocating resources is mainly guided by and achieved through the market prices and their changes. To set up a socialist market economic system, we must deepen price reform, set up a market price system that is regulated and controlled at the macro level, and give full play to the role of the market mechanisms. After 15 years of price reform, China has made substantive progress in this area. Ninety percent of the consumer goods have been decontrolled and are now regulated by the market. The double track pricing of capital goods is fast merging into a single track, and most of them have adopted the market's single track price. After rectification and decontrol, the price of services has become more reasonable; the process of marketizing the price of factors of production has also begun. Meanwhile, a new price regulation and control system is gradually being set up: For example, the comprehensive use of fiscal and monetary measures to control the overall price level has produced some results, and we have accumulated some useful experience; we have set up a reserve system for important goods and materials which can be used to suppress market prices; more than a dozen provinces and more than 60 cities have set up price regulation funds for key products; and we also have promulgated laws and regulations to regulate pricing behavior. Price reform has clearly improved the once seriously distorted pricing structure. The long-depressed relative prices of agricultural products and basic industrial products have been raised: Comparing 1992 to 1978, agricultural product procurement price has increased 176.5 percent; the retail price of rural industrial products has increased 83.2 percent; prices of excavated products have increased 165.7 percent; raw industrial materials, 150.2 percent; processed industrial products, 114.8 percent. More than 95 percent of the imported commodities are using the agent system, and domestic market prices have linked up with international market prices. Even now, price reform is not yet complete. The saying that price reform has successfully climbed ten-thousand mountains is not exactly true. Although market mechanisms and pricing mechanisms now play an important role in regulating production and demand, price reform is still an arduous task. There are still no market prices for factors of production, and therefore the market's basic role in allocating resources is constrained. Some important factors of production are still under the double-track pricing system; the task of merging tracks has not yet been accomplished. The domestic market prices of some products still deviate significantly from international prices, and as a result, we cannot use comparative cost as a basis to regulate their import and export to improve foreign trade efficiency. The price regulation and control system is unsound, and we have few material means to keep the market in line, so that when the market price of some products begins to fluctuate, we cannot effective apply macro regulation and control measures and reduce the magnitude of price fluctuation by means of expanding or contracting product circulation, regulating import and export, or making use of the market regulation fund and so on. To promote market development and give full play to the role of the market mechanisms and further develop the market system, we must accomplish the following price reform tasks: Within the next 3 years, we should decontrol the prices of goods and services that are competitive. This also means closing the double-track pricing system for factors of production (the competitive portion) by shifting to the market price track. Within the next 3 to 5 years, we should sort out and readjust the government-set prices of goods and services. The focus is on raising the prices of basic products and services. In the near-term, we should merge the yuan's double-track prices and implement a variable exchange rate system. Domestic and foreign market prices should be pegged. Prices of commercial goods should link tracks first. We should accelerate the process of marketization of capital, land, and other key factors of production. We should further establish and perfect the price regulation and control system that focuses on keeping the product price level relatively stable (with annual increases not exceeding 10 percent) and the prices of important commodities relatively steady. We should promulgate and perfect laws and regulations that guarantee the normal functioning of the market price system and set up a perfect and open market information network. III. Focus on the Development of Markets for Key Factors of Production Henceforth, when we further develop and perfect markets for goods, we must also focus on the development of markets for factors of production. At the end of 1992, nationwide, we had more than 1,000 wholesale capital goods markets, more than 1,000 wholesale markets for industrial consumption goods, more than 1,600 wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products, and nearly 80,000 township country fair markets, and some important commodities exchange markets experimenting with futures exchange have also begun to emerge. In the future, as needed by the development of market economy, we should set up some standardized, nationwide wholesale markets and exchanges for industrial and agricultural products in localities where important commodities are produced, sold, or collected and distributed, and on that basis, we can choose a handful of products to test the commodities futures market. In the near-term, we can concentrate efforts on setting up proper futures markets for grain, cotton, oil, nonferrous metals, and crude oil, and we should have strict regulations and gradually link these markets with the international market network. We should reform the existing commercial and commodity circulation systems and gradually create a wholesale system and a retail system that integrate large, medium, and small enterprises; and that combine and mix different economic formats as well as different operating styles. A perfect commodity economy should be a large, open system where all kinds of commodities can circulate freely across industrial sectors, regions, and national boundaries. This system should be able to link the domestic and foreign markets and provide strong incentives as well as pressure to improve the quality of the nation's economic activities and promote the development of the socialist market economy. If the market mechanisms are to play a basic role in allocating resources, the factors of production must be able to circulate in the market. In the near-term, we must put the emphasis of market construction on nurturing and developing the fledgling capital goods markets. Capital is the most precious, the most scarce resource in a market economy. The capital market is the hub of the whole market economy. The key to realizing the optimal allocation of resources lies in developing a perfect capital market and increasing the use-efficiency of capital. In a capital market, there are two ways to raise capital--directly and indirectly. In the near to intermediate-term, China will still rely on the indirect method of raising capital, but at the same time, we will actively develop various ways to raise capital directly. As for the proportion of funds raised directly and indirectly, it cannot be determined artificially; it can only be determined amid competition. Today, the development of the capital market is plagued by lack of discipline and disorder which have given rise to all kinds of reckless fund gathering and distribution activities. To develop the capital market, we must gradually let the market set the interest rates and promptly end the double-track and multiple-track systems. The central bank must be able to regulate market rates by taking control of the basic interest rates. China already has a fledgling money market. Henceforth, using existing regional short-term inter-bank loan markets as base, we should smash regional blockades, standardize market management, and form a nationwide unified money market. We should develop bill discounting and mortgage business, further develop the short-term government bond market, and allow the central bank to engage in open market operations to buy and sell government bonds. Land is a scarce and non-renewable resource. We must treasure it and put it to proper use. We must take a step further to implement a compensated, limited-term land-use system and develop the land market to give play to the market mechanisms' role in optimizing the allocation of land resource. In the urban market system, the state should monopolize the primary market, but the secondary market should be decontrolled. Today, whether in the primary or the secondary market, we still do not have the mechanism that lets the market set the price of land-use rights. Henceforth, the sale and transfer of commercial land-use rights should be conducted through public tender or auction to make the process more competitive and transparent. In the long-run, we should concentrate on setting up a "posted-price" system to guide and standardize land prices, and it can also be used as a basis for levying land tax. By levying a real estate business tax, income tax, and value-added tax, the state need not lose its share of profit generated by land when land-use rights are being transferred or traded. We must crack down on illegal speculation of land, reckless jacking up of land prices, and other activities to exact exorbitant profit, and we must not funnel too much money into the land market. In turning over agricultural land to non-agricultural use, we must comply with the land-use plan and proceed with restraint. We should gradually set up a labor market. First we must acknowledge the market mechanisms' basic role in the proper allocation of resources. To this end, we must change the wage system. The state should no longer serve as employer or assigner of jobs. Wages should be determined by labor productivity rate and supply and demand in the labor market. Payment for labor should be in monetary terms. We should permit and even guide the proper circulation of the labor force and smash the labor market's regional boundaries in a planned and systematic way to gradually eliminate the iron rice bowl, the iron-clad wage system, and the iron chair--guaranteed employment. We must further develop the technologies and information markets. Developing the technologies market is of great importance to the commercialization and industrialization of advanced and new technologies, to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement, and to the orientation of scientific and technological work toward the main battleground of economic construction. We must promulgate a perfect set of laws and regulations to protect intellectual property rights and protect the transfer of the fruits of science and technology. Developing the information market is an inherent requirement in the establishment of a well-developed, mature market system. Henceforth, the technologies, information, and consultation service industries must operate like enterprises. Their services should be society-based, and their products and services should be commercialized, and we should bring in the competitive mechanisms. We should also vigorously develop a market for property rights and a housing market and so on. We must control the cost and price of houses, so that most urban residents can get into the housing market. IV. Vigorously Develop Market Intermediaries The vigorous development of market intermediaries is an important link in the normal functioning and the healthy development of the socialist market economy. The better developed the modern market economy, the broader the economic entities' market ties, and the busier and more specialized and technical the market exchange activities, the more we need to have qualified market entities, different types of developed markets, and stringent market rules and regulation; on top of that, we must also set up and develop market intermediaries to serve those taking part in the market activities and to promote the orderly conduct of market activities. Currently, the kinds of market intermediaries we need to develop include the following: Self-disciplinary institutions, such as various types of trade federations and trade associations, that coordinate and constrain the behavior of personnel in enterprises and trades and industries who participate in market activities; brokerages, mortgage companies, and auction houses that directly engage in market transaction services; accounting firms, auditing firms, law firms, appraisers--especially land appraisers--who are there to guarantee equitable market transactions and fair competition; institutions that provide research, consultation, and information services to promote market development; price-quotation systems, settlement centers, materials allocation and delivery centers, and warehouses; arbitration organs to settle market disputes; quantity measurement, quality control, product inspection, and other production service agencies to supervise market activities; a whole spectrum of circulation intermediaries, such as rural circulation associations, that help develop rural markets and help the scattered peasants get into the market; employment agencies and personnel exchange centers that promote the circulation of well-trained and untrained workers. Market intermediaries generally should be created from the bottom up, by enterprises themselves, on a voluntary basis. Their main functions are to provide their member enterprises with information, advice, and legal and business services; train specialized personnel; open up international communications channels; represent the member enterprises' and individuals' interests in settling business disputes. They draw up guild regulations and trade pacts according to market regulations, impose collective self-discipline, supervise market transactions, fight unfair competition, and guarantee normal production and marketing order, and these include conscious compliance with the state's quality standards, refusal to engage in improper competition, and refusal to enter into collusion to set monopolistic prices and divide up the market. They smooth the relationship between enterprises and government, so that the trade federations and trade associations become self-coordinated.
