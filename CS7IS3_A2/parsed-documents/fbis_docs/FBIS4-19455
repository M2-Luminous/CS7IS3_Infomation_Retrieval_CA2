Your own election, for example, was a complex contest, do you agree? [Scognamiglio] I believe that two lessons can be drawn from the uncertainty surrounding my election as speaker of the Senate. One is political in nature, and the other technical. These are serious issues that must be tackled and solved. [Sunseri] Let us start from the first. Which is the political issue? [Scognamiglio] The political problem is no doubt linked to the majority's enlargement. It seems obvious to me that the existing majority is too puny, at least in the Senate, to enable the country to be governed acceptably. I am concerned about what may happen when important laws, such as the finance bill or the budget, have to be passed. There is the risk that the legislative system may become paralyzed, which would certainly not do Italy any good. [Sunseri] Do you have any proposals to make concerning the enlargement of the majority? [Scognamiglio] It is not up to me to make any operational proposals. It is a task for politicians, and I am not a politician but a professor. I have now been elected Senate speaker, and it is my duty to make it function properly. However, I believe that reaching broader agreements is essential to avoid the danger of paralysis. [Sunseri] However, your own appointment, which was secured in such an aggressive fashion, certainly does not help in seeking broader agreements, do you not agree? [Scognamiglio] What you are saying does not seem very accurate to me. My election was not secured by forcing the situation, but rather, it resulted from an act of clarity. A candidacy was submitted, and then consensus was sought. The candidacy obtained the necessary support, and was therefore approved. I find nothing abnormal in such a procedure. [Sunseri] But how do you feel being the speaker of a house which is split down the middle, and in which your name prevailed only by a single vote? [Scognamiglio] I feel fine. I will be the speaker for all the senators, not only of those who voted for me. I think calling me only a half-speaker does not do justice to the real situation. A vote was taken, and this led to a result. Everything took place by the book, and it is pointless to dwell on whether the majority was achieved by one vote or one hundred. We must now forget this. I feel I represent all the senators, and that it is my task to ensure that the assembly can function fully. [Sunseri] However, without a majority it will be difficult. [Scognamiglio] Of course. This is why I favor seeking new alliances. This, however, is not my task. My duty is to safeguard the institution. Politicians must muster the necessary consensus to ensure that the country can be governed. [Sunseri] Earlier on, apart from the political aspect, you were mentioning a technical problem. Does the Bocconi [Milan University] professor intend to apply his theories to the government institutions? [Scognamiglio] The problem is very simple. The Senate's organization was set up on the basis of the old proportional law. Now it has been elected through a majority system. Clearly, changes must be introduced to take account of this fundamental difference. Once upon a time, agreements were reached behind closed doors, which today, however, must be opened. I am committed to this goal, and will not pursue it alone. I will seek agreement with all other collegiate bodies.
