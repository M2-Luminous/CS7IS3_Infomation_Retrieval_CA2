The outcome of this personal battle is far from certain. Rocco Tolfa reports: [Tolfa] Allies and antagonists, Bossi and Berlusconi are united in the government, but Bossi and Berlusconi are also the eternal duellists. Their relationship has always been stormy and now it is becoming increasingly bitter in the run-up to the European elections. Umberto Bossi says that Berlusconi is the restorer of the old regime and the leader of an opportunist political movement which Bossi compares to an empty box. Bossi has also fired a warning shot at Berlusconi: We will not defend the government at all costs. Berlusconi is losing patience and says that those who believe in what Bossi says don't know anything. However, he refuses to be more critical because he says that he does not want to create tensions in his government and because he is convinced that Bossi's outbursts will lose the Northern League votes. The prime minister then passes a pitiless comment: Gianfranco Fini is an ally on whim one can depend.
