Political interests should not be a major factor in the issue of privatizations. The most important concern should be the national reality and the need to reform the state, the minister said. "If we want to reform and reduce the state, we must privatize public companies," Sandoval stressed. "Here, the question is one of structure or change of structures. No matter what government is installed in the country, it must proceed with the privatization program," Sandoval said. The issue, however, continues to face opposition in the Senate. Sandoval said the privatization of public companies is an economic, social, and political fact currently in effect everywhere in the world because it has been recognized that the entrepreneurial state is a failure. Consequently, it is necessary to transfer inefficient state companies to the private sector, Sandoval said. The minister recalled that in the past, such entities were put under state control because of a doctrine that practically did not leave anything in private hands. Sandoval said the Wasmosy administration has the clear purpose of implementing a privatization program. "Political interests cannot prevail, for the national reality is at stake. No matter the political orientation, if we want to reduce and reform the state, we must transfer public companies to private hands," the minister said. Sandoval pointed out that all governments need to open up their administration, adding that an indication of that openness will be "getting rid of inefficient state companies." The minister said some people wrongly think that privatizing means losing state assets. "Political interests should not prevail. The most important thing is the decision to reduce the state, which must become more efficient. The state must get rid of the burden of maintaining public companies that more often than not operate in the red and provide poor services, according to the evaluation made by the community itself." When reporters pointed out that politicians, particularly from the Colorado Party, do not seem to want these companies transferred to private hands because they are used for patronage, Sandoval said he did not think privatizations will have a political cost. "I think the electoral cost could be a lot worse if backward economic structures are maintained," Sandoval added. The minister said no political party will succeed unless it can modernize the country's economic base to encourage private investments. "We will get many more votes if we get the country to sustain solid growth. This can be achieved only if we eliminate factors creating backwardness and underdevelopment, that is, inefficient companies. Maintaining these companies will have a political cost in the long term," the finance minister concluded.
