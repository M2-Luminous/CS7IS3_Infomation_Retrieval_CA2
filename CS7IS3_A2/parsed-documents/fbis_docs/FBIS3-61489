It was found that the chief anomalous features of inertial and tidal waves were their increased intensity, and that the intensity depends on the depth of the horizon, as well as on frequency and time. At the same time the intensity of the waves decreased considerably towards the ocean's surface. Conclusions which could be drawn from the above were first that inertial and tidal waves are generated locally in the lower levels of the ocean, and secondly that on the average they lose their energy as they rise towards the surface. On the basis of similarities between some of the data obtained in the Mesopolygon experiment and data obtained in other regions, the authors speculate that the generation of inertial and tidal waves in this area may be caused by an intrusive lens of Mediterranean waters.
