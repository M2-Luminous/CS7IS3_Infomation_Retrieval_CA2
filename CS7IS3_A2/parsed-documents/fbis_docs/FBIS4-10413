Fewer than 10 percent will be specialized jurists. Nearly half of the 305 delegates to the Constituent Convention will be lawyers, the lists of candidates from the nation as a whole reveal. However, jurists specializing in constitutional law will comprise less than 10 percent of the total number of attorneys. The projected profile of the future convention, based on the votes obtained by political forces in the most recent elections, will also include a large number of teachers and doctors, followed by trade unionists, engineers, clerk/secretaries, and businessmen. They will be joined by economists, accountants, farmers, and journalists, plus dentists, former military men, housewives, a bishop, and possibly a poet! However, the list would not be representative if it were not observed that a very large percentage of these professionals--no more than a dozen of the likely conventioneers have no higher or university degrees--have not toiled in their profession for years, having devoted all their efforts to politics. Members Therefore, it is not surprising to find provincial or national lawmakers, intendants, officials from various areas, and party presidents who, by virtue of their charisma, their distinguished political careers, because they are in positions of leadership, or based on strictly numerical considerations will supply more votes for the partisan mills. The party affiliation of most candidates would seem to indicate that the convention will have more of a political than constituent tint. The points of greatest interest to President Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, head of the UCR [Radical Civic Union], were put together in a "package" that will be voted upon without being opened! Which explains the concern of the leaders of the two majority parties over taking delegates to the convention who will be faithful to the Olivos Pact rather than ones who might contribute to reform. Insurance It is the Justicialist Party (PJ) that is most interested in the business of election insurance. Many of those heading the lists are in fact provincial governors, followed by deputy governors and even former governors. Ramon Ortega (Tucuman), Adolfo Rodriguez Saa (San Luis), Nestor Kirchner (Santa Cruz), Eduardo Duhalde (Buenos Aires), Carlos Reutemann (Santa Fe), Ruben Marin (La Pampa), Mario Moine (Entre Rios), and Federico Puerta (Misiones) head the PJ lists as well as the governments of their respective districts, while Radical Carlos Maestro does the same in Chubut. Deputy Governors Gildo Insfran (Formosa), Julio Diaz Lozano (Tucuman), Eduardo Arnold (Santa Cruz), and Miguel Robles (Santa Fe) will back their chiefs from the next, although no less predictable, posts. Also enjoying every chance at a convention spot are former Peronist governors Arturo Puricelli (Santa Cruz) and Jorge Escobar, removed from his stewardship of San Juan. Two governors will have the inestimable presence of their wives in the assembly: Evangelina Salazar de Ortega (former actress) and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (attorney) are certain to represent Tucuman and Santa Cruz respectively at the convention. Because of its legal status, the capital could not fall back on the governor, but the ruling party found a way to make sure the assumed insurance would be just as important as in the rest of the districts. The names topping that list belong to five officials from the Central Government: Carlos Corach (legal and technical secretary), Raul Matera (Science and Technology secretary), Matilde Menendez (head of PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan]), Claudia Bello (Civil Service secretary), and Adelina Dalesio de Viola (president of the National Mortgage Bank). Justicialists Alberto Pierri and Eduardo Menem, who head the Chamber of Deputies and Senate, will be convention delegates from Buenos Aires and La Rioja, while the UCR will send former President Raul Alfonsin to the assembly, also for Buenos Aires. Bishops and Poets Few convention candidates are from unusual professions (no value judgment intended). Among them, Jaime de Nevares, bishop emeritus of Neuquen, will very likely have a seat, representing the Grand Front, along with poet David Gatica (PJ, La Rioja). However, the latter is an alternate on the party list. The names of farmers Oscar Paz (Republican Force, Tucuman) and Jose Piccinato (UCR, Santiago del Estero) and journalists Jose Mantilla (PJ, La Pampa) and Domingo Schiavoni (PJ, Santiago del Estero) are sure to go down in history. Formosa Deputy Governor Insfran is a veterinarian, a profession he shares with La Pampa Radical Carlos D'Amico. Susana Sanchez (UCR, La Pampa) is a housewife, while the first candidate for the Cordoban UCR, Ramon Mestre, is a dentist and the former intendant of Cordoba. One important fact for possible future mothers who might be active in the Constituent Convention: They will be able to rely on the presence of delegate Ada de Liggerini (PJ, Entre Rios), who is an obstetrician.
