Today, he reiterated the idea of a Jerusalem united under Israeli control. For the old part of the city, at the center of the dispute, Rabin has proposed a tripartite administration. Miguel Moreira reports. [Moreira] This morning Rabin spoke for more than an hour with Portuguese businessmen and tried to convince them that to invest in Israel could prove very beneficial. According to Rabin, peace is very close and the future is promising. The AIP [Portuguese Industrial Association] personnel answered by nodding their heads. They are willing to go forward with new deals in civil construction and textiles. At this meeting, Rabin reiterated that the administration of the sacred part of the city of Jerusalem should be a tripartite one. [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed translation into Portuguese] We believe that one has to distinguish between the living city of Jerusalem and the holy city of Jerusalem for the three religions. We are committed to allow free access and free religious practice to the members of the Christian and Muslim religious communities. But it is more than that. The administration of religious shrines is not carried out by Israel; it is in the hands of the various churches. [end recording] [Moreira] After the visit to the AIP, Rabin went to the Assembly of the Republic where he met [Assembly Speaker] Barbosa de Melo and a number of political leaders. At the moment, he is having lunch at Belem Palace with President Soares.
