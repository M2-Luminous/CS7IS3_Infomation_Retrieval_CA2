As long as this decision is in force, parliament will not have a moral right to speak up against the violations of national minority rights in the neighborhood, because it has also joined the lines of those who violate these rights. After this, what can be said to the accusations that Hungarian legislation does not practice what it preaches? While in all Europe, it is probably this parliament that speaks most about national minority rights, it has not really done anything more to solve this tense problem of the region than the parliaments and governments it so often criticizes. Naturally, there is an explanation to the ominous decision -- discarding the "corporative element of representation" -- however, this does not at all appears to be convincing when we consider what is at stake. The decision certainly goes against the national minorities; mainly because the parliamentary parties were obviously unable even to bear the thought of the very hypothetical possibility that the representatives of national minorities might decide the voting on a certain political issue. Narrow party political considerations decided a matter that should not have anything to do with party politics. If there is an all-national problem then it is the national minority issue; therefore, it is simply astounding how little the deputies were able to realize that progress cannot be made through superficial rhetoric, empty speech, and especially not through indiscriminately denouncing the neighboring national minority policies. Instead, it can mainly be done through example. Among other things, through Hungary generously and without hesitation granting all rights to its national minorities that can be given in Europe at the moment, and which it itself expects from others. This generosity would be simple in our case, because we have fewer citizens belonging to national minorities than the neighboring countries have. If we cannot find acceptable solutions even in these circumstances, then what right do we have to expect the neighboring countries to deal with the national minority issues on their merit? Of course, in the given case, international assessments are not the major problem. After all, we should settle our national minority problems for our own good rather than to give an example to others. These rights would be due to the national minorities in Hungary even if all Hungarians living beyond the border were deprived of them. The simple reason is that these people are Hungarian citizens, the constitutional provisions apply to them the same way as to others. And Hungary, after all, is a democratic constitutional state. This fact of being a constitutional state appears to have been violated through parliament's antiminority decision. This in itself is enough shame. It would be even bigger shame if we cannot find a remedy to this wounding of Hungary's national minorities before the next elections.
