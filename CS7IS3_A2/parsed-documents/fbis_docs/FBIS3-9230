He stressed that the SNS would react to all steps taken by the government. "The SNS is waiting for signals by the government and then we will response," he noted. Kona said he was convinced that Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian parties, with which the new cabinet wants to cooperate, did not contribute to a calm atmosphere on the Slovak political scene. Before the early elections scheduled for autumn, the SNS intends to focus on attitudes of the Hungarian parties and reactions to them. "The SNS finds it very interesting that it is the Hungarian parties which hold the balance of power in Parliament," Kona said.
