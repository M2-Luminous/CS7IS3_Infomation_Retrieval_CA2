Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, by Vladimir Smyk, RIA NOVOSTI correspondent (especially for RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA); place and date not given: "At Magnitka, Hurrah!"] [Text] The first stage of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill was put into operation at Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine on 21 May. In connection with this RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA asked S. Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, to answer a number of questions. [Smyk] Serafim Zakharovich, even when the country's economy was on the rise, central newspapers reported an event of such scope in big headlines. But in our days it inspires us with special feeling: Not only bankruptcies of enterprises and the shutdown of main conveyers are today's reality. Of course, this is an emotional evaluation by a journalist. Do professionals subscribe to it? [Afonin] Indeed, today, during a period when we face difficult questions and are engaged in a search for a way out of the crisis that has affected the economy, such concepts as "labor victory" sound unusual. However, for those that with their own hands built the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill and for those that will work on it--moreover, for all workers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine--the day of 21 May was a true holiday. [Smyk] What does the production line represent? [Afonin] These are six roughing stands, through which a billet passes in stages. At the entry it is 250 mm thick. Passing a 1/2-km path, the slab turns into a sheet about 2 mm thick. Right after the roughing this rolled metal, a so-called plate, is of independent industrial significance. It is used for various kinds of structures in the machine-building and construction industry. It must be stated that the combine, before commissioning the first stage, found orders for plate, that is, expenditures on the construction of the project will begin to be recovered before the commissioning of the second stage. The 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill with an annual productivity of 5 million tonnes of rolled metal (the real load will be 4 million) will be commissioned in August. [Smyk] Can existing rolling capacities coexist with the new ones? [Afonin] No. Two obsolete mills are now being removed from service at the combine. In general, it must be said that the construction of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill represents a central moment in the reconstruction of the leader of Russian metallurgy--the Magnitogorsk Combine--carried out in three stages. [Smyk] How many work places are vacated at the combine as a result of the reconstruction? [Afonin] In all, 15,000. The program for the creation of new work places is being actively realized right now. People working with obsolete equipment under quite difficult conditions are offered a number of new production facilities, that is, of machine-building and construction specialization. A new bakery has been commissioned and a meat combine is on the eve of a start-up... Today the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine is a multispecialization joint-stock company--no one will remain without a job. The combine's modernization will have a beneficial effect on the working and living conditions of workers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. The federal program for the retooling of metallurgy is being truly realized in this Ural city. [Smyk] The next question concerns financing: How much did the 2000 mill cost and how did you manage to find funds? [Afonin] At present prices, approximately 1 trillion rubles. Its construction began at the end of the 1980's. Therefore, the combine managed to get substantial state support. It amounted to approximately 60 percent. Magnitka earned the rest of the money itself. [Smyk] The situation has changed now. The new budget is another evidence of this. Can the federal program be fulfilled without strong state subsidies? [Afonin] State support must be expressed in the government's creation of optimum conditions for enterprises, under which they could earn money. We laid down the following principle in the federal program for the modernization of metallurgy: Metallurgists expect to earn more than 90 percent of the necessary funds themselves. [Smyk] Does this mean that metallurgists are fully satisfied with government activity? [Afonin] For a start, let us discuss what we are not satisfied with. First, with the fact that the problem of nonpayments is being solved slowly; second, with the way rates of railroad transport and of electric power are being formed. The government must work out a system of measures so that the transport and energy components of the cost of products are not a burden on the entire economy. Third, naturally, taxes. We criticized our colleagues from the Ministry of Finance. During the formation of the budget it is incorrect to proceed from the principle: balance for the sake of balance. Furthermore, under crisis conditions the budget part should not be collected from enterprises by all conceivable and inconceivable extortions. As a result, the producer is left with funds, which often are not sufficient for the organization of simple reproduction, not to mention expanded reproduction. [Smyk] As far as I know, at a recent economic conference in Lipetsk managers of the metallurgical complex worked out proposals for the government, including on tax policy. [Afonin] They are now in the government, and I cannot say, in order to put them off indefinitely. At a meeting with managers of industrial and transport enterprises during the signing of the "Agreement on Accord" Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin said that the government saw the corrections, including in the tax system, which should motivate production growth. Apparently, however, the correction of tax policy will begin not earlier than next year.
