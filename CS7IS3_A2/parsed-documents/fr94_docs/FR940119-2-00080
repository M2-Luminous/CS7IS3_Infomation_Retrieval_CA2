Prior to December 8, 1993, applicant, formerly Integrated Cash Fund, an open-end management investment company was a Massachusetts business trust. On July 8, 1986, applicant filed a notification of registration under section 8(a) of the Act. On July 9, 1986, applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act to register an indefinite number of shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share. The registration statement became effective on January 6, 1987. Applicant commenced operations and the initial public offering of its shares on September 23, 1987. 2. On March 31, 1993, applicant's Board of Trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Agreement'') between applicant and SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc. (File No. 811&hyph;3807, formerly SunAmerica Money Market Securities, Inc., ``SunAmerica''), providing for the transfer of substantially all of applicant's assets and liabilities to SunAmerica Money Market Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a separate investment series of SunAmerica, in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. 3. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act, at a joint meeting held on March 31, 1993, the Board of Trustees/Directors of each of applicant and SunAmerica determined that participation in the reorganization was in the best interest of the shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization. These findings, and the basis upon which such findings were made, were recorded in the minute books of each investment company. 4. Proxy materials relating to the reorganization were filed with the SEC and distributed to applicant's sharedholders on or about July 29, 1993. On September 23, 1993, a majority of applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization. 5. The reorganization was effected pursuant to the Agreement at a closing held on September 24, 1993. Applicant distributed in complete liquidation, pro rata to its shareholders of record as of the closet of business on September 24, 1993, the full and fractional shares acquired in the exchange. The net asset value of Acquiring Fund shares received by applicant's shareholders was equal to the net asset value of applicant's shares held by such shareholders. 6. No brokerage commissions were paid on the transfer of assets from applicant to the Fund. Expenses for effecting the reorganization were borne by applicant and SunAmerica. Such expenses included preparation of proxy materials, printing expenses, and legal and accounting fees. 7. On December 8, 1993, applicant filed a Certificate of Termination of Trust with the Secretary of State of Massachusetts business trust. 8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no assets, liabilities, or shareholders. All liabilities and obligations not discharged by applicant on or before September 24, 1993 were assumed by, and became the obligations of, the Acquiring Fund. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 9. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administration proceeding. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
