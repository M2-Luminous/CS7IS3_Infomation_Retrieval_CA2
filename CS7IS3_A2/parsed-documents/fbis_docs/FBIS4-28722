According to Burmese Government news agencies, five elected representatives and three party organizers returned to the legal fold in the capital of Kachin State, Myitkyina, in northern Burma last week. Two years ago, these gentlemen fled to the border area controlled by the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and formed the NLD Liberated Area-North. BBC correspondent Larry Jagen dispatches the following report: Dear Listeners: More than a week ago, eight members of the National League for Democracy, who set up their office in the armed group-controlled area of (Pagyawng) two years ago, brought down the NLD flag, closed the office, and headed for Myitkyina. According to Burmese Television news, these NLD members returned to the legal fold after having gone into the jungle, but observers believe that they returned to Burma legally on their own volition because they were no longer permitted to continue to carry out their political activities. According to a reliable opposition source, these eight people returned to Myitkyina to continue to work for regaining democratic rights in Burma. They returned to Myitkyina with the help of the Kachin armed group, the KIO. Not long ago, the KIO completed the singing of a cease-fire agreement with the military government. A source in Kachin State says that since a cease-fire agreement has been signed, their return to mainland Burma is natural because they did not act as an armed opposition group. It says some of these politicians are from various parts of Kachin State, while others belong to a Burmese group from outside the KIO-controlled area. It also says that they were sent back to Myitkyina on their request. This kind of development will continue to be a problem because it has been learned that there were some activities going on long before the KIO signed the cease-fire agreement -- long before February. According to the opposition source, these political leaders have wanted to return home since last year. These elected representatives planned to make the political transition [returning to the legal fold] after holding discussions with members of the exiled NCGUB, National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, and other NLD elected representatives at the Manerplaw camp along the Thai-Burmese border last September. It says the KIO explained and prohibited them from making a political transition and arranged their journey back to (Pagyawng) camp through areas controlled by Wa ethnic nationals who have already reached a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese Government. According to the opposition source, these eight political leaders were disappointed by the influence of personal struggles and factions within the NLD movement in the border area. All of them are Kachin nationals and they were especially unhappy when none of them were invited to participate in the NCGUB, a move they perceived as racial discrimination within the exiled NLD movement. This political transition will badly affect the NCGUB and NLD groups based along the Burmese border. After the NLD won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in the 1990 general election, about 20 of its members fled to the border areas to continue the fight for democracy. However, this number is gradually dwindling. About a year ago, two prominent members of the NCGUB -- one in China and another in Thailand -- were killed. Moreover, another NCGUB minister returned to Rangoon early this year. According to the opposition source, after the return of five Kachin parliamentary representatives, there are now less than 10 opposition parliamentary representatives in the border area. But another two representatives, including U Daniel Aung [of the Lahu National Development Party], came to join the Manerplaw opposition movement last month.
