After much open discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions: 1. Political tensions have increased as a result of the abstractionism of the Socialist Party, clothed in the garments of renewal, and the abstractionism of its allies. Communism is still present in Albania. The "renewal" of the Socialists, imposed by time, is demagogy. 2. The efforts to bring the country out of the crisis have produced some good results with the general orientation to the free market but the optimal solution has not yet been achieved. The optimal solution can be achieved only by means of the republican program, which is based on the recognition and return of private property and, especially, ownership of the land. 3. The party in power, which has the heavy burden of governing the country, is continuing to develop a tendency to monopolize administrative leadership and political life, with a restraining effect on the development of democracy and the effective use of intellectual potential. This has paved the way for left-wing phenomena and recidivist elements from the past. 4. Corruption has taken on alarming proportions for the present and future of the country. Efforts to combat these manifestations, especially in the area of privatization, have been ineffective. 5. The Republican Party provided all types of assistance to the alliance of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Social Democratic Party, an alliance which was created at the time of the struggle for the overthrow of the communist government, and regarded this alliance as a compass for democratic developments. Under the present conditions, there is no hope that this alliance can be repeated. The Republican Party is in favor of cooperation with the Democratic Party if this party creates true conditions for real and sincere cooperation. 6. Keeping in mind the country's great interest in internal stability and foreign credibility, the Republican Party supports the government coalition, which guarantees general democratic developments. This does not prevent the Republican Party from freely stating its opinions and providing constructive opposition on all matters which are not in accord with its program. 7. The National Council is convinced that the creation of a right wing in Albania is necessary today because: -- the right wing will be an effective counterbalance to the unproclaimed alliance of the left-wing forces which, under various labels and slogans, are aiming to reestablish the socialist form of government. -- only the right wing can carry out free capitalist development, beginning with the recognition and return of legal ownership. -- under current political conditions, only the right wing can represent a true democratic opposition. -- during the past year, in particular, the foreign policy of the Albanian state in the defense of the country has followed a correct line. However, this policy will receive the necessary strength through coordination with the right wing's clear ideas on the country. The leadership of the party is charged with engaging in discussions with right-wing political parties and associations to formulate joint guidelines and action plans on the basis of political reality and national interests. 8. The Republican Party will increase its struggle, in an effective manner, for the return of property and, first, for the enactment of a just land law. The republican concept of ownership must be extended over the entire economic spectrum. At the same time, the Republican Party must anticipate the problems resulting from capitalist development. 9. The Republican Party will work with perseverance to attract intellectuals into its ranks and management. The party's central headquarters and the party press are being reorganized and oriented on the basis of the guidelines in this resolution. 10. The membership of Arben Babameto, Arben Brace, Arsen Proko, Durim Kulli, and Neritan Alibali on the party's steering committee is approved.
