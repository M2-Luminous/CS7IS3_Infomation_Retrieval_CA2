Gonzalez: I think this is an important event in the fight against drug trafficking and a positive event in the struggle against crime. It conveys the idea that criminals are better off surrendering to justice rather than succumbing to the state's firm actions. To the extent that this process advances within the framework of effective cooperation so justice can be done, we believe it will help strengthen the country's judicial organization. Announcer: Is the government certain that drug traffickers who surrender will confess their crimes and cooperate with justice? Gonzalez: According to reports from the Prosecutor General's Office, we understand there is a willingness on the part of drug traffickers to cooperate with authorities and confess their crimes. Obviously, this will have to be evaluated and judged by the Prosecutor General's Office and judicial authorities. However, we do have reports on the drug traffickers' willingness to cooperate. They surrendered to authorities unconditionally. Let's wait for an evaluation from the Prosecutor General's Office and for the process to conclude. Announcer: Is the Palmira Prison a maximum security prison? Does it guarantee that these people will be safe there? Gonzalez: Once we received the information from the Prosecutor General's Office on the surrender of these individuals, we set aside a place within Palmira Prison and took special security measures. They will be submitted to an ordinary disciplinary regime, as well as to special security measures. Once the projects for a security section within Palmira Prison are complete, they will be transferred to those installations. Announcer: Does the government know anything about other people surrendering? Gonzalez: No. There are no reports of other drug traffickers surrendering to justice. As the public knows, this surrender is part of a process of conversations and requests that has been under way for several months now under the direction of the Prosecutor General's Office. Announcer: We thank Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz. He just gave the government's official position on the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales.
