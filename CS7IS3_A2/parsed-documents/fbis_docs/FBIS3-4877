Why were economic frictions intensified so badly between Japan and the United States? What should the two nations do for relaxing the friction? We interviewed Japanese and U.S. negotiators, business leaders, and intellectuals. Japan Offered a Concession Plan [Kagei] The economic framework talks showed very delicate development in the final stage, and the United States reportedly offered a concession plan for reaching an agreement on microeconomic subjects. Could you describe a little bit about that? [Matsuura] On the evening of 9 February, Assistant to the U.S. President Bowman Cutter verbally conveyed to us an informal concession plan. We thought "the two nations may be able to reach an agreement," but that offer did not come up in formal conversations. I guess there were various opinions even in the U.S. Government. [Kagei] Did not Japan make any drastic proposal? [Matsuura] In the final stage of the negotiations, we offered a plan to use figures in objective criteria for government procurement. That was a drastic proposal which contained something more than the number and the amount of biddings to be opened -- but I cannot disclose the proposal now since development of the negotiations is still uncertain. In addition, we were ready to comply with a U.S. demand for a commitment on "maintaining past trends of import growth." However, we would not have a chance to convey this since the United States made no proposal. [Kagei] In short, what is the reason for the breakup of the framework talks? [Matsuura] The primary reason is that we could not reach an accord on what should be used for objective criteria to measure the degree of market liberalization. But this was caused by lack of mutual understanding. We were supposed to agree on why the trade imbalance is growing between the two nations. Nevertheless, we started negotiations without such common ground. Discord on Agreement [Kagei] What was the conflicting point between the two nations? [Matsuura] U.S. negotiators said "over 30 bilateral agreements concluded between Japan and the United States are not working well with a few exceptions, and this is why the trade imbalance is getting bigger." But the opinion stands on two false premises. First, most bilateral agreements, including procurements by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT), beef, and oranges, are working quite well. Second, the trade imbalance is primarily caused by macroeconomic factors -- Japan's oversaving and U.S. overconsumption -- rather than market policies in individual fields. Even American economists say so. Unfortunately, however, the two governments could not agree on the two points. [Kagei] If you say macroeconomic policies are more important for redressing the trade imbalance, the government's announcement of a 6-trillion-yen [Y] income tax reduction effective for one year is probably inadequate. What is your comment on that? [Matsuura] Please let me make one thing clear. In the macroeconomic negotiations last July, both Japan and the United States made commitments. Japan promised highly significant reduction of its trade surplus in a mid-term period, but the United States also said it would cut fiscal deficits in a mid-term period. We must not forget about the U.S. promise. Unfortunately, the United States did not show understanding of our tax reduction plan, but it is inappropriate to discuss further measures right now. At present, Japan should think about how it can steadily implement the Y15-trillion pump-priming package. The United States would understand Japan's efforts when the package brings about a recovery of the Japanese economy. [Kagei] Are you really taking things so easy? [Matsuura] The results cannot be obtained in a couple of months, but Japan's commitment is to reduce the trade surplus "in a mid-term period." In my understanding, a mid-term period normally means four to five years. Even U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said, in a 24 February interview with NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, it is important for Japan to cut the trade surplus in a mid-term period. 2.8 Percent -- It Is Not an Objective [Kagei] In a recent speech, you said "Japan's task" is to realize the government's estimate that Japan's trade surplus will become 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) within fiscal 1994.... [Matsuura] What I meant is Japan should steadily go ahead to fulfill the commitment to reduce the trade surplus in a mid-term period. The figure, 2.8 percent, itself is not a goal, but an estimate. [Kagei] What are Japan's future tasks in the microeconomic field? [Matsuura] The cabinet held a meeting on international economic issues on 25 February. Since Prime Minister Hosokawa is emphasizing the deregulation policy, the government must promote the policy as soon as possible. Regarding macroeconomic policy, we should implement the pump-priming package, and, in microeconomic policy, we must open markets through deregulation measures. Japan's task is to promote the two policies at the same time. [Kagei] What is your comment on U.S. moves to seek economic sanctions against Japan? [Matsuura] I have no comment right now because it depends on the future development of the issue. Generally speaking, it is logically funny to discuss counteractions before settling negotiations.
