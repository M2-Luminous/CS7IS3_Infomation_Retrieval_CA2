Voting in favor were 82 deputies; 15 were opposed. [passage omitted] The new prime minister supports the joining by Moldova of the CIS and the economic union, as well as restoring and strengthening ties with the commonwealth countries since the lion's share of Moldovan economy is oriented toward their market. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrei Sangheli said that the former Cabinet of Ministers had not been a team of like-minded persons because it consisted of representatives of various parties. In his words, the victory of the agrarians in the elections makes it possible to form a new government, made up of professionals with a pragmatic approach who will speed up the economic reform and bring Moldova out of the crisis. The prime minister will submit the list of members of the new cabinet to the parliament as soon as next week.
