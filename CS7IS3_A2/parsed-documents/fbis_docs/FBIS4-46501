The metal will be sold abroad. The cruiser of over 60,000 tonnes displacement is 340 meters long and 76 meters wide. Russia has several ships of the type, including Kiev, Novorossiisk and Minsk. Kiev has scrapped the almost-built Ulyanov aircraft-carrier, and sold its metal abroad dirt cheap, Deputy Black Sea Fleet Commander for Operation and Repairs Rear-Admiral Aleksandr Aladkin told ITAR- TASS today. The same will be done to the ships to be received by Kiev as result of the Black Sea Fleet division. The Admiral is skeptical about Ukrainian claims the republic is a major ship-building state. In his words, all the eight ship- building plants of the republic depend on the delivery of accessories. "It is half the work to build a ship's hull. It should be equipped and armed, and Ukraine cannot do this on its own," said Aladkin. The Nikolayev plant has almost finalized the construction of the Admiral Lobov cruiser. But they will still have to buy an air-defence system which is produced in Russia and costs 65 billion rubles, he added. Aladkin is sure that the Black Sea Fleet should be divided as soon as possible, as this is the only way "to make sure that Ukraine is unable to maintain even a small part of the fleet".
