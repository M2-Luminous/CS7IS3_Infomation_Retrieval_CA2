FR941222-2-00007 FR941222-2-00006 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;583&hyph;605] Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Taiwan; Preliminary Results of Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to a request from the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, petitioner in this proceeding, the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise to the United States for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and FMV. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carlo G. Cavagna or Richard Rimlinger, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 17, 1986, the Department published in the Federal Register (51 FR 45152) the antidumping duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. On November 26, 1993, the Department published (58 FR 62327) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. We received a timely request from the petitioner, the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, to review C.M. Pipe Fitting Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (CM), Rigid Industries Co., Ltd. (Rigid), Chup Hsin Enterprises (Chup Hsin), and Gei Bey Corporation (Gei Bey). The period of review (POR) covers December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, and the administrative review was initiated on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2593). The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of carbon steel butt-weld type pipe fittings, other than couplings, under 14 inches in inside diameter, whether finished or unfinished, that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees, reducers, and caps, and if forged, have been advanced after forging. These advancements may include one or more of the following: coining, heat treatment, shot blasting, grinding, die stamping, or painting. Carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 7307.93.3000. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. Best Information Available In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information otherwise available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account whether a party refuses to provide information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). For purposes of these reviews, we have used the most adverse BIA_generally, the highest rate for any company for this same class or kind of merchandise from this or any prior segment of the proceeding_whenever a company refused to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but failed to provide all the information requested in a timely manner or in the form requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country from either the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or a prior administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country. See Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany, et. al.; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 31692, 31704 (July 11, 1991); see also Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Because Chup Hsin and Gei Bey failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we have used the highest rate ever found in this proceeding to establish their margins. This rate is 87.30 percent, which was also used for these two firms in the LTFV investigation when they failed to respond in that stage of the proceeding.
