In the structure of export to the USA the main commodity groups consist of precious metals and articles from these metals, rare earth and nonferrous metals, chemical goods, oil products, foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials. Import is mainly represented by food products (wheat, maize, barley, butter, soy beans, etc.), machines, equipment and transport facilities. Russian-American trade is traditionally characterized by a considerable deficit of the balance of trade. In 1992, for instance, import exceeded export 4.2 times. The volume and structure of Russia's export, especially that of finished articles, has been adversely affected by the long absence (from 1951 to 1992) of the most-favoured-nation treatment. For a whole number of goods likely to be exported the duties imposed on us were two to ten times higher than the level of customs duties for countries enjoying this treatment. Among other reasons mention can be made of low competitive capacity, the barriers kept alive in the USA for the import into the country of high-technology goods, and antidumping legislation. As a result, the possibilities of exporting uranium products to the USA were considerably limited in the past, and an antidumping duty was imposed on ferrosilicium from Russia. Until recently there has been a threat of antidumping proceedings being instituted in relation to the sale of chlorinated potassium, aluminium and steel. As in the past, last year goods turnover was mainly determined by our import of grain. A favourable balance of trade in the first half-year arose partly in virtue of the fact that due to the unsettled problem of debt Russia could still not use credits for the purchase of grain. However, four new agreements were concluded in June in the framework of the Food for Progress programme, shipments of which commenced in September. In this way Russia's import in October exceeded export, the latter growing at a higher rate than in 1992. Treaty rights and legal status The key document is the Agreement on Trade on Trade Relations signed between the USSR and the USA in 1990. In relation to Russia it was put in force on June 17, 1992, during the summit meeting in Washington. The document makes provision for measures aimed at encouraging commercial contacts and boosting the mutual deliveries of goods and services, and assists in expanding trade in equipment and technologies. The agreement regulates the financial aspect of trade between the two countries, the questions of protecting intellectual property, and formalizes cooperation in the spheres of statistics and standards. Provision is made for facilitating the transit of goods across the territories of our countries. Agreements have been reached on measures for the eventuality of the "market being violated" (damage being inflicted on national industry by import), and on the settlement of disputes through arbitration. In June 1992 there was an exchange of notes on giving effect to the Agreement on Assisting Investments signed on April 3, 1992. It envisages the possibility for American investors to use the services of the U.S. Government's specialized insurance agency known at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The Treaty on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of Investments (not yet ratified by the Russian side) and the Treaty on Avoiding Dual Taxation (the exchange of ratification instruments took place in December 1993) have also been signed with a view to attracting investments. Organizational basis In previous decades the Joint Soviet-American Commission on Trade (in 1980-1985 its activities were unilaterally frozen by the USA in connection with the war in Afghanistan) had a considerable part to play in promoting economic contacts. In 1992, on the American side's initiative, the US-Russian Business Council was instituted in Washington as a lobbyist organization speaking for the interests of the U.S. business circles. On the part of the CIS there is the Council for Trade Cooperation Between the Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the CIS and the USA. An Intergovernmental Russian-American Committee for the Development of Business Cooperation was instituted in 1992 for the purpose of promoting cooperation in the economy at a governmental level. Last April, at the summit meeting in Vancouver, it was decided to set up an Intergovernmental Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. The range of its interests comprises joint activities in areas such as science, energy, space, conversion and environmental protection. The commission has held two sittings: in Washington (September) and in Moscow (December). It is headed by the Chairman of the RF Government and the Vice-President of the USA. Trade and political situation In the late 1980s, after a partial embargo on the export of agricultural products to the USSR, the US administration took a number of positive steps. Since 1987 the United States had been granting us subsidies for the purchase of wheat. In April 1992 the US Congress eliminated one of the key obstacles to Russian-American trade and economic relations--the Byrd-Stevenson amendments fixing a ceiling of 300 million dollars on the total volume of credits to Russia on the part of the US Eximbank and 40 million on credits for energy projects. As a result of the Agreement on Trade Relations Between the USSR and the USA being brought into force (June 1992) Russia has been granted the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade with the United States. Incidentally, contrary to the provisions of the Agreement's Article 1 on the unconditional provision of such treatment, the USA extended it on the basis of an annual waiver--temporary suspension of the Jackson-Vanik amendment (this suspension can be unilaterally cancelled at any moment). The Act on Support for Freedom in Russia and Nascent Euro-Asian Democracies and Support for Open Markets, better known as the Freedom Support Act, came into force in October 1992. It envisages the repeal of a number of legislative restrictions of the Cold War times, but does not affect Section IV of the 1974 US Trade Act (Jackson-Vanik amendment). Thanks to the Vancouver accords between the two presidents two agreements were signed in June of last year on the free supplies of food products and two intergovernmental credit agreements under the Food for Progress programme. The total cost of supplies is 500 million dollars, including 71.5 million on an unrepayable basis. Another 200 million dollars will be used to compensate transport expenses. The term of the credit is 15 years. The interest rate is 3 percent in the course of easy-term seven years and 4 percent in subsequent years. In July 1993 a framework agreement was signed with the US Eximbank on the provision of credits and credit guarantees for the Russian oil and gas industry to the tune of more than two billion dollars. Last August President Clinton signed a bill on the budget and taxation, which also speaks about the need to extend to Russia the benefits of the General System of Preferences. In December 1993, on the administration's initiative, the US Congress passed a Law on Assisting the Reform in New Democratic Countries and on Rendering Aid and Support with a View to Improving Partnership with Russia, Ukraine and Other Newly-Independent States, whereby more than 70 legislative restrictions have been lifted. This number does not include the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Prospects The creation of a treaty rights basis, the establishment of the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade between the two countries, the extension to Russia of the US General System of Preferences and, lastly, the new programmes of economic aid provide real prerequisites for increasing mutual trade. Cooperation in investments has a special part to play. US firms already take the lead among Western investors in the creation of joint ventures in Russia (as many as 1,400 JVs have been set up with their participation). American investments in our country total c.400 million dollars. More than 300 firms have opened their representation missions. Work is also underway to implement a whole number of projects aimed at the creation of companies on US territory with the participation of Russian capital, including those on the basis of our advanced technology.
