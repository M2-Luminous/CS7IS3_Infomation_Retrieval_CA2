FR941222-0-00044 FR941222-0-00004 i. the amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards and reversals of existing temporary differences), or ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences would generally not be limited under the proposal. II. Public Comments on the Proposal The comment period for the Board's proposal ended on March 15, 1993. The Board received nineteen comment letters including ten from multinational and large regional banking organizations, and three community banks. In addition, the Board received four comment letters from bank trade associations and two from finance companies. Sixteen commenters offered support for the Board's proposal to require banking organizations to report, for regulatory purposes, deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS 109. In addition, fifteen commenters indicated that it would be preferable for the Board to place no limit on the amount of deferred tax assets allowable in capital. These commenters indicated that, in their view, embracing FAS 109 in its entirety would achieve consistency between regulatory standards and GAAP as well as maintain consistency with the intent of Section 121 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991. Commenters asserted that the criteria set forth in FAS 109 to recognize and value deferred tax assets is sufficiently conservative to limit any exposure to the bank insurance fund and that an arbitrary or mechanical formula, such as the ones proposed, would not provide a more accurate or reliable result. While preferring no capital limit on deferred tax assets, some commenters noted that the proposal represented a compromise and a step forward from prior regulatory policies that permitted little or no inclusion in regulatory reports or capital of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Two commenters generally supported the proposal or expressed their understanding of the regulator's concern regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets and one commenter indicated the capital treatment should be consistent with the capital treatment for identifiable intangible assets. A. Responses to the Board's Questions Question 1: (Gross-up of Intangible Assets) Nine commenters responded to the Board's first question regarding whether certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a nontaxable business combination accounted for as a purchase should be adjusted for the tax effect of the difference between the market or appraised value of the asset and its tax basis. Under FAS 109, this tax effect is recorded separately in a deferred tax liability account, whereas under preexisting GAAP, this tax effect reduced the amount of the intangible asset. This change in treatment could cause a large increase (i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount of certain identifiable intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles, which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory capital. Seven commenters indicated that banking organizations should be permitted to deduct the net after-tax amount of the intangible asset from capital, not the gross amount of the intangible asset. These commenters argued that FAS 109 will create artificially high values for intangible assets and the related deferred tax liability when a banking organization acquires the assets with a carryover basis for tax purposes but revalues the asset for financial reporting purposes. The commenters generally indicated that, under FAS 109, the balance sheet will not accurately reflect the value paid for the intangibles. Furthermore, commenters indicated that the increased value of the intangible posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related deferred tax liability. On the other hand, two commenters indicated that the pretax (gross) value of intangible assets should be deducted for regulatory capital purposes in this situation. This organization contended that intangible assets should be treated similarly to other assets, which are not reduced by any related liability. Question 2: The Board's second question inquired about (i) the potential burden associated with the proposal and whether a limitation based on projections of taxable income would be difficult to implement, and (ii) the appropriateness of the separate entity method for deferred tax assets and tax sharing agreements in general. i. Methodology Based on Income Projections. The Board received eleven letters from commenters who responded directly to this aspect of the question. Four commenters supported using income projections and stated that calculating deferred tax asset limitations for capital purposes based on projected taxable income would not be difficult to implement and would not impose an additional burden because many banking organizations already forecast taxable income in order to recognize their deferred tax assets. One commenter added that these calculations should not pose any problems, provided they are done on a consolidated basis. In addition, one commenter suggested that the Board clarify the term ``realized within one year'' so that readers understand that the phrase means the amount of deferred tax assets that could be used to offset income taxes generated in the next 12 months, and not the amount of deferred tax assets that actually will be used. Four commenters specifically opposed an income approach, citing the additional burden that would be created by the detailed calculations. One commenter specifically favored implementing the percentage of capital method since it is certain and exact and does not involve as many estimations or fluctuations as the income approach. Five commenters supported an approach based on the financial condition of the institution, some of whom also offered support or opposition to the income or percentage of capital approach. One commenter suggested that ``healthy'' institutions be permitted to include deferred tax assets in regulatory capital in an amount based on a specified percentage of Tier 1 capital. Another commenter supported an approach that excluded ``well capitalized'' banks from the limitation. On the other hand, one commenter did not support using an approach for calculating the capital limitation based upon the perceived ``health'' of the institution, stating that this method could lead to arbitrary and inconsistent measures of capital adequacy. ii. Separate Entity Approach. Twelve commenters specifically addressed this part of the question. Under the Board's proposal, the capital limit for deferred tax assets would be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member bank so that a bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company would be treated as a separate taxpayer rather than as part of the consolidated entity. All of the commenters opposed the separate entity approach. They argued that the separate entity approach is artificial and that tax-sharing agreements between financially capable bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries should be considered when evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. Commenters also stated that the separate entity method is unnecessarily restrictive and that any systematic and rational method should be permitted for the calculation of the limitation for each bank. One commenter based its opposition for the separate entity approach on the view that the limitation is not consistent with the Board's 1987 ``Policy Statement on the Responsibility of Bank Holding Companies to Act as Sources of Strength to Their Subsidiary Banks'' which, in some respects, treats a controlled group as one entity. Another commenter contended that the effect of a separate entity calculation would be to reduce bank capital which is needed for future lending which would be inconsistent with the March 10, 1993, ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability''. The same commenter also noted that the regulatory burden and cost of calculating the deferred tax asset on a separate entity basis would be substantial for both bankers and regulators. Question 3: The Board's third question addressed three specific provisions of the proposal. These provisions included (i) requiring tax planning strategies to be part of an institution's projection of taxable income for the next year, (ii) requiring organizations to assume that all temporary differences fully reverse at the report date, and (iii) permitting the grandfathering of amounts previously reported if they were in excess of the proposed limitation. i. Inclusion of Tax Planning Strategies. Two commenters addressed this issue. Both commenters stated that they support including tax planning strategies in an institution's projection of taxable income. One commenter stated that the proposal should be modified to permit institutions to consider strategies that would ensure realization of deferred tax assets within the one-year time frame. The proposal provided that organizations should consider tax planning strategies that would realize tax carryforwards or net operating losses that would otherwise expire during that time frame. ii. Temporary Differences. Four commenters specifically addressed this aspect of the question, and all agreed that it is appropriate to require the assumption that all temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. One commenter noted that this assumption would eliminate the burden of scheduling the ``turnaround'' of temporary differences. iii. Grandfathering. Five commenters discussed the proposal's provision on grandfathering which would allow the amount of any deferred tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of the limit to be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994. Four commenters offered support for grandfathering but argued that excess deferred tax assets should be grandfathered until the underlying temporary differences reversed, rather than be phased out over two years. The other commenter disagreed with the grandfathering proposal and stated that such provisions would be inconsistent with the proposal's capital adequacy objectives. III. Final Amendment to the Capital Adequacy Guidelines
