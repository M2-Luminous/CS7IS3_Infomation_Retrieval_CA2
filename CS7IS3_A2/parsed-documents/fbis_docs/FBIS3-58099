According to information from the paper, Mueller, who was also press spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, worked for the Stasi on an "ideological basis"--and, therefore, free of charge--since 1974. Security authorities described the extent of betrayal as "considerable," the paper writes (Friday [7 January] edition). Mueller went to Gabon as ambassador last spring. Although he has so far denied the charges, the arrest warrant is still in force. The investigations are continuing.
