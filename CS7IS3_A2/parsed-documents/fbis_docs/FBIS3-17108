The commission reports this resolution was the result of a compromise between the Central Electoral Commission and the autonomy's head of executive power. The required changes and amendments to his directive had been made by the president, which in commission members' view will ensure differences between the directive and the legislation are settled. The Central Electoral Commission agreed organizationally to help carry out a poll among those wishing to do this. It will not, however, take part in determining its results. This function is to be performed by officials authorized by the Crimean president.
