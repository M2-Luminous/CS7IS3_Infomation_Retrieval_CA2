Both men are serving life sentences: Nur-al-Din for his leadership of Egypt's Revolution, a group that between 1986 and 1988 killed Israeli elements and people working for the Mosad in Cairo; and Al-Zumur for his involvement in the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. Security sources attribute this move to the close ties that had recently grown between Nur-al-Din and al-Zumur, culminating in their agreement to alternate in leading the inmates in prayers. Nur-al-Din has won the confidence of al-Jihad inmates in Turah jail. The prisoners treat him as a spiritual father. Those on death row have a long meeting with him before their execution and sometimes scribble a note of gratitude on a scrap of their clothes for him to keep as a souvenir. Nur-al-Din, for his part, normally leads the prayer for the absent--a memorial service for the executed al-Jihad members. Nur-al-Din has issued a call to the Islamic Group and the al-Jihad Organization through AL-SAFIR, asking them to attack Israeli targets and interests in Egypt instead of the Egyptian police, tourism, and banks.
