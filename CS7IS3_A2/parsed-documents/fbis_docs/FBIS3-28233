The "German Asia Concept" report, which was submitted to the German Government, urges Bonn to set up a semiofficial "German Asia Center" to "bundle the meager German Asia resources" and make the German industry competitive in the Asia-Pacific region. With Bonn shouldering 50 percent of a proposed 1 billion German mark stock capital, local governments, labor and economic organizations, as well as academics, should join forces in setting up the center, the paper suggests. German Asia strategies can be successful only "if they take into account the Japanese positioning in the Pacific rim," it said. To make inroads in Japan-dominated Asian markets, German companies must exploit the deficits of Japanese economic strategy in Asian countries in transition, the paper states. Japanese business activities block transfer of know-how and key technologies, fail to provide for participation of local management and do not foster the establishment of independent non-Japanese domestic firms, the chamber says in pointing to areas where German enterprises could jump in. Germany, in close cooperation with domestic governments, must offer "comprehensive packages" linking official development aid, infrastructure projects, training and know-how transfer to prevail over competitor Japan, the paper says. While not excluding cooperation with Japanese networks in Asia, the paper advocates link-ups with "non-Japanese networks in Asia, first of all the networks of Overseas Chinese." The proposals come after the German Government last fall formulated a new Asia concept aimed at greater economic presence in the Asia-Pacific area. In its bid to make up lost ground in Asia, the German industry ailing under a longstanding recession, high labor costs and loss of markets in former communist countries, recently set up an Asia- Pacific Committee.
