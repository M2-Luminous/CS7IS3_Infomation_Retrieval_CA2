FBIS4-10241 "drlat069_f_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 El Salvador FMLN Urges UN for Help in Fulfilling Accords FMLN Urges UN for Help in Fulfilling Accords PA0904022494 San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 24 PA0904022494 San Salvador DIARIO LATINO Spanish BFN [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] today denounced serious distortions in the fulfillment of the peace agreements, and expressed the fear that a failure to fulfill pending agreements may cause social instability. The FMLN appealed to the UN secretary general for "a stronger reaction" to force the government to fulfill the agreements. FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez pointed out that the distortion of the peace agreements is part of the government's plan to merge the National Police [PN], which is to be dismantled, with the National Civilian Police [PNC] and the government's presentation of a new plan to step up the transfer of lands that would overlook over 20,000 former FMLN and Armed Forces fighters. Regarding the government's failure to fulfill the agreements, Gonzalez pointed out that the constitutional reforms to modernize the administration of justice are pending, and he expressed the fear that on 1 May the new Legislative Assembly will be installed without the previous assembly having approved the reforms. According to procedure, constitutional reforms must be approved and confirmed by two legislative assemblies and if they are not approved by the current assembly, changes in the judicial system will remain on hold until 2000. "The judicial system is obsolete, and it allows impunity to succeed," Gonzalez said, adding: "these are factors that could destabilize the country's transition process." Another issue denounced by Gonzalez is that the government "has disregarded ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador], and it has been unable to confirm how many soldiers are in the PNC or to assess how much they earn." Expanding on the dismantling of the PN, Gonzalez said: "There is an agreement to dissolve the PN. A reduction in force program has already been presented, and 3,000 policemen were to be demobilized this month, but the government suspended the demobilization process, and we are aware of its plan to merge the PN and PNC in October." The possible merger of the PN and PNC and the incorporation into the PNC of the Narcotics Executive Unit and Commission for the Investigation of Crimes, means to Gonzalez that "by 1995 the seed of a new repressive body will exist." To make the government fulfill the peace agreements, Gonzalez has proposed that the United Nations and Group of Friends (Mexico, Spain, Venezuela, and Colombia) exert pressure on the government with a mandate from the Security Council. He added that the UN "must take firmer action." UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said yesterday that still pending are the reintegrations into society through the land transfers and constitutional reforms recommended by the Truth Commission. Ghali also pointed out the persistence of significant signs of reluctance to establish the PNC, which was a fundamental goal of the peace agreements between the government and FMLN. He added that there seems to be a desire to distance the formation of the PNC from the dismantling of the PN.
