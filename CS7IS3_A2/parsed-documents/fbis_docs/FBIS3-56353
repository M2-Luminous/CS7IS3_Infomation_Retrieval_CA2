The three delegations also discussed other conditions of Russia's membership in the CE, the head of the Lithuanian delegation, Algirdas Gricius, said at a press conference Friday. Russia has already fulfilled part of the demands -- it has a new Constitution and a new parliament, he said. But, Lithuania and Estonia, as members of the council, and Latvia, which enjoys special guest membership, will insist that Russia solve national and ethnic problems on its territory. The Baltics also want Russia to assess the Soviet aggression upon the three states in 1940. Russia must also promise not to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries and "must become a normal state," said Tunne Kelam, member of the Estonian delegation. In Vilnius, the three delegations coordinated their positions for the upcoming session of the CE General Assembly. The session will start in Strasbourg Jan. 24 and will reportedly focus on possibilities of expanding Europe politically. The three Baltic states agreed to support the idea of including the Caucasian region in the political map of Europe. Lithuanians and Estonians decided to circulate a joint statement on the recent NATO summit in Brussels and a joint resolution of the Baltic Assembly on Russian army presence in Estonia and Latvia. Roland Blezurs, secretary of the Latvian delegation, said this week's incident with the Russian military in his country revealed the kind of pressure that may be caused by the presence of foreign troops. The three delegations also discussed the economic and political situation in the Baltic states.
