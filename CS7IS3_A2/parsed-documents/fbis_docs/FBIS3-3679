China and Japan are next-door neighbours only separated, as people often note, by a narrow strip of water. And all sorts of ties have been forged between the two countries in the last 22 years since diplomatic relations were restored in 1972. Economic cooperation has been high on the agenda of Sino-Japanese relations. Over the last decade, trade between the two countries registered an average per annum increase of 10 percent. And last year, total trade reached a record $39 billion, making Japan the country's number one trade partner. However, as China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out during his recent trip to Japan, the present figure is far from impressive considering the vast potential for economic cooperation between the two nations. And Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out to his Japanese counterpart on Sunday that China's economic plans lay particular emphasis on energy supply, transport, and telecommunications--all sectors in which Japan is strong. This means that the two countries complement each other economically and that increased cooperation could only benefit them both. We were pleased to hear Hosokawa's sincere apologies for the intolerable suffering inflicted on Asian countries by Japan's invasion and colonial domination in history. And we envisage fuller and broader cooperation between our two countries following Hosokawa's commitment to bear the past in mind when looking to the future. We also share his view that increased bilateral cooperation holds out the hope of a brighter future. Hosokawa delivered a strong message from the Japanese Government that his country will continue to support China's policies of reform, opening-up, and modernization. He said that the rapid development of the Chinese economy has helped the Japanese economy. Sino-Japanese relations have become particularly crucial since Asia's relative global position has grown in importance with the demise of the Cold War. And the economies in east Asia are now the most vigorous ones in the world. Despite their different political systems, China and Japan are the two most influential countries in the region. And bilateral relations between them, particularly in the economic sphere, will affect not only the west rim of the Pacific, but the whole world. And both countries will make a great contribution to a peaceful and prosperous new world order, now that their leading statesmen have reached consensus on the importance of long-term, good bilateral relations.
