The Turkish newspapers have frequently commented on the matter in the past few days. Nuraliyev said: "Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to Europe and other markets in the world through a pipeline that will traverse Turkey." Recalling that Kazakhstan markets its oil through a pipeline to Novosibirsk in Russia, Nuraliyev asserted: "We do not have time to wait. We have to sell our oil. Novosibirsk is not an alternative." Stressing that the oil pipeline to Novosibirsk, which crosses through Astrakhan, needs to be modernized, Nuraliyev said the decision to repair and renovate that pipeline was made before the project for the second pipeline was considered. Nuraliyev also denied Turkish press reports that "Russia has been allowed to decide on the new project." He said: "The second pipeline, which will carry Kazakhstan's oil through Turkey to international markets, is a significant project this requires significant expertise. Meanwhile, a decision has to be made on the route of the pipeline."
