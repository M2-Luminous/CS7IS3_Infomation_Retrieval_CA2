Hector Romero Navas, president of the Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry [Fedecamaras], said that the measure that meeting of the Fedecamaras Board of Directors, Romero Navas said the controls do nothing to eliminate the roots of the crisis, adding that there are other solutions. He said confidence can be recovered by giving positive signals accompanied by a unified economic program. He said the measures adopted by the national government must be temporary. [Begin Romero Navas recording] We think the government should have taken this opportunity to establish a deadline, saying something like: We will find a solution in 30 days, or in 60 days. It is easy to decree something, while it is more difficult to rescind it. The only way to step back from a situation such as this is to prepare a program that has strong political support and the support of the Venezuelan people who, in the end, have to be assured that we will overcome inflation. [end recording] Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce and Services, said the availability of supplies will depend on the swiftness with which foreign exchange is delivered. He said that if the implementation of measures is delayed, production will be delayed. He said the people fear the emergence of a new Differential Exchange System. [Begin Roosen recording] The freezing of prices will have an effect. We will see this happen because of price controls. It is also true that these controls will provide some stability, but in the end it is not the best thing to do. Remember the Differential Exchange System. It was easy to start it, but getting out of it was very turbulent. [end recording] Regarding prices, (CAVIDEA) [expansion unknown] President Simon Nobile said distortions have emerged in the underground economy, adding that wherever price hikes have been excessive, prices can be lowered. [Begin Nobile recording] Prices will be brought down. The established commercial sector maintains prices at an agreed-upon level. In other sectors, however, prices were above this level. At a time when more products are available, prices will have to return to their normal levels -- levels maintained by the rest of the commercial sector. In this sense, products marked at prices above normal levels will have to be adjusted. [end recording] These sectors support the measures if they are temporary in nature, and they also want signs of confidence displayed, because, at this point in time, the eyes of the world are upon our country.
