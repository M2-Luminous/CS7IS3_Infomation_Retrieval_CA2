Greetings from Havana, Rey. [Rodriguez] Greetings, Cavada. Well, the most important thing I can tell you now is that within a few hours, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will be received by Indonesian President Suharto at Government Palace here in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the fourth most heavily populated country in the world, with 189 million [as heard] inhabitants. I said that the meeting will be held within the next few hours because it is now a little past 0100 in the morning. I wish to remind you that there are approximately 12 hours' difference. This Robaina-Suharto meeting has dual importance: First, because the foreign minister will be received by the head of the government of a country that is currently achieving a very high economic growth rate; and second, because it has strong commercial relations with highly developed nations such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, among others. But I can tell you more: Indonesia has great regional influence not only in the economic area, but in the political field as well. Indonesia has served as mediator in several regional conflicts, as in the case of Cambodia, and today it is a member of the nonaligned movement. In a meeting with the local press, Robaina said that today all members of the movement are satisfied with the work carried out by this nation, and with its efforts to strengthen South-South relations. In this regard, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas today said: [Begin Alatas recording, in English, with simultaneous translation into Spanish] We have talked about some of the problems we are facing, and as members of the nonaligned movement, and as individual countries, we both agree, as we have always agreed among members of the movement, that now more than ever we need to contribute and to continue playing the same role, to keep participating in a world that is rapidly changing, a world in transition. [end recording] Today the Cuban delegation will also meet with the top Indonesian Congress representative, then leave for Laos, second leg of the Cuban foreign minister's tour of Asian countries. [Cavada] Thank you very much, Rey, for this additional report for the many listeners of Radio Rebelde. This was a direct live report by journalist Rey Rodriguez who is accompanying Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on his tour of several Asian countries.
