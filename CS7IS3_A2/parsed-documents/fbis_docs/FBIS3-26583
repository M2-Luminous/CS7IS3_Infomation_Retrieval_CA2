Enhancing and quickening cross-strait exchanges and cooperation in science and technology will be conducive to the economies and scientific and technological development of both sides. This tendency is irresistible and its prospects are bright. Leading a delegation to attend the "1994 Cross-Strait Conference on Technologies of the Steel and Material Industries," Zhou Guangzhao arrived in Taibei [Taipei] on 17 January. Others who attended this conference included several well-known scientists from the CAS as well as experts from the Shougang Corporation, the Anshan Steel Corporation, the Wuhan Steel Corporation, the Panzhihua Steel Corporation, and the China Metals Import and Export Corporation. When asked about what he thought of his exchange visit to Taiwan, Zhou Guangzhao said: I certainly felt very happy that I was able to visit our country's prized island, conduct exchanges there, and do something for the development of cross-strait exchanges. In this exchange visit to Taiwan, Mainland scientists, technicians, and enterprise representatives were well received in Taiwan. This shows the willingness of people on Taiwan to enhance exchanges. Zhou Guangzhao held: This conference further specified both sides' individual strong points in resources and technologies. If we can enhance our cooperation, it will be conducive to development on both sides. He explained: The Mainland is blessed with rich resources, affluent supplies of raw and semifinished materials, and abundant scientists and technicians, whereas Taiwan has a solid basis of technology and is very good at developing and commercializing research results. Take material technology for example; rare earth is very useful in many fields of high technology industries such as motor manufacturing, special semiconductors, new magnetic materials, and superconductors. According to statistics on proven reserves, more than a half of the world's rare earth resources are in the Mainland. However, the Mainland still has a lot of catching up to do in developing technologies for exploiting and applying rare earth elements, while Taiwan has strong production and applied mechanical and electrical technologies. He said: Taiwan has many electrical manufacturers. If they use rare earth to produce electrical products, the performance of their products will be even better. Suffering from the lack of raw and semifinished materials on Taiwan, these manufacturers are not able to give full play to their strong points. As for steel materials, Taiwan's steel output has increased by a large margin in recent years. The annual output of the "China Steel Corporation" on Taiwan currently exceeds 6 million tonnes, and it is marching toward the goal of 9 million tonnes. Nevertheless, the market on the island is quite small after all and its development potential is limited. On the other hand, the Mainland's broad market and abundant raw and semifinished materials represent an advantage for development. Therefore, the two sides need to further cooperate with each other. Speaking on the present situation and prospects for cross-strait cooperation, Zhou Guangzhao pointed out: At present, some Taiwan industries depend heavily on foreign countries. A number of persons with insight on Taiwan hope to find cooperation partners on the Mainland to reduce dependence on foreign countries. He said: The two sides should work hand in hand to develope some technological industries. Again, he took rare earth as an example and said: The two sides are intensifying efforts to develop industries in this field. It will absolutely help accelerate development if they can make good use of their strong points, strengthen cooperation, and complement each other with their own advantages. Zhou Guangzhao said: Some progress has now been made in scientific and technological exchanges between the two sides. Quite a few Taiwan researchers have visited the Mainland and conduct exchanges. This time Mainland scientists were invited to visit Taiwan. These visits and exchanges promote understanding. Moreover, many cross-strait science and technology [S&T] cooperation projects are underway in communications, radiation synchrotrons, and marine science. The range for cooperation is very broad, including basic theory, applications of technology, industrial development, and even nuclear science and technology. In conclusion, he said: Under the premise of mutual benefit and reciprocity, we will make efforts to promote further cooperation between S&T circles from both sides.
