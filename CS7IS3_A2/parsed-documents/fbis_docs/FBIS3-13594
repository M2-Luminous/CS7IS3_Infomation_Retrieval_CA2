In an editorial today, the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that the United Nations and some other parties have underscored, from the outset, that the elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, missiles, and nuclear materiel must be followed by lifting the economic sanctions within the context of a "package deal." The paper indicates that the "package deal" concept is a legal one. The legal aspect of this concept means that there are reciprocal commitments between Iraq and the United Nations. The paper goes on to say that using compliance with international resolutions as a tactical cover to make Iraq honor its commitments without expecting the UNSC to honor its own commitments is a dangerous game that undermines the credibility of the United Nations, and opens the door for further crises and regional and international turmoil. The paper says that those who are concerned about peace, security, and rights are required to honor their commitments, and to act rapidly to deliver on their agreements. The paper warns that Iraq's patience and wisdom in no way means that Iraq will allow the infliction of further destruction and harm on its people. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The United Nations and those standing behind it must understand that peoples have the right to defend themselves, their destinies, and their interests with all available means when the avenues of hope before them are blocked. The paper addresses the current U.S. position, which is grounded in exposed political motives and objectives. It also touches upon the UN position, as explained by Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, which seeks to perpetuate the embargo even after its legal justifications have been removed. In contrast, the paper notes some positive international and regional changes that have surfaced over the past four months, developments that have signaled that it is high time the embargo clamped on Iraq was lifted, either partially or entirely. The paper emphasizes that the Iraqi people have observed that the overwhelming majority of nations are now demonstrating an understanding of their positions and of their reasoning after years of misunderstanding. It goes on to say that while the Iraqi people appreciate these stands, they are also capable of changing the current equations, based on their legitimate right to a free and decent living. Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH wonders: Will Washington understand all this and retreat? Or is it determined to persist with its criminal acts against the Iraqi people, something that would herald new and dangerous political developments in the region, and the world? The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the UNSC to honor its commitments, as the dictates of fairness and justice require, particularly since Iraq has complied with all relevant UNSC resolutions. If they do not see any hope for removing the injustice meted out against them, our people will have no choice but to decide, along with their leadership, on the means to create other hope, the paper adds. In an analysis today, the paper asserts that Iraqis have the right to choose the kind of life they want to lead, to resist the embargo with all possible legitimate means, and to demonstrate inventiveness with regard to the form and content of this resistance when they find that hopes for a positive UNSC move are tightly blocked. The paper criticizes the United Nations' failure to honor its commitments toward Iraq as enshrined in UNSC resolutions, noting that Iraq has demonstrated exemplary commitment and a high sense of responsibility in its dealings with the world body, which professes to be an advocate of fairness, justice, and human rights, to help cope with this or that hurdle in the hope that the UNSC members will rise to the required level of humanitarian and historical responsibility. For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH blames this failure on the United States and Zionism, contending that they have conspired against Iraq and prevented the UNSC from playing the honest role of lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq. The paper adds: The aggressiveness of both the West and Zionism has nothing to do with the events unleashed on 2 August 1990. Rather, it is connected with Iraq's special and effective role, and with the pan-Arab and unity-orientated principles it cherishes. Similarly, it has something to do with the scientific and technological accomplishments Iraq has made -- accomplishments that have broken the myth of Israel's superiority in the region. The paper adds: The prime objective of the United States and Zionism is to weaken Iraq's military and economic capabilities and halt its creative potential.
