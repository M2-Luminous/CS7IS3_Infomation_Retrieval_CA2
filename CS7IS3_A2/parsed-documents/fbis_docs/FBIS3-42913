Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment of the State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan, conducted by Tatyana Korneyeva: "In Order To Turn the Land Over to the Peasants in the Rayons"; date and place of interview not given] [Text] About three years have passed since the beginning of the proclamation of land reform in Tatarstan. At a recent conference in the State Land Committee, some interesting figures were cited. In 1993 alone, 34,317 orchard plots were granted to the republic's population. Now there are more than 445,000 of them with a total area of 26,000 hectares. More than 3,700 parcels of land were allocated for individual housing construction in cities and settlements. The number of personal auxiliary farms increased by 5,200. However, land reform has not proceeded smoothly everywhere and in every respect. R. Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment of the State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan, comments on the current situation. [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, although the figures look impressive, they say little to the uninitiated. What can you say about the pace of land reform in the republic? [Khabibrakhmanov] The process of the democratization of land relations and creation of a mixed economy is proceeding much more slowly in Tatarstan than in Russia. One of the key aspects of land reform is the organization of peasant and individual farms. There are 712 of them in the republic with a total area of more than 24,000 hectares. But that is only 0.7 percent of total agricultural land. If one says that 57 farms ceased to exist last year, the overall picture is a dreary one. In two cases the individual farmers themselves couldn't make it and gave up. In the remaining cases land was confiscated because of various violations of land-use regulations. The greatest number of peasant farms was organized last year in Aznakayevskiy, Almetyevskiy, Bavlinskiy, Bugulminskiy and Spasskiy rayons. And yet no one was found in Atninskiy, Kaybitskiy and Cheremshanskiy rayons who wanted to establish individual farms, and there are very few farms in Tyulyachinskiy, Drozhzhanovskiy, Muslyumovskiy and Apastovskiy rayons. [Korneyeva] What are the reasons for that situation? [Khabibrakhmanov] First of all, there is the effect of objective circumstances. Despite broad-scale propaganda for individual farming arrangements, rural residents continue to prefer collective labor on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Despite all their drawbacks, social and economic questions are resolved much more easily on them. And there is hardly any need to speak yet again about the numerous difficulties involved in creating a sound and dependable basis of physical facilities and equipment for peasant farms. They are well known. Those are the main but, alas, not the only reasons that have held up the development of the individual-farming movement. Many economic executives and local administrations have shown a negative attitude toward the development of new production relations in the countryside and have artificially created various obstacles. Just let a city dweller try to obtain a parcel of land in a rural locality to use for personal auxiliary farming! In rare cases will he meet with understanding and support on the part of local authorities. The picture is more likely to be the opposite: The kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which are still monopolistic land owners, do not part so readily with their property. The flood of complaints from citizens is rising. A great deal could be done here by the local authorities, who have been granted broad powers to dispose of parcels of land. However, the soviets have been acting extremely timidly to defend citizens' legitimate rights and interests. [Korneyeva] But perhaps the economic executives and local administrations are right in not rushing to hand out land right and left. After all, you mentioned those who have voluntarily given up parcels of land they have taken, and those from whom it has even been necessary to take back land parcels. [Khabibrakhmanov] Unfortunately, there have been a good many violations of land laws. Last year our service identified more than a thousand such cases, and administrative penalties were imposed on many violators; the total amount of the fines came to 3,700,000 rubles. Typical violations involve the unauthorized construction of facilities by enterprises and organizations without the necessary official permission to withdraw parcels of land for such purposes. Quite often production wastes are dumped on land and fertile soil is polluted. In Baltasinskiy Rayon, subdivisions of Kazankhimstroy [approximate expansion: Kazan Trust? for the Construction of Chemical-Industry Facilities] and Selkhozkhimiya [approximate expansion: Agricultural Chemistry Association] have been building their own production facilities without authorization, and a hospital and production facilities for the gas depot are also being built without authorization. In Atninskiy Rayon, the rayon DRSU [Regional Directorate of Road Repair and Construction], the veterinary station and the gas service are among those engaged in unauthorized construction. There have been a good many cases in which land has been used ineffectively by peasant farms and the auxiliary farms of industrial enterprises. We analyze matters and attempt to take action. The ways to improve soil fertility and crop yields and to make effective use of land on such farms have been discussed in Almetyevskiy, Rybno-Slobodskiy, Sabinskiy, Verkhneuslonskiy, Mamadyshskiy and other rayons. The oil drillers, the Bugulminskiy Highway Administration, the "Kamgesenergostroy," the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant, the Yelabuga Brick Plant and other enterprises simply cannot or do not want to restore disturbed land to fit condition. It is important to provide a mechanism in the near future for effective state control over the conservation and effective use of land. This is very important at the stage of the development of private land ownership and of various forms of economic operation. Unfortunately, it has proved extremely difficult to eliminate even the violations that have been identified: we still lack legislative acts on administrative penalties for the violation of land legislation. And so far the measures taken against violators are simply not serious. Fines are meager. [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, but it seems that there are no permanent documents codifying citizens' right to land. Is that the case? [Khabibrakhmanov] That is not quite the case. Legal codification of the forms of land possession and use does exist. In the past two years more than 750,000 land owners and land users have received appropriate permits--granting the right to land ownership and to the use of land without a time limit (permanent use). But these really are temporary permits. Our committee has prepared the forms for state documents granting the right of land possession and use. They will be issued in place of the temporary permits. In this connection, according to a recent decree of the government of the Republic of Tatarstan, the reregistration of land previously granted for all categories of land use has now begun. [Korneyeva] Aren't the norms for the size of parcels allocated being changed in this connection? [Khabibrakhmanov] According to existing legislation, the size of parcels turned over at no charge only for ownership by citizens is strictly limited. I may recall that for an orchard plot it is 0.1 hectares of land, for housing construction in a suburban zone--up to 0.15 hectares, for personal auxiliary farming by city dwellers in a rural location--up to 0.2 hectares, and for rural residents--up to 1 hectare. Norms also exist for the amount of land turned over for private ownership for peasant farms. They are different in different rayons and are approved by the local soviets.
