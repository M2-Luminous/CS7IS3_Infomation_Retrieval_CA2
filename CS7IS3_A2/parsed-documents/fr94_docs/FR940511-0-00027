FR940511-0-00027 FR940511-0-00011 Annette Islands Reserve Fishery in Area 2C The Metlakatla Indian Community has been authorized by the United States Government to conduct a commercial halibut fishery within the 3,000 foot (914.4 meters) Annette Islands Reserve waters. Fishing is restricted to 96 hours per month, and all catches are deducted from the Area 2C catch limit. Four 48-hour fishing periods in April and March produced a catch of just under 500 lbs (0.2 mt). June Fishing Period Limits in Area 3B and 4A The Commission has determined that fishing period limits will be required during the June 6 opening in Area 3B to avoid exceeding the catch limit. Last year, 5.2 million lbs (2,358.7 mt) were landed from Area 3B during the June fishing period, and this year's catch limit is 4.0 million lbs (1,814 mt). With fishing period limits in Area 3B, the Commission is concerned that some Area 3B fishermen might shift to Area 4A, thereby increasing the Area 4A catch. A shift of effort to Area 4A could jeopardize the August 15 fishing period, and possibly even result in exceeding the Area 4A catch limit. The Commission approved the June opening in Area 4A with the understanding that the catch would be minimal and that the August fishery would not be effected. Therefore, the fishing period limits in Area 3B will also be in effect in Area 4A. The fishing period in both areas will open at 12 noon on June 6 and close at 12 noon on June 7 with the following fishing period limits: ␣ 1Vessel class 2Length 2Letter 1Fishing period limit (dressed, heads off) 2Area 3B&hyph;4A 3Pounds 3Metric tons ␣0&hyph;25 A 900 0.4 26&hyph;30 B 1,300 0.6 31&hyph;35 C 4,000 1.8 36&hyph;40 D 5,200 2.4 41&hyph;45 E 8,400 3.8 46&hyph;50 F 11,800 5.4 51&hyph;55 G 17,400 7.9 56+ H 30,000 13.6 Dated: May 5, 1994.
