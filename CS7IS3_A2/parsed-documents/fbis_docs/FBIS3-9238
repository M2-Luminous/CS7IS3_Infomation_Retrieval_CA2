[Gligorov] Yes. When they first tried -- in October 1992 -- they did not achieve anything. The blockade could not prevent our recognition by the European Union [EU] states. The impetus for it came from an intra-Greek power struggle. Had the Mitsotakis government remained in power then we would have achieved a solution together with Vance and Owen. Yet, the new head of government, Papandreou, feels bound by his anti-Macedonian statements from the election campaign and is trying to harness the EU to his cart. Yet, six EU countries have already recognized us -- and now even the United States. The Greek embargo is a nervous reaction to our success. [Glenny] The Albanian party has split up into two factions. The radicals have requested identical rights for the Albanians as for the Macedonians at all levels. Does this worry you? [Gligorov] The division of the Albanian ethnic group is a normal democratic process. We must pursue dialogue with all groups. So far we have survived because we have avoided the kind of nationalism that erupted everywhere in the former Yugoslavia. [Glenny] Do you think that the U.S.-supported Muslim-Croat alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina will work? [Gligorov] I have always been of the opinion that Bosnia- Herzegovina should be preserved as one. The Muslim-Croat alliance is one step forward. Yet, how will the Serbs react? The United States is afraid that the war might spread to the south, and it seems to be interested in preserving Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. If the dispute were to come here it would mean a new war in the Balkans -- which is why I cannot understand why Greece is acting the way it is. If war were to break out here it would affect all Balkan countries. [Glenny] Is it true that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic invited you to a Christian-Orthodox alliance with Greece and Cyprus? [Gligorov] There is the idea of a large bloc, which should comprise Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece, and Cyprus. Yet, Macedonia is looking toward Europe and is against the creation of new alliances. I frankly said so to Milosevic when he proposed to me the creation of such an Orthodox alliance from Belgrade via Skopje to Athens and Cyprus. I said that Macedonia would never join such an alliance that is based on religion and nationalities. The Greeks are afraid of a Muslim alliance, but we do not want that, either. We are hoping for an associative membership agreement with the EU, which might ultimately lead to membership in 15 years. I also wrote to President Clinton that we would like to participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace.
