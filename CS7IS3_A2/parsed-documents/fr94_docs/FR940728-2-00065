FR940728-2-00065 FR940728-2-00047 IV. State Certification Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act requires that NPDES permits contain conditions which ensure compliance with applicable State water quality standards or limitations. Section 401 requires that States certify that Federally issued permits are in compliance with State law. These permits are for operations within waters of the States. EPA is requesting the States to review and provide appropriate certification to these general permits pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53. V. Administrative Aspects A. Request To Be Covered Owners or operators of water treatment facility discharges are not covered by this general permit until they meet two requirements. First, they must send a letter of intent to EPA indicating that they meet the requirements of the permit and wish to be covered. Second, they must be notified by EPA that they are covered by a general permit. If the facility has an existing individual NPDES permit, it will be terminated as outlined in 40 CFR 122.28(b)(2)(iv). B. Mechanisms All persons, including dischargers who believe any condition of the draft permit is inappropriate must raise all issues and submit all available arguments and supporting material for their arguments in full by the close of the public comment period, to the U. S. EPA, Wastewater Management Branch, WMN, JFK Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts, 02203. Any person, prior to such date, may submit a request in writing for a public hearing to consider the draft permit to EPA and the State Agency. Such requests shall state the nature of the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing. A public hearing may be held after at least a 30-day public notice whenever the Regional Administrator finds that response to this notice indicates significant interest. In reaching a final decision on the draft permits, the Regional Administrator will respond to all significant comments and make these responses available to the public at EPA's Boston office. Following the close of the comment period, and after the public hearing, if such hearing is held, the Regional Administrator will issue a final permit in the Federal Register . C. The Coastal Zone Management Act The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq., and its implementing regulations [15 CFR Part 930] require that any federally licensed activity affecting the coastal zone with an approved Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) be determined to be consistent with the CZMA. EPA, Region I, has determined that these general NPDES permits are consistent with the CZMA. EPA has requested the Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire coastal zone agencies for a determination that these three permits are consistent with their respective State policies. D. The Endangered Species Act EPA Region I has concluded that the discharges to be covered by the general NPDES permits will not affect or jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat. EPA has requested consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to confirm this conclusion. E. Environmental Impact Statement Requirements The general permits do not authorize the construction of any water resources project or the impoundment of any water body or have any effect on historical property, and are not major Federal activities needing preparation of any Environmental Impact Statement. Therefore, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1273 et seq., the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C 470 et seq., the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq., and the National Environmental Policy Act, 33 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., do not apply to the issuance of this general NPDES permit. VI. Other Legal Requirements A. Economic Impact (Executive Order 12866) EPA has reviewed the effect of Executive Order 12866 on this draft general permit and has determined that it is not a significant rule under that order. This regulation was submitted previously to the Office of Management and Budget for review as required by the former Executive Order 12291. The Office of Management and Budget exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Order, which was revoked and superseded by Executive Order 12866. B. Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities by these draft general NPDES permits under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. The information collection requirements of these draft permits have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. No comments from the Office of Management and Budget or the public were received on the information collection requirements in these permits. C. The Regulatory Flexibility Act After review of the facts presented in the notice printed above, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this permit does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Moreover, the draft permit will reduce a significant administrative burden on regulated sources. Dated: July 6, 1994. John P. DeVillars, Regional Administrator.
