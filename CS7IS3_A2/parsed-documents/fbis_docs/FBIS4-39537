Kazakh National Space Agency Director Aisultan Kalybayev told INTERFAX that the draft complied with the agreement that had been signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev on 28 March. In particular, the launching pads and the buildings in the town of Leninsk will be rented by Russia for a term of 20 years, which may be extended for 10 more years. Kazakhstan had earlier intended to have the rent increased. Kalybayev also said that the electricity and water supply bills would be paid separately as would be those for temporary seizure of land area where parts of booster rockets might fall. The energy rates, he said, will not be higher than those paid by Kazakh consumers. Kalybayev said the draft, which he had submitted to his Russian counterpart Yuri Koptev, will be finalized in Almaty. Koptev is also deputy chairman of the bilateral commission on Baykonur. Kalybayev expressed the hope that officials from the two countries would meet no later than in mid-June.
