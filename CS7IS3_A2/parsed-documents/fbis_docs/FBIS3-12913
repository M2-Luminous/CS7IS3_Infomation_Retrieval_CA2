The sources said that the delegation will be headed by a minister close to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The sources in the PLO leadership said that the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in Cairo was positive; however, it is still too early to talk of resuming the negotiations. Moti Amir, our correspondent in Tunis, reports that the PLO leadership feels that some tentative progress has been made toward resuming the talks with Israel. For the time being, however, no date has been set for their resumption. Consultations were held at the prime minister's bureau last night within the framework of the efforts to resume the talks with the PLO. The participants analyzed the messages that arrived from the PLO yesterday. Shlomo Raz, our political correspondent, reports that the messages were delivered via direct and indirect contacts between the Prime Minister's Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and PLO elements in the territories and in Tunis. Among those attending yesterday's consultations were Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, and senior IDF officers, headed by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq.
