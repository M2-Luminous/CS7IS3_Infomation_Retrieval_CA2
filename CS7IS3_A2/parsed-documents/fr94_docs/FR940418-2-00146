HTS number: 2917.32.00.00 CAS number: 117&hyph;81&hyph;7 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals xylene and propylene. Di-2 ethyl hexyl phthalate is a liquid produced predominantly by acid catalyzed esterification of phthalic anhydride (derived from o-xylene) and 2-ethyl hexanol (derived from propylene). The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 8 H 10 (xylene) + 4 C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 3 O 2 (oxygen) + 4 CO (carbon monoxide) + 8 H 2 (hydrogen) _____> C 24 H 38 O 4 (di-2 ethyl hexyl phthalate) + 6 H 2 O (water). According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 55 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $3.42 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.272 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.431. Dale D. Goode, Federal Register Liaison Officer, Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate).
