In an interview with Luis Nascimento, he accuses President Chissano of wasting public funds. [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am not happy, I am not happy, because my party does not have infrastructures a party should have. What we are complaining about is the promises made by the international community, as well as our Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] brothers, who have not provided us with the buildings that they had promised and that are contained in the Rome agreement that we signed. Therefore, I am not happy with the aid, the promises, because it all has been restricted to promises and they have not been followed up. [Nascimento] Within this context, are you going to keep contact? Are you going to continue holding regular meetings with President Chissano? [Dhlakama] Of course, of course. I will be discussing with him, for example, one of the issues pending. I will remind you that, at the first summit we held back in August last year, I had proposed that he, as head of state, should accept the setting up of an economic and social council that might include Renamo, Frelimo, and other, unarmed parties. That council would supervise or control the use of state funds and would monitor all foreign investment and keep control over all the state funds. The government, through President Chissano, rejected this proposal. I am waiting for him to come back so we can resume this discussion because I am not happy because I know that the government is using state funds, state vehicles, and state buildings for its political activities. Therefore, I do not understand how, at a time of transition like this, Frelimo continues to control all state funds and makes use of them for its own campaigning. [Nascimento] You have been quoted by international agencies as having said that Renamo may at any time suspend the confinement of its troops if this situation, these government delays, continue. Do you maintain that threat? [Dhlakama] Well, I could have done it already, because Frelimo has confined very few of its troops so far. The only thing is that if I did that, I would be helping Frelimo implement its maneuvers. Therefore we do not want to help those Frelimo tactics. That is why we have not yet suspended troop confinement, but Frelimo continues to not confine its troops. [end recording] [Announcer] Those were the Renamo leader's accusations. We then listened to the Mozambican president. President Chissano stated he will be talking to the Renamo leader and everything will be sorted out: [Begin recording] [Chissano] Because those questions have been raised by Mr Dhlakama, I will answer him and because he talked to the press that way, I do not know whether he will ask me about those problems in the same way, I do not know. Therefore I prefer to talk to him since he wants to talk to me. [Unidentified correspondent] And as far as the delays in confinement, the alleged delays by the government? [Chissano] Well, as far as satisfying your curiosity is concerned -- and his too and I will answer him -- but if you want to ask me then I would tell you that we are dealing with those matters in the appropriate places. Before I left Mozambique, I met Mr. Ayello and other members of the CST [not further identified], and subsequently I met with my aides and was pleased to observe that some measures are being taken for the troop confinement process to be speeded up because, after all, this is simply a technical issue, not a political issue. Well, at the time, there was a slowdown, but there may be, and there really is already, a speeding up, which may increase. [Correspondent] If there is no change, Mr Aldo Ayello said it today himself, the UN Security Council may react against the Mozambican Government. [Chissano] Of course, of course. There may be. From the moment you can see there is bad faith from the government, I will find it legitimate for you to be concerned. So far, there has been no sign of bad faith, and therefore I feel optimistic that it will all go well. [end recording] [Announcer] Mozambique has already entered its preelection campaign.
