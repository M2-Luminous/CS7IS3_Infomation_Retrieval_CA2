A. Slavutskiy; UDC 5 51.466:621.396.96] [Abstract] Electromagnetic waves in the centimeter range are scattered from the sea surface on small ripples under conditions of Bragg resonance. In a two-scale model, large-scale waves lead to spatial and temporal modulation of the amplitude of the radar signal due to a change in the local scattering angle, and to phase modulation associated with the orbital velocities of surface elements. This article describes a method of studying the Doppler spectrum of a radar signal with a frequency up to 20 GHz scattered by the sea surface. It is possible to obtain information on the fine structure of the Doppler spectrum associated with resonant scattering on gravitational-capillary ripples in digital processing of the received signal. It is also possible to evaluate the effect of large waves with a period of several seconds. A numerical fast Fourier transform algorithm was used to obtain the radar signal spectrum. The stable fine structure of the spectrum is provided by ``sliding'' averaging. Digital data processing may be done in real time, so the method is suitable for comprehensive studies of sur face phenomena. Figures 2; references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.
