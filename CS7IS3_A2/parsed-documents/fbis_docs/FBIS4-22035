[passage omitted] PKK Promised Government in Exile In addition to the international developments, the NSC meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile" in Athens or Nicosia. Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter these developments in the coming days. The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a strong reaction from the West. An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.
