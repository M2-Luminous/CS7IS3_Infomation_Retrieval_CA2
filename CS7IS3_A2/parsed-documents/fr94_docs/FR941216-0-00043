FR941216-0-00043 FR941216-0-00012 Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by NMFS according to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620, 675, 676, and 677. Regulations at 50 CFR 675.23(e) establish two fishing seasons for BSAI pollock. The first (roe) directed fishing season extends from January 1 until April 15. The second (nonroe) season extends from August 15 through the end of the fishing year. Since 1992, regulations at ยง673.23(d) have prohibited fishing for groundfish with trawl gear until January 20 of each fishing year (57 FR 381, January 6, 1992). Nontrawl fisheries for pollock do not exist. This action delays the opening date of the 1995 offshore component directed pollock roe trawl fishery in the BSAI from January 20 to January 26 to increase the likelihood of harvesting pollock when roe quality is optimum. The large harvesting capacity in the offshore component has resulted in a fast-paced fishery of decreasing duration (in 1994 the directed trawl fishery was opened for a 29-day period from January 20 until February 18) that, in the past, has closed before the period of prime roe quality, which peaks between the 10th and 20th of February. This delay of the offshore component pollock roe fishery (all gear) will increase the likelihood that the offshore component season will encompass the time period of prime roe quality. This action also prohibits vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery does not apply to vessels used to fish exclusively in the BSAI pollock CDQ program prior to January 26. This prohibition is intended to discourage a shift in fishing effort into other fisheries by pollock vessels prior to January 26. A proposed rule to implement this action was published in the Federal Register September 26, 1994 (59 FR 49051). Comment on the proposed rule was invited through October 26, 1994. Two letters were received in support of the proposed action and one letter was received in opposition. The three letters are summarized in the Response to Comments section, below. NMFS has determined that a delay of the offshore component pollock roe season is consistent with the Magnuson Act and has approved it. The necessity for and description of this action are explained further in the preamble to the proposed rule. This season delay is effective only through December 31, 1995, when regulations authorizing the allocation of pollock between the inshore and offshore component expire. Response to Comments
