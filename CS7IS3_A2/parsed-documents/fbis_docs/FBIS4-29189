The Japan Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsored the session, told those attending that the number of Japanese dealers selling imported cars has increased because they are not barred by affiliated makers from selling products of other manufacturers. The association said the number of such dealers will continue to increase if imported cars are competitive in quality and price. Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Motor Co. (Japan) Ltd., and other representatives of the Big Three U.S. automakers explained their marketing strategies in Japan. The seminar was organized by the association to help promote Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new framework of bilateral trade. The association said it plans to hold a similar seminar for cars imported from Europe.
