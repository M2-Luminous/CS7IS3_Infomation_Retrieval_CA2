Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech announced after four hours of talks with a fishermen's delegation in Rennes that Brussels has agreed to reintroduce minimum prices on certain species of fish. Here is an extract from the minister's news conference, which finished a moment ago: [Begin Puech recording] Regarding crews and families, the social aspect has, I believe, been dealt with as was requested. I now turn to the issue of prices, of markets. We are implementing, as I indicated the other day, the means that are available: 50 million francs have been released immediately for producers' organizations, so that they can intervene efficiently. [passage omitted] We have also obtained agreement from the European Commission in Brussels that minimum prices should be reintroduced. Minimum prices are once again operative. [end recording] Philippe Lefebvre, you are in front of the regional council building. I suppose that the fishermen's delegation will now try to sell these proposals to their members and to calm them down a bit. [Lefebvre] Yes, the delegation led by Dominique Lapart went down to Rue Gambetta, near the regional council building, about 10 minutes ago to try to calm the fishermen's anger. Their efforts appear, however, to have been in vain, since the crowd immediately began chanting: We have not obtained anything. They are not satisfied with Puech's measures. Some of them intend to stay in Rennes tonight. The town can brace itself for the worse. Some of the fishermen will be leaving, but they have announced their intention to stop on the way to empty more cases of imported fish in warehouses somewhere between Rennes and their final destination. This is all we can say for now. So, to sum up, we have had two reactions to the measures announced: a rather calm welcome from the delegates, but their members seem rather disappointed, and clashes are continuing near the town hall between demonstrators and riot police.
