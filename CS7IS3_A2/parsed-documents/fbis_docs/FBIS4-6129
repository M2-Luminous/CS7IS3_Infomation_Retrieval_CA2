He said: "We have absolutely no way of knowing whether an agreement can be reached there on a resumption of the (Japan-U.S.) framework trade talks. The issue may not be settled so easily, particularly because of the current political situation in Japan." He thus indicated it could be difficult to break the ice in resuming the deadlocked framework trade talks. Saito then added: "In the past, mutual interests (between Japan and the United States) on security matters have covered up bilateral trade friction, but it is unlikely that such a situation would continue (in the future). Unless Japan tries harder, bilateral relations will worsen, contrary to what has happened in the past." He thus stressed the need for Japan to actively work toward breaking the deadlock.
