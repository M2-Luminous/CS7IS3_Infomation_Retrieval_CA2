FBIS4-60109 "drnes099dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Tibi Rejects `Despicable' Distortion of Islam Al-Tibi Rejects `Despicable' Distortion of Islam TA2305095594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1505 GMT 22 May 94 TA2305095594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Mikha'el Tuchfeld; place not given -- live] [Text] [Tuchfeld] Today we heard additional comments made by 'Arafat in Johannesburg, this time referring to an agreement Muhammad made with the Quiraish Tribe and later violated. Does this mean that Islam permits people to sign agreements and then, when the circumstances change, to violate them? [Al-Tibi] What you are saying now and what you have been broadcasting since noon today is totally despicable. You interviewed a self-appointed expert with a political bias, a pseudo-orientalist who has distorted both Islam and the facts, claiming that Muhammad was the one who violated the agreement with the Quiraish Tribe. I accompanied 'Arafat to Johannesburg. Upon entering the mosque, he was immediately surrounded by radical fundamentalists who charged that he had signed an agreement with Israel while the latter violated it daily by murdering Palestinians, confiscating land, etc. In this mosque, 'Arafat said -- and you broadcast his remarks -- that if one side violates the agreement, the other side can violate it, as happened in the agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish. Now, what was this agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish, which was distorted by that self-appointed orientalist, Moshe Sharon? [Tuchfeld] A nonbelligerency agreement. [Al-Tibi] The agreement was called Hudaybah Sulh [reconciliation]. In this agreement, which dictated tough terms to Muhammad, the latter undertook to forgo the pilgrimage to Mecca. He accepted this dictate, and he also agreed not to accept any Quiraish member who wanted to become a Muslim and to send him away. An important clause in the agreement stated that if one side harms a member of the other side, the agreement is thereby annulled. This clause, incidentally, was inserted at the Quiraish's request. After two years, the Quiraish Tribe massacred the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, thereby violating the agreement. It was the Quiraish Tribe that violated the agreement, as every elementary school student knows. Now you come here and do something totally unacceptable.... [Tuchfeld, interrupting] It is not unacceptable, because Yasir 'Arafat's comments require clarification, and Professor Moshe Sharon is a renowned orientalist. Now, returning to 'Arafat's call for jihad, he later explained it as a religious jihad for peace. Not only Moshe Sharon, however, but other orientalists claim that there is no such thing in Islam. [Al-Tibi] I will not let this go unanswered. I agree with you that 'Arafat referred to the agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish, but you were accomplices to an act of distortion. Since noon today, you have been broadcasting that Yasir 'Arafat meant.... [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Now we are giving you the opportunity to clarify what he said, so why do you not use the short time you have to explain things? [Al-Tibi] Mikha'el, 'Arafat's comments should not have been elucidated by a right-wing orientalist whom you pulled straight out of a Gush Emunim conference. I can sympathize with your sensitivity to the word jihad, because it has a militant connotation for Jews, seeing that Arabs have always used it in this sense. Yasir 'Arafat explained what he meant, but many Israelis did not accept his explanation, while some did. Someone is now trying to make unjustifiable use of this second version of the tape. Incidentally, tapes are a special Israeli political genre which I think we should not exploit in reference to agreements between two nations.... [Tuchfeld, interrupting] Dr. al-Tibi, this is why we are giving you the opportunity to explain 'Arafat's remarks, and what you are claiming is that when one side violates an agreement, the other side is entitled to launch a jihad. [Al-Tibi] Absolutely not. Nobody said this, and now you are again distorting what was said. Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres themselves said that if Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] comes to power after the elections, the agreement is null and void. Now, if somebody thinks of violating an agreement as a result of political elections, what should be the fate of the agreement in the case of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] massacre of Palestinians or a Palestinian massacre of Israelis? I think in that case the agreement will be totally worthless. We are dealing here with an agreement that must be honored. Yasir 'Arafat signed this agreement. Perhaps criticism regarding the insensitive use of the jihad concept was justified, but this is not the case concerning the new version and this theater of the absurd which you are all participating in.
