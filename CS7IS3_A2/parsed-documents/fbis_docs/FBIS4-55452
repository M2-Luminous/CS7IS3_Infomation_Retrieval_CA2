In turn, Miroslaw Pietrewicz, head of the Central Planning Administration, estimated in his forecast for the next few years that, by 1997, inflation could amount to 12 percent. If we remember that, in 1989, inflation reached more than 500 percent and that last year it still amounted to almost 40 percent, a realistic expectation of 10-percent inflation must be seen as excellent progress. Here, however, we come to the question of the true feasibility of such a result. This year, inflation should reach some 26 percent. The beginning of the year was very good: In January and February, prices went up by a little over 1 percent (each month, of course). However, the March figures were only half as good, with price hikes of 2.6 percent. It is too early to say anything with certainty about April, but it seems that, if the results are only half as good as in March, they will be good enough in the circumstances. Inflation depends on many other things in addition to wage increases, but that factor has still to be taken seriously into consideration. Almost everyone (apart from trade union activists) insists that wage control is still essential in Poland and that allowing unrestricted wage increases is bound to result in rising inflation. Unfortunately, the situation we have witnessed since the beginning of April is starting to look like a deliberate game of provoking inflation. The president refuses to sign the neopopiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative wages] act. The prime minister says one day that we need the act, the next that we can do perfectly well without it, and the day after that that the coalition is in favor of introducing the neopopiwek after all. The Sejm finally approved the latest version of the wage control bill, and, if all goes well, the resultant parliamentary act will come into force by mid-May. If all goes well, that is, because, although the president did agree that, for the time being, wage control is necessary, that does not necessarily mean that he will definitely endorse the new act. Let us hope he will, but, even if he does, it will be a month and a half too late. What will happen to wages and prices in that time? We only need to look at what is happening to them already. The result will be that our long-term goal--that is, single-digit inflation in a few years' time--will still be a realistic proposition, but the path leading to it will become progressivly longer and more difficult, as it has become longer and more difficult over these past few weeks. But that long-term goal is not something we are seeking in the abstract, for its own sake. This truth seems to be forgotten by those who should be most interested in good economic results because the ultimate assessment of their administration will largely depend on their performance in that sphere.
