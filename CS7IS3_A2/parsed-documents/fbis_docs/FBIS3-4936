A senior official of the BOJ's International Department said: "To a certain degree, the market already reflects the fact that the exchange rate was not going to be high on the agenda at the latest meeting." At a meeting with the Japanese finance minister, the U.S. treasury secretary requested in strong terms that Japan try to cut its current account surplus. Some market officials, therefore, predict a yen rise in the exchange market early next week. However, the BOJ is doubtful, saying, "there does not now seem to be an automatic appreciation in the yen when the United States takes a hard-line attitude."
