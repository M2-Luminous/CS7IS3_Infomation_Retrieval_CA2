He was addressing a joint meeting of the Press Advisory Council and the Consultative Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad today. The meeting adopted a resolution condemning the Indian Government's ban on the entry of representatives from the human rights organizations and the mass media into occupied Kashmir. The resolution says the ban has been imposed to cover up the brutal activities of Indian forces in the occupied area. The meeting called on the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] to convene a special meeting on Kashmir and also urged the Pakistani Government to make a formal request to the ICO in this regard. The meeting welcomed the UN secretary general's annual report calling for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and U.S. President Bill Clinton's reference to Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, which, the meeting hoped, will greatly help the implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir.
