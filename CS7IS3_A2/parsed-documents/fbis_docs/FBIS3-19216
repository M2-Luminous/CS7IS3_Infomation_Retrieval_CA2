In a discussion in the Bundestag on Friday [11 March] about aid to the reform democracies in the East, Kinkel stressed "the Federal Government's pioneering role." By providing almost 90 billion German marks [DM] so far to the countries on the territory of the former Soviet Union, it has provided more than half of the entire international aid and is surpassed only by the United States. In contrast, Japan has spent DM46 million. Kinkel said that German aid to the Central European reform states (except the CIS) has amounted to about 37.5 billion since the end of 1989. He advocated accepting Russia as an equal member into the G-7 groups of the large industrialized countries. [passage omitted]
