Army Col. Rudolfo Lorayes, 603rd Infantry Brigade chief, was named as chairman with Capt. Filemon Saria and Sgt. Filemon Rowe as members representing the government in the Maguindanao Joint Cease Fire Subcommittee (MJCS). The MNLF counterparts are rebel Colonel Hamid Piang, chairman, Major Abas Kalipha and Mustapha Abdulwahab, members. The MJCS, housed at the provincial capitol complex in Sultan Kudarat town, was formed on 21 February, two days after the MNLF-GRP main cease fire committee came here to probe the renewed armed rift between Moro rebels and logging firm guards in Maguindanao. The planned probe, however, has been stalled due to the non- arrival here of some Indonesian Embassy officials from Manila to represent the Organization of Islamic Conference in the probe, local MNLF sources said. It was not known whether the MJCS will be the one to pursue the stalled probe as members of the GRP-MNLF main joint cease fire committees had returned to Zamboanga after the MJCS was formed. The probe was sought by MNLF Secretary-General Muslimen Sema, who had expressed alarm over the renewed rift between Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels and guards of the Cotabato Timberland Company, Inc. (CTCI) in Buldon and Barira towns. The skirmishes recurred when MILF rebels reportedly raided last 27 January three CTCI checkpoints and an Army detachment in Barira town, killing a CTCI guard and wounding another. [passage omitted] The MILF had accused the military of being "partisan" with the CTCI in the rift, which stemmed from the MILF's objection to the CTCl's alleged intrusion into MILF lairs and watershed areas in Buldon and Barira towns. The military denied the accusation, saying its presence in the area was for "peace keeping" as sought by the people there. The CTCI and the MILF had recently forged a peace truce with the intercession of some Muslim leaders. But Murad said the rift will remain until the CTCI leaves Maguindanao. Maguindanao Governor Norodin Matalan has also demanded the cancellation of the CTCI's timber License Agreement and its ejection from his province.
