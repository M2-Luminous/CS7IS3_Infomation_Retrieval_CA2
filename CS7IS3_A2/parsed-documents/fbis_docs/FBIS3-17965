This decision was adopted at the plenum of the Central Committee convened to discuss the new political situation, which developed after the Supreme Soviet passed a corresponding law. PKB members nominated Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the PKB Central Committee, as their candidate for president. Assessing this fact, numerous experts and observers notice that the left and left-centrist forces composing the People's Movement of Belarus, have probably not agreed on a single candidate for the job of Belarus' first president. At the same time, the opposite wing presents only one candidate for this post -- Stanislav Shushkevich. He was proposed by the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly. The Belarusian Union of Entrepreneurs did not remain aloof and proposed its president, Vladimir Karyagin, to participate in the presidential race. However, in the immediate future, everything could change and it is not ruled out that we will learn about other -- left, right, centrist, independent, and, by all means, unexpected -- candidates.
