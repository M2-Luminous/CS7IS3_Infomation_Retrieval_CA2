Henceforth, all restrictions on the export of strategic and nonstrategic output by all legal entities observing the law and customs and banking procedures are being removed. This will primarily make it possible to attract currency from abroad and speed up the formation of the republic's currency fund, so experts believe. Obviously, this is not a question of total license, because a special commission will be strictly observing exports. A reliable customs barrier has also been placed in the way of excesses: It is only possible to export output when its value is paid for in hard currency or the relevant banking letter of credit provided. The practice of holding of commodity exchanges is being introduced -- these will determine the value of output destined for export. The role of the national currency -- the manat -- is also being strengthened. The exchange rate of the manat will be established at currency auctions, which is reviving hopes of its convertibility. At the same time as the long-awaited edict, the Azerbaijani Ministry of the Economy has also published forecasts for foreign trade activity for 1994. The commodity turnover will increase by almost $297 million and will constitute $727 million by the end of the year. Barter deals will have to be given up. Like in previous years, exports are mainly made up of oil and oil products (up to 40 percent) and raw cotton (up to 28 percent), as well as machine-building, metallurgical, and petrochemical output. Currency receipts are also expected from the export of caviar. Iran and Turkey occupy a priority position in Azerbaijan's foreign economic activity. These countries also account for the largest volumes of food product purchases.
