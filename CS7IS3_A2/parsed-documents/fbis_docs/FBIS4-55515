There were also forced evictions from apartments. Last week was also characterized by movements of the Serbian army through Kosova, on the pretext of exercises. In fact this was a threat to the population of Kosova. The commander of the Third Army in Nis himself admitted the nature of this threat, saying that these exercises are being conducted with the aim of preventing an uprising of the Albanian populace or to maintain peace in Kosova, despite the well-known fact that the Albanians have declared themselves in favor of a peaceful solution to the problem of Kosova. These threats are a bad omen, and we therefore draw the international community's attention to the consequences they may entail. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, began yesterday's news conference in Prishtina with these comments. Sali Berisha's Important Visit to Romania Kosova continues to be at the center of attention of international institutions and different world figures. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova welcomed the recent CSCE statement on Kosova and the debate in the U.S. Congress and in the Foreign Affairs Committee chaired by Hamilton, which had devoted particular attention to Kosova. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome the very important visit of Sali Berisha, president of the Republic of Albania, to Romania, also appreciating his commitment to solving the question of Kosova. After expressing the hope that the question of Kosova will be placed on the agenda of the ministerial meeting to be held in Geneva, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova again demanded that Kosova be placed under the supervision of the international community. President Rugova went on to reply to journalists' questions. Asked about the Serbian rulers' threats to ban the activities of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova stressed that there had been demands to ban the LDK ever since it started, and there were also such demands last year. In the context of the question of banning this party, the so-called prefect of Kosova Simovic also mentioned Hogg. The British Embassy in Belgrade has meanwhile issued a denial that the question of registering the LDK had been discussed during his visit to Prishtina. Threats to ban the activities of the largest political party in Kosova are a highly dangerous step. This shows a tendency to destroy political life in Kosova. A ban of the LDK would be the most serious kind of provocation of the Albanians. This would not be a wise step for the Serbian regime, and this party will continue its work. A Serbian journalist asked whether the party would be registered. There is no question of registration, President Rugova said. We were registered under the former Yugoslav federation, of which we were a part when the Kosova authorities were suspended. This is merely a game and a pretext to ban this party. The Serbian regime should therefore think carefully about this as it is a dangerous step. We Must Be Careful Asked what he thought about the talks conducted by foreign delegations with people who have no legitimacy, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova stressed that all the delegations that come from abroad talk to the relevant personalities and institutions in Kosova, to me, to the LDK and other parties, and to various people in order to learn their views. This is normal. There have been no attempts to identify some other party in order to achieve something different. It is in the meantime well known who possesses legitimacy in Kosova. On the basis of the elections, we possess our authorities and institutions. The next questioner said that criticisms are being raised against peaceful resistance. There are demands for a more active resistance, and even the organization of demonstrations. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said that we receive these criticisms in the spirit of the differences of opinion displayed in relation to our movement. Our movement has been called passive, but it is not passive; on the contrary, it is active. This is shown by our political and institutional organization and the organization of our life. The patience we have shown when faced with the violence and murders that take place in Kosova is also active resistance, and is appreciated by the world. Not out of fear, but because of the situation in which we find ourselves, it must be stressed that even peaceful demonstrations are dangerous, and we must therefore be careful. As for the question of whether the question of Kosova will be raised at the ministerial meeting in Geneva, President Rugova stressed that the request has been made for Kosova to be treated at this meeting, because there can be no comprehensive solution for the former Yugoslavia without a solution for the problem of Kosova. Despite the tragic problem of Bosnia, we hope that Kosova too will be on the agenda at this meeting, he stressed. Asked whether any confusion persists regarding the visit of British Minister of State Douglas Hogg to Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said that there is no confusion for us. His visit and the statement he made in Kosova were very important for us. These were the reasons why attempts were made to incriminate and cast aspersions on his visit. He was one of the highest-level figures to visit Kosova, which is very important for us, president Rugova emphasized. It Is Known Who Performs Ethnic Cleansing Asked about Milosevic's statement that it was the Albanians who first started ethnic cleansing, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said that it is well known who started ethnic cleansing. I will go no further than to recall the period between the two world wars when Cubrilovic and Andric drew up plans for the emigration of the Albanians. They were deported to Turkey, and these programs were carried out after the war too. The case of Bosnia best shows who is carrying out purges. This is clear to the world. However, when the question of Kosova is raised before the international public, the Albanians are accused of something they have never done. Quiet ethnic cleansing is taking place in Kosova, in that Albanians are leaving because of the violence to which they are subjected. Serbia showed who is carrying out purges when warnings came of the repatriation of Albanians from some Western countries. Commenting on this statement by Milosevic, Professor Dr. Fehmi Agani recalled the statement by Karadzic, who said that he had not bombarded the civilian population in Brcko. Sarajevo was surrounded and bombarded for two years, but the other side denied this. This is a manner of thinking that on the one hand ignores facts and on the other despises and shows contempt for the public, who are told to "listen to what I say."
