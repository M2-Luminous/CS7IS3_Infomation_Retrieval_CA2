FR940318-1-00023 FR940318-1-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;03] Proposed Revision of Class E Airspace, Juneau and Dillingham, AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. . SUMMARY: This notice proposes to revise Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. The FAA is preparing to develop and test Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) instrument approach procedures at the Juneau Airport and additional controlled airspace starting at 700 feet above the surface, a 700 foot transition area, is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) departure and arrival operations at the airport. In order to ensure holding patterns recently developed for use at Dillingham (DLG) are in controlled airspace, additional controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet above the surface, a 1200 foot transition area, is needed. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``700 foot transition area and 1200 foot transition area'' and in its place uses the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations in controlled airspace. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 30, 1994.
