[Horn] I do not know. This question is of little concern to me. We say that we do not commit ourselves to anything regarding this question before we get the election result. If I am correctly informed, there are 11 candidates for the office of prime minister in this country. Why should we increase their number? [PROFIL] Over recent months your party has gained a degree of popularity, which is surprising to many. Is it also surprising to you? [Horn] It makes one feel rather good. One sees that one's own political work has meaning. We are dealing with questions of the social restructuring of the economy, for which there is no recipe and where we are treading on virgin soil. Nowhere in the world is there an example of such rapid and massive privatization. One must not deal with ideologies in this matter. We decided the ideological issues during the second half of the 1980's when we passed laws on the multiparty parliamentary system and urged associated membership in the European Community and when I stated at the beginning of 1990 that Hungary's security would be ensured within the framework of NATO. [PROFIL] Four or five years ago most people would have assumed that the long communist rule would give rise to a long political quarantine for the Communist Parties and their successor organizations. Would you have believed at that time that you would get close to power so quickly again? [Horn] Why do you use the term "Communist Party"? This is a term that is used by the right. I just want to remind you that on 7 October 1989 we founded the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). This party broke with the old state party, not only in ideological and political terms but also in practice. Therefore, I reject the adjective "communist," even though I have never denied that I was a communist. But one can develop also in this region, and not only in the West. [PROFIL] Let us turn to the future. You have an economic program that is expressly liberal on economics. In the Socialist International you would be on the far right wing. [Horn] This statement is not correct. Why should a program be liberal that says that one must no longer place the burdens of restructuring more or less one-sidedly on those who earn wages and salaries. Is a program liberal that calls for equal opportunities, that gives the state a greater role in the social field? I ask you: Is this liberal? [PROFIL] So your party is not liberal. Is there anything on which you agree with the liberals, with whom you want to form a coalition? [Horn] On the fact that the economy is in a disastrous situation. On the fact that the entrepreneurs are suffering under enormous taxes and burdens. However, this is also in harmony with the political ideas of the Socialist International. [PROFIL] Thus, you would say that a government with socialist participation would be better for Hungarian entrepreneurs than a new edition of the current conservative government? [Horn] Look, the majority of entrepreneurs have clearly indicated that they support the MSZP. For two reason: First, they want competent people in the government and, second, they want a predictable government policy. [PROFIL] Is this support from the entrepreneurs also due to the fact that some former communists have become capitalists? [Horn] The majority of communists did not join us. Those who had middle-echelon posts in the former state party founded small shareholding companies; they are not the owners or managing directors of large companies. [PROFIL] In all the eastern Central European countries there is the problem of how one can get out of the mess. Do you think that the privatization of the Hungarian economy must be slowed down or accelerated.... [Horn] It is not the speed that is the essential thing. In implementing privatization we would do two things in a fundamentally different way: First, we would once again make privatization subject to parliamentary control and, second, the point is not how much money a company is sold for -- the revenue is mostly used to close gaps in the budget anyway -- but that the new owner invests in modernization, preserves jobs, or creates them. The usual practice with the European Community is, however, that the company is closed down, the workers are dismissed, and the goods of the new owner stream into the country. Thus, in most cases a market is bought up, not just a company. [PROFIL] Prime Minister Antall reportedly said on his death bed: "Only a Christian Hungary has a future." What kind of Hungary has a future, in your view? [Horn] I was not present at Antall's death and, therefore, I cannot judge what he said. However, I know very well that most states in Europe do not define themselves as Christina countries. I believe that Christians and non-Christians, believers and non- believers, Hungarians and non-Hungarians all have their place in this country. Today it almost looks as if those who are not Christians, who are not believers, are a kind of second-class citizens. This is nonsense and has nothing to do with a European attitude.
