"No one can change history, but pain and human sacrifice can never suffer distinctions or divisions," said Scalfaro at a memorial service attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi. "I cannot forget that in the division of my country, suffering and bloodshed affected other sons of this earth," said the head of state. A particular thought was spared for the Americans who died in the Salerno, Nettuno and Anzio landings "whose young, sacrificed, lives we celebrate today." Affirming that the dead of past wars are calling out for an end to current conflicts, Scalfaro recalled how Italy, over the past 50 years has always responded "swiftly and generously to calls for solidarity and brotherhood between people, in the service of liberty and justice, in the same spirit in which it was present in the heroic battle for freedom." Calling for nations to be on their guard against "future dangers and fears", the president condemned the Second World War, "because man chose violence against all reason," and because of the existence of "dishonest dictatorships, with the hegemony of a `superior race' which massacred brotherly equality between people and generated nameless genocide." On the podium alongside Scalfaro were President Clinton and his wife Hillary, who were greeted by huge crowds waving Italian and American flag as they made their way through Nettuno, 40 km south of Rome, where they arrived by helicopter earlier this morning. Security officers ran metal detectors over all those wishing to enter the war cemetery here for the service to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings, a service attended by many Italian veterans. Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who was present but did not make a speech at this morning's ceremony, displayed irritation at journalists who wanted to quiz him solely on the domestic political situation. "Can't you be a little bit moved for once, seeing all these boys who died for Italy," the premier asked the press.
