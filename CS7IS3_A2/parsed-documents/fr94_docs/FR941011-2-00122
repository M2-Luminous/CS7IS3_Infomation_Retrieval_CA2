FR941011-2-00122 FR941011-2-00082 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34783; Filed No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;24] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Extension of the Pilot Program for Fees Due for Post-Trade Data Submission of Trade Information October 3, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S. C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on July 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Exchange subsequently filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on September 29, 1994. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 In Amendment No. 1 the Exchange requested an extension of the pilot program until December 31, 1994, rather than permanent approval. See Letter from Michael Meyer, Schiff, Hardin & Waite, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated September 29, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to request an extension of the ``As-of-Add'' fee [program contained in CBOE Rule 2.26 (``Pilot Program''), until December 31, 1994. 2 Under that rule, individual members and member organizations are assessed a monthly fee when they submit trade information later than the trade date (each an ``As-of-Add'') on more than a stated maximum percentage of their monthly transatins. The Exchange does not propose to amend Rule 2.26 in any respect at this time. 2 Id. Under the Pilot Program, the fee, if any, to an individual member is $10.00 for each As-of-Add submitting during a given month in excess of the percentage of submissions considered ``nominal'' under paragraph (a) of Rule 2.26. The fee to any clearing firm under paragraph (a) of Rule 2.26. The fee to any clearing firm under paragraph (b) of that rule is $3.00 for each As-of-Add submitted in excess of the ``nominal'' monthly percentage. Any member assessed an As-of-Add fee may request verification from the Exchange pursuant to Part B of Chapter XIX of CBOE's Rules and may appeal the fee assessment pursuant to Part A thereof. The Pilot Program was initially approved by the Commission on October 1, 1993. 3 Continuation of the Pilot Program, in its present form, was approved on April 4, 1994. 4 In the Continuation Order, the Commission required the Exchange, if it wished to make the Pilot Program a permanent program, to explain how the Pilot Program reflects an equitable allocation of fees among members and to establish a policy with respect to discipline of members that repeatedly file an excessive number of AS-of-Add. 5 The Commission also required the CBOE to submit a report setting forth particular statistics about the Pilot Program. 6 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32999 (October 1, 1993), 58 FR 53003 (October 13, 1993) (``Exchange Act Release No. 32999''). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33855 (April 4, 1994), 59 FR 17128 (April 11, 1994) (``Continuation Order''). 5 Id. Rule 6.51 requires members to submit data for every executed trade on the day executed. 6 The report was submitted to the Commission on July 5, 1994. See Letter from Joanne Moffic-Silver, Associate General Counsel, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, OMS, Division, Commisison, dated June 29, 1994 (``Pilot Report''). The Exchange represents that the Pilot Program serves two purposes. First, it helps reimburse the Exchange for the administrative burdens and costs of processing post-trade date submission from members. Late trade submissions, according to the Exchange, impose special processing costs on the Exchange and require significant effort by clearing firms and executing brokers to check and resolve late trade reports. The Exchange further represents that late trade submissions also can burden the Exchange during periods of high volume and create financial risks to members during volatile markets. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the As-of-Add fees provide the Exchange with revenues that cover, in part, its cost for providing As-of-Add services. Second, the Exchange represents that the Pilot Program is designed to create economic incentives for members to submit trade data on the trade date, thereby relieving the Exchange and Exchnge members of high levels of special handling. The Exchange believes that the Pilot Program and the incentive effects of the fee are equitably allocated among individual members and member organizations. Although individual members incur a higher per-submission fee than do clearing members, the Exchange states that individual members have primary control over the timing of submissions and, in the Exchange's experience, individual member errors and delays are the direct cause of most As-of-Adds. The fee structure is thus designed to impose greater As-of-Add responsibilities on those members, i.e. , individual members, whose conduct, according to the Exchange creates the biggest share of the extra work and extra costs posed by late submissions. Since October 1993, 354 individual members, and 13 clearing firms, have been assessed a fee pursuant to the Pilot Program. 7 7 The highest fee assessed against an individual member was $858 and the average fee assessed was $105.64, while the highest fee assessed against a clearing member was $2,406 with average fees amounting to $307.07.
