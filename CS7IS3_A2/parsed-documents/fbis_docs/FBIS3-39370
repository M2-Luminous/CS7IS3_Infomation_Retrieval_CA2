The 22 January Paris weekly LE POINT published the results of an IPSOS/LE POINT poll conducted between 14 and 17 January among a representative sample of 1,000 individuals. Respondents were asked their presidential candidate preference in the first round of voting. Several hypotheses were posed: A race including Michel Rocard, leader of the Socialist Party (PS), Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac. The winner was Edouard Balladur with 38 percent of the vote, followed by Rocard with 18 percent and Chirac with 13 percent. Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front (FN) received 11 percent, the candidate of the ecologist movement with 11 percent, the candidate of the Communist Party (PC) 7 percent, and the candidate of the extreme left 2 percent. Some 23 percent did not answer. A race including Rocard, Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and Chirac would be won by Chirac with 31 percent, followed by Rocard with 21 percent, and Giscard d'Estaing with 15 percent. The candidate of the ecologist movement received 14 percent, Le Pen 10 percent, the candidate of the PC 7 percent, and the extreme left's candidate 2 percent. A total of 25 percent did not answer. In a contest including Rocard, Balladur, and Giscard d'Estaing the lead would go to Balladur with 42 percent, followed by Rocard with 19 percent, the ecologists' candidate with 13 percent, Le Pen with 10 percent, Giscard d'Estaing and the candidate of the PC with 7 percent, and the candidate of the extreme left with 2 percent. Some 21 percent did not answer. In a race between Rocard, Balladur, Chirac, and Senate President Rene Monory the winner again would be Balladur with 36 percent, followed by Rocard with 17 percent, Chirac with 13 percent, the ecologists' candidate with 12 percent, Le Pen with 9 percent, the PC's candidate with 7 percent, Rene Monory with 4 percent, and the extreme left's candidate with 2 percent. A total of 21 percent did not answer. The last hypothesis involved a race including Rocard, Balladur, Chirac, and Giscard d'Estaing. Balladur would overtake all his rivals with 34 percent, followed by Rocard with 19 percent, Chirac with 14 percent, the ecologists' candidate with 11 percent, Le Pen with 9 percent, the PC's candidate with 6 percent, Giscard d'Estaing with 5 percent, and the candidate of the extreme left with 2 percent. Commenting on the results, Denis Jeambar notes that "nothing can resist Balladur and Chirac": Neither a Rocard "stuck" between 17 and 21 percent, nor the right in which the UDF is "afflicted with electoral dwarfism." Giscard d'Estaing, he adds, risks the "terrible humiliation" of finding himself behind Le Pen. Finally, the UDF's Rene Monory made a very poor showing. Jeambar also comments that the rivalry between the poll's two strongest candidates, Balladur and Chirac, will become increasingly exacerbated. Chirac is preparing for the presidential election with his characteristic energy and force; while only the real risk of a defeat would prevent him from running, this prospect is nonexistent for the moment because of Rocard's low scores. Faced with Chirac's power, Balladur possesses cunning, another major ingredient in politics, Jeambar continues. The prime minister's ability ensures him an "exceptional" presidential potential. The war between the two men will be "total," Jeambar predicts. Victory will go to whoever can supplement his own specific qualities: Were Chirac to successfully add cunning to force, he would win, and if Balladur can add force to cunning, he would remain "irresistible," Jeambar concludes. Philippe Reinhard comments on the results of a SOFRES poll (no further information) in the 20 January Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, according to which Balladur would outscore Chirac by 10 percentage points, and president of the EC Commission Jacques Delors by 13 percentage points. Some 44 percent of the respondents would like Balladur to be a candidate for president, compared with 23 percent who choose Chirac. Poll results are making Chirac's entourage "nervous," as they indicate that even RPR sympathizers prefer Balladur as a candidate (63 percent) over Chirac (34 percent). However, Reinhard points out that the Chirac aides' "exasperation" propagates the idea that a Chirac/Balladur war has now replaced the "eternal" Chirac-Giscard face-off. Tn addition, by criticizing "more or less openly" the prime minister's course of action and attempting to invoke a "contract" between Balladur and Chirac, these same aides are harming their leader. In fact, Reinhard contends, Chirac is certainly not eliminated from the race, for as long as he seems practically sure of beating Rocard, the candidate of the left, "his presidential chances remain intact." Finally, Chirac's friends should not prevent him from being viewed as a "credible unifying force" in case persistent difficulties and insufficient results make a Balladur candidacy improbable, Reinhard concludes. Writing in the 24 January LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, Philippe Reinhard comments on the results of an TFOP/LE QUOTIDIEN poll conducted on 20-21 January among 955 individuals over 18. Respondents were asked to express their preference on a possible single list of rightist candidates for the European Parliament elections. Like a number of recent polls, they confirmed that the RPR and within it Edouard Balladur "dominate the political game hands down." Balladur led as head of the list with 28 percent, followed by Chirac with 16 percent, Giscard d'Estaing with 12 percent, and a number of other candidates, each with less than 10 percent. According to Reinhard, poll results show that the European issue is no longer a UDF "specialty." In addition, the Balladur government's course of action has "dedramatized" the European debate through the "pragmatic" management of European issues and GATT, as well as the strengthening effect the negotiations had on Community solidarity. A second conclusion from the poll results is the surprising fact that Balladur is chosen over other candidates in spite of his clear indication that he would reject the additional burden. This "Balladurian" performance only confirms all other poll results favoring him as the presidential candidate, Reinhard comments.
