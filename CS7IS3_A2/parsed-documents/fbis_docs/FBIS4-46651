The flux from the source when it was first detected was 600 mCrab in an energy range of 8-20 keV. The instrument managed to localize the source to within about 1�. The following coordinates for the 1950.0 epoch were recorded: _a_ = 17[.sup]h[/]24[.sup]m[/], _b_ = 20�43'. The radius of the region of localization with a level of significance of 1_s_ was 40 arc minutes. The source is in the Hercules constellation. The distance between GRS 1724+21 and the x-ray source closest to it (quasar V396 Her) is 4�. The source "switched off" on 11 August. The front of increasing intensity is considerably shorter than the period of decay of the light curve, and the light curve weakened from 7 August through 9 August.
