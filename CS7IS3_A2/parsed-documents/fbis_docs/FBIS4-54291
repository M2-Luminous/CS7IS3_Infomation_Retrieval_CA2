The price hike will be the first in three years, and the range of the hike is about 10 percent. Previously, a "special price" has been applied to China that was 10 to 20 percent below the price for other Asian countries, but they are taking advantage of the sudden increase in the demand for steel in Asia to review this. If there is a permeation of price hikes for China, which accounts for about 30 percent of total steel export volume, it appears that it will be linked to an improvement in earnings for blast furnaces manufacturers. The joint business talks with China are negotiations every half year with the Five Metal and Mineral Production General Corporation of China on the prices of eight items such as various kinds of steel plate, and this time they will be held in Beijing beginning on 16 May. It appears that exports to China due to the joint business talks will reach 1.7 million tons in the first half of this year, but it is said that they "would like to implement a price hike of at least 10 percent in the second half even if it somewhat stifles volume" (blast furnace maker officer). The various blast furnace companies charge the various Southeast Asian nations about $370 per ton for hot-rolled coil, but 20 percent less than this for China. The various blast furnace companies, who estimate an across-the-board deficit in the March 1994 settlement of accounts, aim to eliminate this price difference in these negotiations. China appears to be opposed to the price hike in steel, a basic material, but the various blast furnace companies view that "a price hike environment is determined by the aspect of supply and demand" insofar as the surplus export strength of South Korea and others, who previously had put effort into exports to China, is dropping.
