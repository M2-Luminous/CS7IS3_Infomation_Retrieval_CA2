An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today by Valeriy Eksuzyan, general director of Russian International Airlines, which operated the airliner. Using information gathered from the site of the disaster investigation, he pointed out that this scenario is supported by the facts. The investigation has established that the airbus descended from a height of 10,000 m with its engine running at an angle of 70-80 degrees for 10-20 minutes with its navigation lights on and undercarriage retracted. It fell after grazing a hill. The area over which the pieces of the aircraft are scattered is small - 200 meters. The fuselage, cockpit, wings, and other pieces are close together. The three pilots were found in the Airbus's cockpit, strapped to their seats. Their bodies, like 46 bodies of the other people on board, were quite recognizable. According to Valeriy Eksuzyan, these facts indicate that, as a result of some abnormal phenomena, the pilot's cockpit may have been suddenly depressurized, which, at an altitude of 10km, causes the blood to boil and death ensues quickly, and the aircraft, uncontrolled and on autopilot, lost height until the moment of impact. However, it will be possible to determine the precise cause of the disaster, according to Valeriy Eksuzyan, only after the two "black boxes", the flight recorders, which were recovered today and were sent to Moscow for study, have been decoded.
