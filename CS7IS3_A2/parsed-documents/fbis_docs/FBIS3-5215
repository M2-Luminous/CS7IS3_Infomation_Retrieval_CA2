Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard held himself personally responsible for the ill-timed and misworded comments on the South Korean security law, admitting that he was not the appropriate person to make such remarks, Ministry officials said. An official from the South Korean Embassy in Washington met with Hubbard and was told the United States does not plan to raise the issue as part of the bilateral agenda, they said. "We believe that Mr. Hubbard made these remarks in his capacity as deputy secretary of state," one official said. Hubbard told a seminar on Feb. 25 that the United States hopes South Korea will abolish its National Security Law, which bars any unauthorized contact with North Korea or any activities sympathetic to the communist regime. The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate to nuclear negotiations with North Korea. At the meeting with South Korean Embassy official, Hubbard reasserted that his statements were in line with Washington's 1993 human rights report, which said the South Korean law is subject to abuse. Admitting his personal responsibility, Hubbard said he should not have made such comments in light of his capacity as chief negotiator with Pyongyang on nuclear affairs, officials said.
