Speaking at the two-day seminar on policies of the world arrogance in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other Islamic states, he remarked that despite Iran's readiness, the Iranian forces had not yet been allowed to be dispatched to that region. The vice-speaker said that the west was using Russia as an excuse to withhold help to Muslims adding that the west was now pretending that it was Russia which, as a member of the Security Council, would veto decisions of other members made in favor of the Muslims. He further said that if the U.S., Britain and France had not shown the green light to Russia, the latter would not have been in a position to stand against western powers. Stressing that over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims were ready to struggle and sacrifice their lives, Rowhani concluded by saying that although the U.N. has confirmed that Bosnian Muslims are under Serbian aggressions, it has so far failed to provide them with defensive means.
