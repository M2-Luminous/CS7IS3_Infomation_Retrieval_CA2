Holla del Salto, 59, was accused of leading and arming a group of civilians in the eastern state of Puebla with shotguns, .22-caliber rifles, and other small arms. The authorities have not disclosed any details about the group, but Holla del Salto was expelled for having forged Mexican citizenship documents. The Ecuadoran priest was arrested Sunday in Chapulco, Puebla, 180 km east of the Mexican capital, and he was expelled from the country Monday, which prompted protests by some 500 of his followers who blocked local highways to demand his return. Holla's arrest and the existence of his armed group aroused the concern of a group of senators, who asked the government to investigate the existence of organizations such as this one, particularly in areas susceptible to unrest. The Mexican Government must detect "additional armed groups in areas in which there may be social conflicts," said Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Senator Alger Leon, chairman of the Senate Defense Commission. German Sierra, a senator from Puebla, asked authorities to dismantle the armed group organized by Holla del Salto, who lived in Chapulco. Sierra also admitted that the authorities were aware of Holla's activities for some time but had failed to act to avoid confrontations with the fanatics who sheltered him. Senator Sierra denied the priest was involved in drug trafficking or that he had connections with other guerrilla groups in the country, characterizing the existence of the Puebla organization as no threat "because its members do not have high-caliber weapons." The Secretariat of Defense recently admitted that it had unsuccessfully investigated reports that approximately 2,000 AK-47 submachine guns, which are known in Mexico as "goat horns," had entered the country. According to the reports, the weapons, allegedly part of a larger shipment, may have been intended for drug traffickers or armed groups in certain southern Mexico states. The Ecuadoran priest, who arrived in Mexico in December 1961, managed to leave Mexico to further his religious studies in Europe and to reenter the country on several occasions using false documents. According to records, he resided in Chapulco. Puebla State and southern and southeastern Mexico, including the state of Chiapas, are the areas with the highest rate of poverty and, therefore, are the areas in which the probable existence of armed groups is the highest. Subcommander "Marcos" of the EZLN, which staged an uprising on 1 January in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, says he has been informed that there are other armed groups in the country. Subcommander "Marcos" said: "The government's blindness prevents it from seeing that there are armed groups in various parts of the republic, that they are multiplying, and that a civil war is imminent."
