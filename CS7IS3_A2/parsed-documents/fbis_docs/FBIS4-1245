The explosion occurred in Bree Street near the regional offices of the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and the ANC's national headquarters. Regional ANC spokesman Obed Bapela has said a senior ANC official was among those killed. He said there were about 200 MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] members in the ANC's regional offices when the bomb went off. The police say the bomb, of between 70 and 90 kilograms, had apparently been planted in or under a car parked at the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh Streets. Neighboring buildings were extensively damaged and numerous windows were blown out. After the explosion people scattered in all directions. A sizable crowd began gathering near the scene of the blast but dispersed peacefully after being addressed by Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC. Troops were called in to help patrol the area which had been cordoned off by the police shortly after the blast. Police sniffer dogs are being used to comb the area for more bombs.
