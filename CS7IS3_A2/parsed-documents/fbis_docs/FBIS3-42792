The consequences of these conflicts are reflected directly in the daily life of Russians. More than 2 million refugees arrived in the country in 1993 alone. The Government of the Russian Federation and the local authorities have in just the last two years spent R51.5 billion in making provision for them. This is a difficult economic burden for any country, let alone ours. The mass influx of refugees has revived the threat, long-forgotten here, of epidemics of dangerous diseases. Waves of organized crime are coming to Russia from the "flash points." The great Russian historian V.O. Klyuchevskiy considered a principal factor reflected in the historical fate of Russia its lack of a natural border on the vast expanse between the Urals range and the Caspian. Down the ages nomadic Asiatic hordes entered Russia through this "gate." Although today's Russia is not threatened by invasions of nomads, it once again in fact lacks a southern border. We simply do not have the means to furnish one. But even a highly fortified border would not protect us against the new threats connected with the instability and internal conflicts of our neighbors. Especially since compatriots living outside of Russia are coming primarily to be the victims of these conflicts. For the Defense of National Interests The debate in Russian society in connection with the problems of the near abroad is unfolding in the space between two extreme positions. The first: a solution of the problem by way of "restoring order" in the former Soviet republics, that is, simply put, the restoration "by fire and sword" of the disintegrated USSR. In order to imagine what this would signify it is sufficient to glance at events in the former Yugoslavia. If Russia has succeeded thus far in sparing itself the horrors that have fallen to the lot of the peoples of this country, it is only because Moscow has not attempted to restore the Union state by force and redraw internal borders. Adopting an imperial policy would mean getting that same Yugoslav scenario, but one that is immeasurably more dangerous owing to the dimensions of the former state and the presence on its territory of nuclear and chemical weapons, nuclear power stations.... The second position: Russia "walks away" from the near abroad, removing itself completely from involvement in the fate of the states of the former USSR. But this option also, despite all its ostensible allure, would ultimately result in catastrophe. If, for example, the Russian peacekeepers were to leave Tajikistan, tomorrow hundreds of thousands of refugees would be pouring into Russia from there, and not only Russians but both Tajiks and Uzbeks also, what is more. The result would be chaos in Russia itself, from which it would be a straight path to a pogrom-type-nationalist dictatorship, and from this to the Yugoslav version once again. It transpires that Russia is "condemned" to perform a special role in the former USSR, but the role not of a gendarme but of a peacekeeper. Especially since no state of the near or far abroad and no international organization is displaying a desire or is in a position to replace Russia as the peacekeeping force in this region. But recognition of a special role does not signify Russia's claims to some "free hand" in respect to its neighbors. We are organizing our actions strictly in accordance with the principles of international law: respect for the sovereignty and independence of the states involved in conflicts, noninterference in their internal affairs, and recognition of their territorial integrity, with respect for the rights of the national minorities. In all cases where this is possible Moscow aspires to joint actions within the framework of the CIS. At the same time, on the other hand, it should be clear that Russia is forced at times to speak strongly and has no intention of paying in the lives of its soldiers for a lack of will to reconciliation in the parties involved in a conflict. Russian peacekeeping has already accumulated considerable experience. There have been no military operations in South Ossetia or the Dniester region for more than a year now. Mechanisms of mediation in a settlement of the Karabakh and Abkhaz conflicts are operating. Russia's important practical contribution to a settlement of the conflicts in Nagornyy Karabakh and Abkhazia has already been recognized in a number of documents of the UN Security Council and the CSCE. If a decisive turn toward peace in the post-Soviet space has not yet occurred, it is not because the choice in favor of an active peacekeeping policy was wrong. It is primarily a question of the seriousness and complexity of these conflicts. And the "peacekeeping techniques" formulated by the United Nations, the CSCE, and other organizations are still imperfect to a large extent also. No one in the world has a 100 percent effective methodology of peacekeeping operations. This is indicated, specifically, by the experience of their prosecution in Bosnia and Somalia. Like other states also, we have to learn peacekeeping, perfecting both international and domestic mechanisms. It is essential first and foremost to ensure the pursuit of a common all-state policy in respect to local conflicts. It should not appear as a "layer cake," in which each layer corresponds to the tastes of individual persons, departments, or regions. Manifestations of such an approach, even in defiance of Russia's official position, not only seriously harm the cause of a settlement (we saw examples of this in Abkhazia) but also undermine trust in Russia on the part of the world community, fostering the myth of "Russian imperialism." The new constitution adopted at the general referendum clearly enshrines the prerogatives of the president in questions of foreign policy and security. The further strengthening of Russian statehood requires that a barrier be erected in the way of departmental and opportunist calculations. The efficiency of our peacekeeping should be enhanced through the alignment of Russia's trade and economic relations with the parties to conflicts with the overall aim of a peace settlement. Peacekeeping also needs a strong material and legal foundation. It is important that our new parliament not repeat the deplorable experience of the former Supreme Soviet, which, while from time to time striking an heroic pose in relation to our neighbors, displayed no concern for the creation of a full-fledged legislative base of Russian peacekeeping. Faced With a Common Challenge Support for Russia in the settlement of conflicts in the former USSR is a test of strength of the partnership that has taken shape between former adversaries in the cold war. I emphasize that we are talking about assistance, not attempts to instruct and control while shifting the burdens of the accomplishment of this task onto Russia. Europe and the world are coming increasingly to recognize that these conflicts are not some far-off fratricidal strife but a serious problem of European and international security. Even now the waves of the narcotics mafia and crime from the "flash points" are beginning to roll down to Central and West Europe. Understandably, no "cordons sanitaires" will save Europe if conflicts and instability in the post-Soviet space engulf Russia. But it is not only a question of a common threat. The fundamental interests of Russia and our partners in the far abroad coincide in a desire to see in the new independent states observance of generally recognized international standards, in the field of human rights included. After all, the southern border of the CIS has become, simultaneously, the border of the CSCE also. This is important for Russia primarily because only under the conditions of peace, democracy, and the observance of human rights in these states can the rights of the Russian-speaking population be fully secured. The United Nations and the CSCE: `Inspectors' or Participants in Peacekeeping in the CIS? The world community has begun to pay more attention to peacekeeping operations in the former USSR as of late. We are grateful to the representatives of the United Nations and the CSCE who are working in the conflict zones hand in hand with the Russian peacekeepers. But a certain duality is being displayed in the position of many of our partners. They are torn, as it were, between recognition of the real significance of the Russian peacekeeping mission and doubts lest it serve as a pretext for a revival of Russia's "imperial propensities." As a result we are at times encountering attempts to make cooperation with us dependent on a variety of speculative conditions and "criteria," which only distract from the real cause. These apprehensions are noticeable among our neighbors also. Memories of the carnage caused by the Soviet authorities in Tbilisi, Baku, Vilnius, and Riga are with them superimposed on top of new fears born of the ultra-nationalist appeals of a number of Russian politicians. The best "medicine" for such fears is interaction in the sphere of peacekeeping, within the CIS framework included. An international peacekeeping strategy is needed, on the whole. An important component of it should be the bolstering by a UN mandate of the peacekeeping operations being conducted by Russia in the former USSR. We are not talking about some international "legalization" of the presence of Russian peacekeeping forces in CIS countries. There is no need for this since they are deployed there on an entirely legitimate basis, at the request of the corresponding governments. The need for such a mandate is caused by the fact that Russia's peacekeeping operations are "nontraditional" from the standpoint of UN practice. They are being conducted on the territory of neighboring states, where Russia has serious economic and other interests. Under these conditions a UN mandate and the presence of observers are designed to confirm the dispassionate nature of the Russian mission, strengthen its connection with the UN efforts, and, on the whole, enhance the efficiency of the peacekeeping operations. UN and CSCE observers should be sent to the conflict zones at the right moment, when a cease-fire has been achieved. In this case they could really bolster the Russian peacekeeping contingent as a third force. The breakdown of the Abkhazia peace negotiations in the summer of 1993 showed the cost of delay in the deployment of a peacekeeping mission. On the one hand the Russian contingent failed to obtain the necessary reinforcement, although it was known from the outset that the forces available by the start of the operation would be insufficient for accomplishing it in full. The Russian piece of folk wisdom: Don't start a job you can't finish, is pertinent here. But such jobs have to be undertaken! The same applies to the United Nations. Extraordinary efforts were required of Russian diplomacy first for the number of observers whom the UN Security Council would have been prepared to send to Abkhazia to be increased from the laughable figure of eight-12 to 80. But by the time of the breakdown of the agreement, two and a half months later, no more than 20 observers were on the scene. International support should be expressed also in acceptance of the principle of a fair distribution of the burden of expenditure on peacekeeping. We are raising the question of the formation of a voluntary international fund to this end. A strengthening of the peacekeeping functions of the CSCE constituted the essence of our proposals at the recent meeting of CSCE foreign ministers in Rome. The adoption of the declaration on countering aggressive nationalism was an important achievement. This is a serious contribution of the CSCE to the prevention of interethnic conflicts forming the basis of many armed clashes in the former USSR and Yugoslavia. The three-year Russian peacekeeping experience has not been in vain. We now know better what needs to be done for a settlement of interethnic conflicts and how and, what is most important, what should not be done. It is now essential to patiently and consistently continue the cause of peacekeeping that has begun, not succumbing to the temptation of simplistic ideas: resolving everything at a stroke or walking away, abandoning everything. Russia's Participation in UN Peacekeeping Operations IKMOON (UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission)--15 military observers; MOONG (UN Mission on Haiti)--five civilian police officers and one civilian specialist have been allocated, but the deployment of the mission has been suspended at this time on account of the situation on Haiti; MOONPR (UN Mission for Assistance to Rwanda)--it is planned sending 15 military observers; MOONPRZS (UN Mission To Observe the Referendum in Western Sahara)--three military observers; ONVUP (UN Body Observing Compliance With the Truce Conditions, Near East)--17 military observers; SOONO (UN Protection Force, former Yugoslavia)--one infantry battalion (831 men, in January 1994, following reinforcement, its manning level will be 1,200), 13 military observers, 40 civilian police officers, two civilian specialists, two motor detachments; YUNOMOZ (UN Operation in Mozambique)--20 military observers (a further six are being sent) and one civilian specialist; YUNOSOM (UN Operation in Somalia)--one civilian specialist.
