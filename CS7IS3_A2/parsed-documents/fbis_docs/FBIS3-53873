['Abbas] We began the Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid together. We also moved together in Washington and in the multilateral talks. Tracks like the Palestinian or Jordanian tracks made more progress than other tracks. Now it is Syria's turn. We believe that achieving positive results in negotiations on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks will lead to a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we consider it [the Geneva summit] a positive and good step toward solving the issue of the occupied Syrian territories. [Mansur] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' had earlier called for excluding the PLO from Arab coordination. Do you think the Clinton-al-Asad summit has invalidated this call? ['Abbas] I do not want to comment on that, but four- or five-track coordination is necessary. Coordinated Arab positions and unity are essential. Consequently, I have no comment on Minister al-Shar's statement. What really concerns me is that the track has succeeded and this is something good for us. [Mansur] How does the PLO view the Palestinian-Syrian relationship following the success of negotiations on the Syrian track? ['Abbas] I think it must be good because both of us are moving in the same direction. The Palestinians might have been accused of moving faster or acting unilaterally, but now that progress has been made, I do not think talk about who advanced or lagged behind is valid any more. Now we all are supposed to think about the future and to have good relations with our brothers in Syria. [Mansur] What can the Palestinian leadership tell the Syrian leadership now that progress has been made on the Syrian track? ['Abbas] The PLO tells the Syrian leadership that what it did was good and we hope this process will continue and lead to full agreement based on complete withdrawal from the Golan and on full withdrawal for full peace. We hope the Syrian brothers will pursue this course until peace is attained. [Mansur] Do you think differences between Syria and the PLO are over and bridges in Syrian-PLO relations can be reestablished? ['Abbas] Bridges between us and Syria have not been broken; they might have been clouded, but not broken. [Mansur] An economic agreement similar to the one signed with Jordan is expected to be signed with Egypt. Does this agreement conflict with the one signed with Jordan? ['Abbas] Absolutely not. We do not accept any contradiction. It will complement the agreement with Jordan. We studied the Egyptian agreement very carefully so that there will be no contradiction or privileges for one at the expense of the other. [Mansur] How far have you gone in studying this agreement? ['Abbas] The Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is ready for signing. [Mansur] The Palestinian-Israeli economic committee meetings in Paris have been postponed until further notice. Why? ['Abbas] They have been postponed for a short period of time pending the results of the Taba talks. We will resume the Paris talks once the results of the Taba talks are known. [Mansur] The U.S. secretary of commerce called on the Arab states to lift the Arab boycott of Israel. How do you view this call? ['Abbas] We said more than once that the Arab boycott is linked to the Arab position. This is an Arab as well as a Palestinian position. Hence, any progress in this regard should be made within an Arab context. [Mansur] Are your differences with President 'Arafat over? Have you settled your differences with him or not? ['Abbas] There are no real differences between us; we are together in one leadership, one institution, one movement, and one organization. However, we, within the framework of this institution, may have differences in opinion. We discuss these opinions and may agree or disagree. This disagreement will not reach the stage of a split. Differences in opinion within the organization do exist. [Mansur] It was reported that there are differences between the PLO and Jordan on Jerusalem. What is the truth behind these differences if indeed they exist? ['Abbas] There are no differences whatsoever on Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a Palestinian Arab land. We, Jordan, and both the Arab and Islamic world demand its return. There are absolutely no differences with the brothers in Jordan over the issue of Jerusalem.
