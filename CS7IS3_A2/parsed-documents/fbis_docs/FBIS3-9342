On the second day of his official visit to Hungary, Dehaene had talks on Monday with leading Magyar political, economic, financial, and social figures. The Belgian prime minister also met with President Arpad Goncz and Assembly President Gyorgy Szabad. At a joint news conference, Dehaene and Boross both stressed that Belgium and Hungary -- which is seeking closer ties with the West -- largely share the same approach to Europe's future. "We support Hungary's role as the driving force" in the process of integrating Central European countries into European structures, a process which must be progressive, stated the Belgian prime minister, who arrived in Hungary on Sunday for a three-day official visit. Boross stressed that Hungary -- one of the first countries to have implemented reforms prior to the collapse of communism -- would need several years in order to attain the level of economic development required for European Union (EU) membership. He added that current reforms had set his country "on the right road" and noted that EU membership would be important for Hungary's security. Dehaene's trip comes less than two months after the entry into force of the Association Treaty between Hungary and the EU. Speaking of the Partnership for Peace -- NATO's initiative to improve cooperation with its former enemies and which Hungary joined on 8 February -- Dehaene confirmed that the implementation of this program should perhaps be speeded up. "Hungary signed the Partnership for Peace to be able to move closer to NATO, which would represent total security for the country," Boross said at the same news conference. Hungary is ready to compromise on the question of national minorities, added Boross, referring to the conference on stability in Europe convened at the proposal of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and to be held in Paris on 26 and 27 May to discuss the situation of minorities. Dehaene is to lunch on Tuesday with the Hungarian secretary of state for minorities. He will also meet representatives from the opposition parties in parliament, namely the SzDSz [Alliance of Free Democrats], the Socialist Party (the former Communist MSZP or Hungarian Socialist Party), and the Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats]. After a sightseeing tour of Budapest, he will return to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon.
