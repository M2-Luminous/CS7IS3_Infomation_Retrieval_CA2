Federal Assembly To Look at Finance Ministry Draft on Tougher Fiscal Policy"] [Text] During the 23 April parliamentary hearings in the Federation Council, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Budget Committee, heard the experts' opinion and proposed that the Finance Ministry's proposal on the complete abolition or considerable reduction of the number of tax privileges be supported. The hearings also made a decision to get the Federal Assembly to examine this draft in September to October 1994. It was proposed to enlist as experts Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee; Vladimir Gusev, head of the tax service; and Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, among others. Participants in the hearings recognized that Russia's tax system is imperfect. Tax service chief Sergey Almazov stated that tax evasion "has taken on a mass nature" and the number of court cases instituted does not reflect its real dimensions. Vladimir Gusev in turn intimated that the nonpayment of taxes into the budget had grown during the first quarter of 1994 by a factor of 1.7 over the corresponding period in 1993. The State Committee for Taxes is planning to discuss this problem at a sitting of its collegium in the second quarter. Aleksandr Bukin, head of the Finance Ministry tax department, was more sanguine. He still expects that the revenue part of the budget will be completed as forecast.
