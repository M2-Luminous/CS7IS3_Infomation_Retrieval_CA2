Afanasyev by Valeriy Natarov; place and date not given: "Concerning the `China Card.' Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arranges the Accents"] [Text] Following the visit to China of A.V. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, interest in the problem of relations with our eastern neighbor has grown sharply. Our correspondent Valeriy Natarov interviewed Ye.V. Afanasyev, first deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Asia-Pacific Region First Department. On Ye.V. Afanasyev's desk is an article by V. Sharov, our Far East correspondent, "The China Card" (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA No. 43, 27 October 1993). And although this material was published at the end of last October, the Russian Foreign Ministry does not deny its relevance today also. There is a multitude of notes in the margins of the article, and individual paragraphs have been highlighted. [Natarov] Yevgeniy Vladimirovich, the article "The China Card" outlines a very gloomy prospect for the Far East--multimillion Chinese masses hovering menacingly over it. Is the Chinese apocalypse impending? [Afanasyev] It was laid on thick, of course, to say no more than that. And the article caught our eye immediately. [Natarov] It achieved its purpose, then? [Afanasyev] In the sense of catching our attention, yes. This article is one of a series of such publications, which have appeared in the past year in the local Far East press also. They purport to show that China's silent expansion is under way and that a vast number of Chinese are illegally penetrating our territory and living there. These articles maintain also that the territories bordering China have been stabbed in the back--government documents that have been signed are, in fact, opening our borders to the uncontrolled entry of Chinese. [Natarov] Could you explain to what documents you refer? [Afanasyev] The history of the matter is as follows. As bilateral contacts expand, there is, naturally, an increase in the number of people's journeys both to Russia and to China. Last year, for example, there were more than 1 million journeys from Russia to China, and from China to Russia, 2 million. And Russians are, perhaps, the most representative group of foreigners in China, what is more. In connection with the further development of contacts, both the center and the territorial authorities concluded that our citizens carrying diplomatic, official, and regular passports stamped "official" would travel to China without visas. Correspondingly, Chinese citizens with similar passports may enter our territory without visas. This procedure is based on interstate agreements, which were coordinated with the leaders of all the Far East oblasts in advance, incidentally. [Natarov] That is, you see a certain distortion in this article: The visa-free conditions were, in fact, introduced with the consent of the local authorities, not in defiance of them? [Afanasyev] Of course. In addition, I would like to refer to the stream of letters addressed to the Foreign Ministry from Siberia and the Far East, which say that the center is being slow to afford opportunities for reciprocal exchanges and that the expansion of free communication should be assisted. I would like to mention also that such a travel category as one-day shopping trips was introduced also on the initiative of the territorial authorities. Our citizens have gone on these trips without visas, on regular general passports, what is more. Chinese have, accordingly, come to us on the same basis. True, it was ascertained after a certain period of time that dishonest people and representatives of mafia structures also have been actively availing themselves of the visa-free conditions. On both our side and the Chinese side. Chinese criminal elements have penetrated Russia, the number of offenses committed by Chinese has grown, and there has been an increase in the number of Chinese who have simply "gone missing" on our territory. [Natarov] This is not, I suppose, a "headache" for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone? [Afanasyev] Doubtless. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles questions of visa practices. The rest is up to the MVD, the special services, the Federal Immigration Service, the leaders of local administrations--from kray through rayon--and to enterprises and organizations with direct relations with China. It is all of them together that create the situation--controlled or uncontrolled. [Natarov] In other words, the local authorities have perfectly sufficient powers for controlling the situation without looking to Moscow here? [Afanasyev] Perfectly correct. In addition, questions connected with the presence of Chinese on our territory--whether for business or other activity--are decided to a considerable extent locally. The premise contained in the article, therefore, to the effect that the center has opened the gates to the uncontrolled entry of Chinese and that this is being combated locally with might and main is fundamentally wrong. Basically, this decision was dictated to the center by a mass of requests from the localities. But the problem about which V. Sharov writes does in fact exist. There are, truly, instances of disgraceful behavior on the part of Chinese on our territory--the examples cited in the article are graphic confirmation of this. But what I personally dislike in the way this problem is presented in "The China Card" article is the fact that these individual cases are attributed to China, that there is allegedly a conscious policy of the Chinese leaders aimed at winning back territory and supplanting the Russians, that is, creeping expansion. We in the Foreign Ministry and in Russia's embassy in China have the impression that it is by no means a question of any long-term, conscious, officially approved strategy. We believe that the issue of China's claims on our vast territory has been settled. [Natarov] The question of the so-called "border equalization" in this connection. Specifically, the article of our correspondent mentions that the local administration is fighting Moscow's decision to unilaterally give China thousands of hectares of land. [Afanasyev] This also is an entirely incorrect proposition, which, unfortunately, is given credence in our border territories, but it is based on two circumstances. The first, an ignorance of the essence of the border issue, which ensues from the secret nature of the negotiations. These negotiations had been conducted for more than 30 years, and the populace was not informed as to their content. The second, the endeavor of certain local political leaders to amass extra points by way of the incitement of nationalist sentiments. The heart of the matter is that the parties agreed to clarify the line of passage of the border--4,300 km. Of these, 3,700 km run along the rivers Ussuri, Amur, and Argun. And here the parties adopted the generally recognized principle of international law--the border runs along the middle of the main channel in rivers that are navigable or along the middle of the river of nonnavigable rivers. That is, Mother Nature herself decides to whom the islands in these rivers belong. I repeat that this is a generally recognized principle of international law. This question was decided according to this principle in tsarist Russia also. The agreement on the eastern section of the border signed in 1991 has been ratified by the parliaments of the two countries. This agreement is already in operation, and any attempts to revise it would lead to confrontation and conflict with China. We know full well to what the unsettled nature of the territorial problem with China led from the history of the 1960's: Remember Damanskiy Island. As far as thousands of hectares of land are concerned, this is absolute rubbish. The borders are being clarified, as a result of which some sections will pass from China to Russia, some, from Russia to China. Representatives of the local authorities also are taking part in the demarcation work, naturally. [Natarov] Let us return to the problem of illegal penetration of our territory. What are the ways of resolving it? [Afanasyev] There is a problem of illegal residence and penetration. In some communities, considering the sparse population of our areas, there are more Chinese than Russian citizens. In these cases, specific measures need to be adopted--in conjunction with the central authorities, the local authorities, and various departments. And such measures are being adopted, incidentally. This matter was raised in the course of A.V. Kozyrev's recent visit to Beijing, and the Chinese side expressed understanding of this problem; more, the Chinese representatives were concerned to ensure that the impressions gained from the actions of individual Chinese offenders not be transferred in the minds of Russian people to China as a whole. Two agreements on visa travel, which tighten control of border crossing, have been in effect since 29 January. Thus, travel on regular passports with the "official" stamp has been abolished--and a multitude of trips with such passports had been made on both our side and the Chinese side--and visa conditions for all travel other than group tourist travel are being introduced. Special tourist companies--there are five of them currently in the Far East--which will draw up the papers for visa-free tourist travel to China, have been distinguished. I would like to emphasize that all these questions are being tackled on a reciprocal basis. It is the bilateral nature of the resolution of Russian-Chinese problems that I would like to emphasize. The article "The China Card" is guilty of a one-sidedness of consideration of the problem. After all, it is perfectly obvious that if we restrict the entry of Chinese, we have a right to expect the same actions of the Chinese authorities. [Natarov] Is there any information on the response to the publication "The China Card" in China itself? [Afanasyev] Yes, this article was noticed in China. I will tell you that in unofficial conversations Chinese have told me that they were wondering whether or not to start a polemic with us, that is, who are worse: the Chinese in Russia or the Russians in China. [Natarov] They have no less of a bill? [Afanasyev] Yes. But ultimately the Chinese decided to refrain. They are of the opinion that the start of a public argument on these matters would have an extremely negative effect on our bilateral relations. There is much evidence, incidentally, of disgraceful and criminal behavior of our citizens in China, and were the Chinese to judge the whole Russian people by these cases, no good would come of this. To sum up, a calm, realistic approach to this problem is needed. We need to take a look at it and need to think how to resolve it, but there should under no circumstances be exaggerations in the direction of charges against China and the Chinese people as a whole, their being ascribed sinister intentions of expansion into Russia. This problem can be resolved perfectly easily by way of order being brought to bear within our country and the regulation of the rules of foreigners' residence, with regard to the new realities. The law enforcement authorities of Russia and China should cooperate actively, and there are examples of this. In short, under no circumstances must we once again erect along our border with China a "Wall of China" and estrange our countries and peoples. A prudent combination of freedom, communication, movement, trade and other relations, and the most elementary order determined by the border regime, are needed. This is entirely within the capabilities of good neighbors--Russia and China.
