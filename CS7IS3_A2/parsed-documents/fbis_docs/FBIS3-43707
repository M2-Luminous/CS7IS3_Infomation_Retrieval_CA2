IFP spokesman Senzo Mfayela said joint policing by the kwaZulu police and the South African Police was the result of bilateral understandings between the two forces -- not as a result of TEC instructions. He said there had been no visible decline in violence in flashpoint areas policed exclusively by the SAP in Natal. Mr Mfayela said it was ironic that the TEC favoured the intervention of the ISD in kwaZulu areas where the ANC [African National Congress] had little following, while the ANC simultaneously campaigned for the ISD's withdrawal from areas it believed it had a chance of dominating.
