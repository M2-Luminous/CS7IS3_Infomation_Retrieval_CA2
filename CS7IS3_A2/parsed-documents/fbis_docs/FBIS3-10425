Peligre is closed for repairs. That is all we were able to ascertain. No answer was given to what kind of repairs, the cost of those repairs, or the duration of those repairs since the general manager continues to hide behind a great wall of silence. He has perhaps chosen not to speak with the press because our calls remain unanswered. Jean Max Blanc tries to find some explanations in the following report: [Begin recording, in Creole] The problem of electricity in Haiti is not going to be solved by the end of the week or within a few days. Currently, the authorities of Electricity of Haiti [EDH] have closed the Peligre power station, which supplies power to the West Department. A high-ranking employee in the company told Radio Metropole that the authorities made such a decision in order to repair the Peligre station. However, this employee is not able to tell us how long those repairs will take, how much they will cost, or how much damage there is in the station. Some say the damages are not inconsequential in the Peligre station. The management EDH will not confirm this information. The general manager, Axel Saint-Dic, never agreed to receive journalists and even refused to answer phone calls. Manager Saint-Dic, according to his secretary, is in meetings everyday. Perhaps Saint-Dic is seeking solutions to the electricity problem the country has been facing since 1990. Although this problem is not new, it reached a new level some time ago. For instance, some neighborhoods do not have electricity at all, while others receive some electricity once or twice a week. Regardless of who comments on that problem, the answers are basically the same. [passage omitted] The electricity problem in the country not only increases the prices of products, but also creates a change in lifestyle for Haitians. The problem of electricity is now closely linked to the problem of fuel. Some business people say those problems have caused the decrease in sales, and the prices of freezer products have increased. They explain that the greater the stock of products requiring refrigeration, the more fuel the generators need to operate. The result is that the consumers pay those costs while their purchase power is at a standstill. The other problem is that since the consumers cannot stock at home, they are obliged to spend more on gasoline to market everyday. [passage omitted] If people are more or less informed on the fluctuating price of gasoline, no one knows when Haitians will no longer have to face this electricity dilemma in the country. While still waiting for the EDH general manager, Axel Saint-Dic, to answer questions regarding the importance and duration of the work to be done in Peligre, most of the neighborhoods in Port-au- Prince are blacked out, while others enjoy electricity 24 hours a day. Some residents explain that in addition to these problems, some people steal their transformers. The daily blackout encourages much negative behaivior, which is being reported in Port-au-Prince.
