It was a breath-taking sight and...a disturbing one: Foreign words blazed audaciously in neon lights on Novyy Arbat. Viktor Ilyich sighed with regret: "It is like a foreign city...." It had been a hard day: The Duma had been discussing the draft budget, and during the breaks he had spoken with representatives of different religions, given statements to reporters, and worked on his speech for the upcoming party conference. He did not refuse the interview, however, because Viktor Ilyich had once seen a thick pile of letters from readers on the editor's desk and made this request after reading some of them: "Give them to me, and I will answer them personally and through PRAVDA." This man, a structural engineer by profession and a party worker by vocation, a people's deputy of the Supreme Soviet and a deputy of the State Duma by civic duty--what did he see in these letters? "I wanted to communicate with the authors, to explain some things, and to argue about others. In the past there was not enough time to read letters, and this was not even part of our routine--we only responded to official requests from superior party and soviet organs regarding 'complaints filed by workers,'" he said with an ironic grin. [Nikiforova] Viktor Ilyich, what was it about the letters that interested you? [Zorkaltsev] In the letters and in conversations with people, I keep hearing the same question: "When you communists are back in charge of the government, will you put everything back the way it was?" I want to say frankly and sincerely that the communists will not be back in charge of the government. This is not our goal. The objective of the Communist Party is to put the workers in charge--the segment of the laboring public that shares the ideals of socialist construction. Furthermore, if we do establish government by the people (and not government by the party!), we will not put anything back the way it was. We will move ahead. [Nikiforova] Then the readers--or, more precisely, some readers--want to know if it is true that the RF Communist Party is in favor of reform. [Zorkaltsev] Yes, it is. The need for reform is self-evident. Here is what Mikhail Ivanovich Kozhin from Krasnodar Kray says in his letter: "Although I still support socialism and have retained my communist convictions, I will refrain from rejoining the RF Communist Party because I did not agree with the socialism we had even in the 1950s." That is the opinion of a man who does not deny the need for reform, but we cannot see any kind of reform in our country today! What we see is an artificial situation in which people are being forced to cross a river and are being promised that life is better over there. But the river is turbulent, the water is cold, the elderly are drowning, the children are sick, and the women are crying. Meanwhile, others are urging them on, forcing them to swim faster, to their death. If we are going to cross a river, we have to begin by finding out how deep it is and how swift the current is, collecting life preservers, and then calmly starting the journey, all of us at the same time. Have you heard what kind of budget we are approving? It is the most anti-reform document possible! We have heard that the reformers want to build capitalism (an absurd idea in itself, because Russia was not destined to master it at once), but why then does the budget allocate only 17.5 billion rubles for the promotion of business and commercial enterprise, 249 billion for the development of family farms, and 3.78 trillion for the administrative bureaucracy? [Nikiforova] It is probably no coincidence that the idea of the agreement on civic accord came up, and with such a close deadline--28 April. Anatoliy Ivanovich Shorokhov from Krasnoyarsk Kray is extremely critical of this idea: "Before the elections they tried to frighten us with the threat of civil war if we did not approve the draft constitution. Now there is suddenly a need for this agreement as well. Is the Constitution no longer enough? Could this be another trick: to prevent the opposition from voicing any objections and then calmly declare a state of emergency?" What would you tell him? [Zorkaltsev] The accord is actually necessary for the avoidance of a state of emergency. It is true that this could be achieved by constitutional means, but the government and the president have to take some substantive steps now. [Nikiforova] What kind of steps? [Zorkaltsev] First they have to pay people their back wages. What kind of accord can we have when people are not getting enough money to cover their living expenses for four or five months at a time? The second thing is to make cost-of-living adjustments in pensions. The third is to return everything they seized in January 1992. Then they can perfect the tax system and leave it in place for the next 5 or 10 years. After all of this has been done, we can begin to consider signing the document. And there will be no deadline of 28 April! [Nikiforova] Is that your personal opinion? [Zorkaltsev] Yes. I expressed it at a faction meeting, but the final decision on signing should be made by the administrative bodies of political forces. We can only sign the agreement after the decision has been made by the all-Russian conference. [Nikiforova] On your own terms? [Zorkaltsev] If a two-year moratorium on political stability is declared, the Mausoleum of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin will have to be reopened, and the memorials by the Kremlin wall and Vladimir Ilyich's office and home must be inviolate. The expenses of the Lenin Museum must be included in the budget and financed completely. The blacklist of deputies who defended the Constitution in the Palace of Soviets must be voided. The economic conditions are set forth in the Premises of the Communist Party Program, "From Crisis to Stable Development, Sovereignty of the People, and Socialism." [Nikiforova] The general response to the document was favorable. Here is what I. Gobozov from Moscow writes: "The 'Premises' advocate national accord, which offers indisputable confirmation of the fact that the communists, contrary to the common views of their opponents, are not calling for class warfare. We must not forget, however, that 'people in palaces do not have the same views as people in huts.'" [Zorkaltsev] And that the "hut-dwellers" will want to cross swords with the "palace-dwellers" at some point. That is why a political party hoping to lead the "hut-dwellers" must not forget Feuerbach's warning.... Incidentally, the "Premises" were drafted by party workers, and not by elitist academicians from the party. I know that the document is being criticized by the Right and the Left, and this is a good thing: It means that we will be able to chart the right course. One thing that is disturbing, however, is that both sides are quoting V.I. Lenin! They criticized us for agreeing to the elections, for example, saying that this was not a Leninist move. Lenin, they say, would have been against this, but they have not even read Lenin's works! Obviously, our party can be criticized for some things. My comrades in the leadership and I can see its flaws, but people are still joining it. I recently attended the Khoroshevskiy Rayon Conference in Moscow, where three people were issued membership cards. One was 46 years old, joining in the prime of his life, but the other two were quite young. This means they put their trust in the Communist Party! [Nikiforova] While we are on the subject, here is something we were told by Arseniy Chanyshev, an instructor at Moscow State University. Twenty years ago he was not allowed to go into science because of some poems he had written against the communists (saying he would rather go to hell than live among them), but now he sees so many people who have "gone to hell." He writes with concern about the "lost generation of perestroyka." He is looking to the communists for solutions and salvation: "Only the communists have an accurate view of Russia's present tragic situation and can analyze it from the standpoint of science and class (and ours is now a class-antagonistic society), and only they can save Russia." But the Communist Party still has to analyze its own policies more thoroughly. Many communists feel that the tragic changes in the party were the result of the betrayal of the upper echelon and the leaders. Do you agree? [Zorkaltsev] This is an obvious mistake, and when people say that we will revive the CPSU and that this will guarantee the restoration of the Soviet Union, this is an even bigger mistake. The CPSU caused the Soviet Union to collapse and then destroyed itself. The CPSU was unable to offer the society a new model of development. Strong productive forces came into conflict with production relations, and the party, which had already grown fat and lazy on materialistic gratification, did not notice this. It had lost its fighting strength and could not lead the society. The CPSU got soft when there were no other parties competing with it, but now there are only 600,000 of us and we won the election. In 1989 there were 9 million communists in Russia and we lost. We now hold 10 percent of the seats in the Duma, and we can have the final say on some matters. We plan to implement the economic part of our program there. In the Supreme Soviet, 85 percent of the deputies were communists, and what was the result? When they say that Yeltsin suspended the activities of the CPSU and banned the party, this is a lie. Deputies voted for the suspension at the USSR Congress of People's Deputies, attended by all of the former obkom first secretaries and members of the Central Committee. Dissident Roy Medvedev walked up to the microphone and was the only one to object. Why did the 170 obkom first secretaries and Central Committee members remain silent? Why did the Central Committee itself remain silent? Yeltsin did not sign his edicts until after all of this. They were based on the decision of the USSR Congress of People's Deputies! Here is another fact. When the Belovizh bargain was being concluded, the communists did not defend the results of the 17 March 1991 referendum. In the auditorium where the treaty was ratified, a few of us felt as if we were sitting in a well. Communists all around us stood and applauded. There was still time to correct everything then. Just imagine this: Political instructor Klochkov rises to lead the people in battle, and at that time he is "suspended"! He is no longer a political instructor.... [Nikiforova] The letters contain extremely vehement criticism of the bureaucratic party. Do you agree? [Zorkaltsev] It hurts me when people say that about the CPSU. The party promoted and always will promote career personnel. It could not exist without them, and the present fight with the party bureaucracy is a carefully orchestrated performance. Few of the readers were in the party with us. At one time the most mature and politically knowledgeable promoters of the communist ideal had to leave the party. The new people, although there were many intelligent and outstanding organizers among them, were confronted by an experienced and insidious political opponent--and were defeated. I have spent my whole adult life working for the party. I never knew (or was it just luck?) any hoarders, money-grubbers, or hypocrites. They were all people who were devoted to the ideal and the cause and they did the work in response to their conscience, and not for money. [Nikiforova] Yes, but will you agree that the party has aged? [Zorkaltsev] I often hear that only old people come to party meetings, and I reply that these are the most steadfast supporters of the communist ideal. As long as they are still here, there is a chance to prepare replacements for them. In Khoroshevskiy Rayon I was fascinated by Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Mikhail Pavlovich Shendrik. He is an elderly man with a great mind and a colossal memory. He is the true ideologist of that party organization. [Nikiforova] Incidentally, I saw that organization's campaign leaflets. They were explicit, clear, and precise. Everyone should have a chance to read them.... [Zorkaltsev] This is a vivid example of a job done by professionals. This means that the party is safe and is coming around the perilous bend. Each day it has to defend itself. First it is criticized by PRAVDA, then by LEVAYA GAZETA, and then even by the people attending a party conference. I once gave a speech in the Taman Division Officers Club. I was asked why I had never come before. Without thinking, I replied that they had their own deputy. When the meeting was over, a communist who had been in the party for 40 years came up to me and reprimanded me: "Why did you say that you are not our deputy? We voted for the Communist Party ticket and I campaigned for you." [Nikiforova] Do you have any complaints about PRAVDA? [Zorkaltsev] I like PRAVDA, but there is something I have to say. I was offended to read two articles in a row that were essentially an indictment of the Russian Orthodox Church. One was written by Rutskoy's assistant, and the other was written by Rutskoy himself. The Orthodox Church and its hierarchy were blamed directly or indirectly in one of them for the events of 3-4 October. I think this was a result of political nearsightedness rather than malice. I am an atheist, but there are certain times in politics when everything that is genuinely Russian has to be protected. Our ancient traditional religions need support. In the years of Soviet power many church leaders were awarded the highest honors of their Motherland. Everyone knows how helpful the church was during the Great Patriotic War and the postwar years. As far as the tragic events are concerned, it seems to me that Khasbulatov did not have enough staying power, and that a cursory reading of Ilyin and Berdyayev could not make Rutskoy a profound man.... [Nikiforova] Viktor Ilyich, many communists are disturbed by the prospect of unification in the SCP-CPSU. The Moscow organization was actually split by different views on this matter. Some of the letters accuse the RF Communist Party leadership of not joining the SCP-CPSU because they have degenerated and are drifting toward social democracy. [Zorkaltsev] I do not agree with the line of the SCP-CPSU leadership. Think back on what they have accomplished in a year and a half of existence. They held a congress of peoples of the USSR, but they turned the grand and difficult task of uniting the country into a slogan. What contributed to the quick establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922? Russia was like a beacon to the outlying regions. They were attracted by the revolution that had triumphed and was defending itself, by the grand-scale construction, by the progressive ideology, and by the strong intelligentsia. The backward outlying regions were drawn to Russia. Recently, however, when Russia relinquished all of those same regions and was in a state of poverty, they all turned away from it and the parade of sovereignties began. Can they live alone for long? Time will tell, and it has already told us in some cases.... But we cannot establish a new union until Russia recovers its appeal. We have to build a powerful Russia and build a strong Communist Party. Then it will be joined by other communist parties in our Fatherland, and we will all work together to build a single state. This is why the work against the RF Communist Party, which split the party, is work against the communist movement and the whole leftist movement. I cannot bear this. That is why I feel that we should join the SCP-CPSU soon. Then it will be easier to reach an agreement with other parties. In the first place, communists are collectivists and internationalists. In the second place, now that there are several communist parties, they should unite, because this is not the time for dissension. The slow integration of the Fatherland is beginning. Regrettably, it was not initiated by leftist forces. Oddly enough, it is being promoted by the power structure. Everyone criticizes V. Chernomyrdin, but his integration on the basis of property exchanges has proved to be a sound process. Then there is the creation of the ruble zone, which also, to our regret, was initiated not by us, but by the premier. You remember how the leaders of the six republics met in Tashkent and had already reached an agreement on the ruble zone when Christopher suddenly arrived, made his tour, and annihilated the plan in its infancy. It was a good thing that Belarus held out. If the communist parties had acted decisively and boldly, the republics might have held out. Yes, it is true that the Communist Party does not agree with this government's reforms, and we do criticize it, but we do support this particular government move. We do not like Yeltsin, but we support his position on the creation of the ruble zone. Our voters and the supporters and allies of the RF Communist Party should know this. [Nikiforova] Incidentally, how would political instructor Klochkov respond today to these comments by R. Kosourov, secretary of an RCWP [Russian Communist Workers' Party] rayon organization from Ryazan Oblast? "The team in charge today and the whole bourgeois upper echelon will not give up their power to the workers without a fight. That is why the working class, as capitalism's grave-digger, and the peasantry, its loyal ally in the struggle for class interests, need a party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and capable of leading them to victory, and not accord or a government of national accord. The slogan 'Proletarians of all nations, unite!' is not obsolete." [Zorkaltsev] The working class.... It might be more accurate to say the labor collective. Today it is impossible to distinguish the worker from the engineer or the foreman. There is no question that the slogan "Proletarians of all nations, unite!" is right, but can we realize it today? Did the workers on the Ford assembly line, for instance, support the workers of the Lenin Vehicle Plant? I have not heard, but I know that this would not be convenient for the Ford workers. After all, they now earn a fairly high wage, and partly because of the low wages workers earn in other countries. The attempt to move too far ahead in ideology and the party's objectives led to the events of 3-4 October. I think political instructor Klochkov would spare the people for now. He would advise study and training. We must remember that the Great October Socialist Revolution triumphed because it was not a plot by a small group of people or a coup by members of the upper echelon, but a great popular movement.
