"The course towards reforms, financial stabilisation and economic restructuring remains the backbone of the Russian economic policy", Chernomyrdin told a meeting of the governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which opened in the second biggest Russian city on Monday. He recalled that in the first quarter of 1994 inflation was below the 10 per cent level and predicted it would be further curtailed to monthly 7-8 per cent by the end of the year "if the planned parametres of the budget are preserved". The Russian State Duma gave an outline approval to the draft budget, but demanded that the government introduces certain corrections to it.
