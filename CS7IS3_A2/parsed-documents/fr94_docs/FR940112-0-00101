Removal of Burn Compound From First-Aid Kits; Final Rule Federal Register / Vol. 59, No. 8 / Wednesday, January 12, 1994 / Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 121, 125, 135 [Docket No. 25154; Amendment No. 121&hyph;236; 125&hyph;19; 135&hyph;47] Removal of Burn Compound From First-Aid Kits AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comment. SUMMARY: This amendment revises the regulations concerning first aid kits required on board air carrier, air taxi, and commercial aircraft to remove the burn compound from the list of items required for the kits. This amendment responds to a petition from Air Transport Association, supported by the American Red Cross, that the burn compound be removed from the kits since the use of ice or cold water is the preferred treatment for minor burns. This amendment will relieve affected operators from the expense of having to periodically replace an item in the first aid kits that is not needed. DATES: Effective date: January 12, 1994. Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 5, 1986, the Air Transport Association (ATA) submitted a petition to delete burn compound (burn ointment) from the first-aid kits required to be carried on each aircraft operated under part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. In the petition ATA noted that the application of ice or cold water is the preferred treatment for minor burns. As part of its supporting data, the petition included a request from Western Airlines to delete burn ointment from their first aid kits. Also included in the petition were copies of instructions from flight manuals for several other airlines in which flight attendants were advised to use ice compresses for the treatment of burns and not to use the burn ointment unless it is requested by the passenger. In addition, ATA stated that burn ointment normally has an expiration date, which requires replacement, inspection, and record-keeping. On January 21, 1987, ATA submitted a second letter to the docket that transmitted an American Red Cross statement confirming their position that burn ointment retains heat within the wound, causing the wound to actually worsen in some cases. In addition, information provided by the Red Cross indicated that burn ointment must be removed before any other treatment can be applied. ATA submitted additional information on April 9, 1987, in which it cited the March 1987 ATA Cabin Safety Panel meeting where the subject of first-aid for minor burns was discussed. At that meeting, each panel member present stated that their flight attendants were trained to use cold water or ice rather than burn ointment, unless burn ointment was specifically requested by the passenger. Representatives of most of the major airlines were included in this group, constituting over 80 percent of all the seat miles flown by the major airlines. By letter dated July 6, 1987, ATA submitted a comment from the School of Nursing at the University of Miami as an additional medical opinion. That letter, from an associate professor, stated that emergency care for burns should begin with stopping the burning process by applying cool water to stop the pain and slow the process of heat damage. This medical opinion also noted that application of ointments, oils, etc., should be avoided.
