Millions of Russian families have remained in cramped, dilapidated, damaged housing. Does the Russian Government intend to provide support for the disadvantaged, who are not in a position to spend millions to improve their housing conditions? As we know, the new constitution of the Russian Federation grants only our right to have a roof over our heads instead of the traditional state "guarantee" of housing for all of us. And achieving this now depends only on the individual himself, or more more precisely, on his wallet. And that is sad. Half of our society is made up of persons unable to work (pensioners, young people, the disabled, and children), who receive fixed allowances, compensatory payments, and stipends which are far below the subsistence minimum. It is clear that the market in the housing field means they are completely deprived of civil rights and even further dependent on the local budget. But if we are reminded that there is never any money in the budget as it is, it is not at all clear how the new order for providing social housing will function. The state of affairs with respect to provision of housing for the 60 million able-bodied citizens is even less clear. The most pressing question is: will the state's "housing debt" be paid to them? After all, the line in which over 10 million families have "stood" for many years has completely lost its outlines (vague as they were). And the mechanism for ordinary employees of "ordinary" enterprises to purchase housing on the market is completely inaccessible. In the transition to the market, the housing problem is just as severe as the wage and employment problems. However, the latter have counterparts in the economy of Western countries, but the housing problem has the features of a purely Soviet phenomenon. In this connection, I believe we need to single out several key factors and define them more specifically in a new housing policy. Unless the reformers want restructuring of the housing field to become an additional catalyst for social instability, of course... First of all, in defining the overall economic mechanism for stabilization, we cannot overlook the gradual expansion of housing construction. Naturally, this is possible only with wide-scale state protectionism. Secondly, we need to maintain state levers for regulating the housing market. A policy of "shock" privatization of housing facilities is unacceptable. And thirdly, discontinuation of state subsidies for housing and payment for communal services should take place together with an appropriate review of the tax system and a change in the structure of a minimum consumer budget. I would like to discuss these key problms in a little more detail. The average housing per citizen is 16 square meters of total space, which is somewhat less than that stipulated by the Housing Code of the RSFSR--18 square meters. The housing problem in Russia is burdened by the fact that more than 30 million square meters of housing are located in dilapidated and damaged structures. With the volumes of construction being forecast, it is not hard to draw the conclusion that there are no prospects for improvement in the situation. The shock increase of 100 times the cost of housing and everyday services outlined by the government program deprives persons on the waiting list of the opportunity to acquire an apartment under the conditions stipulated by the RSFSR Law "On privatization of available housing in the RSFSR." Most of the people simply will not have the funds needed to purchase housing over the next 10 years. There has been a decline in the volume of financing for housing construction from all sources. The government has practically relieved itself of this unpleasant business. The situation that has taken shape has paralyzed movement of the line for improved housing conditions, first of all. The FITUR's proposals to conclude a General Agreement on Additional Commitments for Housing Construction have not been supported in the Russian Federation Government and were not put into a document. The situation with respect to development of house-building cooperatives and individual builders is no better. There has been three times as much recession here. In the economic sitation that has taken shape, shifting the concern about housing to the people's shoulders will not be able to stimulate new construction over the next 10 years, since the population has a single problem--survival. A new source of financing for housing construction has made its appearance over the past 2 years--so-called commercial and shareholding organizations. It is being practically doubled each year, but its proportion, as before, is not high (25 to 30 percent). As of the beginning of this year, 10 million families were on the waiting list to receive housing. Almost one-third of them are living in communal apartments, dormitory facilities, and dilapidated and damaged structures; many have been waiting to receive housing for over 10 years. With the existing level of housing provided for the public and the condition of the economy, we cannot manage without direct assistance from the state budget and other centralized sources. The housing market being formed under government supervision has become a factor in the workers' deteriorating housing conditions and has sharply stepped up both economic and social tension. I think that housing reform should be coordinated without delay with all elements of social policy (primarily with the policy of incomes and the living standard, and with the employment policy and directed social support for disadvantaged citizens) and subordinated to the goals of providing for the priority constitutional rights of the individual--to housing and property and a fitting standard of living. But the current housing policy is openly subordinated to a single, purely economic interest--relieving the state budget of what is left of elementary social guarantees.
