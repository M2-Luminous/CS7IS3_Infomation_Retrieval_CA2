The United Nations Security Council last week called on North Korea to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities -- which it has so far refused. Ray told Nine Network Australia that North Korea, suspected of developing nuclear weapons, was the most serious flashpoint in the world and he predicted the crisis would drag on for several months. "The Koreans have given a variety of assurances with regard to their nuclear program, yet they will not allow proper inspection of those processes," Ray said. "Allied with the fact that they are trying to develop ballistic missiles, that is a very dangerous mix for countries such as Japan and South Korea." He said North Korea had a very strong and competent standing army and would be a far more dangerous opponent than Iraq had been against the United States in the Gulf War. "But one hopes it won't get to that situation, I doubt it will," Ray said, adding that China would have a key role in pressing North Korea to change its stand. Asked whether Australian troops would become involved engaged if hostilties broke out between North Korea and its neighbours, Ray said "That depends on the circumstances at the time and it is a very hypothetical question. "I have been asked it a few times in the past. I just won't answer it at this stage." Ray said a conflict in the region had implications for Australia's security and economic interests, as "Japan and Korea are two of our biggest trading partners and they would be inevitably involved in any conflict in this particular region." Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans expressed optimism after meeting Chinese leaders in Beijing on Saturday that China would not block efforts to impose sanctions on North Korea if talks on the nuclear crisis broke down.
