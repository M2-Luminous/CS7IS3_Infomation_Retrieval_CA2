December 12 Union is led by Former Vice- Premier and Finance Minister of the Russian Federation Boris Fedorov. "We used to vote in the same way in the State Duma without previous discussion, but it would be very useful to work out a certain mechanism for coordination of positions on the most important issues," Zolotukhin pointed out. He believes that regular meetings of these deputy groups could become such a mechanism for coordination of actions prior to taking important decisions in the Duma. Asked by IF's correspondent, Zolotukhin said that similar talks with leaders of the Yavlinskiy faction were in their preliminary stages. Interfax learned that Russia's Choice will be represented by Boris Zolotukhin, the Yavlinskiy bloc Viktor Sheynis and December 12 Union by Boris Zamay. A final decision on the issue will be taken by Russia's Choice at its meeting on April 7.
