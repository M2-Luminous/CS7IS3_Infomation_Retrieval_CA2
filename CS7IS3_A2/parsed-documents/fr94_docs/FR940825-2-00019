FR940825-2-00019 FR940825-2-00012 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Docket No. 940826&hyph;4226] [I.D. 071294B] Atlantic Swordfish Catches by Minor Harvesting Nations; Possible Restrictions on Imports AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS has been asked to conduct an investigation with respect to invoking restrictions on swordfish imports under the provisions of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA or the Convention). This document provides background information concerning this request and solicits comments to be considered in the NMFS investigation of the issue. DATES: Comments must be received by September 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be directed to: Dr. Kevin Chu, Office of International Affairs, Room 14247, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin Chu at (301) 713-2276 or Richard Stone at (301) 713&hyph;2347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Blue Water Fishermen's Association asked NMFS to conduct an investigation with respect to invoking restrictions on swordfish imports under the provisions of the ATCA. The request expressed concern about fisheries developing in Canada, as well as in the Caribbean and Latin America. It included information showing a 37&hyph;percent decline in U.S. catches from 1988 to 1992 and a 72&hyph;percent increase in Canadian landings during the same period. The request also expressed a concern that Canadian vessels were apparently expanding operations into tropical regions and Bermuda. It expressed the belief that NMFS should conclude that the apparent absence of effective Canadian regulations to control harvest (fishing mortality) has undermined the effectiveness of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT or the Commission) swordfish management program and has jeopardized what was predicted as a reasonable probability of a stock increase based on the 1992 swordfish stock assessment by ICCAT. In response to the request, NMFS has undertaken an investigation pursuant to the ATCA, which could lead to the prohibition of swordfish imports from certain countries. As part of this investigation, NMFS has had a series of formal and informal exchanges with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Canada on swordfish catches and on Canadian vessels fishing outside its exclusive economic zone. NMFS also has conducted a series of investigations about Canadian-harvested tuna shipped through Bermuda and has collated import data from a number of countries fishing for swordfish in the Atlantic. This notice explains the legal basis for the investigation, provides background information, and seeks additional information. Regulations Implementing the ATCA Regulations implementing the ATCA are published at 50 CFR 285, subpart D. They direct NOAA, with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to prohibit: (1) The entry into the United States of fish in any form of those species which are subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of the ICCAT and which were taken from the ICCAT regulatory area ``in such manner or in such circumstances as would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of the Commission''; and (2) the entry into the United States, from any country when vessels of such country are being used in the conduct of fishing operations in the regulatory area in such manner or in such circumstances as would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of ICCAT, of fish in any form of those species which are subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of the Commission and which were taken from the ICCAT regulatory area. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) is required to make inquiries and investigations, from time to time, so as to keep informed of the nature and effectiveness of the measures for the implementation of the Commission's recommendations concerning those activities which are being carried out by foreign countries whose vessels engage in fishing within the ICCAT regulatory area. The AA also must undertake an investigation when a member of the public submits a proper request. There are three related issues that the AA must consider: 1. Whether fish in any form are being taken in a manner or under such circumstances that would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of ICCAT, 2. Whether a country is condoning the use of vessels in the conduct of fishing operations in the ICCAT regulatory area in such a manner or under such circumstances that would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of ICCAT, or 3. Whether a country is condoning the use of vessels in repeated and flagrant fishing operations which seriously threaten the achievement of the objectives of the ICCAT recommendations. In conducting the investigation, the AA is to take into account, among other considerations as may be pertinent: 1. Whether the country provides to ICCAT pertinent statistics on a timely basis; 2. Whether the country has in force conservation measures applicable to its own fishermen adequate for the implementation of the Commission's recommendations; 3. Whether the country has in force measures for the control of landing in its ports of species subject to regulations which are taken in the ICCAT regulatory area by fishermen of other countries contrary to the ICCAT conservation recommendations; 4. Whether the country, having put conservation measures into effect, takes reasonable action to enforce such measures; 5. The number of vessels of the country which conduct fishing operations in the ICCAT regulatory area; and 6. The quantity of species subject to regulation taken from the regulatory area by the country's vessels contrary to the ICCAT conservation recommendations and its relationship to: (A) The total quantity permitted to be taken by the vessels of all countries participating in the fishery; and (B) the quantity of such species sought to be restored to the stocks of fish pursuant to the Commission's conservation recommendations. ICCAT Recommendations In 1990, ICCAT recognized that swordfish yields were not sustainable and that fishing mortality needed to be reduced. As a result, six management recommendations were approved. First, mortality on fish weighing more than 25 kg was to be reduced 15&hyph;percent from recent levels, using 1988 as a base year. Mortality reductions could be made by reducing catch or by reducing equivalent effort. Second, taking and landing of fish smaller than 25 kg was prohibited. Tolerances were allowed for incidental small fish catches, provided that small fish do not exceed 15&hyph;percent of the total number of fish per boat landing. Third, all countries directly fishing for swordfish were to limit fishing mortality to 1988 catch levels or to an equivalent level of effort. Fourth, notwithstanding the first and third recommendations, countries with small catches were to keep annual catches at ``reasonable levels'' and abide by all conservation measures on small fish. (This provision applies to Canada, but not to the United States.) Fifth, countries not targeting swordfish were to limit incidental catch to not more than 10&hyph;percent by weight of the total catch. Sixth, ICCAT was to encourage cooperation by non-ICCAT members in achieving the conservation goals of the ICCAT recommendations. The Report of the 1990 ICCAT meeting shows that there was considerable discussion of what would constitute ``reasonable levels,'' as that term was used in the fourth recommendation, but that term was never specifically defined in the recommendation itself. Based upon that discussion, the United States understood the term to refer to an allowed increase in total country catch of up to 45&hyph;percent from its 1988 catch levels. When the United States introduced the fourth recommendation dealing with countries with small catches, Portugal supported the proposed wording, since the total impact of allowing the countries with smaller catches to increase by 45&hyph;percent would be far less than the bycatch taken at that time and which would be permissible to countries that take swordfish as a bycatch. Canada supported the position of Portugal. In 1992, ICCAT's swordfish panel recommended that all nations fishing for Atlantic swordfish restrict 1993&hyph;94 catch levels or fishing capacity to recent levels (i.e., 1990&hyph;91). The panel also recommended that the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) assess the impact of conservation measures on the stock at the 1994 meeting. Fishing Records No country filed an objection to either the 1990 or 1992 recommendations; thus, the recommendations have come into force. As a result of the U.S. regulations implementing the ICCAT recommendations, U.S. landings have dropped rapidly from an all-time high of 6,385 metric tons (mt) in 1989 to the following levels for 1990&hyph;93, respectively: 5,494 mt, 4,255 mt, 3,833 mt, and 2,584 mt. (The 1993 figure is preliminary.) This is a 60&hyph;percent reduction in catch in 4 years. In terms of the 1990 ICCAT recommendation setting the small fish tolerance level at 15&hyph;percent by number, the percentage and number of small fish landed also have decreased annually and, for the period 1989&hyph;92, were 37.7&hyph;percent (65,712 small fish from a total catch of 174,271), 32.5&hyph;percent (46,381 small fish from a total catch of 142,847), 21.8&hyph;percent (21,391 small fish from a total catch of 98,306), and 7&hyph;percent (5,417 small fish from a total catch of 77,487), respectively. Effort has decreased as well. The number of vessels that actually have fished has dropped 25&hyph;percent from 457 to 334. Canadian landings have shown an opposite trend. From 1985&hyph;89, annual Canadian catches were 585 mt, 1,059 mt, 954 mt, 898 mt, and 1,247 mt, respectively_well below Canada's self-determined quota of 3,500 mt for those years. In response to the 1990 ICCAT recommendations for swordfish, Canada reduced its self-determined quota to 2,000 mt. Since then, Canadian harvests of swordfish have rapidly increased from 991 mt in 1990, 1,026 mt in 1991, 1,547 mt in 1992, to approximately 2,322 mt in 1993. This is a 134&hyph;percent increase in landings. Prior to 1992, the last year that Canadian catches exceeded 1,500 mt was in 1980. The percentage and number of small fish landed have fluctuated annually, and, for the period 1989&hyph;92, were 16.4&hyph;percent (3,445 small fish from a total catch of 20,980), 10.7&hyph;percent (1,445 small fish from a total catch of 13,525), 11.4&hyph;percent (1,824 small fish from a total catch of 15,988), and 15.5&hyph;percent (4,092 small fish from a total catch of 26,465), respectively. (Canada's 1993 small catch data was not available at the time of printing.) Since Canada harvested 898 mt in 1988, a 45&hyph;percent increase would have been to 1,302 mt. However, Canada's current quota of 2,000 mt is an increase of over 120&hyph;percent from 1988 levels. Additionally, Canada's swordfish harvest in 1993 exceeded this quota by approximately 322 mt. Canada's quota for 1994 again is set at 2,000 mt. In a meeting with the United States on this issue, Canada contended that its 2,000 mt quota was within ``reasonable levels'' and disagreed with the U.S. view that Canada, a ``minor'' harvesting nation at the time the ICCAT recommendations came into force, should limit its harvest to a 45&hyph;percent increase over its 1988 catch level. Canada pointed out that, prior to the health alert of the 1970s that nearly closed the fishery, Canadian fisherman were harvesting well over 2,000 mt. Further, Canada maintained that, until recently, no country had objected to its self-determined 2,000 mt quota. Canada argued that its quota reduction from 3,500 mt to 2,000 mt was tantamount to compliance with the fourth ICCAT recommendation. In addition to Canadian swordfish harvests, recent U.S. import statistics have raised a concern that certain other countries also may be harvesting swordfish in amounts inconsistent with the fourth ICCAT recommendation. For example, Grenada increased its exports to the United States more than 500&hyph;percent since 1990, to 3.29 mt; St. Vincent and the Grenadines increased its exports 25&hyph;percent since 1992, to 13.39 mt; and Venezuela, an ICCAT member, has increased its exports 150&hyph;percent since 1990, to 141.5 mt. As part of its investigation into alleged noncompliance, NMFS is seeking additional information pertaining to the compliance by minor swordfish harvesting nations with relevant ICCAT recommendations. The texts of the relevant recommendations and U.S. domestic regulations can be obtained by contacting NMFS (see ADDRESSES ). Classification This document is exempt from review under of E.O. 12866.
