Laverov: ``It Is Time To Rid Ourselves of the Illusions That Someone Wants To Help Us. We Continue the Discussion on the Problems of Basic Science''--first paragraph is RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA introduction] [Text] First of all about competence. Do you remember the incident with the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant? After the earthquake in Armenia the question of what to do with the nuclear power plant arose. The situation was an extremely complicated one. Serious damages, casualties, but here a nuclear power plant was operating near by. The governmental group, which I was charged to head, should have made a decision on the fate of the plant. We came to the conclusion that it must not be shut down. In the Politburo I and Ryzhkov for half an hour defended our point of view. This is recorded in the minutes. But all the same it was shut down ``at the request of the working people.'' Now they are opening it again. If the leaders of that time had found in themselves the courage and boldness to heed the opinion of scientists and to follow our advice, Armenia, without a doubt, would have been spared many troubles. The conclusion is simple: Earlier, unfortunately, they also did not always take into account the position of scientists. And now the situation with this is, in my opinion, simply rotten. And the present state of science is a clear example of this. It is impossible to build a new, developed, democratic society without scientific support. But what is happening in our country? Remember what the ancients said: ``While listening to the words, look at the deeds.'' We, it seems to me, should understand that we are already living in a different society, but are still thinking in old categories. Here we swear at the state and demand that it give us money. But from where is it to get it? The debt of the state comes already to tens of trillions of rubles. If we are to give, hence, we are to take it from someone. But we see only our own problems. This is understandable, but, it seems to me, precisely scientists should now begin to actively suggest means of getting out of the crisis. Who, if not we? For it is clear to everyone that if they give money today, tomorrow the same problem will arise. A fundamental settlement of the question is necessary, and I am afraid that all our corporate claims--of the intelligentsia, the workers, the peasantry, the service sphere--in the attempt to survive are merely aggravating the situation. Because of the nature of my job I regularly visit the most different enterprises. Recently I returned from the Arkhangelsk Lumber and Paper Combine, the largest in Russia. It is completely idle. Ukraine owes it 6 billion rubles. It is clear that it will never pay it them. This is hundreds of workers and their families. Other enterprises are also idle. Now we should ourselves make, but without any political cunning, a truthful diagnosis. Have they collapsed completely or now yet? If they are in a complete coma, think about that to do under the conditions of a coma. But everyone is afraid to speak the truth. It turns out like it did with the Armenian nuclear plant. But we will all the same have to make this diagnosis. I have repeatedly talked about this to members of the government. Whereas earlier there was no policy in the state in the area of science and technology, now everything has been aimed at the destruction of the sphere of science. The allocations for science have been reduced according to my estimates by a factor of 30. But if this is not the destruction of science, what is it? For me it is absolutely clear, and I think it also is for all of you, that under the conditions of such a gigantic deficit it is time to specify national priorities. And to speak frankly about this to everyone. We will develop agriculture and power engineering, because without food and light it is impossible to live, but we will close down science. May it not suffer. But without science it is impossible to built a bright future. Here I would also wish that there were no illusions. I personally believe that it is necessary by and large to talk not only about the Academy of Sciences. It is necessary to talk about the entire sphere of science: sectorial, VUZ, and defense. We all represent, after all, a unified complex. We are saving basic science, but who will convert our knowledge into specific technologies or pass it down to future generations? We cannot saves ourselves on our own. There is another thought. In 1966 we developed a unit for superdeep drilling. It reached a depth of 13 kilometers. The Germans with their machine building, which is famous throughout the world, cannot develop such units. I am saying this, and there are innumerable examples, because we have in domestic science a large number of our own priorities, which are in the leading positions. Just as the state as a whole needs to determine its position with priorities, so each sector and science, in particular, needs to go through all its archives, to analyze the state of affairs and to say both honestly and openly: We will develop and support this. And this we will put off to better times. I would like particularly to emphasize the attitude toward us of the world community. I have a serious report of foreign analysts, which is devoted to the state of Russian science. The conclusions there are interesting. The main thing is: Russia is living beyond its means, it is incapable of supporting such science, and the RAS should be reduced by two-thirds. Applied science should be converted completely to financing at its own expense. This report was prepared by experts of the European Economic Community on the order of our Ministry of Science. Roughly speaking, it is simply suggested to us that we lie in a coffin and in addition independently drive the nails into its cover. They are suggesting that we do this, with our own money, without blinking an eye. The conclusion is one from my numerous contacts with foreign structures. They did not help to help us and will not. They are calmly watching us fight in the grip of our own problems, and are giving advice on how we are to die subsequently. The solution lies only in reliance on ourselves. It has turned out historically that in our country science is monolithic and unified. We are not bound to the West. Its own advantages and disadvantages exist here. Thus, we are obliged today to use the advantages. It is time to rid ourselves of the illusions that someone wants to help us. For the present it is only in words. I want particularly to emphasize the role of the contemporary press in the current fate of science. Earlier in every self-respecting newspaper and journal there was without fail its own department of science. For better or for worse they did their job: They educated, popularized, raised the prestige of scientific labor, and, when necessary, criticized. There was at least some link of science and society. Without it neither the state nor science itself can develop normally. Now, as far as I know, all the departments have been eliminated. Pseudoscience: fortune tellers, clairvoyants, astrologers, and flying saucers, have replaced science. On the threshold of the third millennium we are rapidly sliding into the abyss of ignorance. But this is the road to nowhere.
