ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing rules that establish equipment standards, performance standards, and procedures for security against acts of terrorism on certain passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals. Passenger vessels over 100 gross tons carrying more than 12 passengers on voyages of over 24 hours on the high seas will be affected. These rules are necessary because lack of voluntary compliance with measures of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) published in 1986, or with these measures published as Coast Guard ``guidelines'' in 1987, requires mandatory compliance to attain ``effective security measures.'' DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA&hyph;2, 3406) [CGD 91&hyph;012], U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to Room 3406 at the above address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. Comments on collection of information requirements must also be mailed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer, U.S. Coast Guard. The Executive Secretary maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters.
