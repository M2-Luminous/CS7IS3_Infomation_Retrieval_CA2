They Will Go Ahead, Although the Liberal Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Party Oppose Them"] [Text] The State Duma tried to interfere in the preparations for local elections but failed once again: None of the three draft resolutions on local elections got the requisite majority of votes yesterday. All three documents were sent to be further reworked which, according to deputies' estimates, will last for at least a week. This means that preparation for the elections has been left to the local authorities. The glaring violations already observed in a number of regions will apparently never be rectified. In 64 Russian Federation components, local elections have been set for various dates in March and in another three for April. Boris Yeltsin's October edict defined merely the "basic guidelines," leaving the elaboration of the final procedures to the discretion of regional authorities (in fact the governors). The greatest public response has been evoked by the limitations of the franchise in the form of residence and professional qualifications introduced by Anatoliy Sobchak in St. Petersburg: Yet now it appears that his example has been followed by authorities in other regions. Furthermore, Duma experts say that in many regions the rights of observers have been limited. In Tula Oblast, the deputy administration chief has appropriated the right to appoint part of the deputies to the representative body. Two draft resolutions out of the three -- submitted by the Duma's committees on regional policy and local self-government and the Yabloko bloc -- invited the president "to take measures to correct the violation of citizens' voting rights." The third -- from the Liberal Democratic Party -- proposed to cancel the elections altogether. All three were defeated. The debate, however, showed a curious distribution of votes. The idea of holding the elections but with a revised procedure has been supported by Women of Russia, Yabloko, and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES]. The Zhirinovskiy followers, the communists, and the Travkin party want to call off the elections, in spite of the fact that forecasts are promising the "restorationists" success in many regions. As for the reformers, the Russia's Choice leader in confidential conversations with journalists was rather pessimistic. PRES deputy Anatoliy Sliva attributed the communists' and liberal democrats' mood to their hopes for coming to power in the capital, riding on the crest of a wave brought about by economic collapse this coming summer, and therefore they do not consider it reasonable to change authority at the local level. It is perfectly clear, however, that local elections will be held as scheduled, regardless of the mood in the deputy corps. But, as Yabloko deputy Vyacheslav Igrunov noted, the elections "could have looked more decent but it seems that we have missed the chance."
