It is clear that EC opponents from all the other parties, including the Socialist Left Party, flocked to the Center Party. However, it was a big surprise to many that election experts feel they can draw the conclusion that the record low voter turnout was caused primarily by EC opponents who decided to stay home. If that is true, it is a clear indication of the challenge that faces EC supporters. The Labor Party has its problems to contend with, but the Conservatives have problems that are just as great. Among the nonvoters in the Conservative ranks, there were three times as many EC opponents as supporters. Even so, the election experts are overstating the case when they maintain that the Labor and Conservative roles as political opposites have been abolished. The fact that only a minority of voters regarded the Conservatives as a government alternative in this election does not necessarily mean that the traditional dividing line in Norwegian politics has become irrelevant for all time. It is not a foregone conclusion that the party patterns resulting from the EC struggle will be a permanent phenomenon. Nonetheless, the Conservatives must be quite perplexed by the fact that the Labor Party received a sizable influx of EC supporters from both the Conservative and Progress parties in this year's election. For the many voters who regard a strong government as the best guarantee of stability, the Conservative Party was not an alternative. The Labor Party for its part lost many EC opponents, mainly to the Center Party, but in return it acquired new voters from the ranks of those who support Norwegian membership in the European Union, the new name of the EC. Again underlining that the Conservatives are on the sidelines. EC supporters simply sought refuge in the Labor Party. At the same time, former Conservative voters who oppose EC membership voted for the Center Party--if they went to the polls at all. It is no surprise that there are also many opponents among traditionally Conservative voters. However, it would be a complete mistake for the Conservative leadership to be deluded into believing that the election defeat was a consequence of the fact that there appeared to be more room for opponents in the Labor Party than in the Conservative Party. If the Conservatives had been able to make this year's meeting with the voters a government election, the EC opponents in the party's own ranks would also have voted the same way they did in 1989. When it comes to our future relationship to the EC, the voters already knew where the Conservatives stood four years ago. The difference was that then the Conservatives emerged as the leaders of a nonsocialist coalition that was prepared to assume government responsibility. When the nonsocialist coalition collapsed in November 1990 and the Center Party paved the way for a new Social Democratic minority government, the Conservatives saw their big chance. But they never succeed in emerging on their own as a credible challenger in the fight for government power. If the Conservatives remain standing in the wings without having any impact in the Storting, this year's "anomalous" Storting election could be the beginning of years of tedious effort. The Conservatives must now show that the party is able to find its bearings in a new reality.
