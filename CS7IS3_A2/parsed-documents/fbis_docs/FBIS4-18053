In 1988 the figure was 70. All the rest are relieved because of poor health or are deferred. Last year the Russian Army had only half of the prescribed strength. The spring-time call-up is also having problems. These facts were reported on Thursday at a joint meeting in Moscow of the leaders of the medical service of the Army, the conscription group, the parliamentary committees for defence and health protection, the interior and education ministries and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Participants accounted the current miserable situation with conscription to the actual decline in health standards among young people. Last year 26.4 pct [percent] of young men were relieved of army service on account of poor health. Diseases of internal organs ranked first, mental diseases second. However, speakers felt that the outdated system of medical examination allows to call up actually sick people and simultaneously permits various forms of fraud. The conference formed a working group to draft a plan to improve health care and prepare young people for army service.
