Two Korean frigates are to join the 52-day joint naval maneuvers, in which over 60 warships including two U.S. carrier battle groups, 200 aircraft and 25,000 officers and sailors from the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan are participate. RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) drill, which began in 1971 under the initiative of the U.S. Navy, is intended to secure the safety of sea routes in the Pacific and enhance the joint operational capability among navies of Pacific-rim countries. The drill is held once every two years and the South Korean Navy began to participate in 1990. In RIMPAC '92, the Korean unit was awarded the Top Gun award thanks to its excellent naval gunfire. The joint naval maneuvers have nothing to do with the international political situation including the impasse over the North Korean nuclear program, said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
