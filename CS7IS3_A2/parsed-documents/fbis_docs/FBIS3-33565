With the investigation and drafted proposal, Fenasep and Sintrasip [expansion unknown] have initiated an honest, direct, open dialogue, a dialogue without giving up their principles with the government's economic cabinet. The results of this dialogue were reported to the unions' rank and file during special general assemblies. 3. Fenasep and Sintrasip announce to the country the government, via the economic cabinet, has not accepted salary adjustments, arguing it does not have the resources to do so. It has proposed to the Negotiating Commission an annual bonus of 360 quetzals, a proposal Fenasep and Sintrasip never accepted. Consequently, by virtue of the moral authority vested upon the before mentioned unions, they reject the lies and false statements of those who have said these organizations are progovernment and have accepted the bonus. 4. The Fenasep rank and file, in a special general assembly, agreed to continue the talks to accomplish the following: 4.1. A salary adjustment in accordance with the high cost of living that will benefit not only state workers but also private sector workers. We also call for the implementation of other compensations to social sectors. 4.2. The government must demonstrate its political willingness and take corrective measures to guarantee a price reduction to the basic market basket items and must not permit increases to these products. The Economy, Finance, Energy and Mines, particularly, Ministries must stop protecting the interests of the large purse potentates; instead, they must impose price controls that guarantee the rights and interests of the poor majorities. 4.3. Fenasep and Sintrasip demand the Fiscal Offense Law be promulgated to punish those who evade taxes. Such a law must contemplate prison terms; that is, offenders must pay by spending time in prison, not with their dirty money, for the offense of tax evasion and nonpayment. 4.4. Fenasep and Sintrasip make a profound, serious, and responsible call to reflection and moderation to labor leaders. We must not play the game of those who want to blackmail us by privatizing state-owned companies. In addition, we demand the government rule out its plans to reduce the state via structural adjustment measures with the sale of assets and privatization of the basic services of Guatemalans. 4.5. Fenasep and Sintrasip affirm we must not give excuses to the sectors that are seeking to decree a state of emergency, which would be a return to the dictatorial-type measures of the past. We must avoid the working class again paying with its blood the price of recklessness, intolerance, and passion. For a decent and fair salary for all and for the defense of national interests, [Signed] Fenasep and Sintrasip
