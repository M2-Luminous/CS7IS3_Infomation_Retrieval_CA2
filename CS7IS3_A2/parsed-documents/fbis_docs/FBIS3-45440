An official from the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday that each of the 900 million farmers in the country now pays 11 yuan ($1.3) less than before for various financial charges and public duties imposed by government departments at various levels. Li Xiangang, official with the department of rural co-operative economy under the Ministry of Agriculture said, "That is a direct result of a series of measures taken by the central government last year to reduce burdens on farmers." In an interview yesterday, Li said the information came from a just-completed nationwide inspection made by his team on the implementation of the central government's policy. Prompted by increasing complaints and discontent in the country's rural areas about the growing levies, which required cash payment or labour contributions from farmers, the central government has since last year cancelled 43 non-agricultural public duties and abolished 37 charges borne by rural residents. Those decades-old duties, previously imposed by different ministries and departments under the central government, included a variety of communal projects, such as training of militia, rural public security, housing land charges, rural film and TV relay services, rodent control, subsidies for rural doctors, and the construction and development of social welfare projects and facilities. All these projects demanded farmers to offer either labour or money, resulting in excessive burdens on farmers and disruption of normal agricultural production, the official said. The State Council had earlier stipulated that a farmer should not have to pay more than 5 per cent of his annual income as taxes or duties to the central and local governments. But a survey early last year showed that farmers in one-third of the country's provinces municipalities and regions had been forced to cough up 10 per cent or more of their annual income for special assessments. The complaints from farmers about these improper practices flooded into the central government as they were too heavy for farmers to bear. The State Council set up a special inspection team last September with members from five ministries to conduct a survey of more than 2,000 rural households in 18 provinces. Now more than a half of China's provinces, municipalities and regions have issued decrees or regulations, or set up supervision, auditing and budget systems, to control the imposing of these burdens on farmers, he added. But he pointed out the central government's policies have not been well carried out in some areas and some cases of excessive levies still exist.
