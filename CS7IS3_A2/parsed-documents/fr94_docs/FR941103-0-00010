FR941103-0-00010 FR941103-0-00003 Comment: Proposed ยง94.17(j)(3) would require that pork loins have packaging material that remains intact throughout processing and bears the identifying number of the processing establishment. This is not possible, since the packaging material must be removed when the pork loin is placed in the pickle preparation. The processing establishment number should instead be recorded on the plastic tag also required by this paragraph, which can remain on the product throughout processing. Response: We agree, and are making the requested change. Comment: Proposed ยง94.17(m) (3), (4), and (5) would require that Iberian hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins would have to come from a swine of the Iberico breed of black pigs. The word ``black'' should be deleted, as Iberico breeds include pigs of several skin colors, all of which are equally suitable for processing under the regulations. The color of the skin of the Iberico breed does not alter the way in which viruses present in the meat respond to processing. Response: We agree, and are making the suggested change. Comment: No assurance has been given that the proposed requirements for the controlled curing and long-term drying of these products will in fact be followed. A failure to follow the proposed procedures could significantly increase the risk of introducing foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, African swine fever, hog cholera, or swine vesicular disease into the United States. Response: We believe that a number of controls exist to ensure that the regulatory requirements will be followed. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture exercises supervision over all animal importation and meat processing in Spain, and will cooperate in enforcing the requirements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Food Safety and Inspection Service inspect establishments participating in this program and review their records. The official ink seals required on these products by the regulations provide a reliable check for some of the most important requirements_ensuring that the products come from an approved establishment and were processed for the required time period. Comment: These products should not be imported until a procedure is available to test the products at the time of importation for freedom from the disease agents of concern. Response: Such a test is not now available; currently, identifying the disease agents of concern requires extensive laboratory analysis. We do not expect early development of a practical test that could be used at the time of importation. We have instead developed procedures, based on research, that have proven effective in eliminating the disease agents, and have implemented regulatory controls to ensure that the procedures are followed. We do not believe that it is necessary to prohibit the proposed importations until a test is available. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposed rule as a final rule, with the changes discussed above. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) estimates that, under these regulations, between 5 and 15 metric tons of dry-cured hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins will be imported into the United States during the first year that importation is allowed. Products imported in accordance with the regulations will have an approximate retail value between $352,500 and $1,057,500. In Spain, these products sell for approximately $32 per pound. We anticipate the price per pound in the United States will be higher. Over the next decade, we estimate annual imports will plateau as United States markets for the products are developed. These products are all high-value products, and not likely to be purchased for home consumption. Instead, we anticipate most of these products will be purchased for resale by delicatessens, restaurants, and caterers. Within the next 20 years, APHIS estimates that the retail value of imported dry-cured pork products described in this document will average between $33 and $66.1 million (50&hyph;100 metric tons) annually. This can be compared with the dry-cured pork products, all of which are hams, currently being imported into the United States. In 1990, approximately 429 metric tons of these hams were imported. These dry-cured hams retail in the United States for approximately $16 per pound. Dry-cured pork products exactly like those allowed to be imported into the United States under the regulations are not produced in the United States. Certain dry-cured pork products produced in Virginia do resemble, in appearance, the products the final rule allows to be imported. However, the Virginia products have a significantly higher salt concentration and a significantly different taste. Genuine Virginia dry-cured hams are produced by four producers in Smithfield, VA. Two of these producers are small entities. Wholesale production statistics and prices are not available due to propriety concerns. However, genuine Virginia dry-cured hams retail for approximately $4 per pound.
