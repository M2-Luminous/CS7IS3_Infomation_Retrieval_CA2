FR940620-0-00019 FR940620-0-00005 Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,655,290. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the modification will require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph (b) of this AD should allow ample time for the sync-lock installation to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;13&hyph;02␣Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8942. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;111&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 757 series airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535E4/E4B engines; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was not installed during production or as a modification in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032: Within 4,000 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD; and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service until the modification required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished; accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD to verify proper operation of the thrust reverser system. Prior to further flight, repair any discrepancy found, in accordance with the procedures described in the Boeing 757 Maintenance Manual. (1) Perform a ``Thrust Reverser-Auto Restow Test'' in accordance with the procedures described in Section 78&hyph;31&hyph;00 of the Boeing 757 Maintenance Manual. (2) Perform an ``Actuator Lock and Crossover Shaft Integrity Test'' in accordance with the procedures described in Section 78&hyph;31&hyph;00 of the Boeing 757 Maintenance Manual. (b) For airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was not installed during production or as a modification in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032: Within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this AD. Accomplishment of either of these installations constitutes terminating action for the tests required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (1) Install an additional thrust reverser system locking feature (sync-lock installation) in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032, Revision 2, dated May 12, 1994.

Note 2: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 as an additional source of service information for airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535E4/E4B engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627 as an additional source of service information. The FAA's intent is that the appropriate revision levels to be used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613, Revision 2, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627, dated December 3, 1992. (c) Within 4,000 hours time-in-service after accomplishing the modification required by paragraph (b) of this AD, or within 4,000 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later; and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service: Accomplish the ``Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Integrity Test'' specified below to verify that the sync-locks have not failed in the ``unlocked'' state. Prior to further flight, repair any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 757 Maintenance Manual. Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Integrity Test 1. General A. Use this procedure to test the integrity of the thrust reverser sync locks. The procedure must be performed on each engine. 2. Thrust Reverser Sync Lock Test A. Prepare for the thrust reverser sync lock test. (1) Open the AUTO SPEEDBRAKE circuit breaker on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11. (2) Do steps 2.A.(2)(a) through 2.A.(2)(f) to supply power to the thrust reverser system: (a) Make sure the thrust levers are in the idle position. (b) Make sure the thrust reversers are retracted and locked. (c) Make sure these circuit breakers on the main power distribution panel, P6, are closed: 1) L ENG SYNC LOCK 2) R ENG SYNC LOCK&hyph;ALTN (d) Make sure these circuit breakers on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11, are closed: 1) LANDING GEAR POS SYS 1 2) T/R IND R 3) T/R CONT&hyph;ALTN&hyph;R 4) T/R IND L 5) T/R CONT L 6) R ENG SYNC LOCK 7) T/R CONT R 8) EICAS CMPTR LEFT 9) EICAS UPPER IND 10) EICAS CMPTR RIGHT 11) EICAS LOWER IND 12) EICAS DISPLAY SW 13) EICAS PILOTS DSP 14) AIR/GND SYS 1 15) AIR/GND SYS 2 16) LANDING GEAR POS SYS 2 17) PROX SW TEST (e) Supply electrical power. (f) Supply pressure to the left (for the left engine) or right (for the right engine) hydraulic system. B. Do the thrust reverser sync lock test. (1) Use the SENSOR CHANNEL SELECT thumb switches to set the PSEU code for the auto-restow proximity sensor. (a) On PSEU (^17), The left engine code is 433. (b) On PSEU (^16), The left engine code is 105. (c) The right engine PSEU code is 099. Note: Step 2.B.(2) will cause the Hydraulic Isolation Valve (HIV) to open for approximately 5 seconds. Steps 2.B.(3) through 2.B.(5) must be done during this 5 second time. Steps 2.B.(2) through 2.B.(5) may be repeated if necessary. (2) Push the TARGET TEST switch on the PSEU and hold for one second. (3) Make sure the TARGET NEAR light on the PSEU comes on after approximately four seconds. (4) Make sure that the EICAS Advisory message L(R) REV ISLN VAL shows for approximately 3 seconds and then does not show. (5) Make sure the sync lock manual unlock lever on the right sleeve of the reverser does not extend. (6) Push and release the RESET switch on the PSEU. (7) Open the applicable circuit breaker(s): (a) For the left engine; L ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P6) (b) For the right engine; R ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P11) R ENG SYNC LOCK&hyph;ALTN (Panel P6) (8) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever up and rearward to the reverse thrust position. (9) Make sure that the thrust reverser does not extend. (10) Move the left (right) reverse thrust lever to the forward and down position. C. Put the airplane back to its usual condition. (1) Remove hydraulic pressure. (2) Close the applicable circuit breaker(s). (a) For the left engine; L ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P6) (b) For the right engine; R ENG SYNC LOCK (Panel P11) R ENG SYNC LOCK&hyph;ALTN (Panel P6) (3) Close the AUTO SPEEDBRAKE circuit breaker on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11. (4) Remove electrical power. D. Repeat the thrust reverser sync lock test on the other engine.
