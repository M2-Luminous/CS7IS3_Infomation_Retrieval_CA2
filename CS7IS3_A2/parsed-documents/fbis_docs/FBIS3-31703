"The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in particular in Bosnia-Herzegovina have once again proved that human rights only play a secondary role in the context of international politics," the latest report by the UN Human Rights Commission's special rapporteur commented. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Polish prime minister who has been compiling reports on former Yugoslavia since August 1992, said humanitarian efforts had not compensated for what he termed "political inertia" and called for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to be allowed to intervene more actively. "A number of formal steps which have been undertaken may be considered as a substitute or excuse for political inertia.... The enormous efforts and sacrifices of the field officers of the various international agencies have not compensated for that policy," he argued. "Such a policy undermines some of the most fundamental principles upon which international law and the system of human rights protection have been built," he concluded. Mazowiecki acknowledged that he had not been able to achieve his main objectives of offering effective assistance to victims and of reducing the massive scale of the violations of human rights and urged that UNPROFOR be given a more active mandate. "UNPROFOR forces have not been effectively empowered to intervene to protect against human rights violations as they occur and have been forced to observe passively many serious breaches of international humanitarian law owing to the inadequacy of their mandate and resources." He particularly accused Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats of exploiting humanitarian aid "as an element in a political game." Although aid continues to get through by road, there are frequently massive delays at Bosnian Serb checkpoints, he noted. He also denounced the plan for Bosnia put forward last September by the international mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg (UN) and Lord Owen (European Community), saying the proposals for partition represented "an absolute repudiation" of his most basic recommendations. Mazowiecki, who published five reports last year, emphasised that "this warning has been ignored by the international community" and that all this time, ethnic cleansing has continued without any respite.
