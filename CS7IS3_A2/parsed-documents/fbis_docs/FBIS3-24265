Sklyarov: "Entrepreneurs Cannot Do Without Government Aid"] [Text] Last year, as we know, the Fund to Support Business and the Development of Competition was created by an edict of the Russian government for the purpose of organizing and rendering real aid by the government to small business. Quite possibly, the fund has not yet been operating long enough, but readers of EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA and entrepreneurs are persistently posing questions regarding what the fund has already done, why the results of its work are not evident, whether there is any reason to count on it, and others. At the request of the editors, some of these questions will be answered today by N. Petrov, acting general director of the Fund to Support Business and the Development of Competition. [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, first of all we would like to hear from you about what results the Fund to Support Business began the year with. What was it able to accomplish and what did it fail to accomplish in 1993? [Petrov] You know that the path leading to the creation of the fund was long and tortuous. It was only on 1 April of last year that finally a resolution was issued concerning its formation, after which much time and effort was spent on purely organizational measures -- the search for facilities, confirmation of the state schedule and fund budget, hiring of specialists, and so forth. Nevertheless, the fund's supervisory council began active work immediately, thereby facilitating a solution to organizational-methodological questions. It was especially important to establish a mechanism for rendering credit-financial aid in order to implement regional programs to support business and specific entrepreneurial projects. Among our achievements of last year we can include the fact that we have already put this mechanism into action by providing credit for over two dozen business projects. Now, about the things that we failed to accomplish. The main difficulties in implementing the fund's goals have to do with limited financial resources allocated to the fund from the republic budget. It is no secret that in 1993 we were to receive 25 billion rubles. But then in connection with making the budget more precise this sum was decreased to 15.9 billion rubles. In real terms as of the end of last year we received only 7.5 billion rubles. In assessing these resources please keep the inflationary process in mind. In other words, we were not able to support business in a volume of at least those 25 billion that businessmen were counting on. I say "at least" because in late 1993 the fund had accumulated select (i.e., deserving of state financial support) programs and projects totalling a sum of over 400 billion rubles. [Sklyarov] Yes, it is not a happy picture. What are the fund's prospects this year with regard to finances? I have in mind the needs as well as the possibilities for receiving assets. [Petrov] As concerns last year's debt to the fund from the budget, this sum has been established at 7.8 billion rubles. We are making attempts to obtain it, but realistically we can hope for only 5 billion. Naturally, the fund's need for budget allocations are much greater this year. We have added them up, and the results have been included in the draft, "Programs of Federal Measures for Government Support of Small Business in 1994-1995," which was submitted to the government for examination. What sums figure into this document? The fund is requesting 19 billion rubles in 1994 in order to implement measures to create an infrastructure that will support business (the formation of a normative base, a financial infrastructure, systems for providing information to small businesses, for training and retraining of personnel, and so forth). In other words, this sum is needed to create and begin the support mechanism on the necessary level. The second part of the program, which is related to the direct implementation of regional plans and programs to which the fund has decided to contribute financing, is assessed at slightly less than 588 billion rubles. But this is a general total and requires clarification. According to the resolution on the Fund to Support Business and the Development of Competition, our share in financing regional projects and programs cannot exceed 50 percent of their cost. Thus the 588 billion rubles consist of the following according to source of financing: 153.8 billion rubles -- the assets of the businessmen themselves; 170.2 billion -- from local budgets; 65.1 billion -- expected income in an amount equalling 5 percent of privatized federal property; 7.7 billion -- planned income from invested fund assets; 3.5 billion -- expected clear income from the sale of bonds, which we are preparing to issue; and finally, 206.56 billion rubles -- planned allocations directly from the republic budget. [Sklyarov] The sum is actually not that large if we compare it to those trillions of rubles that the government intends to pour into the giant branches. But if we compare it to last year's 25 billion, of which the fund received just a trifle, then realistically how can you expect to receive a sum that is tenfold larger? [Petrov] There is hope. I can tell you that on 3 February the government examined the draft for the federal program to support business, which I have already mentioned. This year that was the first program to be fully approved by the government. Of course, Minfin [Ministry of Finance] raised considerable objections regarding the figures. I want to clearly state that we plan to allocate 206.56 billion rubles from the budget for partial financing by the fund of regional programs and projects. In response to Minfin's objections, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin stated, "We must find the assets. Businessmen cannot do without government support." [Sklyarov] These are pretty words. The government has not been lacking in such words before... [Petrov] How can I answer here? Where money is invested is determined, naturally, by the government's politics and not by words... [Sklyarov] All right, let us try to be optimistic and let us imagine that the fund has received these 200 billion. Now we have the question of effectiveness of use. How dependable is the mechanism for bringing the assets to specific businessmen? We know, for example, that considerable amounts of government money allocated to support farmers reached the land in a very thinned out form. [Petrov] You see, our fund's goal is much broader than simply putting money into specific business programs and projects. This money must be returned to us, and in a somewhat increased quantity. By share participation in financing we are not simply giving away assets; we are investing them and providing credit. Yes, the fund has a non-commercial structure; our credit is issued at a percentage that for the times may seem symbolic to some. Sometimes our credit may be percentage-free. But repayment conditions are immutable. This is one of the basic principles of fund operations. And believe me, we are not at all interested in "loosing" the money that is allocated by us, or in having it thrown to the wind, especially since the situation involving the receipt of budget allocations by the fund are far from what is desired. Who specifically controls the allocation and movement of our credit and how? It all begins with a careful selection of programs and projects submitted to the fund. This is carefully overseen by the fund's supervisory council, consisting, as we know, of representatives of several ministries and committees. At this stage the main task is to select projects that correspond to government economic priorities, that are precisely worked out and well-justified, that are capable of providing an adequately rapid return, that facilitate the production of goods and services needed by the market, and that are capable of repaying our credit. Further, the fund's general bank agent, Mezhekonomsberbank [International Economic Savings Bank] and its local bank agents carry out direct operations to credit and control the use of these assets. [Sklyarov] And who in the chain of "general bank agent--regional bank agents" guarantees credit and is responsible for its repayment? [Petrov] This depends on the credit scheme, of which there are four. Regional programs and projects are usually financed in the following manner. Mezhekonomsberbank, acting at our fund's behest, provides interbank credit to its bank agent, and the latter concludes a credit contract directly with the credit recipient. In this case the bank agent guarantees the issuance and repayment of credit with Mezhekonomsberbank as the fund's representative. In the second scheme Mezhekonomsberbank itself becomes the bank agent for projects selected by the fund. It then becomes responsible for credit repayment and we guarantee issuance of credit. The third scheme is similar to this but differs in that with the fund's guarantee Mezhekonomsberbank issues credit from its own assets. The last scheme has to do with the fact that the fund can transfer a portion of its assets to the general bank agent for trust administration, establishing only the direction of financial projects. In this case all credit responsibility is placed on the bank. But we are not yet utilizing this variant because the fund does not have sufficient assets at its disposal. [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, the press has been critical of the fact that of last year's 7.5 billion rubles received by the fund, you directed 2 billion into Mezhekonomsberbank's charter fund instead of crediting these assets to businessmen. What can you say about this? [Petrov] Are these expenditures justified? Let us take a look. By moving into the bank's charter capital as one of the main founders, the fund will thereby considerably expand its financial possibilities, since the bank takes upon itself obligations that will enable it to do the following: to provide bank guarantees to small enterprises for obtaining credit in commercial banks, to increase assets for providing credit to small business using assets of the general bank agent itself, to administer the bank business support system, and finally, to receive a dividend from investment capital and in the form of income for bank guarantees provided to small business, thus increasing the fund's financial resources. I can tell you, for example, that according to the average monthly balance in our Mezhekonomsberbank current account, the fund receives an income that is double that of the bank's regular clients. It is all well and good to provide credit for business projects and programs. But world experience proved long ago that effective government support of small business and its extensive development are impossible without the creation of the corresponding infrastructure, an integral part of which is credit-financial, insurance and leasing organizations. Since there is no one but our fund to deal with this problem on a federal level, we will continue to seek and invest assets in infrastructure development. [Sklayrov] I think that you yourself have heard criticism from businessmen that the fund operates secretly, that it is difficult to receive an answer from you regarding why you accept or reject a particular project for financing and correspondingly, regarding where fund assets go. [Petrov] I have already mentioned the criteria for the selection of projects. I should note that most businessmen simply submit poor quality materials to the fund. It happens that they request considerable sums without explaining how they intend to spend them. Naturally, we do not even look at such requests. In addition, I think you will agree that regardless of the financial possibilities of our fund there will always be businessmen who are "insulted" as well as those who "are lucky enough" to receive our support. We will always have to make choices regarding which projects to give preference to. [Sklyarov] Could you mention some small businesses which have already been "lucky enough" to receive aid from you? [Petrov] There are no secrets here. This includes Kaluga's "Progress" TOO [limited liability partnership], to which we gave credit to create a mini-bakery. "Alfa" AO [joint-stock company] of Belorechensk, Krasnodar Kray, which has production and storage facilities, received credit to procure equipment for producing soy milk and other soy products, including livestock feed. Penza's "Karteks" AO, which has experience in manufacturing equipment for mini-mills and churns, was allocated capital to begin manufacturing potato-processing complexes. In the city of Zheleznodorozhnyy, Moscow Oblast, "Uchprofprom" TOO received our credit to produce furniture for schools and children's institutions. We provided capital to "Kredo" AO of Zlatoust, Chelyabinsk Oblast, to manufacture bactericidal irradiation equipment used in medicine as well as in livestock raising. We can spend a great deal of time enumerating recipients of fund support. I will say only that as of late January of this year we have already provided credit for 24 projects totalling approximately 5 billion rubles. [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, how do you feel about creating a type of advisory council for the fund, made up of representatives of public associations, small businessmen, scientific experts and specialists? Perhaps this would diffuse mistrust and criticism among businessmen with regard to the fund? [Petrov] The resolution on the Fund to Support Business and the Development of Competition that was confirmed by the government does not call for this at all. But we are keeping the creation of such an organ in mind. How to implement it is another matter. This is not as simple as it seems. You know that in Russia we have countless numbers of all kinds of unions, associations and organizations for small businesses, many of which are phony structures that do not represent any MP [small business]. But all of them demand government support, especially financial. All of them are pulling the blanket up over themselves. This is why as of now we do not see how we can create a public organ within the fund and keep our joint work constructive. I think that right now we must simply more broadly inform the public and business circles about the fund's operations. I hope that EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN will help us in this. [Sklyarov] Don't worry about this, as long as your side continues to have an interest in doing this. Thank you for the interview.
