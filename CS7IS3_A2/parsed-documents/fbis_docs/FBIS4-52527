FBIS4-52527 "dreas091_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 South Korea IAEA Sends Letter to DPRK Urging Inspections IAEA Sends Letter to DPRK Urging Inspections SK1105020694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0141 GMT 11 May 94 SK1105020694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced Tuesday that it will send inspectors "in the next few days" to North Korea to complete monitoring activities begun in March. Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable. Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel rods. The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly selected, and various measurements of the rods should be conducted late this year, officials said. The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to an inspection agreement. The IAEA inspection team, with entry visas to North Korea already in hand, would conduct basic checks such as replacing batteries and film in monitoring cameras as well as additional inspections of facilities that were barred to the inspectors during their last visit in March. Blix wrote to Kim that the team would go to Pyongyang "in the next few days." North Korea and the IAEA have been deadlocked over the inspections, with Pyongyang refusing random collection and measurement of the fuel rods as demanded by the agency. Blix's latest proposal cautiously sidesteps this stumbling block by recommending that North Korea delay the refueling for now so that his agency can get on with other inspection activities first. Officials here predicted that North Korea will accept this proposal since it meets the requirements for a third round of much- wanted high-level dialogue with the United States. This glimmer of hope comes just days before Blix is to go before the UN Security Council with a report on the status of the North Korean nuclear row.
