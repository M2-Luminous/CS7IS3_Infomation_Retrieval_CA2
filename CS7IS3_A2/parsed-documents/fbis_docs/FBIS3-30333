Despite the fact that one would expect closer political ties between Romania and Bulgaria -- as the two countries are neighbors, they have similar domestic problems, and a chance that if they had cooperated they would find a way to solve the difficulties generated by the crisis situation outside their borders. Except for a few random attempts to further their ties, relations between the two countries have been characterized by indifference, perhaps even competition. The Bulgarian defense minister's visit was due for several months, but it was postponed a number of times, although the reasons for that had nothing to do with the nature of bilateral relations. Merely one week before the meeting of the two ministers, a certain suspicion and tension emerged again as a consequence of the fact that the Bulgarian press had published some false information claiming that Romania had massed troops along the common border. However, in Bucharest, the two defense ministers still managed to find a common "language." They reasserted their consequent support for the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and excluded the variant of military involvement, which they termed as dangerous for both conflict parties [the Bosnian Serbs and the NATO allies acting on behalf of the United Nations], because of the high probability that, as a consequence of such involvement, the conflict would expand. In the same context, the ministers agreed that neither country would send troops to join the "blue helmets" in former Yugoslavia. Such a decision was only natural, whereas the opposite would have been quite unusual, as UN peacekeeping operations are never carried out by forces of countries that neighbor a conflict region. During the visit, they also signed the Romanian-Bulgarian military cooperation accord. Among other things, the accord also provides for cooperation in the education and training of military personnel, a chapter that, in view of the Partnership for Peace, might be equally interesting for both countries.
