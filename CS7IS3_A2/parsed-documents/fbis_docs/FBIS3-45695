Using Hong Kong as a base, the company is looking to sell many of its more than 150 prescription medicines in China, according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's New York office here today. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive office of Merck said, after a recent trip to China's Shenzhen, his company has made some important decisions about China and their strategy was well advanced and about to crystallize. The visit by a five-member Merck delegation to Shenzhen was organized by the Hong Kong Council. Since 1953 Merck has established its Far East Regional Office in Hong Kong and in the past months representative offices were also set up in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. As the chairman noted, the company has now reached the point to become a joint venture partner in selling directly to China's domestic market and producing some of the products on the mainland. A technology transfer project from Merck prompted China's national vaccine and serum institute to launch a factory in Beijing last October that produced vaccine against hepatitis B and now a similar factory is now under construction in Shenzhen.
