During a break in the conference, Volodymyr Bezkorovynyy granted a brief interview to a UNIAN correspondent. "The 12 April meeting in Kiev between the unofficial delegations of Ukraine and Russia in connection with the Odessa incident does not evoke my optimism," said the Ukrainian Naval Forces commander. "We supplied the Russian side with all the documents that confirm the illegitimate and criminal nature of the actions by the Russian officers who were on board the survey vessel, the Cheleken, and also on the part of the command of the former 318th Division of the Black Sea Fleet conservation ships. We submitted explanatory notes, eyewitnesses' evidence that the cargo on board the Cheleken was loaded in secret, and the order to use arms against Ukrainian sailors was immediately passed to Captain 2d Rank Oleksandr Zelenko from Sevastopol by the Black Sea Fleet command. ``We also provided proof of the legitimacy of the actions by Captain 1st Rank Volodymyr Orlov, the senior naval chief of Odessa. All the documents are irrefutable, from the legal viewpoint. One can only refuse to acknowledge them -- to be more precise -- to refuse to be aware of them, what, correctly speaking, the Russian side, headed by Admiral Feliks Gromov, demonstrated at the meeting. There can be no other explanation of the fact that Admiral Gromov did everything possible so that we, like him, would fail to meet the participants in the Odessa incident in Sevastopol. The meeting with the crew of the Cheleken was obviously not to his advantage. When he arrived in Sevastopol, the Russian military sailors would not allow the procurator, a customs official, and border guards to go onboard the Cheleken. This gives grounds to assume that not only the hydrographic unit RLS-5 `Mars' was taken away from Odessa in a criminal manner, but, probably, other valuable equipment from Ukraine's untouchable mobilization resources, as well. We insist and we will continue to insist that the stolen military cargo be returned to Odessa.'' Replying to the question as to what his answer to President Leonid Kravchuk was concerning the proposal made by the U.S. top leadership on 13 April to mediate in solving the Black Sea Fleet issues, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy said: "Of course, it is time that the leaders of the two states and peoples -- the Ukrainian and Russian -- should themselves sort out every aspect of the matter. Where there is a will, there is a way. I would speak out in favor of adopting the proposal of the U.S. top leadership to be a third arbitration party during the Black Sea Fleet division." Also today, Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy had a businesslike meeting with Lieutenant General Volodymyr Shkidchenko, the Odessa Military District commander.
