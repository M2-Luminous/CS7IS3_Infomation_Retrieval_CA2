Senior officials from the Defense Agency [DA] and the Chinese Ministry of National Defense [CMND] will hold talks in Beijing on 1 March. Officials of the Russian Ministry of Defense [MD] will visit Japan on 28 March for exchanges on defense studies with Japanese officials. Because Japan and China have not held regular security consultations before, they intend to take the opportunity to build a regular and continuous framework for exchange of views. Among those who will attend the Japan-China security talks are: Ken Sato, DA's defense councilor; Toshimasa Fujiwara, chief of the fifth section of the DA Joint Staff Council; and senior CMND officials. They will exchange views on the whole situation in the Asia-Pacific region, including the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected nuclear development. The prevailing view within the DA is that "China will become the largest unstable factor in the Asian region from a medium-to-long perspective," (as stated by a senior DA official). At the time of the upcoming talks, the DA intends to establish a stage for dialogue with Chinese military authorities to promote mutual understanding. Defense study exchanges between Japan and Russia are hosted alternately by DA's National Institute for Defense Studies and the Military Strategic Center under the Russian General Staff Office. The upcoming exchanges will be the third case and will also be the first since February last year. Russian officials who will visit Japan include: Lukyanov, acting chief of the International Treaty Directorate of the General Staff Office, and Zolotorev, chief of MD's Information Analysis Center.
