Speaking at the Council of Europe session in Strasbourg today, Aho stressed that Russia and the other applicant countries should be adopted as members as soon as the conditions are fulfilled. He pointed out that only membership will guarantee commitment to the Council of Europe's principles. According to Aho, the Russians have clearly chosen democracy and entry into the Council of Europe would be a significant step on this road. Aho, who addressed the parliamentary general assembly, believes it is vital both for Russia and the rest of Europe that Russia should take a full part in the European process. He emphasized that Russia must not be isolated or allowed to drift into isolation.
