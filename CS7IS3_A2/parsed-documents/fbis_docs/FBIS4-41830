"All basic types of Chinese armaments are virtiually the same which the Soviet Army relied upon. China, it seems, is interested in our weapons by virtue of the established conditions. I do not see any reasons that would preclude at least the maintenance of the level which has been achieved in this respect," Yushenkov said. "The United States has renounced a ban on the granting of the most-favoured-nation trading status to China. Why should Russia keep aloof? If the United States has granted such a status, it has serious grounds to draw conclusions on the state of affairs in China. One can cast doubt on the conclusions, of course. But this, to my mind, would cost a pretty penny," the parliamentarian recalled.
