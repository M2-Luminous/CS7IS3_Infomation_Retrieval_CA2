Participants reviewed the spirit of Mao Zedong's "talks," and explored ways in which to carry out the task of "inspiring people with works of excellence," which was proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They also suggested ways and means for improving publication-related work. Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publication Administration, said at the meeting: Although different eras have different requirements on the contents of works of excellence, the orientation of "serving the people and socialism" pointed out to literary and art workers by Comrade Mao Zedong more than half a century ago, and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" later proposed by him, still form the basic demand we set on the production of intellectual products today, as well as an important guarantee for promoting a flourishing publication industry. Yu Youxian said: Large numbers of good, widely-circulated books were produced during each of the historical periods following the founding of New China. These works played a huge and irreplaceable role in elevating the masses' realm of thought, in inspiring the masses to unite and struggle, in promoting social progress, and in promoting reform and opening up. Yu Youxian said: As a publication administration organ, we consider it our main task to vigorously organize the publication, promotion, and distribution of excellent books. Participants of the meeting stated their views on the current book markets, which face many problems. Dong Xiuyu [5516 4423 3768], editor-in-chief of the Joint Publishing Company, said: I often came across things which were in a mess but still put on display in public when I browsed in bookstores on the streets. As a member of the publication work force, I feel very uneasy about this. We should produce more and better works of excellence to corner markets and to satisfy the needs of the broad masses of people. These are the responsibility and duty we must face. Ren Jiyu, curator of the National Library, believed that we should pay special attention to young people in our creative undertakings and publications. Nowadays, young students know very little about the cultural and historical figures of their country, but the future of our country and people rests on them. We will face very serious consequences if we fail to solve this problem.
