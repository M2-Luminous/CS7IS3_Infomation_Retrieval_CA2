FR940610-1-00043 FR940610-1-00007 (v) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1._Unproductive property. The decedent's will provides for a bequest of corporation stock to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is payable to the decedent's child for life. After the death of the life income beneficiary, the trust is to terminate and the trust property is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The trust specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain the shares of stock. The corporation has paid no dividends on this stock during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state law, the corporation is considered to be an adequately sound growth investment for a trust with diversified investments because the corporation's practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation stock to increase commensurately each year. The facts and circumstances, including applicable state law, indicate that the life income beneficiary would not be able to compel the trustee to make the trust corpus productive in conformity with the requirements for a lifetime trust income interest under applicable local law. Therefore, the life income interest in this case is considered nonproductive. Consequently, the income interest may not be valued actuarially under this section. Example 2._Beneficiary's right to make trust productive. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the trustee is not specifically authorized to retain the shares of stock. Further, the terms of the trust specifically provide that the life income beneficiary may require the trustee to make the trust corpus productive consistent with income yield standards for trusts under applicable state law. Under that law, the minimum rate of income that a productive trust may produce is substantially below the section 7520 interest rate for the month of the decedent's death. In this case, because the income beneficiary has the right to compel the trustee to make the trust productive for purposes of applicable local law during the beneficiary's lifetime, the income interest is considered an ordinary income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section 7520 life income interest factor may be used to determine the present value of the income interest. Example 3._Discretionary invasion of corpus. The decedent transfers property to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is to be paid to the decedent's child for life and the remainder of the trust is to be distributed to a grandchild. The trust authorizes the trustee without restriction to distribute corpus to the decedent's surviving spouse for the spouse's comfort and happiness. In this case, because the trustee's power to invade trust corpus is unrestricted, the exercise of the power could result in the termination of the income interest at any time. Consequently, the income interest is not considered an ordinary income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and may not be valued actuarially under this section. Example 4._Limited invasion of corpus. The decedent bequeaths property to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is to be paid to the decedent's child for life and the remainder is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The trust authorizes the child to withdraw up to $5,000 per year from the trust corpus. In this case, the child's power to invade trust corpus is limited to an ascertainable amount each year. Annual invasions of any amount would be expected to progressively diminish the property from which the child's income is paid. Consequently, the income interest is not considered an ordinary income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section 7520 income interest factor may not be used to determine the present value of the income interest. Nevertheless, the present value of the child's income interest is ascertainable by making a special actuarial calculation that would take into account not only the initial value of the trust corpus, the section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer, and the mortality component for the child's age, but also the assumption that the trust corpus will decline at the rate of $5,000 each year during the child's lifetime. The child's right to receive an amount not in excess of $5,000 per year may be separately valued in this instance and, assuming the trust corpus would not exhaust before the child would attain age 110, would be considered an ordinary annuity interest. Example 5._Power to consume. The decedent devises a life estate in 3 parcels of real estate to the surviving spouse with the remainder to a child. The decedent also confers upon the spouse an unrestricted power to consume the property, which includes the right to sell part or all of the property and to use the proceeds for the spouse's support, comfort, happiness, and other purposes. Any portion of the property or its sale proceeds remaining at the death of the surviving spouse is to vest by operation of law in the child at that time. In this case, the surviving spouse's power to consume the corpus is unrestricted, and the exercise of the power could entirely exhaust the remainder interest during the life of the spouse. Consequently, the remainder interest is not considered an ordinary remainder interest for purposes of this paragraph and may not be valued actuarially under this section. (3) Mortality component _(i) Terminal illness cases. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the mortality component prescribed under section 7520 is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity, income interest, remainder interest, or reversionary interest if an individual who is a measuring life dies or is terminally ill at the time of the decedent's death. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within 1 year.
