[Gruber] Look, I share the president's concern this evening after seeing the video clips. The video clips show us part of our history, part of the past, and we, who suffered that past, have relived it this evening; therefore, we have recalled what the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] was. [Reporter] Opposition groups claim he did this to support your candidacy. What is your comment? [Gruber] I do not think this was done to support my candidacy. This president has shown this video clip to the country as evidence of his concern for what may happen on 8 May. I do not think it was done to help me. [Reporter] Isn't the president taking sides with a party and violating the Constitution with this? [Gruber] No, he is not. [Reporter] Nevertheless, Ernesto Toro Perez Balladares has said this is negative and that President Endara is violating the Santa Maria la Antigua Commitment by doing this. [Gruber] I do not think the president has violated the Constitution or the Justice and Peace Commission Pact. He has only shown part of our history. We cannot deny this is part of our history. There are many people who want to forget it, but it is there, and we have seen it tonight. [Reporter] Certain groups want to know why it was done now. [Gruber] Perhaps he was concerned about what is taking place in the country. He said it this evening; he is concerned, perhaps due to so many attacks against him. He wanted to show the country part of Panama's history. [Reporter] Is this a strategy to achieve unity of the civilist forces? [Gruber] Look, we have been issuing appeals for unity since December. We again issued appeals in January, February, and March. I do not think this will help much concerning unity. I hope it does, but I doubt it. [Reporter] Do you think this will change the Panamanian people's mind so they vote for [words indistinct]? [Gruber] Please. I think.... [pauses] Panama lived under a dictatorship for 21 years. The Panamanian people remembered it this evening when they saw the video clips. It will definitely change their minds.
