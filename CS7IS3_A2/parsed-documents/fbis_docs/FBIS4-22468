However, Gaydar apparently had not surmised yet that the "new course" would also signify the bankruptcy of Russian liberalism as the philosophy of the reforms that were implemented on his initiative. "The Moor has done his work"--liberalism has performed its "fire brigade" function, dealing a lethal blow to the command economy and opening the floodgates to the elements of the market, and something else should take its place. They Are Fighting `Against' Rather Than `For' The picture of a party buildup which was undoubtedly stimulated by the parliamentary elections, or more precisely their results, appears to be getting clearer. It is as if everybody suddenly understood that it is difficult to win elections without parties, without their local structures. Unlike what some prominent democrats maintained, referring to completely different conditions--those of a stable society with a structure of long duration, and of an American rather than European type--parties have not at all become a matter of the past. The struggle "against" still prevails. However, what is noteworthy here? The fact that parties of a democratic hue, whether newly built-up or transforming into some kind of new quality, are still more disposed to fight "against" rather than "for." Along with other causes, this is the effect of the previous stage of the struggle, when the strategy of the entire democratic movement was built on the basis of the "against" principle--against the omnipotence of the CPSU, against real socialism, against "the Red empire," and so on. I am trying to understand the new platform of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms (RDDR). As is known, it suffered an unequivocal defeat in the elections, failing to make it over the 5 percent threshold. What conclusion have its leaders drawn? Gavriil Popov says: "Indeed, I understood as early as after August 1991 and the choice of a new course that voters would flee from the fronts of the government, that a backup line needed to be built which would stop them from fleeing and draw them toward itself.... However...we put this backup line too close. People ran past not only us but also Volskiy, Travkin, and even the Russian Communist Party--they ran all the way to Zhirinovskiy." What does this mean if we decipher it? It means that the RDDR should have taken up harsh opposition with regard to the ruling reformers. At the same time, yet another RDDR leader, Anatoliy Sobchak, stressed: The movement should be based on a commonsense policy and become a genuinely liberal party. If that is so, what is liberalism about? About criticizing the government in a parlance approximating that of Zhirinovskiy? In particular, the liberalism of the RDDR, as interpreted by Popov, began to merge not only with a confrontation with the government but also with anti-Westernism (genuine or affected); patriotic and populist notes began to be heard in it. Neither the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] headed by Sergey Shakhray nor the "Apple" in which Grigoriy Yavlinskiy sets the tone can be called liberal in the strict sense of the word, although they undoubtedly include typical liberal democrats. However, they have the already mentioned preponderance of "against" motives in common with the RDDR. For some, it is against the president and the government, for others, it is against Russia's Choice. The most powerful democratic bloc, which is currently being transformed into the Russia's Choice party headed by Yegor Gaydar, is perhaps the most liberal of all blocs and parties: putting its stake on owners; market liberalism, and in a sense even market romanticism; an ode to the bourgeois (in the favorable meaning of the word). The preelection slogans of "Liberty," "Property," and "Legality" are typically liberal. However, recently the weight of arguments "against" has also increased sharply in this quarter. This has happened due to the emergence of a new front in the struggle--against the government of Viktor Chernomyrdin, present and past colleagues of Yegor Timurovich who do not share his views on the progress of reforms. What Ideals Do We Defend? Liberal democracy Russian-style is, in a way, a thing unto itself. Those who view our indigenous liberalism in conjunction with, say, Western analogs will certainly end up at an impasse. For example, when we now refer to the liberal intelligentsia, the liberal opposition, and so on, we frequently mean the phenomenon to which Dostoyevskiy referred in his time and which is characteristic only of us. The great writer and philosopher emphasized this: "Our entire liberal party (the segment of the public with a liberal disposition--note by A.K.) has passed the endeavor by, without participating in it or touching it; the party merely negated and giggled." We have many liberal democrats who are only capable of making mischief and ridiculing anything and everything as they view the events in the country following August 1991 from the sidelines, looking down on them, not participating in real politics and the affairs of the country in a positive way but merely "negating" and "giggling," poisoning everything with pessimism and hopelessness and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We also have those who, no sooner had they touched upon the real endeavor than they got burned and dropped it, cursing everybody and everything. They are liberal maximalists. Since it has not gone their way, may the fires of hell consume everything. A version concerning the so-called conspiracy which has stirred up our society also indicates that Russian liberalism is a special phenomenon. It was clear from the very beginning that this was a provocation. But who brought it into the world (let us for now ignore the issue of the sponsor), who launched it, and who advertised it most extensively? Our liberal democrats from the mass media. For some reason, Yegor Yakovlev resolved to publish the version in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and for some reason, Yevgeniy Kiselev considered it feasible to first familiarize tens of millions of TV viewers with it through "Itogi" on the Independent Television channel, and to subsequently endow the idea of a "conspiracy" with a certain credibility in a string of other "conspiracies" in yet another edition of "Itogi," using to this end Dmitriy Furman and Aleksandr Minkin. This is yet another example of how representatives of the liberal intelligentsia, in a rather traditional manner, benefit the forces of counterreform and the adversaries of democracy by rousing our society and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We ourselves provoke, and fertilize the soil for the appearance of Zhirinovskiys, and we ourselves are later overcome by hysteria and panic, naturally blaming the authorities for everything. We truly do not know what we are doing. Putting it plainly, the rallying ability of liberalism is poor. For a long time I failed to understand why the leaders of our democracy did not get around to explaining to people what kind of society we wanted to build, what our new ideals were, and so on. After all, our fellow citizens may be suffering even more from uncertainty, lack of confidence in the future, and what to them appears to be hopelessness than from economic hardship. Later, I understood that raising the issue in this manner is in principle unacceptable to them (the liberals), it sickens them. Are any additional explanations needed, given that we live by the laws of common sense, that the market economy will sort everything out, and that the mechanism of a rule-of-law state has been set in motion? Either an excessive workload or some other cause is preventing the fathers of our liberal democracy from recalling that even the most liberal society, for example the American, needs slogans and lofty ideals which mobilize and rally the citizens. They do not shun patriotism or spit upon the state. Since liberalism hardly has a clearly mapped-out positive social ideal at all (apart from generalities concerning property, legality, and so on), and since it shuns notions such as "patriotism" and "statehood," and treats even the notion of social justice as cheap social populism, it--liberalism--cannot become a foundation for rallying democratic forces. The camp of liberal democrats is doomed to disintegration under pressure from real life. We observed this after August 1991, during the period between 21 September and 3-4 October, and on the eve of the elections; we are observing this now. There is no theoretical, ethical, or any other foundation on which the democratic forces could rally, except for the fear of a return of totalitarianism. All appeals to those whom we associate with democratic parties, blocs, and so on, not to feud or splinter, and instead to rally and unite--they are all a waste of time. A common platform should be developed first, or at the very least the scope of common interests for the struggle "for" rather than "against" should be determined. Everything in Its Proper Time It would be incorrect to say that Russian liberalism is alien on our national soil. Liberalism is rooted in Russian history--in social thought and movement. It is inseparable from the "superfluous people" and "Westernism." Indeed, the dissident movement which always considered the Western type of democracy and public life in general to be its model certainly was a mighty source of liberal ideas. Undoubtedly, the sudden "flare-up of love" for the West, the United States in particular, as a response to the hatred artificially fueled by Bolsheviks played a role, too. This love made its presence known as early as the period of Gorbachev's perestroyka. Our naive belief that "the West will help us" certainly was a factor. Having renounced confrontation, having removed the "iron curtain," having made major, at times unilateral concessions to the West, they said, we deserve the right to have the West respond in kind--to help us rise from the ruins of postcommunism. Still, the response to our communist past was the main reason for the rise of liberalism in Russia. Since communism was rejected, its antipode, liberalism, gained favor (even more so given our national inclination to rush from one extreme to the other). However, the weakness of Russian liberalism also abides here. First, the hopes for Western aid were not justified. Second, a transition from communism to democratic forms of existence turned out to be an exceptionally difficult endeavor. Besides, this transition implemented on the model of a liberal market economy favored by the West entailed many unfavorable consequences. Third, the principles of liberalism with their emphasis on civil rights and freedoms, the freedom of human personality in all of its manifestations, began to depreciate quite rapidly at the stage of revolutionary transition from one social formation to another against the background of the sudden impoverishment of many people, the unprecedented rampage of crime and, correspondingly, the aggravation of nostalgia for the past life in a united state. Fourth, many of our former liberals, including dissidents, have turned into proponents of authoritarianism. In other words, liberalism somewhat prematurely proclaimed itself to have in hand the situation in Russia, which apparently is destined first to go through a different historic stage. Nonetheless, I believe that the tree of Russian liberalism, which, be that as it may, is deeply rooted in Russian society, will undoubtedly grow and bear fruit. This will happen, although not too soon. After All, Yeltsin Is Right Rather Than Gaydar In general, a revolutionary transition from one social system to another is accomplished, as a rule, under conditions of rigid authoritarianism or dictatorship. Likewise, a new statehood is not at all built on the rubble of an empire on the basis of liberalism. This is all the more true because the entire previous system of social orientation and spiritual values has been blown away. Millions of people have literally become depressed. The spiritual void has reached threatening proportions. This is precisely the time to create new myths and new social utopias, the time for any strong remedy to appear with a view to overcoming the state of depression of the nation and creating prerequisites for regular social well-being, if not for enthusiasm. Nationalism has turned out to be the strongest idea capable of playing an integrating role at the initial stage of postcommunist development in virtually all former republics of the former USSR. To be sure, nationalism is dubious and dangerous for Russia in every respect. First, nationalism would unavoidably grow into great power chauvinism in this country which has multiple ethnic groups, given the underdevelopment of the Russian people's ethnic awareness. Second, it would rather become a disintegrating factor for Russia itself. Third, Russian nationalism, if it were to pick up steam nonetheless in the spirit of our ability to be extreme, would inevitably make our relations with virtually the entire world hostile and would destroy the process of integration within the framework of the CIS. The ideas of patriotism, statehood, our spiritual heritage, and our best traditions have always been genuine integrators for Russia, and are certainly ready to be such at present. It appears to me that Boris Yeltsin has grasped or felt deep down the need to make the idea of statehood foremost. It was the mainstay of not only his message to the Federal Assembly but also quite of a number of presentations that followed. It is precisely with the idea of statehood and patriotism, among other things, that a path toward social accord must be sought. I just do not see another idea. A strong state is a guarantee of overcoming the crisis faster, a prerequisite for mounting a vigorous struggle against crime. However, it is also the most important condition for the exercise of civil rights and liberties. If a person is afraid for his life and the lives of his family, if he is afraid to go out during the evening hours, and has altogether stopped feeling secure, all talk of democracy, freedom, and so on turns into irritating demagoguery. When Yegor Gaydar slights the idea of state regulation all the more because the most powerful state sector exists and speaks scornfully about the "advocates of state," I want to repeat the jocular statement all of us know well: "Yegor, you are not right." First, the opinion of the people who in the course of the elections voiced dissatisfaction with the results of reforms cannot be ignored. The real weight of radical democrats in our society cannot be ignored, either. Second, as reforms are being carried out, we cannot forget about the people. With all the talk about "lobbying" and credit "infusions" into the agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and the fuel and energy complex, we somehow lose sight of the fact that tens of millions of people work in these sectors. We must not fail to think about their fate hiding behind generalities about the ineffectiveness of the state sector and the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system. At times, it seems to me that Gaydar and some of his colleagues have just forgotten where they live and work. In the country that is called Russia, millions of people have frequently agreed to certain death. However, in the name of what? Was it for "cash on the barrel?" No! It was in the name of an idea, but by far not the one known as the "American idea"--a nice house with amenities, a lawn, affluence, personal independence, dignity, and so on. The "Russian idea" is a spiritual idea. Frequently (if not always) it is steeped in utopianism and the setting of unrealizable goals. This is the root of many of our troubles. A change of values should take place which, in turn, should be a product of a more rational mass conscience, which is what happened with other (European) nations in their time. This process is already underway thanks to, among others, the "new Russians"; however, an entire stretch of social development will be needed for it to be completed. Nothing will work on the fly, in a cavalier fashion in this instance. Or else new values will be rejected and historically progressive reforms will fail, as happened in Iran under the shah. We are, after all, a nation of astounding extremes! Just as furiously as our grandfathers fought the "hateful" capitalism in the name of the unknown, enticing socialism, their grandsons are fighting socialism in the name of capitalism, having no real knowledge of either one of them. The whole point is that appeals to go back to a stern reality which is based on common sense cannot be as inspiring as appeals to press ahead and fight for an unknown bright future.
