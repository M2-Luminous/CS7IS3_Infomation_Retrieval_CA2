Compared with the results obtained in September 1992, when 10 percent said the standard of living had improved, this is a slightly positive trend. A total of 29 percent of respondents said in December 1993 that their standard of living did not change--32 percent of respondents responded the same in September 1992. In both cases, 58 percent of respondents described their standard of living as deteriorating. The polls have shown that people view the standard of living depending on political preferences, education, and membership in social and professional groups. There was a relatively higher percentage of respondents who said that their standard of living was improving in the group of sympathizers with the Movement for Democratic Slovakia sympathizers (25 percent) and the Slovak National Party (18 percent).
