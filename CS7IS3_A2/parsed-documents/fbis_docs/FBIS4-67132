He said that the number of drug-related offenses since January went up by 28 percent compared with the same period last year. "The lion's share of drugs is being smuggled via Gorno-Badakhshan into Kyrgyzstan and from there, to the whole of the Commonwealth of Independent States," Blinov said. As much as 60 kg of raw opium and 100 kg of marijuana was seized in the four months to May, or a mere 15-20 percent of what is smuggled in, he said. Blinov said Russian border guards and troops were also engaged in the drug trade. He put the number of such incidents occurring in 1993 at ten. Blinov said that one kg of raw opium fetched an average 150-160 million rubles on the black market in Moscow--but five to eight times cheaper inside Tajikistan. The Interior Ministry is due to start an operation to destroy illegal poppy plantations in two or three days, he said. However, Blinov said the main flow of drugs would come from neighboring Afghanistan because it was much cheaper and safer to cultivate drug-related plants there than in Tajikistan. In 1993, local police destroyed hemp and poppy crops on an area as big as 400 hectare as well as six tonnes of raw opium.
