FR940318-0-00189 FR940318-0-00023 Because this agent has an atmospheric lifetime of about 280 years and a 100-year GWP of 9,000, it is considered a potent greenhouse gas and should be handled accordingly. Since HFC&hyph;23 is typically a by-product of manufacturing and is not expressly produced for use as a fire fighting agent, EPA is allowing the use of this agent wherever applicable given technical or market considerations. However, in order to minimize unnecessary emissions of greenhouse gases, EPA recommends that users limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recover HFC 23 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroy or recycle HFC&hyph;23 for later use. In addition, EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions. (f) HFC&hyph;125. HFC&hyph;125 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. The cardiotoxic NOAEL for HFC&hyph;125 is 7.5 percent, and its LOAEL is 10.0 percent compared to a cup burner extinguishment concentration in heptane of 9.4 percent. While this agent would not be appropriate for use in normally occupied areas, it is not expected that human health would be threatened by use of HFC&hyph;125 in normally unoccupied areas. This agent has a weight and volume equivalence of 2.6 and 3.2, respectively. HFC&hyph;125 does not deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite its zero ODP, HFC&hyph;125 has an atmospheric lifetime of 41 years, and the highest calculated GWP (100-year GWP of 3,400) than any other HFC (except HFC&hyph;23) or HCFC currently planned for production as a halon or CFC substitute. (g) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HFC&hyph;134a has a cardiotoxic NOAEL of 4.0 percent, a LOAEL of 8 percent, and a design concentration of 12.6 percent. This compound is unlikely to be feasible as a total flooding agent in occupied areas because its design concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic level. Like the other HFCs, HFC&hyph;134a has an ODP of zero. It also has among the lowest GWP of the candidate 1301 replacements for which GWP has been estimated, with a 100-year GWP of 1,200 and an atmospheric lifetime of 16. Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that this substance is less effective than 1301. Systems that use HFC&hyph;134a will require approximately 2.5 times more extinguishant by weight and 3.1 times more storage volume than 1301 systems. (h) HFC&hyph;227ea. HFC&hyph;227ea is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. The final report on cardiotoxicity of HFC&hyph;227ea indicates that its NOAEL is 9.0 percent and that its LOAEL is at least 10.5 percent. EPA is accepting 10.5 percent as its LOAEL. Cup burner tests with heptane indicate that the extinguishment concentration for this agent is 5.8 percent, thus making its calculated design concentration 7.0 percent. These concentrations provide a sufficient margin of safety for use in a normally occupied area. HFC&hyph;227ea does not deplete stratospheric ozone. In addition, HFC&hyph;227ea is the most effective of the proposed HFC substitutes for Halon 1301. HFC&hyph;227ea can replace Halon 1301 at a ratio of 1.7 by weight and 1.4 by volume. HFC&hyph;227ea has a 100-year GWP of about 2,050, with an atmospheric lifetime of 31 years. (i) C 4 F 10 . C 4 F 10 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements: (a) due to their physical or chemical properties or (b) where human exposure to the agents may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating conditions. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the preceding discussion. In addition, because this agent can be used in high concentrations due to its cardiotoxicity profile, the design concentration must result in oxygen levels of at least 16%. Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that C 4 F 10 can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 5.5 percent and therefore has a design concentration of 6.6 percent. The cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration and therefore is safe for use in occupied areas. This agent has a weight and volume equivalence of approximately 3.1 and 3.0 respectively. Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 percent, the minimum level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgment or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 percent. This agent has an atmospheric lifetime of 2,600 years and a 100-year GWP of 5,500. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of C 4 F 10 , the Agency is finding this chemical acceptable only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. In most total flooding applications, the Agency believes that alternatives to C 4 F 10 exist. EPA intends that users select C 4 F 10 out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the requirements of the specific end use preclude use of other available alternatives.
