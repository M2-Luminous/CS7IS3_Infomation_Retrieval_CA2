This indicates that the people's inclination toward an independent Taiwan has been growing year by year, while the proportion of those opposed to independence, for the first time, fell below the 50 percent mark to 45.5 percent. Analyzed by backgrounds, the poll shows that support for independence is extremely strong in the southern part of Taiwan, namely 36.7 percent, while those opposing independence are in an inferior position of only 36.4 percent. This was the first time in public opinion polls on Taiwan that supporters of Taiwan independence outscored those in opposition to independence. The results of this public opinion poll possibly show the direction of present public opinion on Taiwan. However, since 25.4 percent of the population indicated that they would not say, had no opinion, or did not know; and because public opinion polls are inherently hardly ever 100 percent indicative of the true opinions of people when questioned on such a subject as the independence of Taiwan, there may be a margin of error. We may therefore only say that there is a trend of increasing support for Taiwan independence, and that this value --the hopes of the population of Taiwan to become an independent sovereign state--is increasing year by year. The people questioned in the said poll of course were also influenced by the "Ch'ien-tao-hu Incident" and by the dictatorial way the Chinese Communist authorities handled the case. However, a more weighty factor must be attributed to the fact that people on Taiwan, after the lifting of martial law, have pondered the gains in the unification-independence argument in view of the international standing of Taiwan and the future prospects of the country. It all boils down to three big factors here: The diplomatic predicament Taiwan finds itself in has the people most fervently wish that the status of the country be made evident as such in the international community. The way relations between the two sides of the strait have developed, the people of Taiwan recognize more accurately the disparity in their political-economic systems and in social and cultural respects, and wishes for reunification of China have dampened. Finally, it is also most important to note the progress in democratization and pluralism on Taiwan which has greatly raised their consciousness of self-rule, as manifested in that their ideas on state and nation tend of course toward becoming a dignified and respected state and nation by themselves, which, in turn, engenders the idea of being one life community by themselves. We are not surprised by the growing tendency for independence among the Taiwanese population, as revealed in the Gallup poll; it is a natural result of the democratization of the country. However, this kind of a public opinion trend deserves to be faced squarely by all political parties and political regimes. It is precisely as President Lee Teng-hui once emphasized: The sovereignty of a country rests with its people, and the position and development of the state must also be adjusted according to the direction of public opinion. The most important factor that will have an impact on Taiwan's future will, we are afraid, not be any one-way consideration of unification or independence, but rather, finally, the independent choice of the 11 million people. We hope the government and the public will combine all their common wisdom, will then gradually readjust the present state policy for unification, and will set their minds on a less disputed developmental road for the state.
