This issue was tackled with total neutrality by the thinker and writer John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality, in which he dwells on the issue of democracy. He wrote that part of the theory on the Islamic threat is the belief that Islam is historically hostile to democracy and tolerance. The author raises a number of points that influence this theory or belief. They are: The West's view of the Islamic Middle East is dictated by the need to guarantee its oil interests. Therefore, the West's route to stability in the Middle East does not pass through democracy but toward maintaining the status quo. Political realities in most Islamic countries in the world have never been ready for the development of democratic traditions and institutions. European colonial rule and the national governments that came to power during the post-independence era have added to a heritage that never cared for political participation or for building strong democratic institutions. Economic weakness, illiteracy, and high unemployment -- especially among the young generations -- have doubly aggravated the situation, undermined confidence in governments, and increased the attraction of any antigovernment slogans, regardless of these slogans' principles. History has taught us that the transformation of European political principles from rule that depended on divine right to democratic countries was accompanied by a reform process and a redirection from political individualism to the democratic notion. This means that the democratic notion did not stem from the core of European society but from the reform process that spread fully to all its structures, positions, establishments, and ways of life. Islam itself allows different interpretations. It has advocates of the democratic notion in the same way it has advocates of autocratic rule or rule by a minority. The trends that believe in democracy represent the normal course of things while the advocates of autocracy or rule by a minority are a transient and erratic phenomenon that does not have deep roots in these societies. John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality has thus analyzed the extent of the Western belief that Islam is hostile to democracy and tolerance. The fact is that democracy is not a cliche or a vague expression but an active mechanism that protects the nation from the autocrat's tyranny and sets up a control system that protects the nation from imbalance, errors, and corruption. This is the proof whether a regime is legitimate or not. It is based on a plurality of views, opinions, and stands. Islam essentially agrees with this and does not conflict with it. If there is something that creates the impression that Islam is the opposite of this, it is not Islam but those who nominally affiliate themselves to Islam, either rulers or ruled. They have tyrannized man and intentionally canceled or neutralized his role, while God Almighty has created man as a sane human being with a role that no other person can take away, with the right to participate in and influence the decision-making process. [passage omitted] Thus, the campaign by the media and some study centers in the West to depict Islam as the companion of antidemocratic terrorism is partly based on superficiality and on picking temporary phenomena like skin rashes as health symptoms. It is also partly based on intentional and premeditated conduct, whose architects understand that hostility to democracy is the behavior of individuals or groups -- both rulers and ruled -- and does not lie at the heart or essence of Islam. They also understand that it is in the political interest of the West itself to maintain the current situation, even if this demands that it squanders any opportunity to revive democracy.
