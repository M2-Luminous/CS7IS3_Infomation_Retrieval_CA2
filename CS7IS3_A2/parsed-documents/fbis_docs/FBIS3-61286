General Principles of Administrative-Territorial Division 1. This Provisional Statute establishes the general principles of administrative-territorial division of the city of Moscow as an entity of the Russian Federation and city of federal status. 2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the city of Moscow is formed by: the administrative okrug; the municipal rayon. 3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative unit whose system of organs of power is structured on the basis of centralized government. The procedure for government of the administrative okrug is established by a special statute approved by the mayor of Moscow. The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative okrug. The territory of the administrative okrug encompasses municipal rayons. 4. A municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit of the city of Moscow within whose boundaries self-government of the populace residing in the given territory is effected. Municipal rayons are formed taking into account the socioeconomic features of the applicable territories, their city-planning and historical characteristics, and the presence of residential buildings and facilities of municipal infrastructure. The borders and designations of municipal rayons are established by the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of the city of Moscow. A municipal rayon is divided into microrayons (settlements) in which organs of territorial public self-government may be created. The borders and designations of microrayons are determined by the organs of local self-government of the municipal rayon. II. Principles of the Organization of Local Self-Government 5. Local self-government in the territory of the city of Moscow is effected on the basis of this Provisional Statute, legislation of the Russian Federation, and normative acts of the city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the capital of the Russian Federation. 6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow are the municipalities, encompassing assemblies of representatives of the populace of a municipal rayon (municipal assemblies) and the head of the local administration (head of the municipality). III. Local Administration 7. The activity of a local administration is directed by the head of the municipality, who manages the municipal economy and property, develops an estimate of income and expenditures, ensures compliance with this estimate, and performs other executive and administrative functions. 8. The head of a municipality is appointed by the mayor of Moscow, upon coordination with the municipal assembly, from among a field of candidates recommended by the prefect of the administrative okrug. In the event a majority of the members of the municipal assembly fail to agree with the candidacy presented for the position of head of municipality, the mayor has the right to present this candidacy again or to present another candidacy. If the above takes place, upon failure of a majority of the members of the municipal assembly to agree with the candidacy presented, the mayor appoints an acting head of municipality within two weeks for a term of office of one year. The individual so appointed enjoys all the rights and bears all the responsibilities of head of the municipality. A head of municipality may not engage in other paid activity, except for instructor, scientific, scholarly, or other creative activity. 9. In the event of systematic failure to fulfill his responsibilities or gross violation of these, the head of a municipality may be discharged from his position by the mayor of Moscow, including upon recommendation of the prefect of the administrative okrug or based upon an appeal of the municipal assembly adopted by two-thirds of the assembly members. The aforementioned appeal is examined by the mayor within two weeks. 10. The head of a municipality issues directives on matters within his competence as established by Russian Federation legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 11. The city administration and municipal assembly have the right to supervise the activity of a head of municipality according to procedure as envisaged by Russian Federation legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 12. The procedure for discharging a head of municipality from his position and of appointing and discharging his deputies from their positions is determined by the mayor of Moscow. IV. The Municipal Assembly 13.

The procedure for elections to the municipal assembly and the number of municipal councilmen are determined by the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the municipality, who presides over the municipal assembly no less frequently than once per quarter, in order to examine draft resolutions he has proposed on the following issues: confirmation of the estimate of income and expenditures and the estimate compliance report; confirmation of the annual program (plan) for socioeconomic development and housing construction for the territory, and examination of the report on its implementation; confirmation of the procedure for management of municipal property; examination of other issues related to the jurisdiction of the municipal assembly. 15.

Resolutions are adopted by a majority vote of the municipal councilmen present at a session and are signed by the head of the municipality, except for resolutions regarding an appeal to the mayor of Moscow on a question of discharging a head of municipality from his position. 18. Resolutions of a municipal assembly adopted within the framework of its competence are subject to mandatory execution on the part of all enterprises, institutions, organizations, organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens located in the territory in question. In the event a resolution of a municipal assembly contradicts Russian Federation legislation or normative acts of the city of Moscow, or affects the interests of the city as a whole, it may be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or by a responsible official appointed by him. 19. A municipal assembly may be dissolved by the Moscow City Duma in instances stipulated by Russian Federation legislation, and also as the result of conduct of a local referendum on confidence in the assembly. A municipal assembly may adopt a resolution on early self-dissolution.
