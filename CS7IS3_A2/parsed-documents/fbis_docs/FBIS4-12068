FBIS4-12068 "drnes065_l_94019" FBIS-NES-94-065 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Shamgar Commission Continues To Hear Testimonies Shamgar Commission Continues To Hear Testimonies TA0304155294 TA0304155294 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew on 3 April carries several reports by legal affairs correspondent Mira Amsalem on the testimonies heard today by the Shamgar commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. At 0700 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Tzvi Katzover, head of the Qiryat Arba' Council. "Katzover warned that more acts of despair by individuals should be expected if the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] continues to desert the settlers, leaving them to fend for themselves. He denounced Goldstein's deed, saying that most residents of Qiryat Arba' disapprove of it, even if they understand the reasons that drove Goldstein to it. "Commission member Moshe Levi, a former chief of staff, asked Katzover whether the Qiryat Arba' Council had taken any action to get rid of people whom he suspects might carry out acts of despair. Katzover explained that the council had no authority to expel people, but that he had approached the commander of the Central Command and given him names of dangerous people." At 1100 GMT, the radio reports that "sewage truck driver Eli Ganon denied allegations that he had entered the Cave of the Patriarchs carrying an M-16 rifle and had thus confused witnesses trying to identify the weapon used by Barukh Goldstein." Ganon told the Shamgar commission that "he was not carrying a rifle on the morning of the massacre, but was only armed with a pistol. He added that he normally kept an Uzi submachine gun at home," and noted that "he did not see Goldstein on the morning of the massacre." At 1400 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Brigadier General David Agmon, the chief of staff's adviser on intifadah affairs. "His testimony centered on the question of how Barukh Goldstein entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and whether it was reasonable to assume that he had an accomplice. Agmon stated that in his first debriefing to the chief of staff he had noted that Goldstein walked into the cave through the main entrance, and not through a side door. In Agmon's opinion, Goldstein operated alone and was armed with a Glilon rifle which was found in the hall after the massacre. Nevertheless, Agmon said he had heard from soldiers that they were used to seeing Goldstein with an M-16 rifle. He rejected the theory raised by Justice al-Zu'bi that Goldstein's accomplice was carrying an M-16 rifle and a bag to collect spent bullets. Justice Shamgar also remarked that such a possibility did not appear reasonable to him. "Earlier, the commission heard the testimony of four of the 10-man group of worshipers Goldstein used to pray with. They confirmed that only shots, not explosions, were heard in the cave at the time of the massacre. A discrepancy was found between the testimony of one of the worshipers, Yosef Nagar, and his deposition to the police over the question of the place through which Goldstein had entered the Muslim's prayer hall. "Goldstein's widow, Miryam, failed to appear before the commission."
