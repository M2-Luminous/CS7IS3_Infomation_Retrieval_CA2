Agriculture and industrial exports dropped by 33.2 percent and the number of construction permits issued by the authorities fell by 15 percent compared with the average quarterly figures of 1993, Bank Audi said in the report. Activity at Beirut airport fell 20 percent and there was a 19.8 percent drop in the number of passengers, it added. The lack of credit offers and high interest rates on the Lebanese pound were seen as the main reasons for fewer real investments, the report said. Central Bank governor Riyad Salamah meanwhile blamed the slow-down on security fears and a wave of political turbulence that has gripped Lebanon since a church bombing in February killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54 others. The government has since arrested dozens of former Christian militiamen, disbanded the Lebanese Forces Christian party and placed its chief Samir Ja'ja' behind bars as part of an investigation into a 1990 political murder. It has also banned private news and television broadcasts until new legislation to regulate the media is drafted and approved by parliament, and reactivated the death penalty in measures to crackdown on security. The Bank Audi report was released before billionaire Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri decided on Sunday to freeze his political functions in protest over opposition for a government reshuffle. Al-Hariri's decision has plunged Lebanon into one of its worst post-war political crises at a time when it is seeking investments to rebuild the infrastructure wrecked by the 1975-1990 civil war. Lebanon's Central Bank has sold 115 million dollars from its reserves since Monday to bolster the Lebanese pound, which came under pressure following al-Hariri's decision. Economic experts meanwhile predicted that real investments will be kept on hold until the outcome of Arab-Israeli peace talks. "Investors are waiting to see the outline of Lebanon's economic role after Arab-Israeli peace is achieved," one expert said, noting that Beirut's fate depended on the decisions of Israel and Syria which deploy troops in Lebanon.
