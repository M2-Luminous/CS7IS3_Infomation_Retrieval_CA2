The ministry said the latest ratio is a 4 percentage point rise from the level seen in the July-September period. As for trimming the work force, 38 percent of the respondents cut overtime and 24 percent decreased or suspended new hirings. Seven percent temporarily closed factories, up 5 percentage points from the previous survey, and 2 percent called for early retirement or dismissed employees, an increase of 1 percent from the previous poll.

The ratio for companies in the wholesale, retail sales and restaurants industries, on the other hand, declined by 9 percentage points to 27 percent.
