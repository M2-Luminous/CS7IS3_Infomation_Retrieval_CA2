Introduction The NUCLEN Nuclear Power Information Database (NUCLEN File) was constructed and its services are provided by the Japan Information Center of Science and Technology (JICST). JICST, at the behest of the national government, developed this database for the purpose of promoting an understanding of nuclear power and its usage by making available to as broad a segment of the populace as possible information on nuclear power-related policies, technologies and educational programs. Services are provided in the online mode using the JOIS information retrieval system, which JICST developed on its own. In addition to NUCLEN, the following database services are also provided via JOIS: JICST Science and Technology Bibliographic File (JICST File), a broad-based collection of scientific and technological data in bibliographic form obtained from science magazines, conference proceedings and reports generated around the world; JMEDICINE, a Japanese medical bibliographic file comprised of medical-related documents; and the medical bibliographic file MEDLINE. The NUCLEN File was constructed around a core of nuclear power-related data extracted from the JICST File, to which was added government and public relations data. The NUCLEN File is an accumulation of data dating back to 1981, and as of June, 1993, contained roughly 300,000 data elements. This file is updated once every six months. The principal fields covered and number of data elements for each field are shown in Table 1. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

And a gratuitous translation service is also offered for foreign-language documents accessed via NUCLEN. 2. Accessing the NUCLEN File The NUCLEN File can be accessed online using a personal computer equipped with a modem connected to a telephone line. Table 2 lists 10 JICST branch offices that serve as access points for NUCLEN, plus the system can also be accessed from anywhere nationwide via the DDX and INS-P systems. Three baud rates -- 300, 1200 and 2400 bps -- can be used to access NUCLEN via JICST and INS-P access points, and two baud rates -- 300 and 1200 bps --are used to access it via the DDX system. The method for accessing NUCLEN differs depending on whether you use commercial off-the-shelf communications software or the dedicated retrieval software provided free of charge by JICST. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Dial the number to the access point. 2. Check to make sure the modem data lamp is ON, then press RETURN. 3. The message ``JICST NETWORK PLEASE ENTER (JOIS,STN,JOISF):'' will be displayed. Enter ``JOIS'' and press RETURN. 4. The message ``CONNECTED.. ENTER TERMINAL ID'' will then be displayed, at which time you simply press RETURN. 5. The message ``JICST ON-LINE SERVICE'' is then displayed. Input ``¥JOIS 000-5454, (your name),'' and press RETURN. 6. The message ``Password please U:$$$$$$$$'' will be displayed, at which point you input ``NUCLEN,'' and press RETURN. 7. Then the message ``S: Commence dialog U:'' will be displayed, and access is complete. After the ``U:'' input ``¥FILE 610'' to commence retrieval. (2) Accessing the System Using JICST Dedicated Retrieval Software The NUCLEN dedicated retrieval software is menu driven, and selecting ``G. Library Guide'' from the menu screen will bring up the retrieval screen. (It will take a little time for the menu screen to change to the retrieval screen since auto log in and auto dial operations must be carried out first.) And those who do not own personal computers can come in to any JICST branch office or cooperating agency and make free use of the dedicated software-equipped personal computers installed in those locations. Table 2 provides a list of addresses and telephone/modem numbers of JICST's branch offices nationwide. 3. Example of NUCLEN File Retrieval Operation Figure 1 provides an example of a retrieval operation in which a Japanese-language NUCLEN file was retrieved on the subject of ``Nuclear Power Generation Safety.'' Figure 1. Sample Retrieval Operation 4. Methods of retrieving NUCLEN Files Retrieval items are divided into primary and secondary retrieval items, and the methods for retrieving these differ. The number of data elements are displayed in the retrieval response together with the SSno. (retrieval step number). (1) Primary Retrieval Items Primary retrieval items consist of (1) all keywords, (2) category codes, (3) authors' names and (4) document titles. Each item has its own retrieval code, to which colons (:) are attached in order to retrieve them. [1] All Keywords Words contained in titles, abstracts, control words and etc. are compiled into what is called ``All Keywords.'' The retrieval code for all keywords is AL, but this code can be omitted. Sample input: U:Nuclear power generation When retrieving data on an item-by-item basis, then the all keyword code needn't be used. Use the individual retrieval codes for those items instead. The retrieval code for Japanese-language titles, as well as those which have been translated into Japanese from foreign languages is TI. Sample input: U:TI:Radiation The retrieval code for abstracts that summarize the contents of a document in 150-300 words is AB. Sample input: U:AB:Computers Control words, which make use of thesaurus terms to manifest the contents of documents, are used to minimize retrieval gaps. The retrieval code for control words is KW. Sample input: U:KW:Radium isotope Free term refer to important words that express the contents of documents, but which are not contained in the thesaurus. NUCLENSUB is provided as the free term for documents other than those extracted form JICST files. The retrieval code for free term is FT. Sample input: U:FT:NUCLENSUB [2] Category Codes Category codes are used when you want to make an all-inclusive retrieval of general concepts or when you can not obtain satisfactory retrieval results using all keyword retrieval operations. The principal category codes are provided in Table 1. The retrieval code is CC. Sample input: U:CC:NB03060 Z [3] Authors' Names When retrieving Japanese-language documents by authors' names, input these names in katakana last name first. When retrieving foreign-language documents in this way, input the author's last name first, followed by his first initial. The retrieval code for authors' names is AU. Sample input: A:AU:OKANO SHINJI [4] Document Titles Document titles are written in English (the titles of Japanese-language documents are written in roman letters) and are retrieved by inputting the individual titles. Sample input: U:JT:ENERUGI To increase the efficiency of retrieving primary retrieval items, you can make use of forward agreement retrieval, logic operations and proximity operations. You can use forward agreement retrieval operations when you want to retrieve other types of information related to your retrieval word, such as ``inspections'' or ``protection'' in relation to the retrieval word ``radiation.'' Simply input ``&'' after the retrieval word. Sample input: U:Radiation & Since there is always a lot more information available than you are able to find using a single retrieval word, ordinarily you retrieve information using two or more retrieval words. This is called a logical multiply or AND operation, and uses the word ``AND'' or an asterisk mark (*) to connect the retrieval word and SSNo. (retrieval step number). And when your retrieval word has a number of synonyms, you use a logical add or OR operation. The OR operation uses the word ``OR'' or a plus sign (+) to connect the retrieval word to the SSNo. Sample input: U:Nuclear reactor*non-destructive examination When you wish to carry out more precise retrieval operations than are possible using logical multiply (AND) operations, then you can specify the proximity relationship of retrieval words using a proximity operation. With a proximity operation, you input so that the proximity operator links the retrieval words together. There are four (4) kinds of proximity operators, [W], [N], [S] and [F]. The [W] retrieves information in the order that the retrieval words in front and back of it are input. The [N] proximity operator retrieves information associated with the retrieval words in front and back of it, but does so in no particular order. The [S] retrieves information that contains the input retrieval words in the same paragraph. For this purpose, titles are considered one paragraph. The [F] proximity operator retrieves titles, abstracts, keywords (control words) and other such items that contain the specified retrieval words (in which the retrieval words exist together). The proximity operators [W] and [N] cannot be input in Japanese (kana). An example of a proximity operation input would be ``U:JT:ENERUGI[W]KEIZAI'' (2) Secondary Retrieval Items When you want to focus the results of your primary retrieval efforts further by language, publication dates and such, then you conduct secondary retrieval operations. You always conduct primary retrieval operations before carrying out secondary retrieval operations. In secondary retrieval operations, you input the retrieval code followed by an equal sign (=). [1] Language Information is Written In When you want to limit your search to the language that the document is written in, then you specify that language code after inputting ``LN=''. The language code for Japanese is JA, and for English is EN. Sample input: U:LN=JA [2] Year of Publication When you want to limit your search as to the year documents were published, you input a four-digit year after the codes ``PD=''. You can also specify in or after a certain year by inputting a hyphen (-) after the four-digit year. Sample input: U:PD=1990- [3] Terms Found in Titles When you want to limit your search to documents with titles that contain specific words, then you input ``TI='' followed by a pair of ampersands (&) bracketing the specific word you are searching for. Sample input: U:TI=&uranium& (3) Output of Retrieval Results To display the results of your retrieval operations, input ¥P followed by the output format, a backslash (/) and the range of responses you wish output. If you do not specify the range of response output, then all items will be output. Output formats consist of ``A'' for all items, ``T'' for titles, etc. Sample input: U:¥P A/1-10 (4) To End Retrieval Operation End the retrieval operation by inputting ``¥END''. Sample input: U:¥END (5) Dedicated Software Retrieval When you use JICST's dedicated software to conduct your retrieval operations, everything is done in accordance with prompts so that there is no need for you to know the retrieval codes, language codes, etc. The dedicated software is also designed to prompt you through retrieval output and end operations. All of JICST's branch offices are equipped to handle inquiries regarding NUCLEN file retrieval operations, and applications for copies and/or translations of retrieval results. These offices also maintain supplies of applications for NUCLEN dedicated retrieval software (free), pamphlets and retrieval summary sheets, so please contact the JICST office nearest you to avail yourself of these forms and information.
