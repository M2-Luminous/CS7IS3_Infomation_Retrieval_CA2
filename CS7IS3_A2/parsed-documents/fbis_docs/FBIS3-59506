Behind this grand ambition are Ericsson's three main areas of business: -- It's AXE public switching systems -- Its cellular business (Ericsson is the world leader in cellular, with one of the most innovative systems) -- Its MD110 business network system. The company is hoping this combination will push it from a second to a first-tier position in telecommunications. Ericsson has a lot going for it, but the company has a long and difficult road to travel before it realizes its ambition. The company knows that all second-tier players have to try harder in today's cut-throat telecom marketplace. Ericsson has been trying harder, and has realized some admirable success, but it will have to make difficult and uncomfortable decisions in the near future, and allocate its resources very shrewdly, if it is going to succeed. In public telecommunications, the company has shown remarkable resilience, emerging from a recessionary climate in Europe and North America with the most impressive year in its history: installing 7.1 million local AXE lines and 2.9 million trunk lines in 1992. The company commands 13 percent of the Western European market, 15 percent of the Eastern European market, and 7 percent of the U.S. market (up from 2 percent in 1990), and has easily defended its 14 percent share of the lively Chinese market and its 33 percent share of the Latin American market. In mobile communications, Ericsson has managed to maintain its 40 percent world market share since the early 1980's, well ahead of its closest competitor. The company leads with 58 percent of the European market, holds third place in North America with 20 percent of the market, and commands 40 percent of the Latin American market. Ericsson is the only manufacturer to have developed systems for all the three international standards (U.S.A., Europe and Japan), guaranteeing it universal acceptance. Mobile communications order booking in 1992 jumped 58 percent from 1991, and the company remains at the forefront of system and product development. Even Ericsson's PBX [private branch exchange] business, which has experienced sporadic ups and downs over the years, managed to increase sales by 31 percent in 1992, owing largely to increased sales activity in China. The company installed 1 million lines in 1992 and now has a total of 6 million lines installed worldwide. The company has successfully rationalized its worldwide manufacturing; has restructured its organization, entrusting core competencies (technology development and marketing) to its regional operations; and has successfully undertaken company-wide cost-cutting measures. These factors have all contributed to its recent impressive results. The company reported a profit of SEK428 million [Swedish kronor] (US$60 million) in first-quarter 1993 compared with a loss of SEK363 million (US$51 million) for the same period in 1992, and its order backlog was the highest in its history. (The exchange rate used throughout this report is SEK7.1 = US$1.) Ericsson has aggressively pursued research and development. The company delivered its ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] and Intelligent Network (IN) products in 1992, continues to develop the transport network products (ETNA) that it introduced in 1991, and is pushing forward with its operations and support systems (TMOS) and ATM-based [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] research. However, this commitment to R&D has had its cost. The company spent 16 percent of its sales on R&D in 1992 in the face of a drop of 46 percent in net income for the same period. This Herculean effort, however, pales beside competitors such as Siemens, whose net R&D commitment for the same period (11 percent of its sales) was over three times Ericsson's. Ericsson has entered into strategic alliances with Televerket (the Swedish PTT), General Electric, Hewlett Packard, and Texas Instruments. These alliances have provided Ericsson with resources that would otherwise be unavailable to it, but this too has had its cost. Ericsson does not own any of the technology developed in these alliances, and in the increasingly interrelated world of telecommunications has found itself sleeping with strange bedfellows. For example, Ericsson has a joint venture with Toshiba to install and service cellular telephony in Japan. Toshiba also has an alliance with Motorola (Ericsson's arch-rival in mobile communications) to develop DRAMS [dynamic random access memory]. Motorola and Ericsson entered into a joint licensing agreement for their GSM [Global Systems for Mobile Communications] patents. (Motorola entered into similar agreements with Cellnet in the U.K. , Alcatel, Siemens, and with Ericsson's French partner, Matra.) Ericsson's mobile partner in the U.S.A., General Electric, is developing network software for Motorola's IRIDIUM project. Obviously, all of this partnering can lead to some sensitive situations. It is not uncommon for telecom players to team together, especially in increasingly costly R&D. However, Ericsson does not have the capital resources of its competitors to build on this teamwork to deploy proprietary technology that could yield strong strategic advantages. For Ericsson, all this collaboration is only keeping it in the game. The company has also "given away" some of its more impressive technology, as when it licensed its PBX portable business phone to its arch-rival Siemens (and, by extension, to Rolm). No doubt Ericsson will come up against its own technology in its competitors' hands when it vies for critical contracts in the U.S.A. and Mexico (crucial and precarious markets for the company). Ericsson is a company known for responding to the marketplace, not for dominating it. The company is gambling that the merger of public switching, mobile telephony, and private networks will place an increased emphasis on networks and software applications. In this scenario, hardware becomes increasingly less important. This may explain why the company has maintained a single product line for so many years. This approach to the market requires substantial and sustained R&D -- something the company cannot afford. Entering joint ventures and sharing R&D costs with customers is a clever way of dealing with the situation, but it is not the policy of a technology innovator and leader. Also, what is to deter Ericsson's competitors from doing the same? They certainly have the resources. In short, Ericsson's approach has its short-term advantages, but it must be questioned as a long-term strategy. Ericsson's most recent successes are to a great extent the result of the company's historic ability to move into new markets quickly, not necessarily because of its technological innovation. The company's impressive performance in China is in response to a huge new market. The company's success in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former East Germany, is again in response to a new market. The company's advances in Spain, Mexico, and Australia are primarily the result of the expansion and revitalization of networks in regions where the company has an established presence. In mobile telephony, the company has seen increased orders in expanding markets: China, Southeast Asia, and Eastern and Western Europe. But Ericsson has always been a leader in mobile, and will take its fair share of any expanding market. The company's "systems house" approach (whereby Ericsson transfers the latest technology from other computer and software vendors to PTTs [Post, Telegraph and Telephone Authorities], providing customized products for its customers) has already begun to bear fruit in the U.S.A. The company has gained acceptance with five of the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating Companies] and MCI. Ericsson's sales in the U.S.A. decreased in 1992 primarily due to severe price pressure -- a difficult pill to swallow for a company without the large resources of its competitors. Mobile sales have shifted from the U.S.A., which had been the company's major market for cellular telephony, to Europe over the past three years. Europe now accounts for 43 percent of Radio Communications sales, while the U.S.A. accounts for 29 percent (down from 42 percent two years ago). Ericsson's new attempt to enter the U.S. market is proving difficult. The U.S.A. is one of the most demanding markets in the world, and is undergoing dramatic changes. Even Siemens, with all its muscle, is finding it difficult to get its bearings. Ericsson must succeed this time in the U.S.A. if it is to fulfill its ambition and move up to the first tier of telecom suppliers. It remains to be seen if Ericsson can do it alone. The company tacitly acknowledged the difficulty when it entered into joint ventures with GE and, recently, Hewlett Packard; but these alliances are concentrated in niche markets. It is also interesting to note that Ericsson is buying out its partners in these ventures (it has increased its holdings in both), suggesting that the company views these alliances as short term. The company's ace in the hole is its mobile telephony operations. Ericsson has effectively parlayed its advantage here into public switching, and is trying to do the same with private networks with its mobile business phone. In the short term, Ericsson can continue to take advantage of the expanding markets to push its mobile technology. However, this is not going to guarantee Ericsson a place at the table. Ericsson will need a strong partner to ultimately succeed in the U.S.A., and if the company is to make a stand in public switching and PBX in the recently liberalized markets, it will need something more than innovative mobile telephony. It will need the financial muscle to stand firm against increasing competition and pursue its proprietary R&D. It will need resources that we do not currently see on the company's balance sheet to develop and deploy a global technology embracing mobile, public switching, and private networks. We do not suggest that the company's recent successes are not representative of long-term growth, but they are better viewed as a reward for being a shrewd player in the right place at the right time. In the current unsettled telecom environment, only companies with a clear vision of the future and ample resources will succeed. Ericsson has the vision, and the company is a survivor. We do not question its ability to remain a formidable player in telecoms, but we do question its ability, within the confines of its present resources, to move itself up to the first tier of telecom suppliers without help. Until then, the company will have to resign itself to enjoying a seat near, but not at, the head of the table. Perhaps it was said best back in 1923 by B. Wahlqvist, an employee of Ericsson in Spain, who remarked after Ericsson lost the Spanish concession to ITT: "...as you see, there should be no shortage of work for some time. The question, apparently, is how to find the capital to join in the competition." Business Areas Until year-end 1992, Ericsson had six business area (BAs): -- Public Telecommunications -- Radio Communications -- Business Communications -- Cable and Networks -- Components -- Defense Systems In January 1993, these BAs were reduced to five. Cable and Networks was split, with cable operations merged into Components and networks operations merged into Business Communications to form a new business area, Business Networks. Of the six business areas operating in 1992, all but two (Components and Defense Systems) were directly and exclusively involved in telecommunications. In 1992, the four BAs exclusively engaged in telecommunications accounted for 94.7 percent of the company's sales. This ratio has remained relatively constant for the past three years. In 1990, these four BAs accounted for 94.9 percent of sales. The company's decision to concentrate on those activities directly related to its core business -- telecommunications -- made in 1986, when these four BAs accounted for only 85 percent of sales, has remained unchanged. The recent reduction in the number of BAs to five is a further indication of the company's dedication to this strategy; the reduction further consolidates the corporate organization within the company's core business. To further distinguish it from its competitors, Ericsson is for all practical purposes a single-product company centered around the AXE public switch. The AXE was introduced 20 years ago, and the company has continued to develop new products based upon the AXE's core platform. The company's cellular systems are also based upon the AXE platform. While this focused product line has allowed the company to streamline operations, particularly manufacturing (the AXE is modular and is manufactured in "mother" plants and then shipped to assembly plants around the world for installation), and offers economies of scale unavailable to most of its competitors, it also presents risks. The failure of any key component, a delay in delivering new products based on core technology, or a serious manufacturing glitch can have far-reaching implications for the company. The two business areas (BAs) not directly related to the company's core business (Components and Defense Systems) have been retained for strategic purposes. Components is engaged in the development of advanced microcircuits and components. Most of the development is done in cooperation with U.S.-based Texas Instruments. The investment necessary to develop advanced microelectronics is beyond Ericsson's resources. Therefore, this teaming with TI has guaranteed the company access to the necessary customized technology and large-scale production facilities critical to its public switching and cellular businesses. The Components BA is also constructing a manufacturing plant for small-scale production for new products during their start-up phase. In 1992, 59 percent of Components sales were to other Ericsson business areas. Defense Systems provides radar, systems computers, and display equipment, primarily to the Swedish and Norwegian Defense Forces. This is a niche market in which the company has been involved for many years. In addition, the Defense Systems BA is engaged in R&D related to digital mobile telephony, high-frequency radio technology, and broadband communications. This R&D is "purchased" by other business areas. Public Telecommunications accounted for 36 percent of Ericsson's sales and 36 percent of its 1992 profits. Radio Communications accounted for 32 percent of the company's sales and 39 percent of 1992 profits. The third largest BA, Cable and Networks, accounted for 14 percent of 1992 sales and 11 percent of profits. Business Communications, the fourth-largest BA, accounted for 13 percent of company sales, but just 9 percent of profits. Components accounted for 2 percent of sales and 1 percent of profits. Ericsson traditionally groups Public Telecommunications, Radio Communications, Business Communications, and Components into the category of "telecommunications systems", which it uses in reporting its results. These systems accounted for 85 percent of the company's profits in 1992. This grouping is somewhat misleading, since the company's Cable and Networks BA was a serious element in the company's core business, but is not included in this category. Ericsson obviously believes it should be, as is evidenced by its decision in January 1993 to divide this business area among two other BAs that are included in "telecommunications systems." When the Cable and Networks BA is added to the company's telecommunications systems, these systems account for 96 percent of Ericsson's sales and Profits. Financial Analysis After entering the 1990s with record sales and profits, Ericsson has hit a rough patch in the road. Sales remained flat from 1990 to 1991, and profits dropped from SEK3,450 million (US$486 million) in 1990 to SEK886 million (US$125 million) in 1991. Sales increased slightly in 1992, but profits declined to SEK479 million (US$67 million). Over this same period, Ericsson's debt ratio has been increasing and liquidity has been deteriorating. While Ericsson could obviously use the help of a strong financial partner, especially for tough-to-crack markets like the U.S.A., the company's financial position is not catastrophic. Order bookings are at record levels, and the company, with its streamlined global product line, is well positioned to ride any upswing of economic activity in its major markets. It should be noted that the Swedish krona lost some 20 percent of its value against major international currencies when it was allowed to float in the fourth quarter of 1992. According to Ericsson, the change in exchange rates will have little immediate effect on Ericsson's financial position because its operations are fully hedged, and because international clients are billed in local currencies. The long-term consequences of the devaluation will be largely beneficial to Ericsson: Sweden, its home market and the site of its manufacturing "mother" plants and main R&D facilities, is emerging as a low-cost zone, compared to the situations of competitors such as Alcatel and Siemens, whose core operations are based in "strong" currency countries, i.e., France and Germany. Ericsson's Private Networks Business Ericsson has been shepherding its Business Communications business area for some time. In 1985, Business Communications represented 31 percent of Ericsson's sales and had an operating income of SEK806 million (US$113.5 million). By 1987, Business Communications had reduced its work force by 8,000 employees and its operating income loss to SEK2 million (US$281,700). Yet it still accounted for 29 percent of Ericsson's sales. In 1988, the BA restructured, selling 80 percent of its Data Systems Division to Nokia and all of its Office Equipment Division to Design Function A/S. It also announced that it would shift production of its telephone instruments from Sweden to Southeast Asia. 1988 marked a watershed for Business Communications. While it now accounted for only 11 percent of Ericsson's sales (most of what it gave up, Mobile Communications took over), it was holding its own and showing some encouraging signs of growth. The BA's sales jumped 28 percent in 1989. Through manufacturing rationalization and clever marketing, it managed to maintain 23 percent growth in 1990. It suffered a loss in 1991 (-23 percent growth) under increased price pressure and a weak economic climate, but went on to increase sales by 31 percent in 1992, despite a continued tough economic environment. It appeared that the company had finally found the right formula for Business Communications; yet in January 1993, the company undertook the most radical restructuring of the BA to date. In Northern Business Information's 1991 report on Ericsson, we asked if the company would do better to direct its limited resources to Public Telecommunications, Radio Communications, and Cable and Networks; casting off Business Communications. Ericsson obviously disagreed, and has regrouped its resources from Business Communications and Cable and Networks into a new business area -- Business Networks. The company claims that this new BA is a reflection of the corporate-wide restructuring that it undertook in 1991. However, the synergies that the company expects the restructuring to yield are not readily apparent, and we cannot but wonder if the company is reorganizing, as it has in the past, in preparation for a spin-off of the new BA. Business Networks consists of the Business Communications BA plus the networks part of the Cable and Networks BA. Cable was spun off from Cable and Networks to the Components BA. The new Business Networks BA has seven business units: -- MD110 Communication Systems with 4,500 employees and SEK3,399 million (US$478.7 million) in sales (1992); -- Small Business Systems with 1,200 employees and SEK1,010 million (US$142.3 million) in sales (1992); -- Data Networks with 700 employees and SEK686 million (US$96.5 million in sales (1992); -- Business Mobile Data Networks with 300 employees and SEK29 million (US$4.1 million) in sales (1992); -- Fiber Optics with 90 employees and SEK132 million (US$18.6 million) in sales (1992); -- Network Engineering with 2,600 employees and SEK1,382 million (US$194.6 million) in sales (1992); -- Ericsson Engineering with 4,200 employees and SEK2,865 million (US$403.5 million) in sales (1992). The MD110 Communication Systems, Small Business Systems, and Data Networks business units were part of the former Business Communications BA. Business Mobile Data Networks was originally a Major Local Company reporting directly to corporate headquarters in Stockholm. Business Mobile Networks, located in the Netherlands, is responsible for the development, manufacture, and sales of Ericsson's new Digital Cordless Telephone system, DCT900 (Freeset). Part of Network Engineering was transferred from the old Cable and Networks BA and merged with the network company Ericsson Business Networks, AB, which was originally part of the old Business Communications BA, to create the new Network Engineering business unit. Fiber Optics consists of the hardware units (opto welding, terminal products, and sensor systems) from the original Network Engineering and the Optical Network Research Center, Ericsson Sielte is an Italian subsidiary (Ericsson Sielte S.p.A.) originally associated with Cable and Networks and engaged in traditional network operations in Italy and other countries. The new BA has 50 subsidiaries and affiliated companies worldwide and is headed by Lars Berg, past head of the Cable and Networks BA. Business Networks is intended to target a newly defined customer base requiring system solutions that draw upon the unique capabilities of the old BA and the synergies made possible by the merger. Ericsson believes that the traditional network activities of the network sector and the traditional business communication activities of the Business Communications BA can be combined to provide new kinds of services to a new set of customers. The new BA's ability to work with many customers competing with traditional telecom operators in a limited market, to provide a wide array of technical solutions, to function in a decentralized and customer-oriented environment, and to deliver unique solutions in short carry-through times will give it an advantage over its competitors. However, the competition is steep and the market is unsettled, with potential customers viewing technology evolution as a reason for caution. Selling a solution in this environment will put very serious demands on Ericsson. How seriously the company considers the task ahead is underscored by its delay in appointing a head to its new Network Engineering business unit. This unit will include a special function to deal with the identification of new customers and markets for the entire BA. The company is looking for the right manager, one who will be able to be creative and take a lot of pressure. While the BA was formally created as of 1 January 1993, it is not expected to be completely functional until the spring of 1993. Business Communications has performed well. The MD110 is an established product that has found strong acceptance with many PTTs, including those in Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Mexico, and the Netherlands. Of special interest is Telefonica's (Spain) virtual private network utilizing the AXE and the MD110. Ericsson maintains a strong presence in many parts of the world. It increased sales in Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Australia last year, even though it faced a very difficult economic environment and increased price pressure. It has also targeted China as a major market. Since its first major sale of MD110 there in 1988, it has managed to keep up the pace, and now commands 25 percent of the Chinese market. China is also Ericsson's largest market for the MD110 in terms of volume, with over 65,000 delivered lines. The company showed great cleverness and determination in this all-important market; it developed a special version of the MD110, the DRX1, which can be used as a public exchange in rural areas while traditional public networks are being built. After completion of the public networks, the DRX1 can be quickly moved and installed elsewhere. While Ericsson has held sixth place worldwide in PBX sales for the past few years, it has shown itself to be a sly player. Sales increased sharply last year (31 percent over 1991), primarily due to sales of the MD110. Ericsson prides itself on its direct customer experience and its ability to provide advanced network applications. As the division between PBX and public switching becomes increasingly blurred, Ericsson sees an opportunity to parlay its public switching presence into PBX sales. It did this in Australia by setting up an ISDN network using eight AXE switches and selling MD110s for business applications. The company's recently announced collaboration with INTEL to develop communications platforms allowing telephony, video communication, and data transfer in a single "call" accessible on a PC further underscores its determination to be a total system provider. Of course it is not the only player with this ambition, and it does not command the resources of many of its competitors, but its global player status guarantees that it will remain a competitive threat. Mobile communications is probably the overriding reason for Ericsson to stand firm in PBX. The company's undisputed global presence and ambitions here permeate not only Business Communications' (Business Networks') ambitions, but Ericsson's overall global strategy as well. Ericsson is betting that the mobile business communications market will take off as the mobile residential and mobile public network markets did in the 1980's. The company premiered its digital cordless telephone, the DCT900 (later renamed the Freeset), at the 1991 CeBIT trade show. Soon after, it launched the product in Sweden, Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. The company also committed itself to a speedy adaptation to the European DECT [Digital European Cordless Telecommunications] standard, which was finally adopted in July 1992. However, in an unusual twist, the company also "gave away" the technology by entering into a joint marketing agreement with Siemens, giving Siemens worldwide marketing rights to Freeset. Ericsson has established itself as one of the major powers in mobile communications. It has created and maintained strong positions in public cellular, paging, mobile radio, and mobile data. The company commands a 40 percent world market share for mobile telephone systems, and is a market leader in analog-to-digital conversion. More importantly, Ericsson has shrewdly merged its switching system with its cellular radio systems and is doing the same for the MD110. For example the company is participating in the preliminary work on PCS (Personal Communications Systems) in the U.S.A., and is a leading supplier of PCN (Personal Communication Networks) in the U.K. All the pieces are, therefore, in place for an impressive global telecom network. Whether Ericsson can realize this on its own remains to be seen. The increasing demands on the company's R&D budget could force it to seek an alliance with Bosch or, more adventurously, with Northern Telecom. Of course, any partnering would create its own set of problems. It would upset the clean product line in place at Ericsson and the rapid response possibly only in a company the size of Ericsson. Private Network Products The MD110 is the core of Ericsson's private network product line. Since being introduced in 1988, the company has installed, or placed on order, over 6 million lines in over 50 countries. Ericsson's BCS 90 line of business communications systems is targeted for small organizations requiring up to 70 extensions. The BCS 150 is another system, targeted for small to medium-size businesses, that offers voice, data, messaging, and information-handling capabilities. In March 1993, the company announced interface capabilities between the MD110 and IBM's CallPath Services Architecture (CSA), allowing full interface between MD110 and IBM computer-based databases through the MD100 Applicationlink. In late 1992, the company announced similar interface capabilities with Tandem's Call Applications Manager (CAM) computer-to-switch interface. The company expanded its relationship with vendors of network management products through an agreement with Hewlett Packard to develop another network management system. The company also announced in 1992 a new accounts manager package for the ERIPAX X.25 wide area data network system. Ericsson is committed to developing the MD110 to the end of the decade and beyond. The company regularly releases new products and enhancements. In 1991, the company's worldwide development organization released its second global product, BC 6.0, which was developed at the company's design centers in California, Sweden, and Australia. Ericsson's global approach to product development has reduced its costs and, more importantly, allowed it to introduce new products in several new markets simultaneously. In 1992, the company announced a new release for its business switch, BC 6.3. The new release offered several additional services: -- Extension Manager V.3 allows a telephone call to be shifted from one extension to another from a personal computer attached to the switch. -- VAX Account allows a personal computer to complement a larger VAX computer when maintaining accounts. -- VAX Directory allows an operator to see on a computer screen who has gone to lunch, is attending a meeting, etc. -- ACD/MIS [Automatic Call Distribution/Management Information System] Multisupervisor monitors queues of calls and directs them in an economical way. One of the advantages of the Ericsson product line is its simplicity. It is a primary platform on which the company is committed to developing new features and capabilities within a migration strategy, allowing existing customers to upgrade to new releases, features, and applications. The company has plans for two new generations of products: BC 7 and BC 8. Features planned for the BC 7 generation of products (1993-1994) include: -- 2B+D Trunk Interface (ETSI [European Telecommunications Standards Institute] ISDN-compatible) as a private or public interface; -- Enhanced call center with new ACD functionality; -- Enhanced integral RVA [Recorded Voice Announcement] functions, including customer ID; -- Voicemail, RVA integration with host computers, application link providing voice banking, etc.; -- Digital POTS [Plain Old Telephone Service]; -- DECT-standard cordless telephone support; -- Widebank N*64K switching providing wideband applications such as videoconferencing, LAN [Local Area Network] connectivity, and multimedia applications; -- Integral voice compression; -- Premises broadband switching (25 gigabits). Features planned for the BC 8 generation of products (194-1995) include: -- Universal network transparency; -- Full ETSI/ISDN for voice, DAT [Digital Audio Tape], and virtual networking; -- ETSI/ISDN terminal interface; -- New PC OP9 console and centralization of peripherals; -- TAU 2680 data terminal. The company has targeted vertical markets for the MD110, developing application packages for one market and then transferring them to other markets. The company's global R&D structure facilitates such an approach by allowing each market to concentrate on its specific customer requirements, providing new products as tested and successful (association selling). The vertical markets targeted to date are: -- Educational institutions -- Municipalities -- Banking and building societies -- Utilities -- Airlines -- Financial institutions and services -- Health authorities -- The insurance industry -- Retail marketing -- Public transport Sales in Private Networks Table 3 shows that private network sales dropped from SEK5,106 million (US$719.2 million) in 1989 to SEK4,870 million (US$686 million) in 1991, then rose to SEK6,293 million (US$886.3 million) in 1992, a CAGR of 7.2 percent. The increase in 1992 was primarily due to increased sales of the MD110; over half of Business Networks' sales were for the MD110. In 1991, Business Networks sales accounted for approximately 10 percent of all of Ericsson's external sales. In 1992, the BA accounted for 13 percent of the company's external sales. This is an impressive accomplishment, especially since Business Networks has confronted serious price pressure. 1992 performance was also positively affected by the acquisition of majority interest in the Austrian company Schrack, and by strong sales in Germany. Business Networks saw its best sales performance in 1992 in Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Mexico. China also proved to be a fast-growing market. The company now holds a 25 percent market share for PBX in China. The largest markets for the MD110 are in Europe: Sweden (48 percent), Spain (44 percent), Italy (12 percent), the Netherlands (17 percent), and the U.K. (6 percent). The company also has a strong market presence in Germany and Eastern Europe. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ericsson Private Network Sales by Product Line, 1989-1992 (SEK millions) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sales by pr-|1989 |1990 |1991 |1992 |CAGR | |oduct Line: | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MD110 |2,910 |3,587 |2,873 |3,902 |10.3% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other Subsc-|1,021 |1,259 |925 |1,133 |3.5% | |riber Excha-| | | | | | |nge | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone I-|460 |566 |341 |441 |-1.4% | |nstruments | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Data Networ-|357 |441 |390 |441 |7.2% | |ks | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other Produ-|357 |441 |341 |378 |1.8% | |cts | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PBX and Rel-|4,340 |5,349 |4,252 |5,513 |8.3% | |ated Total | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KTS Total |306 |378 |278 |340 |3.5% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Terminals T-|460 |566 |341 |441 |-1.4% | |otal | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Private Net-|5,106 |6,293 |4,870 |6,293 |7.2% | |works Total | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Source: Northam Business Information Estimates) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The full report was published in July 1993 and contains a detailed analysis of Ericsson's divisions, products, and financial results.
