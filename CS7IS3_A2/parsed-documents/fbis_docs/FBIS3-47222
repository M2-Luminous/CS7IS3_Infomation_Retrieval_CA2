The officials said they want the government to call off the project. Japan is the only major country with a nuclear power generation program which has not abandoned or postponed its attempt to develop a fast breeder reactor. The Greenpeace experts have been in contact with groups in Fukui Prefecture opposed to the fast breeder since their arrival in Japan in October. The plutonium-fueled Monju, which is operated by the power reactor and Nuclear Fuel Corp., is on the Sea of Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. Naoki Ohara, a Greenpeace Japan executive director, said the organization's strength lies in its ability to gather information worldwide and then apply it locally. "We consider (the fast breeder) to be unsafe and we want to halt its operation," Ohara said. Fast breeder reactors use reprocessed plutonium as fuel but produce more plutonium than they consume. Monju has the capacity to generate 280,000 kilowatts of electricity. Construction of a full-scale fast breeder reactor is also scheduled to begin around 2000. The United States has halted its fast breeder program because of the low cost of uranium and as a measure against the spread of nuclear weapons which rely on plutonium. Britain and Germany have also decided to halt their programs. France's super Phoenix fast breeder has been out of operation since July 1990 after a series of problems, including the leaking of air into the coolant. But the Japanese Government plans to have Monju reach criticality in April, followed by about 18 months of experiments to confirm its operating capability, leading to full operation by December 1996. Japan's plan to ship 30 tons of plutonium for its fast breeder program from Europe over the next 20 years has sparked concerns in countries which fear accidents or terrorist attacks.
