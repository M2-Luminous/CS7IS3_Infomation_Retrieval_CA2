The source added that the airplane, registration TG-CAC and piloted by Gerardo Poitevan, carried 18 delegates, including Dr. Sergio Viva Scheel, a UN human rights consultant. This fact was later corroborated by Hugo Leon Mejia del Aguila, the human rights office assistant in Nebaj, Quiche. The visitors witnessed the attack and saw how the rebels fired indiscriminately without regard for the fact that civilians were present in a flagrant violation of human rights, the Army report states. The Guatemalan Army reported that this attack shows once again the guerrillas' lack of respect for the sacred right to life. After the rebel attack, the visiting delegations traveled without further incidents. The delegates did say they would report the event at the international level because the URNG's criminal action exposed its lack of political willingness to promote peace, the report concludes.
