The province has leased nearly 2,300 telephones, over 2.5 times higher than the number of phones at the time the province was separated from the former province. Nearly 600 of these telephones -- nearly 25 percent of the total -- have been installed in remote areas and areas occupied by ethnic Khmer compatriots. Tra Vinh is the first province to have 100 percent of its villages and districts covered by a digitized telecommunication network. The Tra Vinh Post and Telegraph Service plans to install about 5,000 to 5,500 more telephones by the end of this year, including 800 to 1,200 sets to be leased to rural areas.
