However, we have not lost hope that the crisis will soon blow over so the state's constitutional institutions may again become active with the participation and cooperation of the partners in the coalition government to implement the document, ease the burden on the population, and build the modern Yemeni state on modern foundations that will ensure the sovereignty of law and order, enhance the role of institutions, nurture respect for constitutional legitimacy, respect the will of the people, and be bound by the principle of a peaceful and democratic rotation of power. In this effort, we must emphasize our commitment to inviolable and sacred national parameters, notably unity and democracy. Unity is the source of the people's strength and is a guarantee for stability, advancement, and national prosperity. On this occaion, we renew the call for all disagreements, contradictions, and problems to be ironed out through the channels of democratic, objective, and sober dialogue, and reason and wisdom. The homeland is not the exclusive property of any one individual, party, or group. Nor has anyone the right to claim custodianship over unity, the people, or any part of the homeland. Unity is our people's communal property. We will not squander our unity no matter what the price. He is in error who thinks that the solutions to problems lay in undermining unity or taking the homeland back to the era preceding 22 May, 1990. The wheels of history have moved forward and will not turn backward. The solution lay in rectifying behavior and mistakes and taking a determined stand against all kinds of corruption and the embezzlement of public money, the due process of law, accountability, putting the general good of the homeland before narrow or party interests, dissociation from parochial affiliations, and desisting from stoking regional, tribal, and other tendencies. The yardstick by which faith in the unity of the homeland must be measured is action to advance the unity of the people. This is because no homeland cannot remain united unless its citizens share a common will and unless their loyalty to their respective parties or regions takes second place to their loyalty to their homeland. The homeland is a trust that we must keep; the protection of unity is a sacred national duty. None of us should take lightly any attempt to tear up our country's unity or plunge it into sedition or war. It is an unforgivable crime for a Yemeni to kill his Yemeni brother or for Yemeni blood to be shed by Yemeni hands. Therefore, it is every Yemeni patriot's sacred duty to speak up against whatever may heighten tension or trigger armed conflict. Brother Citizens: My visit to Egypt and the United Arab Emirates during the last week of the holy month of Ramadan was an opportunity for me to meet with brother President Muhammad Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. The talks I had there were positive and useful both for our bilateral ties and for joint pan-Arab action. The two brotherly countries emphasized their full support for Yemen's unity and deep concern for its security. We deeply appreciate Egypt and the UAE and other Arab brothers for their brotherly stands and the way they relate to our country's concerns. In the name of all our people, on this happy occasion, I send my greetings to all our Armed and Security Forces personnel, who have consistently proved up to the sacred national responsibility, which they are shouldering with courage, devotion, and patience. They shall always watch over our unity, freedom, and democracy and faithfully stand guard over our national sovereignty and all the gains scored by the people. To the best of their ability, they shall distance themselves from all political differences and disputes. This is because by staying loyal to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity, they thus remain above all partisan differences and disputes. I repeat my congratulations on the 'Id. God's peace and mercy be upon you.
