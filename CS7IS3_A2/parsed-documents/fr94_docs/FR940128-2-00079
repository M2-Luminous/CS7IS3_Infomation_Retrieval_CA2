Take notice that on January 14, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 164, to be effective January 1, 1994. ANR states that the above referenced tariff sheet is being filed to replace First Revised Sheet No. 164, filed on December 1, 1993. Such sheet was changed to comply with the conditions of ordering Paragraph (A) of the Commission's Order dated December 30, 1993 that ``pipelines should determine new customers' load factor and access the surcharge for each month based on the actual throughput for each prior month of service until a 12-month history is established.'' Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before January 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this application are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
