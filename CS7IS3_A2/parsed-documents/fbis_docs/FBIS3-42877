Yeltsin"] [Text] The text of the Constitution put to the referendum on 12 December 1993 revives the authoritarian system in the Russian Federation. Granting the president dictatorial powers, the Constitution leaves Russia defenseless in the face of the ill will or caprice of both its present and future rulers. The most flagrant violations of the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian Federation (with subsequent revisions) and the 1990 Referendum Act were perpetrated at the time of the referendum on the draft Constitution. According to the 1978 Constitution, a referendum may be held only in the procedure established by the Constitution and laws of the Russian Federation (Article 5). The referendum on adoption of the Constitution of 12 December 1993 was conducted in the manner established by a subordinate edict of an official. According to the Russian Federation Referendum Act, it is essential for the adoption of a constitution or revisions to the Constitution to obtain a majority vote of the total electorate. The Constitution was "approved" by the votes of less than one-third of those eligible to vote. Serious violations were perpetrated also in the organization of the referendum itself. The election commissions formed by the executive, which substituted for the legitimately elected authorities, spoke in support of the Constitution and thereby called into question the objectivity of the vote count. In consideration of what has been said, we declare that: The Constitution of 12 December 1993 cannot be deemed legitimate or valid. The Federal Assembly elected on the basis of Edict No. 1400 is operative, as specified by the president, until the adoption of a new Constitution of Russia. The Constitution should be elaborated and adopted by a constituent assembly, a law on the elections for which should be adopted by the Federal Assembly. We see this as the sole possible way to the building of a genuinely democratic and just constitutional system. Signatories to the statement: V. Aksyuchits, M. Astafyev, S. Baburin, V. Bondarchuk, Yu.
