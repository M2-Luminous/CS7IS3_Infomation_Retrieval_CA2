According to data from the republic's Institute for Preventative Medicine, last year there were 561 cases, as opposed to 922 in 1992. The Director of the Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Dr. Dusko Panev, cautioned that brucellosis remains a serious problem in the republic. In view of the unquestionable effect of the struggle against the spread of this animal disease among humans, there will not only be a continuing campaign against it in the forthcoming period, but also a determined "plugging" of some "cracks" in the defensive lines. First and foremost, explained Dr. Panev, the number of opstinas [townships] and inhabited places where the disease has been registered does not show such a great decline. More precisely, if in 1992 brucellosis was in evidence in 177 inhabited places within 22 opstinas, last year the disease "climbed" in 150 inhabited places within 19 opstinas, in other words, it remained present on the territory throughout the republic. In the previous period, the "hottest" places were the districts of Strumica (133 as opposed to 154 cases in 1992), Radovis (103), Valandovo (45), Skopje (59), Kumanovo, Veles...[as published] In contrast to the still problematic private sector, the social sector is much more effective in the struggle against this animal disease. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the reasons for the spread are most often connected with contact of the individual producers and through the consumption of impure milk and cheese from goats and sheep. According to Dr. Panev, "Despite all the effort, it is still possible to find milk producers at the market who do not have adequate safety certification. And it is exactly from such food items that people have become ill with brucellosis in the past few years. Earlier, this disease was a job-related illness of herdsmen and veterinarians. But now, the victims are those who have not observed commonly accepted preventive measures, (pasturizing milk and cheese) both among families raising livestock and those supplied by them." The struggle against brucellosis is a complex, longterm process that may take several decades. Since 1980, when the disease appeared here in epidemic form, the main forces in the eradication campaign have been veterinarians and health workers. Dr. Panev explained that, last year alone, medical personnel carried out more than 13,000 serological tests and more than 14,000 medical examinations, placed 426 inhabited places under medical supervision, and visited 1,184 sites.... With early detection of the disease and the use of effective medicines, the intensity and the channels through which the disease is transmitted from one medium to another are localized and defenses are established. In this area, cooperation with veterinary bodies is exceptional. Meanwhile, the "gates" have opened a little for some other organizations whose participation is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the effort. Foremost in this respect are the police organzations that are often overlooked in the transportation of livestock; they should be demanding the compulsory "veterinary" certificates which are shown for exactly these reasons. The services should also provide compensation for the sick animals that are destroyed. But when the "injured parties" are humble, it is not surprising that some shepherds see the solution to their problems in marketing products from sick animals in a neighboring villages or opstinas.... This cycle, in any case, must be stopped.
