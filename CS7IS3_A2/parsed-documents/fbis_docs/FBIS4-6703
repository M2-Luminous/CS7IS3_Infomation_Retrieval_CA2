FBIS4-6703 "dreas077_a_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Farmers Protest Imports of New Zealand Apples Farmers Protest Imports of New Zealand Apples OW2004084194 Tokyo KYODO in English 0605 GMT 20 Apr 94 OW2004084194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Farmers gave free apples to pedestrians in Tokyo's Ginza District Wednesday [20 April] to protest imports of apples from New Zealand. The first batch, a sample consignment of some 50 kilograms, was due to arrive at Narita Airport on Wednesday. Some 100 tons of New Zealand apples will arrive by ship in mid-May. Apple imports were liberalized in 1971, but with only minor exceptions were essentially banned, with agriculture officials citing risks associated from insects possibly arriving with the imported apples. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, however, cleared New Zealand apples for import last June. Japanese apple growers are now attempting to devise ways of producing apples at equally competitive prices. The apples given to Ginza pedestrians came from Aomori Prefecture in northern Honshu, where much of Japan's apple crop is grown. Ginza pedestrians receiving the free apples were told they risk ingesting residual agricultural chemicals if they eat imported varieties. Wednesday's imports, a variety known as "Royal Gala," are a sample batch brought in by the New Zealand Embassy for testing. Consumers will not find New Zealand apples on supermarket shelves until late May. Apples from the United States are also expected in Japan in autumn. Transport and insurance costs for the Royal Gala apples will effectively put them in the same price range as locally grown ones, but future bulk imports are expected to result in price drops.
