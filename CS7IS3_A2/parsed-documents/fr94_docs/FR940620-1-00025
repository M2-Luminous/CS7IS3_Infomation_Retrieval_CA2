FR940620-1-00025 FR940620-1-00006 In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. IV. Collection of Information Requirements Sections 435.10 and 436.10 of these proposed rules contain information collection requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We estimate that any State plan amendments required by these provisions will take a total of not more than 50 hours total. A notice will be published in the Federal Register when approval is obtained. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. V. Response to Public Comments Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are unable to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the COMMENT PERIOD section of this preamble to the final rule.

The January 19, 1993 rule made numerous changes to the organization and numbering of the Medicaid regulations. Therefore, we have reprinted the provisions in order to set forth appropriate text for the provisions of this proposed rule. The effective dates for the January 19 final rule have been delayed (58 FR 9120, February 19, 1993; 58 FR 44457, August 23, 1993; and 59 FR 8138, February 18, 1994). If at the time we issue the final rule for these proposed regulations, the reprinted text has been revised or is not in effect, we will make appropriate changes to ensure that the existing CFR text is reflected. 42 CFR chapter IV, subchapter C would be amended as follows: A.
