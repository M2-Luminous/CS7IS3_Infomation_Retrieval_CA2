The aim of the meeting is to exchange opinions on journalism and the world order. In response to many questions Jovanovic informed his guests, from 36 countries which are taking part in the meeting, about the basic principles of Yugoslavia's foreign policy and the plans for the period after the sanctions are lifted. He also explained the course of the Yugoslav crisis, with a special comment on the Bosnian conflict. "Our main commitment and the basic principles of our foreign policy are peace, a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis, and especially the Bosnian conflict, the lifting of the sanctions and eventually a complete reintegration of the FRY into international trends," the Yugoslav foreign minister said. According to Jovanovic, when the sanctions are lifted, Yugoslavia is ready to assume an active role in the integrational processes not only in the Balkans, but also in Europe. He mentioned one of the provisions of the Yugoslav Constitution whereby all those who seceded can rejoin the FRY, if they wish to do so. "We are open, not closed to others." Asked by a Romanian journalist what the neighboring countries could do to speed up the lifting of the sanctions, Jovanovic said: "The sanctions are not only the consequence, but also a cause of the Yugoslav crisis. They are a cause because, unless they are lifted, there will be no peace in Bosnia." Jovanovic went on to say that the sanctions "have a deadly effect on certain countries in the region." He said that the neighboring countries could contribute to the lifting of the sanctions if they treat them as their own problem, not only as Yugoslavia's problem. This means that they should request an explanation from the Security Council about the actual purpose of the sanctions. Serbian-Croatian relations was one of the issues raised at the news conference. "Relations between Serbia and Croatia have been the key to stability in the Balkans ever since the beginning of this century," Jovanovic said. "We are aware of this fact in the current crisis, too. But we did not want this crisis. On the contrary, we had been constantly warning of its consequences. Regrettably, the Croats strove to bring about crisis, which resulted in heavy conflicts between the two peoples. Our intentions are clear. We expect Croatia to demonstrate goodwill in the full normalization of relations." In this context Jovanovic was asked about the division of inherited assets between the former Yugoslav republics and the FRY. "First of all, the division of assets should be separated from our right to continuity. The process of dividing assets is taking place within the Geneva Conference. It is unfortunately making very slow progress. The reason behind this is the fact that the FRY insists that all the rights and obligations pertaining to the division [of assets] should include everything that stems from 1918; in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia everything that stems from the Balkans wars. The seceded Yugoslav republics insist on dividing what had been created together since the 1974 Constitution". The reporters were interested in the media war against the FRY. "We have lost the media war without taking part in it. This is in a way a result of our mentality since we believe in the truth and are incapable of peddling lies to the world." A reporter from Israel asked Jovanovic about Yugoslav-Israeli relations. Jovanovic said that since the end of World War II Yugoslavia's foreign policies were formulated and carried out by people from the western half of the country. He noted that Tito, Kardelj, Bakaric, Vrhovec, and Loncar had been the chief designers. "Serbian politicians were not influential in formulating foreign policies," Jovanovic said and added: "For example, the decision to break off diplomatic relations with Israel was taken by Tito at a time when he was visiting the Soviet Union. Marko Nikezic opposed this but he was ignored." "We are sorry if Israel thinks that the FRY is responsible for the suspension of diplomatic ties in 1967. I would like to remind you that, even before the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic tried to exert influence on Yugoslav foreign policy, but he failed to do so because of the dominance of people from the western part of the country." "We want Israel to open an embassy in Belgrade as soon as possible," Jovanovic said. In conclusion Jovanovic commented on the latest efforts to solve the Bosnian conflict. He said Belgrade supports efforts leading to peace, and in that context he stressed the importance of the recent Geneva meeting of the five foreign ministers from the EU, Russia, and the United States. "It is commendable that the five foreign ministers are trying together to search for peace. It is commendable that they have gone back to the European plan, and that they agreed there would be no solution to the Bosnian conflict unless the sanctions are lifted. We believe that the meeting of the five would have been more successful if they had adopted a clearer position on the sanctions. I assert that the Bosnian Muslims will sign a peace agreement two weeks after the lifting of the sanctions."
