The latest crisis over enlargement of the EU this week is a case in point. The admission of Austria, England, Norway and Sweden contributes a key building block in the future European Union. According to sublime theory the Union could, by the end of the decade, stretch from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic to the borders of Russia. But, thanks to a ridiculous Norwegian/Spanish dispute over approximately 7,000 tons of cod and arcane objections by the British to proposed changes in voting powers in the Council of Ministers, the entire enlargement project could yet collapse. The British government, which has consistently championed the expansion of the Union, now risks being seen as the main architect of its downfall. In striking contrast to recent speeches emphasising "Britain at the heart of Europe," the British government has decided to turn the debate about the precise level at which countries should be able to block majority decisions into a great issue of principle. In so doing, ministers have provided Euro-sceptic MPs with a new cause to boost their flagging crusade against EU and revive internecine warfare in the Tory party. John Major could find he has just handed a loaded revolver to his Euro-sceptic enemies which will be used against him in the run-up to the crucial European Parliament elections. Against the strong advice of Foreign Office professionals who concluded weeks ago that the UK could not get its way over the votes issue, cabinet ministers insisted on pursuing their cackhanded tactics. Douglas Hurd and his colleagues may now have to choose between a humiliating climbdown or standing firm. This might not only endanger enlargement but would certainly alienate both EU partners and potential allies among the candidate countries. The row with Norway over Spanish fishing rights may be sorted out soon. But if the 32 cannot agree -- primarily with the British -- on just how the new voting rules will work in the Council of Ministers when the Union grows to 16 members, enlargement may be postponed to 1996 or even abandoned. Restive members of the European Parliament have already warned they will not ratify the accession treaties if thc voting issue is not resolved or if a solution is found which makes majority voting more difficult. If the British get their way this is precisely what will happen. The wider implications of the collapse of EU enlargement could be enormous. The governments of the four applicant countries already have a major fight on their hands convincing their voters to support EU membership in referendums to be held later this year. If their membership bids have to be shelved, public opinion in the Nordic countries could turn very hostile to any future European entanglement. If the EU cannot agree terms for admitting countries as similar as Austria amd the three Nordic states, what chance of their absorbing the Hungarians, the Poles and others in East Europe who already seek EU membership? If they too are rejected, some in Central Europe will turn their back on the West and make peace with the growing forces of Slav nationalism in Russia as is already being canvassed in Slovakia and Bulgaria. The repercussions in Germany could also be alarming. Chancellor Kohl -- and the Social Democrat opposition -- have defended the goal of a more federal EU against their critics precisely so that it is best placed to respond to the needs of Central and East Europe. If enlargement is pushed off the agenda, those already urging Germany to turn its back on European integration and to take a stronger "national" line towards the East will become more strident. So why should the British (and to a lesser extent the Spanish) put all this at risk? UK ministers can fairly point to a bias in the present voting system in the Council of Ministers which over-represents smaller countries. The sensible reform would be to allocate votes in the Council more strictly in proportion to population. Reformers have also advocated that majority decisions in the Council should not only require a majority of votes but enough countries which, between them represent an overall majority of the EU population. Logical as it may sound, this approach conflicts with ideological British Conservative hostility to a more democratic federal EU. Instead, the UK has focused obsessively, not on making majority decisions more representative but on strengthening its own power to block decisions on workers' rights, social standards and the environment. The threatened disaster over enlargement will make the reformers more determined that the 1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty should entrench a democratic majority vote system. This can be underpinned with a formal EU constitution which would prevent one country vetoing the right of others to move to a deeper political Union. Major could hardly object since he negotiated the British "opt-out" from the European social chapter and the single currency at Maastricht. It is a precedent which the British may regret since others in the EU are now determined to build on it.
