FR941007-2-00019 FR941007-2-00006 Comment 4: Application of BIA/``All Others'' Rate to Respondents Who Did Not Sell Subject Merchandise to the United States During the POI Respondents request that the Department not apply the ``all others'' rate based on BIA to the ten PRC companies that responded to the Department's November 4, 1993, survey advising that they had not shipped the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI. Because the ``no-shipment'' companies responded to the Department's survey and were cooperative, respondents argue that the Department should modify the ``all others'' rate with respect to these companies. Respondents note that the Department did not issue further questionnaires to these companies or otherwise indicate that these responses were considered to be incomplete. Moreover, respondents assert that the Department was not precluded from verifying the statements of the ``no-shipment'' companies. Respondents cite Olympic Adhesive, Inc. v. United States, where the Court of Appeals Federal Circuit held that ``a `No' answer is a complete answer.'' Therefore, respondents contend, these ten companies complied with Department regulations and should not be given the same BIA rate as respondents which refused to respond to the Department's questionnaires entirely. Respondents argue that these companies should be considered cooperative respondents and should not be assigned a margin based on BIA. Instead, respondents request that these ten companies be given a margin based on a weighted-average of the other participating exporters' margins. Petitioners assert that respondents' request that the Department modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment'' companies should not be granted. First, petitioners state that the Department's recent determinations involving the PRC assigned companies a rate based on the highest margin stated in the petition because the companies in question were unable to show entitlement to a separate rate. Petitioners contend that claims by these PRC firms that they did not produce or sell paper clips exported to the U.S. during the POI is not factual information that can be used by the Department to calculate an appropriate antidumping margin. Petitioners further argue that any reference to the use in past cases of a weighted-average of other respondents' margins are inapposite, because the cited determinations do no discuss a method for assigning an antidumping duty rate to companies which did not submit factual information. In addition, petitioners state the 1991 determinations cited by respondents have been superseded by more recent decisions by the Department, in which the highest margin alleged in the petition was selected for firms deemed ineligible for a separate rate. Petitioners also maintain that the respondents' assertion that the application of the highest margin alleged in the petition to the no-shipping firms constitutes punitive ``BIA'' is incorrect. Petitioners counter that the Department regulations authorize the reliance on factual information submitted in support of the petition, if the Department does not receive a complete, accurate, and timely response to its request for factual information. Given the lack of factual information from the non-shipping firms, petitioners maintain that the Department properly assigned to those firms an ``all others'' rate based on factual information from the petition. Finally, petitioners argue that to give the non-participating firms a rate based on an average of separate rates assigned to the respondent exporters would reward companies that remained outside of the Department's investigation. Such firms, by not participating, would actually receive a margin that is lower than half of the responding firms which submitted factual information. DOC Position We agree with petitioners. Even though the ten companies reported that they made no sales of subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI, the companies did not take the opportunity to answer the ownership and government control questions presented in the November 3, 1993, survey and/or complete the Separate Rates attachment of the Department's questionnaire, which the Department issued both to PRC government agencies and directly to all but one 6 of the ten companies. The companies did not respond to the Department's requests for factual information in an accurate and timely fashion. On the contrary, the companies did not submit any factual information pertaining to their respective ownership and control status to demonstrate that they are eligible for a separate rate. Therefore, we reject respondents' request to modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment'' companies. 6 One company was not issued a questionnaire despite being named in the petition because there was no indication that it had shipped subject merchandise to the United States during the POI.
