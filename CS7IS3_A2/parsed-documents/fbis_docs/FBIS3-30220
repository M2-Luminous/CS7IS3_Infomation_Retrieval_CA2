The correspondent of the AN Newspanorama interviewed him at Ferihegy Airport. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Mr. Zhirinovskiy! You have been traveling a lot lately. Are you also planning a visit to Hungary? [Zhirinovskiy] I have an invitation here too, but I am invited to so many European countries now that I cannot yet tell when I can come here for a longer time. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Who invited you? [Zhirinovskiy] Journalists, public figures, economists, and public organizations. Besides, I have already been to Hungary as a student in 1966. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Personally, with whom or with what political parties do you have contacts? [Zhirinovskiy] With Janos Kadar.... [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] That is the past; what about today? [Zhirinovskiy] Actually, I have no contacts with anyone. I met with the representative of your liberal party in Helsinki in 1990 and we exchanged a few letters after that meeting, but that is all.... You know, the Hungarian liberals received a lot of money from the German liberals before the elections of 1990 and this helped them gain good positions at the elections, so they thought they would not need anyone. However, things did not turn out well for the Hungarians, because they have a lot of problems now. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Why do you think so? [Zhirinovskiy] No one wants your Ikarus buses; these buses fill the air with smoke. These buses are not even required by us any more, and the West does not want Hungarian goods either. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your opinion, what would be the correct road? [Zhirinovskiy] To build up an Eastern community by making use of the former CEMA and Warsaw Pact contacts. Naturally, I think exclusively of economic and cultural cooperation, without communists and fascists. If we create our own Maastricht and our own Strasbourg, we will be able to compete with the West. No doubt, we will be better than the West with our economic reserves and potential. Then, you Hungarians will also be strong and free, not like now, when the old contacts have disintegrated and the West does not show any haste in opening the door for you. We should not throw out the good things. We must modernize the contacts in the new situation. [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Could Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit have a positive effect on these contacts? [Zhirinovskiy] Absolutely. We must restart the system that is advantageous for both sides. In my opinion, there is only sense in a regional cooperation, like a Danube region cooperation. There is no need to knock at the doors of the West, on foreign doors, and ask to be accepted in order to clean their boots and wash their cars. I hope you do not want NATO units to replace the former Soviet troops in Hungary and start feeding them now. Or do you want NATO soldiers massing it up in bars and pestering the girls?
