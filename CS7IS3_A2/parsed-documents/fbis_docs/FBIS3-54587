The President Rabbani's sources quoting the General Committee member of HIA (H) [Hezb-e Eslami Afghanistan, Hekmatyar Faction], Ubaidollah Serat said that the latter along with other 15 central leaders of HIA (H) and announced their dissociation from the fighting terming an alliance with communist Rashid Dostam as unholy one. Those they claimed dissociated from the fighting also included Deputy chief of HIA (H), Qazi Amin Waqad, central leaders Munshi Majid, Hussain Deljo, Qazl Najiullah and Prof Zara. They also claimed that they had destroyed seven MIG planes of Rashid Dostam, Wednesday [26 January] took over more three posts from him in the north-east of Kabul city while 15 personnel fleeing from the latter's command were arrested by Maulavi Saddiqullah of Harekat-e Eslami [Islamic Movement]. They, however, said that rockets were continued to be fired at Kabul city throughout the day while in Baghlan Province the Commander of 54-Brigade of Rashid Dostam, namely Mohammad Ullah Nagar Joined Shora Nazar of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, besides 500 personnel of HIA (H) led by commanders Abdol Ali, Jalal and Mirza Rahim also joined Mas'ud forces along with their weapons. In Paryab province they said to have captured a huge quantity of heavy weapons from Rashid Dostam's forces. On the other hand the HIA (H) has termed the visit of Najibollah Lafraie to Islamic Republic of Iran as very personal and should not be therefore, considered as a minister of state of Afghanistan. "Mr. Lafraie cannot speak on behalf of the government or state of Afghanistan nor he was empowered to sign any contract or memorandum or agreement on behalf of the government of Afghanistan". They further alleged that an amount equal to 70 million dollars in different currencies was looted by the government forces when they captured Sraj Shahznda from HIA (H) and Jonbesh-e Melli forces. However, the commission appointed by President Rabbani headed by Gen Fahcem said in Kabul that according to its report the money changers had withdrawn their amount before they repulsed the attacks of HIA (H) and Jumbashi Milli. Meanwhile, the Council for Understanding and National Unity of Afghanistan (comprising renowned commanders, tribal elders and noted religious scholars) have welcomed the UN Security Council's statement calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities. In the open letter to the UN Secretary General, the Council noted with concern that for more than three weeks bloody battle was raging in the around Kabul where hundreds of innocent men, women and children were being killed mercilessly every day and forcing more than one hundred thousand defenceless Afghans to flee Kabul city in the severe winter. The Council noted with regret that the UN Security Council's statement fell short of calling for an immediate cessation of foreign interference which was the root cause of the ongoing human tragedy in Afghanistan for in fact, intense and continuing foreign involvement in Afghan affairs by friendly and unfriendly powers as well as a myriad of well-financed fundamentalist organisations has precluded Afghans from finding their own solution. They firmly believed that a Loya Jirga [Afghan Assembly] would have national legitimacy representing a broad spectrum of Afghan society lending to a broad-based political structure acceptable to the Afghan people. The letter said the Loya Jirga being a built-in mechanism in the traditional Afghan society has deep roots in the Afghan culture and it is an effective time honoured instrument for conflict resolution. The Council informed that it would not approve of the recent Pakistan's proposal for convening a regional conference on Afghanistan if it does not aim at calling for the UN involvement to promote a political settlement to the Afghan conflict. For the Afghans, the letter said have had highly disastrous results from all foreign brokered and sponsored accords namely the Peshawar Accord of April 24, 1992, the Islamabad Accord of March 7 1993, and the Jalalabad Accord of May 25, 1993, aimed at installing a fundamentalist dominated government in Kabul.
