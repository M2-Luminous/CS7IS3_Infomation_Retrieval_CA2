The project will use a 76 million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank, part of the 500 million U.S. dollar loan supplied by the World Bank for the 1993-1995 fiscal year to help China reform its housing and social security systems. Under the project, a stock company for housing development has been formed between the Chengdu Seamless Stainless Steel Tube Factory, the Jinjiang Motor Factory, altogether 13 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and two government bodies, with a total of 50,000 employees. According to the agreement, housing for these participants totalling 600,000 square meters in floor space will be owned and managed by the new company. The new company will combine housing rentals with loans from the World Bank for housing development to relieve participants from housing problems and help them improve their operation mechanism, official sources said. To raise more funds, the new company will raise the per-square-meter-floor-space rent to 7.5 yuan for existing housing and 10 yuan for new homes. The selling price for each square meter of floor space will be 1,050 yuan, only slightly higher than the costs, according to the sources. Sharing the 500 million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank are four other cities, including Beijing, Yantai, Ningbo and Guanghan.
