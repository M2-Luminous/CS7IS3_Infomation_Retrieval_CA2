FR940706-0-00034 FR940706-0-00002 In this case, a flight demonstration of satisfactory deployment would be required unless a reliable method of analysis is available. The FAA agrees with the commenter that the wording of the proposal infers that the flight demonstrations are required for each airplane model receiving the STC. This was not the FAA's original intent with these special conditions. The FAA agrees with the commenter that the GARD system is intended to add a means of preventing a catastrophic crash when all other means of recovery are exhausted or made inoperative. To this end, this system adds to the overall safety of the airplane. Therefore, the FAA agrees with the commenter's approach to different airplanes with similar characteristics. The commenter also believes that special condition 1(b)(3) should state: Maneuvering speed with 2g normal load, not Og normal load. The original flight tests included a 60 degree bank turn with a 2g normal load for one deployment condition. Essentially, the deployment condition was the airplane turning into the parachute deployment. The test evaluated both deployment during a turn and the force of the ballistics to eject the parachute away from the airplane in a way that would allow it to open. The possible concern was not having enough load on the parachute to properly inflate the canopy. The results on the original GARD&hyph;150 were satisfactory. The FAA's reason for requiring the Og test was to evaluate additional deployment loads against the airframe limits. In re-evaluating this requirement, the FAA believes that data from static tests and the stall condition deployment will adequately address the concerns. Additionally, since the 2g test requirement from the original GARD system was satisfactory, the FAA finds no reason to evaluate the opening during a 2g turn on each airplane that requires deployment testing. A 2g acceleration is the same regardless of the type airplane. If the GARD system had the force to fire the parachute away from the airplane while the airplane was turning toward the parachute, then the results should be the same for other airplanes. The commenter thought that there should be an option of placarding the operating limitations as an alternative to testing at the never exceed speed 1(b)(i)(4) and in inverted flight for aerobatic aircraft 1(b)(ii). Satisfactory deployment would be demonstrated at a maximum placarded deployment speed with 1g normal load. This maximum placarded deployment speed should be greater than or equal to the structural cruising speed of the aircraft. The FAA conducted a thorough evaluation of the first system to be STC'd on a certified airplane. The FAA's interest with follow-on modifications to similar airplanes is primarily to investigate deployment at the airplane's limits. It is realistic to expect pilots to deploy this system in an inadvertent spin, at minimum speed (stall), and at the never exceed speed. By testing at these limits, all conditions in between are covered. The only exception might be high g loads from aerobatic airplanes. Any situation where the GARD system is deployed will either be 1g or less (i.e., normal gliding flight through spins), or completely unloaded, or tumbling from a structural failure. It is not reasonable to expect any applicant to test for the tumbling after a structural failure. In an out-of-control situation (structural failure), the airplane could quickly reach its never exceed speed. So the requirement to deploy the GARD system at the never exceed speed will remain. However, since the argument for aerobatic airplane has been presented, including the operational reality of an inverted deployment, the FAA agrees with the commenter that the merits of requiring the test are far outweighted by the cost to conduct the test. Therefore, the option of placarding against operating the GARD system during aerobatics is supported. Conclusion In view of the design features discussed for the Ballistic Recovery Systems General Aviation Recovery Device (GARD), the following special conditions are issued. This action is a rule of general applicability and affects small general aviation airplanes with characteristics similar to those identified in these special conditions.
