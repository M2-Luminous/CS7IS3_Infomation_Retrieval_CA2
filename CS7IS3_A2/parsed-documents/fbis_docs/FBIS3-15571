Aleksandrov: "Russia Is Again Being Taught How To Live"] [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has made a statement in Congress which as so far failed to attract the attention in our country which it undoubtedly deserves. The statement is about Russia and its relations with the countries of nearby foreign parts. Acknowledging that the concern expressed by Moscow over the position of the 25 million Russian-speaking citizens living outside Russia in the countries of the former Union should not be considered "unnatural," the secretary of state nonetheless made it extremely clear that concern is one thing but attempts to resolve effectively the many problems which the Russian-speaking population are encountering in the Baltic states, for instance, is something quite different. These attempts, it emerges from Christopher's statements, cannot be made except with the consent and even the authorization of international institutes and forums and best of all with the agreement of the United States itself. There is no denying that what Moscow undertakes should, as Christopher notes, accord with the letter and spirit of international laws. But another of the secretary of state's important premises cannot fail to give rise to dispute and keen doubt: Even in those situations where a request is made to Moscow by those countries of the former Union "where Russian troops are deployed and the request is for help in safeguarding and preserving peace, Russia cannot respond unilateral to such requests but only in some kind of cooperation with the United Nations or, for instance, the CSCE," Christopher stated. Russians, the chief U.S. diplomat repeated, have the right to appeal to adjacent states "to be concerned for the position of Russian-speaking citizens and to display generosity with regard to them but the United States will resolutely oppose Moscow's adoption of any powerful steps in this direction." A detail of some importance: Christopher made his statement in response to President Yeltsin's recent speech to Russian parliament. The speech spoke clearly enough of Russia's right to involve itself actively in the development of the situation in the former Union with a view to ensuring stability and the protection of Russians. The secretary of state commented with some scorn on these passages in the Russian president's speech, describing them as something aimed primarily at "a domestic audience." This speech, Christopher reported, is still being studied in Washington but Washington is prepared to issue a warning right now to Moscow on how it should behave. In the most unequivocal terms. In my view in the warnings which are now being heard from Washington it is easy to discern an attempt by the Clinton administration to preserve the status to which Russia has been reduced in recent years, particularly by virtue of the chaos, lack of thought, and often simply shortsightedness of our diplomats' actions. The status which Washington automatically guarantees Washington its own absolute superpowerdom on the world arena probably suits the United States completely. It can hardly suit Russia, nor should it. Everything is the way it was before. Is that not so? It seems to me that Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have a serious talk about this with Christopher when they meet 14 March in Vladivostok, where the secretary of state is going as part of his Far East tour.
