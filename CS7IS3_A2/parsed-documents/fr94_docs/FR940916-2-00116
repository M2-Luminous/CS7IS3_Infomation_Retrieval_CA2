FR940916-2-00116 FR940916-2-00089 Federal Aviation Administration [Docket No. 27782] Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed policy; extension of comment period and statement of intent to issue supplemental notice. SUMMARY: This document announces an extension of the comment period on Notice of Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges, Docket No. 27782 (59 FR 29874, June 9, 1994) until October 15, 1994. By a notice published August 10, 1994, the comment period on the Notice of Proposed Policy was extended until September 15, 1994 (59 FR 41194, August 10, 1994). As a result of enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization act of 1994 (1994 Authorization Act), the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA) have determined that the publication of a supplemental notice of proposed policy may be in order. This notice is being published to advise interested persons of the intention to publish a supplemental notice and to provide for an extension of the comment period to permit commenters to review and respond to the supplemental notice in their comments. DATES: The comment period is extended from September 15, 1994, to October 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed, in quadruplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Dockets No. 27782, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. All comments must be marked: ``Docket No. 27782.'' Comments on this Notice may be examined in room 915G on weekdays, except on Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Barry Molar, Airports Law Branch (AGC&hyph;610), Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;3473. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' (Rules of Practice) proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994). The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August 23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions providing new policy guidance on the reasonableness of airport rates and charges and that direct the Secretary of Transportation to adopt guidelines, policies and procedures for resolving air carrier/airport disputes over the reasonableness of landing fees. The 1994 Authorization Act directs that such guidelines, policies and procedures be adopted within 90 days after enactment. The 90-day deadline is November 21, 1994. One air carrier has already suggested that the current notice of proposed policy should be withdrawn as inconsistent with the 1994 Authorization Act. We do not agree that the 1994 Authorization Act requires so extensive a revision to the notice of proposed policy. However, based on initial review of the new statutory provisions, some modifications to the proposed policy may be in order to assure that the proposed policy conforms to the statute. Accordingly, the OST and the FAA intend to publish a supplemental notice of proposed policy with the modifications we consider to be appropriate. Because the supplemental notice is not ready to publish at this time, we have concluded that an extension of the comment period until October 15 is appropriate. This extension of the comment period should assure that interested persons have an opportunity to review and address the supplemental notice in their comments and should not preclude the OST and the FAA from meeting the statutory deadline for publication of final policy guidance. In view of the statutory deadline, further extensions of the comment period are not anticipated. We intend to publish the supplemental notice by October 1, 1994. The FAA is simultaneously publishing a separate notice in the federal Register with respect to the proposed Rules of Practice. The notice withdraws proposed subpart J, Alternate Procedure for Certain Complaints Concerning Airport Rates and Charges and extends the comment period on the remainder of the proposal until December 1, 1994. In a separate action, DOT intends to publish for comment proposed amendments to 14 CFR Part 302 to provide procedures for resolution of airport/air carrier disputes over airport rates and charges by October 15, 1994. It is anticipated that the comment period for the Part 302 proposal would not exceed 15 days. Issued in Washington, DC, on September 12, 1994. Stephen H. Kaplan, General Counsel, Department of Transportation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23023 Filed 9&hyph;13&hyph;94; 3:34 pm] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
