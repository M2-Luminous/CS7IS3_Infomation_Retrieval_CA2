Latinovic report: "Rabies in Kikinda"] [Text] Kikinda -- After having diagnosed rabies in several wild and domestic animals, the Ministries for Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Resources of the republic of Serbia have issued a statement pronouncing the town of Kikinda and the surrounding region contaminated by rabies. In order to fight and root out the disease, the authorities intend to carry out the listing, vaccination, and marking of all unvaccinated dogs and cats older than four months. All citizens of Kikinda who are owners of unvaccinated animals, have to bring in their pets to the yard of the veterinary station next week for vaccination, that is from 23 February until 25 February. The ministry has also issued a decree that, in order to successfully fight rabies, dogs and cats must be held locked in houses. In addition, trading in such animals, as well as exhibitions and fairs, is forbidden, which also applies to wild animals.
