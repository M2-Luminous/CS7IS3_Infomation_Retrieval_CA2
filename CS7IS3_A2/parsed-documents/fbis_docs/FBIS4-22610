Various departments of the executive, primarily the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Defense, and the Security Council, have reached full agreement, it would seem, concerning the expediency for Russia of affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed in January at the meeting of NATO heads of state in Brussels. This was shown clearly by the visit to Moscow of U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Pavel Grachev, minister of defense of the Russian Federation, expressed the assumption following the meeting with his American colleague that the corresponding document could be signed before the end of March. And although Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev was more guarded in his assessment of the timeframe necessary for preparation for this event, there is every reason to believe that it will happen quite soon. At the same time, on the other hand, the decision on Russia's affiliation to the NATO initiative aroused increased interest on the part of the legislature, and special hearings were held in the State Duma on the ascertainment and evaluation of the consequences of affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, which showed that a number of the people's elect do not share the optimism of representatives of the departments concerning the fact that Russia's inclusion in this program would correspond to its interests. The debate in the press shows that opinions in this connection differ among independent experts also. Fears that affiliation to the program would reduce Russia's space for foreign policy maneuver and even lead to its dangerous political dependence on NATO are being expressed. Theorists from the ranks of the neo-state absolutists are emphasizing that affiliation to the program would signify the creation of a "monocentric Europe and Russia's loss of the role of power center." But before attempting to take issue with sketches whose connection with the diversity of the political landscape would in itself seem arguable and to evaluate the consequences of such a step for Russia, we should clearly formulate what, in fact, is being offered our country and that with which, by all accounts, we have decided to associate. Let us begin by saying that the mere fact of affiliation to the program of the Partnership for Peace (or PFP, as it is called for short in some analytical documents) by no means signifies a "deprivation of rights" and will not entail limitations of Russia's sovereignty or some strict financial obligations. The very adoption of this program was not so much a strategic initiative of NATO as a response to at least two outside factors. On the one hand it is a question of concentrated pressure on the part of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which were endeavoring by might and main to join NATO and obtain guarantees of security against uncertainties of the political course and the possibility of a return of a totalitarian expansionist regime in Russia. On the other, a part was played by the active and cogent foreign policy course of Russia, which is endeavoring to prevent an expansion of the alliance and a new division of Europe. It was here, perhaps, that quite convincing arguments were found in support of the fact that an expansion of NATO would be contrary to its own long-term interests and would have negative consequences both for European security and for the prospects of democratic development and internal political stability in Russia itself. Thus had there been no Partnership for Peace program, it would have to have been invented. For the West this program was largely a forced measure. It appeared as a compromise demonstrating on the one hand that the Western countries are prepared to take account of the reasonably formulated national-state interests of Russia and are not in the least interested in a destabilization of its already none-too-stable domestic political situation; on the other, the countries wishing to join NATO were offered the possibility of military-political cooperation, which puts off the question of their full membership of this organization indefinitely, although does not exclude it in principle. That is, in the difficult situation in January 1994 Russian diplomacy was able to score a pronounced success. This success should not now be lost in fruitless political debate but should be rapidly switched to the plane of real cooperation, it having been made undoubtedly attractive and beneficial for Russia. The NATO initiative was formulated such as to permit quite a broad interpretation and the possibility of influence on its practical filling. Having approved the Partnership for Peace program, the leaders of the NATO countries expounded it in Brussels in two documents. One is a framework document and formulates the general principles and tasks of the program, the second is an invitation sent to potential partners wishing to associate with this initiative. It would seem that, following familiarization, the first document should not give rise to protest even among the toughest opponents of the one-sided Atlantic "pro-West" orientation of Russian foreign policy inasmuch as it contains goals that are common and positive for each normal democratic state. These are assurance of civilian political control over the military sphere, an expansion of transparency and openness in the process of the discussion and adoption of military budgets, cooperation in the peacekeeping sphere, and so forth. It is extremely important to emphasize that it is in fact anticipated that each signatory state will develop with NATO its own, individual partnership program, as it were. It has at the same time to be noted that the so-called "invitation" to participate in the Partnership for Peace program contains statements to the effect that the NATO states "would welcome its expansion thanks to democratic neighbors in the East" and that the program itself should perform an important role "in the process of the evolutionary expansion of NATO." So Russia, which has already adopted a decision on its affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program, will have to determine which versions of its practical realization are acceptable for it and, having made this decision, use its influence to ensure that participation in it correspond as much as possible to our long-term national interests. But it is essential for this to have a clear idea of what these interests consist. There is no such clarity as yet. The few documents on this score, "Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation" included, do not provide an answer to this question, although they do mention our country's "vitally important interests." True, the authors of the "Basic Provisions" allude to the fact that this document is merely a component of the overall concept of security, which has yet to be devised. But any military doctrine becomes a workable document only when it has support in the form of consensus among the main institutions of power. We are still a along way off from this here, it would seem. Thus any appeal to Russia's national interests with reference to "partnership for peace" cannot contain axioms and should be viewed on the basis of the sum total of evidence in support of this proposition or the other. The question of whether it will not be too late after Russia has aligned itself with the initiative to think about its practical filling could arise. It would seem not inasmuch as formal affiliation to the PFP, that is, the signing of the framework document, is only the first procedural step--a kind of demonstration of intent. It should be followed by the elaboration of a "Presentation Document," which should formulate how Russia sees its participation in the program and the goals to whose achievement it aspires. Of course, it will be necessary here to do what Russia has traditionally disliked doing--display initiative, think, and act. It would be possible to opt for another approach which was proposed by an independent expert and which he formulated in a question which is almost Hamlet-like, but with a nuance of our national philosophy--"why join if it is possible not to join?" This approach to foreign policy may be defined as entropic--minimizing the consumption of energy--but it is far removed from the task of assurance of Russia's vital interests. Underlying it is a fear as to whether Russia, having affiliated with the program, could somehow influence it from within. Those who harbor such misgivings could be reminded (granted all the conditionality of historical analogies) how the Socialist Republic of Romania formerly displayed an independence, enviable and dangerous for those times, within the Warsaw Pact and influenced the policy of this bloc in its own interests. There is even reason to believe that Romania made its contribution to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, operating from within. So are Russia's possibilities to be doubted? So which most important priorities of Russia's national security policy should be reflected in the "Presentation Document"? Russia categorically would not be suited by an expansion of NATO in the event of it remaining outside of this alliance. And it is not a question of the admittance of new members representing a direct military threat to it now or in the foreseeable future. Such an expansion would be perceived as Russia's military-political isolation and would predetermine the inevitability of a new division of Europe. Such a policy would be tantamount to the start of the building of a new version of the Berlin Wall, which would have moved considerably closer to Smolensk and Moscow, but would not for this reason have become a more positive factor of European security. Many serious politicians in the West still believe that NATO should even now admit the countries of East and Central Europe to guard them against the instabilities and uncertainties of the development of the domestic political situation in Russia and possible relapses into imperial policy of the totalitarian state. Unfortunately, Russian political reality affords grounds for such apprehensions. We are increasingly becoming a country not only with an "unpredictable past" but also an "unpredictable future." A number of objections to this could be found, but it is hard to dispute the fact that a resolution of a constitutional crisis with the engagement of a "limited contingent" of tanks and combat operations in the center of the capital did not serve to strengthen the conviction in Europe or throughout the world as to the irreversibility of the policy of reforms and democracy. And the results of the December elections by no means induced anyone to finally cast aside all doubts concerning the prospects of civilian democratic rule in Russia. Strobe Talbott, first deputy U.S. secretary of state, recently declared that he was worried about the fate of the democratic reforms in Russia and believes that, in the event of their failure and a recoil to totalitarianism in Russia, the Partnership for Peace initiative could serve also as a protective barrier against its expansion. At the same time any serious expert is well aware that neither now nor in the foreseeable future will Russia, while remaining a strong military power, be in a position, for all that, to "project" this might outside of its national territory, even less outside of the territory of the former USSR. So what is the point of building a system of protection against a threat which does not exist and which cannot appear in the near future, provoking internal political shifts in Russia that could, even though not rapidly, make this threat real. This conclusion also testifies in support of the need for Russian affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program inasmuch as without it this initiative would become a NATO "preparatory class," and the entry into the alliance of new members would only be a matter of time. That is, it should be stated clearly that Russia will subscribe to the program, considering it essential to counterpose to the expansion of NATO a positive alternative--the creation within the framework of this program of the foundation of a future system of European security, in which Russia and the countries of East and Central Europe are subsequently integrated as NATO's equal partners. At the same time, on the other hand, Russia's affiliation to the program with the aim of its speediest membership of NATO, before its former allies even, perhaps, would be, it would seem, a serious strategic mistake. It is the Eurasian aspect of Russia's interests that is important here. We would recall how the report prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation argued the unacceptability of an expansion of NATO for Russia. It pointed out as a most important reason that the very approach, without hostile intentions even, to the borders of Russia of a military grouping with such offensive potential as NATO would fundamentally change the military-strategic situation and compel it to adopt the appropriate countermeasures in the approaches to military organizational development, the disposition and number of force groupings deployed, and so forth. We can imagine quite unambiguously the negative reaction of China or other Asian neighbors of Russia when it transpires that they border a new military-political alliance whose offensive potential is composed of the potentials of NATO, at least 16 other European countries, and Russia. It would certainly have to be recognized that the Asian states bordering Russia, primarily China, would in this case be entitled to take adequate steps, which would unequivocally have a negative effect on security and stability in the region and in the world as a whole. Consequently, it is essential even now to display concern to ensure that the building of a system of European security with Russia's participation not be perceived as a threat to the Muslim countries or China. It is essential that Russia display particular punctiliousness on this issue inasmuch as it is far more vulnerable than the European countries to possible retaliatory measures on the part of its Asian neighbors. Another important argument expressed by opponents of the program in Russia consists of fears of a loss of the traditional markets for the sale of Russian arms in the European countries that formerly belonged to the Warsaw Pact. Mr. Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for Relations with the CIS and Compatriots' Affairs, even indicates that Russia's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace would signify "the death of Russia's military-industrial complex." It would seem that such misgivings fail to take account of at least two factors. First, the NATO program itself by no means implies a transition to some common standard weapons systems. As far as its further development is concerned, much here should depend on our own position. Second, the talk about the death of Russia's military-industrial complex because of the loss of the East European markets would seem somewhat exaggerated for purely economic reasons. According to the figures of a most authoritative source in this sphere--the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)--total arms exports from Russia in 1992 constituted $2.043 billion, of which arms totaling $139 million were sold to developed countries, to which our East European customers pertain, that is, less than 7 percent of the total. And whereas, what is more, our arms exports in the period 1990 through 1992 to the developing countries declined by a factor of 3.5, to the developed countries, by a factor of 22.4. So events on the arms markets in the East European countries undesirable for us were taking place even before the appearance of the Partnership for Peace program. What has been said by no means signifies that Russia should not fight for the possibility of sales of its arms to the East European countries. But the Partnership for Peace creates no obstacles to this. On the contrary, new opportunities, which, however, may be realized only in keen competitive struggle, could, possibly, emerge for Russia's military-industrial complex within the framework of this program. One further fear voiced by the opponents of affiliation to the Partnership for Peace is connected with the fact that other states of the CIS would fasten onto this program also (some have already done so, others are about to) and that this would undermine the fragile prospects of military-political integration within the CIS that have begun to emerge. We should probably agree that the formulation of a coordinated approach to the NATO initiative on the part of the states of the CIS, the members of the Tashkent Collective Security Treaty at least, would be advisable. But what has prevented or is preventing us doing this and discussing it within the CIS? So the numerous declarations concerning the end of the cold war and our calls concerning the need for transition from confrontation to strategic partnership are beginning to move into the sphere of practical action. Russia should undoubtedly take this step. It would be incomprehensible, to say the least, why we, who have said so much about our aspiration to partner relations, would suddenly attempt to distance ourselves from them, condemning ourselves to self-isolation. Participation in them would by no means signify a disregard for Russia's national interests. But what would undoubtedly have to be renounced would be cliches of confrontational thinking and bipolar, trench logic. It should be regretfully acknowledged that the transition to partner relations with the West has occurred largely in words, at the declarative level, and has affected to a considerably lesser extent the sphere of actual policy. The presence, as before, of the inordinately military component of our superpower status, nuclear weapons included, and the extreme internal political instability demand particular attention and dictate the need for Russia's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program on special terms (the nature thereof could be agreed preliminarily and formalized in an individual partnership program). Nonetheless, it is impossible to confine ourselves to these considerations. Russia has performed and will continue to perform an outstanding role in Europe and the world not only in the military-political respect. No serious analyst even today could dispute the presence in our country of enormous potential in literally all spheres. The normal workmanlike process not only of Russia's affiliation to this program but also of our country's entry into partner relations is being hampered by the evolved nature of the discussion of most important foreign policy questions, which can often only be called discussion by stretching the point. The actual path of the formulation of decisions and the role and place therein of the newly elected parliament, which for some reason or other joined in the discussion of "partnership" when the executive had in practice already determined the timeframe of Russia's entry into this program, would seem chaotic, as before. Discussion of any important matter, the Partnership for Peace included, is frequently regarded not from the viewpoint of Russia's actual interests but through the prism of the opportunist interests of politicians' extension of the time of their stay in the upper echelons of power (particularly with the prospect of new elections for everyone within two years). It is clear that performing purposeful work on the elaboration of policy and on the assurance of Russia's national interests, within the framework of "partnership" included, is far more complex than "not joining." After all, it is in this key sphere for future security that there have been more words than deeds. It is a long time since we heard our own proposals in this field, not simply belated "responses" to the development of events. Nor, finally, would it do any harm to determine our position as regards the basic postulates of the foundation of all partner relations--Russia's national interests and their priorities. It was recently learned, incidentally, that Switzerland, which is proud of its long neutrality, has decided to affiliate with the Partnership for Peace in the near future. It does not intend to renounce its neutral status, is not planning to join NATO, and is not even about to take part in joint military maneuvers. At the same time, on the other hand, Switzerland is unwilling to remain aloof from the process of military-political integration in Europe. But if such a small state is not afraid to align itself with the program, should Russia be guided by baseless fears?
