While waiting with his wife to cast his vote, Golhan replied to several questions in a public opinion poll on allergy tests. A SABAH correspondent asked him about the agreement between Greece and south Cyprus to cooperate on defense. Golhan said: "Papandreou won the election by describing Turkey as Greece's target. He feels he must do something now. He is 80. He may make a frenzied move. It will be useful to remain vigilant. Considering that agreement, we are taking the necessary measures." Asked another question, Golhan said that Greece is less popular than any of the other members of the European Union. Stressing that Turkey will dispatch 2,700 troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Golhan asserted: "But Turkey has received no official UN document on the issue. The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution but Turkey has received no official document." Golhan also asserted that General Cevik Bir, former commander of the Turkish troops in Somalia, will not be assigned to command the Turkish military units in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: "Gen. Bir will not be assigned to the job. He has fulfilled his mission in Somalia. Others wish to be assigned similar duties. Naturally, such missions are linked with qualifications and promotions."
