Speaking at a seminar on promotion of economic ties with Africa, the commerce minister said: The government should prepare the grounds for the establishment of extensive economic ties with Africa by providing transport, banking, and insurance facilities as well as export guarantees and information. He said: The fact that there are 450 million Muslims living in the African continent makes it imperative to broaden Iran's ties with that continent on the basis of mutual interest. He added: The Iranian airlines and shipping companies are ready to invest in this field in an effort to promote economic relations between Iran and the African countries. He told the seminar that in 1992 only 2.09 percent of Iran's total exports were supplied to Africa and only 0.58 percent of the goods imported to the country came from that continent.
