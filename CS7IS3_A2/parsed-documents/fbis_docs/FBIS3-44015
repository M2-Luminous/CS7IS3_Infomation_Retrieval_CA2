After the speech made by Marcolino Moco last Wednesday, it was Eduardo dos Santos' turn to reshuffle the army, the police, and navy for what he described as a national requirement for 1994. The reshuffle was undoubtedly a sign of return to belligerence when Angola is already very tired of war. Observers view his decrees as very troublesome.
