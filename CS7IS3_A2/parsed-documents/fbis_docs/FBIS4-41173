A meeting between Vyacheslav Kebich and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets is on the list of today's activities for Russia's top government officials. The Russian government office is not saying much about the content of the meeting which took place behind closed doors. One can assert that the Russian Cabinet of Ministers likes one of the election promises of the Belarusian prime minister, namely his intention to introduce "tax holidays" for Russian goods which are not going to be taxed. It is thought that Vyacheslav Kebich will be received in the Kremlin since Boris Yeltsin made it clear at a press conference on 10 June that Russia is "very much" interested in the Belarus election results. It is obvious who Russia would like to see as the head of Belarus.
