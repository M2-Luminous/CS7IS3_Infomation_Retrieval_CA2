The health state of the strikers is getting worse. According to Doctor Azem Brasha, many of the strikers are suffering from bronchitis and two of them have been hospitalized. The unsuitable hall in which the strikers are placed has its own effect on the worsening of their health. Meanwhile, in front of the building of the district council, where the strike is being staged, crowds of people gather time and again in support of the strikers. The chairman of the commission of the strike, Jahir Trota, told ATA that the strikers are determined to welcome Premier Meksi in Kukes and are delighted that the president and the government consider their demands as right. In the meantime, the political forces and local government keep constant contacts with the strikers in order to find a way out to stop the strike and start dialogue regarding their demands. The strikers refuse to evacuate the building of the district council, an unlawful act, and continue the strike in another place because they are afraid the state bodies will continue to be indifferent towards them.
