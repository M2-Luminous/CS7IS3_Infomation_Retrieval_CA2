FR940208-0-00079 FR940208-0-00031 The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) requires the Service to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently with listing a species as endangered or threatened. On August 20, 1980, the Service listed the Beaver Dam Slope population of the desert tortoise ( Gopherus agassizii ), in southwestern Utah, as a threatened species and designated 35 square miles of critical habitat (45 FR 55654). On September 14, 1984, the Service received a petition from the Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Defenders of Wildlife to list the desert tortoise in Arizona, California, and Nevada as endangered. In September 1985, the Service determined that the listing was warranted but precluded by other listing actions of higher priority under authority of section 4(b)(3)(iii) of the Act (50 FR 49868). The Service made annual findings of warranted but precluded from 1985 through 1989 under section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act. On May 31, 1989, the same three environmental organizations provided substantial new information and petitioned the Service to list the desert tortoise as endangered throughout its range in the United States under the expedited emergency provisions of the Act. As a result of the new information, on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32326), the Service listed the Mojave population, excluding the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah, as endangered by emergency rule. The Mojave population was designated in the emergency rule as all tortoises occurring north and west of the Colorado River, in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. The Mojave population was then proposed under normal listing procedures on October 13, 1989 (54 FR 42270), and listed as threatened on April 2, 1990 (55 FR 12178). Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat. At the time of listing, the Service found that critical habitat was not determinable because the specific size and spatial configuration of essential habitats, as well as vital linkages connecting areas necessary for ensuring the conservation of the Mojave desert population throughout its range, could not be determined without further information. On January 8, 1993, several plaintiffs filed a motion in Desert Tortoise et al. v. Lujan et al ., Civ. No. 93&hyph;0114 MHP (N.D. Cal.) seeking to stop the transfer of public land to the State of California for construction of a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility in Ward Valley located in southern California. The plaintiffs contended that the Service violated the Act by failing to designate critical habitat for the desert tortoise and sought an injunction prohibiting transfer of the site until critical habitat was designated and a new section 7 biological opinion that addressed the effects of the transfer on critical habitat was completed.
