There are no conditions in Armenian territory for the burial of radioactive waste. Previously almost everything was taken to Russia. But what will happen today, when Armenian armed forces have occupied a substantial part of Azerbaijan? There is a danger that the waste will be buried in Azerbaijan's territory. Free access to reservoirs and rivers with the absence of control will lead later on to contamination of the Caspian, which is fraught with catastrophe for all countries in the Caspian basin. We are opposed to starting the AES, the political destabilization, and the endless chaos in the Transcaucasian region. For this reason, Salayev said, "when Armenia raised the question of allocating funds for renovation of the AES at the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] session last year, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey spoke out against it." According to the Baku correspondent, the Azerbaijan MO [Ministry of Defense] is also concerned about this, assuming that radioactive raw material may be used not only for peaceful purposes under the conditions of a conflict.
