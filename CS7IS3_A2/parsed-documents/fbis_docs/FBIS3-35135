Some time ago, Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents in the clerical Majles had started to strongly criticize Mohammad Hashemi and were accusing him of not paying attention to Islamic values in radio and television programs. Thus, they had placed Hashemi-Rafsanjani under severe pressures and were questioning some of his policies. The removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position as the director of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran [VVIRI] once again revealed the fact that in the existing differences among the leadership factions, a large part of the Majles deputies oppose Hashemi-Rafsanjani--a Majles that Hashemi-Rafsanjani hoped would coordinate with his government, his policies, and his programs. However, it is now clear that a considerable number of the Majles deputies not only are not in coordination with Hashemi-Rafsanjani but are also creating problems for him and are thwarting his efforts. Even though the Majles is only an institution and organ of the regime, in these differences there is no institution or or?on which Hashemi-Rafsanjani can rely and gain their support. The Majles, the Council of Guardians, the bazaaris, and RESALAT clique, and the supporters of the religious seminaries are expressing their opposition to Hashemi-Rafsanjani in one way or another. The army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps too are under Khamene'i's orders. The Hezbollah, which manifests itself mostly in the form of the Basij, is under Khamene'i's orders. Meanwhile, if Hashemi-Rafsanjani had some popular support in the past and was able to distract public opinion both at home and abroad with his promises, recently with the defeat of his economic policy and as a result of the baselessness of his promises he has lost this support too. Thus, we can say that Hashemi-Rafsanjani has failed in his duties; and this failure can be seen both in the economic and social fields and in the confrontation with his opponents. Political experts list two major reasons for Hashemi-Rafsanjani's weakening position. The first is the composition of the Majles and the other is the recent considerable increase in the people's dissatisfaction. The composition of the Majles is not what Hashemi-Rafsanjani wanted. The withdrawal of the extremist faction during the elections of the fourth session of the Majles not only did not strengthen Hashemi-Rafsanjani but worked to the benefit of the conservatives inside the leadership. Hashemi-Rafsanjani had assumed that if the extremists inside the leadership were set aside and especially did not participate in the Majles, the rest of the opponents could be tamed by giving them some benefits and that he could then do as he pleased. However, obviously Hashemi-Rafsanjani was wrong in his calculations. Meanwhile, the intensification of the people's dissatisfaction during the past couple of years and the explosive nature of these feelings in several cities in the country made the clerical regime shudder with fear, and during the people's uprising and demonstrations, the clergymen heard the bases of their rule cracking and disintegrating. Thus, Khamene'i used the pretext of the West's cultural onslaught and once again called on the Hezbollah ummah to return to the scene, to revive the Basij Organization, and to return the regime's suppressive forces to the political scene. Thus, the political atmosphere that was created by Khamene'i was not to the benefit of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his situation, and once again it became obvious that the regime's main problem is the continuation of the Islamic Republic and how to preserve it. Long-lasting differences inside the regime increased and new differences emerged. It seems that the long-lasting differences between Khamene'i and Hashemi-Rafsanjani which emerged after Khomeyni's death have become more acute. In this conflict, a large number of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents consider the main problems that the Islamic Republic faces to stem from Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policies and actions. In the middle of all this, a large part of the power centers has been placed under Khamene'i's authority and the balance of power has shifted to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's detriment. These differences have continued and the dismissal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position as VVIRI director is yet another sign of the process that is weakening Hashemi-Rafsanjani. The question is: What will Hashemi-Rafsanjani do to free himself from this situation? Clearly, if he places himself under Khamene'i's cloak, he will join the ranks of other clergymen who work under Khamene'i's shadow without having any special authority or programs; and if he does not do so, then he will have no support of any size to confront his opponents, some of whom are standing behind Khamene'i and are trying to thwart his efforts in one way or another. Under the current situation, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thinks that it is better to come to terms with his opponents and rivals to a certain extent and the clearest example of this is his acceptance of the removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position as VVIRI director, which is considered to be a positive answer to the opponents of Hashemi-Rafsanjani. One can say that under the current situation, neither the alliance of Khamene'i and his supporters nor Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his clique are able to throw the other out of the scene. But the situation will not stay the same and it is improbable that either of the two sides will agree with the continuation of this situation. It can now be said that the intensification of this process and the deepening of the differences and rivalry among the various groups of the regime will, first and foremost, further paralyze the regime and will also render the regime helpless vis-a-vis the crisis which it is now facing. Undoubtedly this too will pave the way for the intensification of the regime's struggle against the ruling regime.
