The concern about impartiality, closely linked to the credibility factor, is based on the Commission's attitude toward specific subjects, such as the people's right to self-determination, economic, social, cultural, and children's rights. Although generally those points are given importance on the agenda, when discussed they are viewed with a sense of critical selectivity toward developing nations. In contrast, extremely serious matters that prevail in the so-called industrialized societies, where for example there is social and labor discrimination against women, are overlooked. Selectiveness is also used when judging specific countries where special rapporteurs have been appointed, even though within the commission, no one doubts that the alleged violations requiring specific supervision do not exist. A very interesting example is Cuba, which has had an appointed special rapporteur whose mandate was the result of U.S. political manipulation of the island's situation since 1990. Of the 108 resolutions adopted, those referring to topic 12 on the agenda -- violations occurring anywhere -- the majority condemn Third World countries, while similar texts linked to practices in the industrialized West are nonexistent. Many participants of the forum continue to wonder how much longer they must wait before the principles of impartiality, nonselectiveness, and objectiveness return to the Commission, and some even wonder if they were ever present. Other sectors besides the 53 Commission-member countries, such as nongovernmental organizations (ONG) have described the 50th session results as unbalanced. In evaluating the meeting, Reed Brody, director of the International Human Rights Juridical Group and the person who coordinates the efforts of more than 3,000 ONG, said it is very easy to condemn small countries, but when it comes to powerful countries that commit violations, destroy ethnic identities, or maintain thousands of prisoners, the Commission is paralyzed. By observing the countries where rapporteurs have been appointed (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, Sudan, and the former Yugoslavia), it is obvious that no West Europe country is on the list. The 50th session, however, heard numerous reports of violations against immigrants, racial discrimination, mistreatment, and abuse of power by police forces in countries like France, the United States, and the UK, to mention a few. A dozen industrialized nations were mentioned in the ONG reports and even in the rapporteur's report on the sale of children, child prostitution, teen pornography, illegal adoptions, and the illegal commercialization of transplant organs, but none were subject to rapporteurs or condemned.
