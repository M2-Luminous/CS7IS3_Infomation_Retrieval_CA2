At the same time, both sides confirmed that their cooperation in the military sphere must not be detrimental to the interests of any third country. The two diplomats wholeheartedly called for the Black Sea region to become an area of peace and calm. With that goal in mind, they agreed to combine their efforts to put out the fires of conflicts in the Caucasus region and the Balkans. The Turkish defence minister reported that his country was ready to discuss the possibility of Russia's participating in the construction of safe, relatively small heating and nuclear power plants in Turkey. In turn, Soskovets voiced Russia's willingness to positively respond to Turkey's overtures and study the possibility of building a natural gas pipe-line through Georgian and Turkish territory. The implementation of such a project would noticeably improve the economic situation in Georgia, which is suffering from a severe lack of energy resources. He noted that the technical and economic foundation for the project could be completed as quickly as within two or three months. Both sides expressed their willingness to sign an agreement on cooperation in the training of military personnel in the near future.
