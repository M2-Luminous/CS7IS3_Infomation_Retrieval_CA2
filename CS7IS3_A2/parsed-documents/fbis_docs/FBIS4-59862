In its statement, the Muslim Brotherhood said: "It has become evident that the PLO has given all the required concessions. The PLO continued to concede right up to the last moment before signing. The PLO has linked itself to the Zionist entity by accepting self-rule. Hence, the PLO has become a tool of the Zionist hegemony in Palestine and the Arab and Islamic region." Continuing, the Muslim Brotherhood said: "The Cairo Agreement is not binding on the Muslim brothers, the issue of Palestine is the responsibility of all Muslims, and the liberation of the holy land in Palestine is the duty of every male and female Muslim. Furthermore, the Cairo agreement does not achieve the minimum of the just demands of the Palestinian people, because the basic issues are still pending, including the issues of the displaced, refugees, holy Jerusalem, settlements, and the setting up of the Palestinian state on all the Palestinian soil." The Muslim Brotherhood called on the Arab and Islamic people to support the Palestinian people's jihad by continuing the complete boycott of the Zionist entity and reviving the jihad spirit among the youth.
