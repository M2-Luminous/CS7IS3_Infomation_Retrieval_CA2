In the commission's First Quarter Analysis and Second Quarter Outlook -- which has been handed over to the State Council -- analysts say frozen salaries at a time of high inflation and the inadequacy of pensions will make newly retired workers "the most unstable factor" in the country over the next one to two years. "They face big problems. They will be retiring on low fixed incomes with little in the way of pensions to support them," an SPC official said. The state sector employed 109 million people at the end of 1993, of which 20 to 30 percent are due to be retired because of age or redundancy. This means the target group includes between 22 and 33 million people. An additional 20 percent of the workforce -- or 22 million -- are already retired and living on low fixed incomes. The report compares state enterprise workers -- who account for almost three quarters of employment in urban areas -- to the middle class in developed capitalist countries. "Overall social stability depends on their situation," the official said. Average retirement pay for state sector workers now stands at about 130 renminbi (HK$115) per month, the SPC official said, which put households that rely on such incomes in the category of "encountering living difficulties". The report blames the heavy tax burdens and lack of competition in the state sector as the main cause of their present sorry state. In the first two months of this year, 40.7 percent of state enterprises lost money. The SPC report makes two suggestions: credit policies should not be tightened any further and no big economic reforms should be introduced over the next one to two years which might put state enterprises in an even worse competitive position.
