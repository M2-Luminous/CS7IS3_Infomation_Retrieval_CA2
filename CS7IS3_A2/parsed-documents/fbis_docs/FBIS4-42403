"This afternoon, a beautiful Rome day and Michelangelo's Capitoline square...provided the perfect backdrop for bearing witness to and celebrating a friendship which has lasted half a century and which will certainly continue for more than half a century into the future," said the Italian government chief. With Berlusconi and Clinton due in Anzio tomorrow to attend a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing there, history also played a part in the premier's speech: "The friendship between our countries and the alliance between our democracies are born out of an act of liberation which laid to rest fascism and Nazi totalitarianism in Europe." Italy's commitment to democracy was underscored by Berlusconi, who said "the new Italy which you see today, Mr. President, is a country which has rediscovered a taste for liberty and which is determined to defend tolerance and peace." "We have learnt all that we should have learnt from our joint history," continued Berlusconi, "Now we feel free and we have hope in our hands. We do not want to remain slaves to the ghosts of the past. After many difficult years, a climate of trust and optimism has returned." Leaders of all the major political parties were invited to attend the dinner, which took place at Villa Madama, but Umberto Bossi of the Northern League turned down his invitation at the last moment, citing previous commitments and sending League number two, and Interior Minister Roberto Maroni in his stead. In a comment to journalists, National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini, who was present for tonight's meal, recalled similar incident which happened during a visit to Rome by former U.S. President George Bush. "I was invited to see Bush while he was in Italy and I did the same as Bossi: I said I was busy with an election campaign. All lies: in fact, no one had warned me he was coming." [passage omitted] More details about this afternoon's talks between Berlusconi and Clinton emerged this evening when the premier's press secretary Antonio Tajani disclosed that Berlusconi had confessed that he was known as the `Amerikano' in his youth. "I have always been very close to the position of the United States. They used to call me `Amerikano', written with a K, when it was very difficult and not at all fashionable to be on the side of the United States," Berlusconi told his guest. Berlusconi's fascination with things American has either died down since then, or only went so far: when refreshments were brought in during the meeting, the Italian premier opted for an espresso coffee, while Clinton chose for a Coca Cola.
