FBIS4-68344 "jpusr047___94006" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 20 April 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Leaders Explain Majority Party Objectives Leaders Explain Majority Party Objectives 944K1142A Moscow LITERATURNAYA GAZETA in Russian No 16, 20 Apr 94 p 12 944K1142A Moscow LITERATURNAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Roundtable discussion with Chairman of the Majority Party Vyacheslav Grechnev; People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva; Yuriy Moiseyev, member of the Majority Party Political Council, president of the Russian Potato concern, and doctor of chemical science; and Andrey Orlov, member of the Political Council, vice dean of the Economic Academy, and doctor of economic science; by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA senior staff members at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial offices; date not given: "Will the Majority Follow the Majority Party?"] [Text] A year and a half ago LITERATURNAYA GAZETA made a trip to Germany. At the request of our German colleagues we brought to a "roundtable" organized by them representatives of all the parties then registered in Russia. At the time there were 25. The Germans were bewildered: How do you navigate in such a large number of parties; we in Germany have only four major ones and several small ones that are of no consequence? The LITERATURNAYA GAZETA staff promised them that Russia, too, will have everything the way it is supposed to be "in a polite society"--two, three, or four parties. A year and a half passed, however, and instead of 25 parties we have 40, or perhaps 50 (it is hard to keep track)! Not too long ago a new party appeared on the horizon, which chose a name that carries quite a claim--the Majority Party. So we decided to ask them a question: How does the idea to set up a party come up today; what is it set up for? Our guests at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial offices are Chairman of the Majority Party Vyacheslav Grechnev; People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva; Yuriy Moiseyev, member of the party's political council, president of the Russian Potato concern, doctor of chemical science; and Andrey Orlov, member of the political council, vice dean of the Economic Academy, and doctor of economic science. Senior staff members of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA participated in the discussion. Writhing Mute Streets [Grechnev] How are parties formed? Probably in different ways. As to our party, if someone told me three months ago that I would be participating in this, I would have been very surprised. After the 12 December elections, when the elements of society's disintegration became obvious; when one could figure out using a simple calculator that only 17-20 percent of Russians were represented in the parliament; when we saw that, on one hand, a clown had come to the forefront of politics, and on the other, Russia's Choice's weaknesses became obvious, we came to the conclusion that Russia needs a new party that will reflect the interests of the majority of its population. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We--meaning who? [Grechnev] A group of entrepreneurs and intellectuals in the humanities. We came to the conclusion that in reality Russia does not have parties as such at all. They are more like associations by interests: a club of Zhirinovskiy lovers, a club of beer lovers... As for a true party that would express the interests of average business, the interests of the middle class in the population, such really does not exist in Russia. We decided to create a party that would truly be a party and represent the interests not only of the Moscow mingling circuit but mainly those of the regions. It did not take us long to set up a party organizing committee, hold a founding congress, and open branches in 58 regions. We acted on the following principle: At the first stage we contacted commercial, cultural, and sports structures with whom we had partnership relations. This facilitated the search. Take for instance entrepreneurs. As a rule, they are successful entrepreneurs. At their enterprises they pay decent salaries. And the families that work here also trust those who let people work normally and earn a normal living. You know, we ourselves did not expect the tremendous, snowball support we got. We have already made a trip to the Urals--Chelyabinsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Tagil. These are huge regions with immense potential. We visited Bryansk Oblast--regional branches are operating there actively. There is interest in our party in the North Caucasus. We have a very strong branch in Smolensk, and there is lot of interest in us in Kaliningrad Oblast and Kaliningrad itself. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you consider the name of your party well chosen--the Majority Party? On one hand, it sounds like pure advertising; on the other, you will be nicknamed Bolsheviks. In reality, it follows from your program documents that you intend to be a party of the middle class, and among other things a party of small and medium-size business. In such a case, why could you not make this clear right away? [Grechnev] We thought for a long time about the name; it is not accidental. This name expresses the very essence. I will explain why. In our opinion, in a normal, civilized society, where Russia should belong, the middle stratum of the population, the middle class, should comprise 70-80 percent of the population. It includes far more than just entrepreneurs, of whom there are no more than 15 percent in society; it truly is a majority. In our perception the middle class includes skilled workers, doctors, teachers, engineers, any specialists working for hire or self-employed, professional athletes, creative intelligentsia, retired military officers, small and medium-size business owners... In short, everyone who is engaged or wishes to be engaged in free, creative, highly skilled labor. This stratum effective maintains the state, ensures its prosperity. That is why we say that we want to express and defend the interests of the majority, the middle class. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that you have support in the regions. Any party in the country probably has support in the regions. Shakhray, for instance, proclaimed that his PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] is a party whose support base is the regions. According to you there are capital city parties and there are all-Russia parties, right? [Grechnev] As to Shakhray, the tactics he uses in work with the regions is bewildering. He calls a head of administration, talks to him, and after that believes that the region supports him. This is far from true. The impression that heads of administration have a great influence on the situation in the regions is incorrect. Rather the contrary, entrepreneurs directly supply them with foodstuffs. Therefore a head of administration also depends on the entrepreneurial class. To the best of my knowledge Shakhray, at least in the regions where we traveled, did not deem it necessary to establish contacts with local entrepreneurs. So I do not know how real his support in the regions is. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] It is difficult to set up a party these days. It takes money. Who is behind your party? Big capital? Medium-size? Small? [Grechnev] Medium-size capital. That is, people who have earned their money themselves. They are mostly our business partners. Trade business, construction... The Market Is Being Strangled by Taxes [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] From some of your remarks one may draw the conclusion that you do not believe that all businessmen have earned their fortune honestly. Of course, this is true. But here is the question: Do you work only with those you consider absolutely honest? [Grechnev] We are not interested in how a person earned his money. We are not the procuracy or a court. This is a matter for a person's conscience and appropriate law enforcement organs. If a person shares our views; if he has money and will contribute to the stabilization of society--for goodness sake, we are always open. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When one reads your program there are some unclear points. We would like to hear more specifically what you offer instead of, for instance, Gaydar's economic policy. How is your economic program different from other parties' programs? [Grechnev] Let us begin with taxes. In our opinion, until the system of taxation is fundamentally changed no further reform, no pulling out of the crisis is possible. [Orlov] Our current system of taxation is completely anomalous, idiotic. No matter how you count it, right now from every million rubles [R] made by an entrepreneur, R850,000-900,000 "disappear." There are 40-plus taxes--federal, republic, city... The conclusion is very simple. Until R650,000 out of this million remains for investment, development based on market forces, production is not going to grow. And we will not build a critical mass of small business, will not be able to support that part of the middle class that is already deteriorating today. And is our potential for the 21st century. This means that we have to create a new tax structure. For our party this is a very real question. We have announced an international competition to develop the best tax system. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What problem would you name as second in importance after taxes? [Orlov] We are facing an explosion of unemployment. In the worst case scenario, keeping in mind the VPK [military-industrial complex] potential--up to 30-35 million persons. In the medium-gravity scenario--up to 12-15 million and a change from latent, hidden unemployment to open. Among the unemployed will be a tremendous number of people we consider middle class. Based on that, we placed the emphasis on a simple, well-developed, easy to understand economic program. So that people will not evade taxes. So that we will find stimuli for an economic upturn. We have a number of concrete projects that will allow us to improve the economic situation, Yes, inflation will persist, but it can be reduced. The proposals for tax systems we have already received in the competition tell us that such potential is there. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your remarks you frequently mention the names of Abalkin, Petrakov, and Shatalin. Does this mean that if your party comes to power, these are people who will be your advisers rather than younger economists? [Orlov] No, it does not. In the past I was indeed close to this group. But I believe now that, with the exception of Petrakov, they have somewhat exhausted their potential. Today we need young flexible minds. And we have on our team many young, talented people. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your opinion, is the return to state regulation, a planned economy possible? [Orlov] Impossible. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] And what if those who insist on such a return come to power? [Orlov] Well, with the attitudes that currently exist in society, with the way we are moving now, they are not going to get power. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] No, this is not what we are asking: What if they do take power? [Orlov] If they take power, we will fight, we will argue that they will lead us into another dead end... [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Some people believe that even if retrogrades take the power, the processes in the economy are already irreversible and there is no way back... [Orlov] They themselves understand this. They know full well that there is no way back. You can slow down some things; some components in the equation may be changed, but there cannot be a genuine turning back... There is another possibility--a partial return. For instance, market socialism with some new face. A lot of state ownership, a lot of regulation, a lot of all sorts of slogans: Let us protect these, and those... Not such a fast progression to a liberal economy of the American type, but something like a social market economy. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What is your position in the current polemics around customs duties? [Orlov] They are needed, of course, but not as high as they have been set. [Grechnev] It is just that this is a bad time to impose them. In time, when production is up; when a new taxation system is in place; when it is profitable for producers to work and expand production--then, of course, in order to protect the domestic producer customs duties will need to be imposed. Does a Party Need Discipline? [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] There is an obvious contradiction in your program documents between the claim to be a party of the majority and the disciplinary restrictions you intend to impose on your ranks. You even use the odious term "democratic centralism..." You have not offered anything unifying in the sphere of ideology. Only disciplinary measures. [Grechnev] I do not see any contradiction here. You say that you cannot pinpoint the ideology. In my opinion, the ideology is defined very precisely and clearly. What is, for example, important for me as a businessman and a member of the middle class? First and foremost, stability in society. A society that is split into the lumpen and the elite is unstable... About democratic centralism. This is our reaction to the past few years of the democratic talking shop. Only talking shop, no real action. People do not have any real responsibility. We think, on the other hand, that real members of our party will have a real responsibility to it. Because they will receive and already receive something from the party. I do not mean some monetary handout or something of this kind. We help people in their self-realization. To some we give a direct distribution market. To others we help find jobs. That is, we do real things. And while for others things did not get beyond declarations, we gather our supporters by concrete, real actions; we help them, and we have the right to ask for reciprocity. [Orlov] Today our task is to create distribution markets, create new jobs, create schools for young talents... We have, for instance, a studio which is called exactly this: "Young Talents." We sponsor it. A wonderful school! They recently gave a great concert in the Rakhmaninov Hall in the conservatory. If we do not support this, we will lose a great number of talented kids brought in from all over the former Union. But in order to help, we ourselves have to be well organized. Place in the Political Spectrum [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What are your goals in the area of privatization? In your opinion, is it being conducted the right way? What do you think about vouchers? [Orlov] We have to start with land. Establish true ownership of it. Look at what is happening now. There are 200,000 peasant and private farms. But have you counted how many of them are true, market-type? Only 25-30 percent. And they only feed themselves; the rest are merely registered. The critical mass, however, which forms a real market, must comprise at least 500,000 farms. Only then will some sort of competitive basis appear. Next we have to organize 3-5 million small enterprises... Vouchers are a stage I call a registration stage--statistical, learning stage. We have not yet achieved fundamental change. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But voucherization has already taken place; this is a fact... [Orlov] When I go to my dairy store on Gruzinskaya Street I see a new sign there--a TOO [limited liability partnership) or AO (joint-stock company). But it is as dirty as it used to be. And the sales clerks are as rude as they used to be... So what has privatization given us? Is this an increase in efficiency? Is this an upturn coming in place of losses and decline? [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When a new party appears on the stage everybody wants to know that kind of party it is. There are certain tests by which the reader can determine what part of the political spectrum you are in. Test No. 1: Which of the Duma parties is closest to you? [Grechnev] Probably Shakhray's party, because it places emphasis on the regions. We, too, as we have already said, want to be a party of the regions rather than a Moscow party. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Test No. 2: How do you feel about calls to restore the USSR? [Grechnev] In our opinion, restoring the USSR in the form in which it existed before certain events is impossible. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do you see unification in some form? Or do you support the CIS? Or something else? [Grechnev] I will answer the question this way. There was Russia, Russia Minor, and Belorussia. This is the way it should be. It is one whole organism. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But Russia Minor does not want to be with us. [Grechnev] This is an arguable contention--about Russia Minor. A Ukrainian Majority Party is being set up there. Also a Belorussian Majority Party. Hopefully we will work together. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about the recent amnesty declared by the Duma? [Grechnev] In my opinion, when mercy is shown, this is good. But the degree of culpability should be determined by a court. [Orlov] I also want to add that it would be good if the initiative in such matters came from the president. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you have a presidential candidate? [Grechnev] Yes. A well-known name, but we do not want to mention it yet. A person who shares our views. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What will you say regarding the current rumors that Luzhkov supports your party? [Grechnev] I think Luzhkov is the best person to speak up on this subject. And he has said that he has nothing to do with our party and that he wrote greetings to our congress at the request of a friend who shares the views of our party and since his own, Luzhkov's, views are not in conflict with it. Russia Is a Rural Country [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your perception, do peasants belong with the middle class? [Moiseyev] Yes, we believe that ordinary rural workers--peasants, farmers--are part of the middle class. Although they as a social group have a number of special traits that have to be taken into account. First and foremost, the rural population is a pragmatic part of the population, the most pragmatic one, which no longer believes slogans. They do not accept revolutionary reforms. Therefore, when farmers come and say: Let us divide everything--it causes psychological hostility. Finally, it is the most technologically backward part of the population. As a result, they have higher production costs, greater storage losses... So now we have arrived at such a logical state where food prices in the domestic market are higher than world prices. And lastly, a proprietor is developing now in each producer in the rural area. While in the past house-adjacent plots were mere vegetable gardens, now people have one or two hectares. They are becoming private producers of goods. But at the same time they do not want to leave state organizations. If a person works at a post office, or someplace else, or in a kolkhoz, he does not want to leave. Such duality requires great tact in treating the choice of path Russia will follow in this area. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do we not have to finally get this sluggish cart moving? [Moiseyev] We are looking into various scenarios now. The first is the administrative way: make everyone a farmer. Today farmers occupy 2 percent of the total area and produce as much output--a little more than 2 percent. That is, when it comes to efficiency they are no different from other sectors in agriculture. This way, as I already said, currently causes hostility on the part of the rest of the rural population. From the economic and psychological standpoint, I think that in the nearest future any forcible pressure in this area is unacceptable. I can quote in this respect the famous message of Petr Filippov, head of the Analytical Center of the President's Administration, in which he recommended "breaking up" over the period March-April large producers into smaller partnerships comprising 20-30 persons. Naturally the countryside was completely hostile to the idea. The second way is currently officially supported by that part of the Duma that oversees the agrarian sector. It envisages continuing financial aid to the agrarian sector. But this is a temporary measure. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] So what way do you--the Majority Party--propose? [Moiseyev] We are searching for a third way. And we see two potential trends here. The first is in uniting rather than pitching against one another personal plot owners, who at the same time also participate in collective production. This may be perhaps a purely Russian way. It requires division of functions instead of division of property. If a collective entity takes upon itself procurement of seed and equipment, and will take the final product from the peasants--this will be a rational division of functions. Therefore, new structures must emerge on the microeconomic level. They already exist now, and we actively support them. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that there are two trends. What is the other one? [Moiseyev] The second trend is that associations, concerns, and corporations must emerge on a higher, macroeconomic level. Not by the territorial principle, however--by product. We had the experience before the reform of organizing the APK [agro-industrial complex] by territorial attribute. Meanwhile, the experience of world development shows that a different variant is more promising. Sometime after the crisis of the 1930's large concerns came into existence--such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola--which combine production, growing, distribution, and even science in their field. Who Are You With, Stage Workers? [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Let us now ask Vera Kuzminichna: Has the entire Theater of Satire joined the Majority Party or only part of it? And how did you come into the party? [Vasilyeva] The Theater of Satire is not part of any parties, including this one. The same goes for me. Being the age I am and having experienced so many disappointments, it would be stupid to run from one party to another. But there are things I consider very important and welcome. This is what I mean. As you know. the situation in culture is very difficult now. Our theater is doing quite well, though. As they say, we do not go around begging. At a time when everybody is getting rid of the "ballast," our people prefer smaller salaries but no layoffs. Well, we have four plays in production now, and money has been found for all four of them. For a year, however, we, together with director Boris Aleksandrovich Lvov-Anokhin, have dreamed of producing Gnedich's "The Assembly." The part I have is far from a dream part, and I could certainly do without this play, but I think it is very much needed precisely now. This is also the opinion of our leadership. Because this is a play about how Peter the Great attempted to lead our Russia onto a civilized road of development, which turned out to be very difficult. Everything that is taking place there resonates very much with our times. Stealing, drinking. The desire of many people, despite tremendous difficulties, to still walk this road of civilization. We decided to conduct an experiment: produce this play together with the New Drama Theater, which is directed by Lvov-Anokhin, because we realize that there are many acting parts and expenditures will be considerable. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We are beginning to guess: Is it they who got you together with the Majority Party? [Vasilyeva] Since I am in charge of the domestic commission in the Theater of Satire, where I very frequently have to ask for money for old actors, sick people, I am used to asking. I am not ashamed of it because I ask not for myself. Therefore, when I was invited to this event--I do not even know what to call it: a party presentation or simply a meeting--I told the person who invited me: "Pardon my cynicism--are there going to be rich people there?" I was told: "Yes." I said: "Then I will be happy to come. And I will be happy if the new party turns out to be a good one. I will speak of every good deed and will never hide who helped us." [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Did you get help? [Vasilyeva] We were promised stage-by-stage financing for this production--"The Assembly." I repeat, we are not poor, but this will simply be a very good act on the part of a party that intends to help intellectuals, people of art, and helps a theater in a difficult moment. I consider it a good deed. The Law Is the Law [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Another question for the party leadership. In your program documents, among the main values you mention legality. You write about the primacy of the law, the sanctity of the law. But there are laws and laws. You see, you are already unhappy about the law on customs duty. On 3-4 October, too, some defended the law while others apparently violated it... [Grechnev] You may have noticed that by our orientation we lean towards the conservatives. To take a Western analogy, we are a conservative party, and we do indeed respect the law. Although we see, of course, the difference between the law and the legal system. As to specifically regarding our attitude to the October events, we consider it a national tragedy. As your newspaper reported, we have opened a special account, money from which will be used to aid all victims of this tragedy. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Once again about your program goals. You make your priority a strong, stable state as a guarantor of freedom, dignity, human rights, and the individual, etc. But in Russia, the state, the bureaucratic state, has always been and remains the opposite--a guarantor of lack of freedom. A guarantor of suppression, an annihilator of the individual. The bureaucracy has acquired a gigantic scale even in comparison with communist times. How can one worship such a state? Only a civil society should be a guarantor of freedom--only such a society is capable of restraining the army of bureaucrats. [Grechnev] In my opinion, the state per se currently does not function at all. What we see is the tyranny of bureaucrats. [Orlov] The situation right now really is anomalous. We understand very well that everything is permeated with corruption. We have to create a civilized stratum of civil servants. But bureaucrats are not necessarily the state. A state is a combination of at least three authorities: executive, legislative, and judiciary. We in the party also attach great significance to the fourth estate--the mass media. We are supporters of a state in which laws are intelligent; where there is a combination of effective authorities, with a great role for judiciary structures. As for building a civil society--this is a long process. We Are Open to Everyone [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you know how many members you currently have, or is there no such record-keeping? [Grechnev] There is. We receive up-to-date information. There are about 200,000 active party members. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In one of your program documents there are words about the priority you attach to the development of Russian spirituality. Do you have a certain weakness for national-patriots? [Grechnev] We are talking about Russia's [rossiyskaya], not Russian, spirituality. We have emphasized this many times. [Orlov] It is our principle, which also was expressed at the congress. There can be no doubt about it. The same extends to our attitude to different religious confessions. We are an open party. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about such populist undertakings as a beer lovers party? [Grechnev] I like beer. [Orlov] Let there be a lot of beer, good-tasting and different. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] The last question--on your plans for the immediate future. What can we expect of your party? In which elections will it participate? [Grechnev] The plan for the immediate future is to work with the regions, travel to the regions: Orel Oblast, Nizhniy Novgorod, Bryansk, Kirov, Yakutsk, Kabardino-Balkaria. We will participate in elections whenever they take place. We are ready. We are already participating in regional elections. [Orlov] We are setting up international contacts. We will visit Austria and Germany. [Grechnev] At the end of the month I am going to Cyprus, where we have already established contacts with the Conservative Party. [Orlov] We have very promising contacts in the United States. Everything will be fine, we hope. [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Can we see your party card? [Grechnev] We have the design, and the cards will be printed soon. *** As this issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA was going to print, the Majority Party held another press conference, at which the party leadership expressed their attitude to the draft Agreement on Civic Accord. The statement says that while supporting the IDEA of the agreement, the party at this point cannot endorse this wording of the document. For instance, calls for compliance with the constitution--which is the duty of any citizen regardless of agreements--are seen by the Majority Party leadership first as nonsense, and second, as an attempt to place this document above the constitution. Also unacceptable is the desire of the document's authors to impose additional political restrictions in the form of obligations to "not initiate political campaigns with the purpose of holding early elections of federal organs of authority," "not conduct and not participate in organizing strikes," and others. In many of its provisions, the party said at the press conference, this agreement is just a collection of obvious maxims and banal assertions. To endorse such a document would be TANTAMOUNT TO ENDORSING THE BIBLE. At the same time, it was said that the Majority Party is ready to take part in work on the preparation of a more serious Memorandum of Accord. It will bring into this work the cadres of highly skilled jurists, economists, and political scientists the party has at its disposal.
