The entire activity of the Ministry of National Defense is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the strategy of the government program, under the control of Romania's Parliament, the Supreme Defense Council of Romania, and the government. Therefore, no action taken by the leadership of the ministry, including the minister, has taken place without the previous approval of the institutions authorized in this respect (...) 2. Although the consequences of the economic recession and of the other difficulties specific to the transition period are seriously felt in the army, too, the Ministry of National Defense has obtained noteworthy results, which have been mentioned as such at the meeting of the Executive and the public has been informed about them. We mention a few of these results: -- the equidistance of the army from any political or party ideology; -- the actions aimed at improving the training of all military groups, while the budget is being reduced every year -- last year's budget was three times lower than in 1989 and was among the lowest in Europe. -- courses of flying instruction for military pilots, with an average duration three times longer than before 1990, but which, unfortunately, is still below international norms. In 1993 we succeeded in promoting all military pilot trainees to the first stage of full command [iesirea in simpla comanda a tuturor pilotilor militari], an unprecedented fact in the past 15 years; -- the improvement of military discipline while action to restructure the system of social values is taking place, with respect for the traditional standards of the military institution thus being weakened. In this respect, through appropriate measures in the army, we achieved a threefold reduction of the number of serious violations of standards in 1993 compared with 1991; -- the implementation of certain measures of social protection for all military ranks, including reserve officers, retired officers, and veterans. 3. Through legal measures and government decisions initiated by the Ministry of National Defense together with the Ministry of Industry, which bear responsibility for private corporations that produce military equipment, we succeeded in preserving the production capacities of the defense industry. They have continued their specific activity, ensured the production of 74 percent of combat equipment, equipment taken over by the army in 1993, and ensured the fulfillment of export orders, as well as products for civilian use. No type of military equipment that can be produced at home has been imported (thus, no tanks from Israel either!), and the export of special products has been constantly increasing since 1990. With Israel and other countries we have organized ventures to jointly produce certain special products, but actual production has been exclusively the job of industrial capacities in Romania. 4. A reduction of combat technology is currently taking place in our country and as in the case of other European countries -- including our neighbors -- this action is carried out strictly in accordance with programs under international treaties that Romania has signed, treaties signed by the country's political leadership and approved by parliament. 5. Regarding the so-called "Kent" affair [cigarette smuggling affair involving a number of military personnel], the Military Prosecuting Magistracy's investigation in connection with the case before the court established that the renting of storage space from the "Romtechnica" Autonomous Public Corporation was a legal act and did not result in any material damage to the Ministry of National Defense. From documents provided to the investigators by the "Romtechnica" Corporation, the identity of the guilty party was established -- Lebanese citizen Nassar Elias -- and the amount of the damage to the Romanian state through evasion of customs duty with the use of fake stamps was recovered. The military cadres guilty of certain violation of the military norms, on the basis of which the customs evasion took place, were removed from their positions and turned over to the appropriate legal authorities. 6. Regarding the alleged damage to the army's patrimony as a result of the contract with the Delta Design firm -- whose owner is Iulian Rosengren -- a firm that had to supply us with oil products, using its own means, the Ministry of National Defense detected a lack of trustworthiness of the partner -- who cheated other institutions as well -- and thus canceled the contract in time and recovered all the money that represented the payment, together with interest on the amount owed by the firm (...). We express our regret that, at this time that is extremely important for speeding up the process of our country's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures, accusations that are in flagrant contradiction with reality are made public. These actions show ill will, the more so, since the ministry leadership has submitted to the democratic bodies of our country all the requested information regarding the activity of the army.
