In an article contributed to the government's weekly "KUKCHONG SIMMUN" issued Monday, he added that inter-Korean relations have a double structure of confrontation on the one hand and dialogue for a gradual and peaceful movement toward reunification on the other. "Policy consistency must be maintained, but policy direction should be adjusted and adapted to a new situation and a new way of pursuing the policy should be developed," he said. The current efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully and through dialogue should be continued, and the government should deal with the issue through increased cooperation with the international community, he added.
