FR941013-1-00077 FR941013-1-00010 Instead of using a model plant approach for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA decided to adapt a computer model developed by the Agency to estimate nationwide organic air emission impacts from RCRA hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF). As explained in section III of this notice, the EPA estimates that approximately 90 percent of the nationwide organic HAP emissions for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category occur from hazardous waste TSDF. Consequently, the EPA considers adapting this computer model to be appropriate for evaluating alternative control options for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category. The primary sources of site-specific waste data used as input to the computer model are two comprehensive nationwide surveys that the EPA Office of Solid Waste (OSW) conducted in 1987: the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators (referred to hereafter as the ``GENSUR''); and the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (referred to hereafter as the ``TSDR Survey''). These data represent waste quantities, waste compositions, and waste management practices at hazardous waste TSDF in 1986, and are the most recent nationwide TSDF waste data available to the EPA on a consistent, industry-wide basis. The data base indicates that 710 TSDF received wastes and recoverable materials from off-site waste generators in 1986. The EPA adapted its computer model to simulate the waste management processes reported in the TSDR Survey to be operating at each of these TSDF. Organic HAP emission factors and emission control cost factors are assigned to each waste management process using one (or in many cases a combination of several) of the model units developed for the TSDF RCRA air rule projects. Further details regarding the emission estimation methodology are provided in the BID for this proposed rulemaking. The EPA is aware that some waste management practices have changed since the data were collected for the GENSUR and TSDR Survey because of new EPA regulations promulgated since 1986 ( e.g. , the RCRA land disposal restrictions) as well as changes implemented by the waste management industry. To address these changes in the definition of the baseline used for this rulemaking, assumptions were applied in the computer model to better reflect current industry-wide waste management trends ( e.g. , conversion of surface impoundments to tanks, treatment of certain wastes prior to or as an alternative to land disposal). Additional assumptions were made to simulate the implementation of the different regulatory alternatives in the computer model. These assumptions are described in further detail in the BID for this proposed rulemaking. 2. Regulatory Baseline For the purpose of evaluating the relative organic emission reduction effectiveness of different regulatory alternatives, the EPA defines a ``baseline'' as a reference point from which each regulatory alternative can be compared. The baseline represents the estimated level of organic emissions from the source category that would occur in the absence of implementing any of the regulatory alternatives. For the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA chose a baseline which would reflect the level of organic emissions for each emission point type following implementation of air emission controls required by federally enforceable air regulations in effective as of July 1991. The EPA defined the baseline to consist of the following regulations: (1) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF process vents (40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA); (2) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40 CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB); (3) RCRA land disposal restrictions (40 CFR part 268); and (4) NESHAP for benzene waste operations (40 CFR 61 subpart FF). 3. Organic Emissions Impacts The EPA estimated organic HAP emission reductions that would be achieved if air rules based on each of the five regulatory alternatives were implemented. Baseline organic HAP emissions are estimated to be approximately 52,000 Mg/yr. The organic HAP emissions assuming implementation of the individual regulatory alternatives are estimated to be approximately: 28,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, 23,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 2, 9,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 3, 9,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 4, and 8,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 5.
