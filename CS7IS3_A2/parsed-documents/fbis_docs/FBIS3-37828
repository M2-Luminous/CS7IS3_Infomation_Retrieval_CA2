Leaders of conservative factions, who have up to now demanded that the commission be vested with the broadest powers possible, agreed to persuade their deputies to refrain altogether from intervening in the investigation conducted by the prosecutor's office, and to act as if the vote on setting up a commission never took place. Their political rivals agreed in response to add a number of "political" provisions to the amnesty decree. The decision on the "purely criminal" amnesty, however, will still be made separately from decisions on the "political and economic" amnesty. Another participant in the meeting, however, told SEGODNYA that "A political amnesty does not mean at all that all those charged with organizing rebellions in 1991 and 1993 and the instigators of last May's disturbances will be pardoned at once."
