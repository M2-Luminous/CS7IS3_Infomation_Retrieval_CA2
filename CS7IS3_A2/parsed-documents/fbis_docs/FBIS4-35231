In its "Window" column today, the paper says that the United States fears that this lone Iraqi may influence congressmen, something which would embarrass the U.S. Administration in its attempts to justify the continued imposition of the blockade against Iraq. The paper asks: How then does the U.S. Administration view the moves made by the Iraqi delegations, led by Tariq 'Aziz, that visit the UN headquarters every two months, especially since it is aware that such moves have substantial effects, even among its allies at the UN Security Council? The paper adds: We are certain that Washington's impulsive stands are a reaction to its loss of confidence in its ability to convince the American people and their law-makers of its policy on maintaining the blockade imposed on Iraq. This is evidence of the success of the Iraqi move. Only further patience and steadfastness is required, for the American side has begun to stagger, and its arguments will inevitably be defeated.
