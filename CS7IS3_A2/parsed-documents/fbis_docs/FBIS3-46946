The Belgrade television of Yugoslavia on January 1 quoted President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as saying in his New Year address that "it is the United States that has created the suspicion of nuclear development by the North, and it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and has been threatening the Korean people," and that the problem "must on any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks." The TANJUG news agency and Radio Belgrade of Yugoslavia repeatedly reported the New Year address.
