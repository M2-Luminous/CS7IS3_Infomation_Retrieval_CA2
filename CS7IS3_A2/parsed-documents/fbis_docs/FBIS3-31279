The attempt to reach a compromise between the two opposing sides at an early congress produced no results -- it was precisely at this congress that the final split occurred. The deputies and ministers group, as well as the majority of congress delegates, left the hall when they saw that the other side, the supporters of the radical Menduh Taci [chairman of the Tetovo branch of the PDP], was making every effort to hold the congress outside the Statute. What is more, Taci's group, which made the technical preparations for the congress -- it never crossed their minds to raise the Macedonian flag beside the party flag and the Albanian flag -- used force: They barred entry to members of the Central Assembly and prevented them from participating in the congress (a congress body), they prevented former president Nevzat Halili attending, and they deprived the delegates and ministers of their right to vote! A working presidency was not elected, for which only Menduh Taci's supporters were proposed! Some delegates of several simultaneously "formed" branches were also introduced. The intention was clear -- to ensure that Taci's current won at all costs. His supporters had another objective -- to take over the name and property of the party. The party seal was "sequestered," and the rooms of the Tetovo Center occupied. Obviously, it will be up to the court to decide -- who in the PDP is the PDP. Political Differences Something that has been clear for some time was once again confirmed: Taci's group is supported by the Republic of Albania. The delegation attending from Tirana, besides delivering the welcome speech (after the ministers and deputies group had left), remained till the end with Taci's supporters. The Kosovo delegation, sitting in the fourth row and not together with the guests from Albania, who were sitting in the first row, remained neutral after the "split" and left for Pristina, although they are on the side of the deputies group. Here is further evidence that Tirana is deeply involved in the party division and that it supports the "Tacists": Albanian Television's report on the congress was confined to Taci's congress, with the solitary remark that "a group of delegates left the congress," without mentioning the fact that it also held a congress. Let us recall that Albania has hosted Menduh Taci a couple of times, giving him support at very high level: the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party of Albania, various ministers, and even the Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi. Only at first sight does it seem that there are no differences in the programs of the two sides. As far as political activities are concerned, however, the differences are enormous and very substantial. At its congress Taci's group assessed that the deputies and ministers had a different ideology -- progovernment. They assessed that the final goal must be the unification of all Albanians! According to Taci, under the old leadership "Ilirida" remained undefined, and the result of the (government) coalition was the arms affair and the creation of other Albanian parties, which "destroyed the Albanian people." Another conclusion was that -- the Yugoslav Army and the Macedonian authorities were arming the Macedonians in their homes, and therefore the "Albanians had to create paramilitary formations!" In his report Taci accused the PDP and the deputies group of failing "to accentuate the interests of the Albanians" and said that the Albanians were not "an equal and authentic subject in Macedonia." As if the process of political activities aiming at national equality were limited in time, after which other methods of activities had to be undertaken. It is weird that a negative reply was given to the "authenticity" of the Albanian subject in Macedonia. Taci remarked that the position of the deputies group in parliament was dependent (is it not logical and normal with 22 deputies positions?) and that the coalition was created without having a political platform (and what is the PDP program, which is normally represented by the deputies group, with its additional requests, depending on the activities and agenda of parliament, which are not constant?). No More Coming Together Quite a different tune from that of Taci's supporters prevailed at the congress held by the supporters of the group of deputies and ministers, where all conditions were fulfilled to make it the Second PDP Congress. Aside from raising a large Macedonian flag, it was reiterated that the PDP will operate only through the institutions of the state, and that it was in the interest of the Albanian factor to have the party operate within the state authority. How the Albanians could otherwise pledge to promote their status in the state is dangerous even to think of. It was also said that the PDP must pledge to maintain peace and stability in the state, which was their fatherland, and official Albania was accused of interfering in the affairs of an "authentic party." The question now is -- what will become of the PDP? According to the first statements in the course of the two congresses, both sides claimed to have the right to the party. Taci was precise: "One of the dilemmas is over -- we inherit the party." This is probably not the case, however, because their congress was of doubtful legitimacy. The deputies and ministers group did not even think of whose hands continuity was in: "They had created a scenario and a voting team" (Naser Ziberi, their elected secretary, said). Yesterday, when we believed passions had cooled, we put the same question to both sides. The leader of the so-called "hard current," radical Menduh Taci, elected vice president by his supporters, declined to make a statement. He simply directed us to someone else: "Ask President Arben Djaferi." Djaferi said he would be giving neither statements nor interviews this week, but he agreed to give us an interview after the end of the week. Let us recall, Taci had also promised to give us an interview, but he did not keep his promise. We asked Djeladin Murati, the newly elected president of the other side, to make a statement. He is also vice chairman of the Macedonian People's Assembly. First, he told us he would occupy this position only temporarily. He was candidate for president of both sides, but he said he could not remain with the "Tacists" because they worked contrary to the Statute. "Privately, I never believed this would happen, and the PDP must survive even if there is a small degree unity and even if there are the problems of a careerist nature. The struggle for power must be waged in a democratic way, and not by way of disqualifying and labeling people," Murati told us. Further, Murati pointed out that divisions occur in other parties, too, and that the process of political differentiation and definition was normal, and usually beneficial. Murati said that the dispute within the PDP was of a program nature. He also emphasized, however, that arguments were needed, not simply some desires for autonomy, "Iliridas," or the refusal to join the Macedonian Army.... "The PDP pledges the maintenance of peace and stability, prosperity for the Albanians, without neglecting the others in Macedonia. I believe there will be a process of reexamination in the demonstrated relations, but it is unlikely the two sides will come together." If the other side wanted the name PDP, in Murati's opinion, it would have to give it a suffix.
