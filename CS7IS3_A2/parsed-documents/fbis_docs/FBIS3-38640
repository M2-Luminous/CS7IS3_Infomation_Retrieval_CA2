But he warned it was a double-edged sword, with air strikes carrying benefits and risks. Mr Rifkind spoke in Bosnia as Britain was expected to face overwhelming pressure at European Union talks in Brussels to support the use of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali yesterday asked NATO to prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in and around Sarajevo after Saturday's [5 February] mortar attack in the city which left 68 civilians dead. British Jaguar jets stationed on the Italian Adriatic coast could be among those involved in any strike. But Mr Rifkind warned that humanitarian aid convoys guarded by British troops could be jeopardised by air strikes. Mr Butrus-Ghali sent a letter to NATO Secretary-Seneral Manfred Woerner asking him to "take action" to obtain, as soon as possible, authorisation for the NATO Council to launch air strikes "against artillery positions in or around Sarajevo, which are responsible for attacks on civilians targets." Representatives of NATO's 16 members will meet in Brussels, possibly today, to discuss the call. NATO, which must carry out any air strikes, previously authorised only close air cover in case UN troops were attacked. Foreign ministers of European members of NATO gather separately today at the European Union's Foreign Affairs Committee in Brussels in a meeting that will test Western determination to intervene after the worst tragedy since the siege of the Bosnian capital began 22 months ago. Among other options, the subsequent NATO council meeting will consider delivering an ultimatum to the warring factions which could involve a deadline to the Serbs to lift the siege of Sarajevo or face air strikes. European Union governments are aware that the massacre has renewed criticism of their inaction in the Bosnian crisis. But any decision on military action would need agreement between the NATO nations, while the EU will concentrate on keeping humanitarian aid flowing. Mr Rifkind said he would support some specific military action if it could prevent atrocities such as the weekend shelling of the market place in Sarajevo. "There may be a powerful case for air strikes" and if military action was needed to defend UN troops from attack then it would be taken, he said. But he added: "It is no use trying to hide the fact that there would be real dangers to the aid programme which is saving tens of thousands of Bosnian lives." The Bosnian prime minister had told him during his current visit that without the aid programme, helped by RAF Hercules flights, the people of Sarajevo would have starved. Mr Rifkind was keen for Britain not to be portrayed as at odds with nations such as France and the United States who look more favourably on the option of air strikes. A discussion over the use of air strikes was currently going on in Britain, he said. "We also are trying to establish whether there is a sensible use of air power that would actually achieve the objective we all seek, or whether the net effect would be damaging rather than helpful," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Labour's defence spokesman Dr David Clark told the same programme: "We have got to recognise at the end of the day there cannot be a military solution in Bosnia but the military might help to bring about a solution." Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, arriving in Brussels for talks, backed calls for air strikes -- provided they do "more good than harm." He said: "Anything that is done has to be forward looking. It has to improve the situation and not simply react to the brutalities of the past." He said such caution did not rule out the use of air power because the principle of such action had already been accepted as long ago as last August. "I think after all that has happened the case for air action is very strong provided we can find a means for doing it in a way which produces more good than harm. That is really what NATO has to work out urgently in the next few days," Mr Hurd added. Freelance British aid worker Sally Becker was back in former Yugoslavia today for her third mercy mission aimed at keeping promises made on her last trip in December.
