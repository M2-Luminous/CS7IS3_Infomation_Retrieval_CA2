Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We have affirmed one basic principle: The ceasefire lines will change to international and recognised borders, which stress the unity of Jordanian territories, preempt any designs on them and preserve the Jordanian entity." He said the two sides had based their agreement on two main points: That the British mandate coordinates will be the reference for defining the border and that the borders will be delineated on the ground. Dr. al-'Anani was talking to reporters after two days of Jordanian-Israeli talks in Washington under the auspices of a trilateral commission which also includes the United States produced the agreements. The information minister said another major breakthrough was an agreement to work out a fair division of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers now being exploited by Israel at the expense of Jordan. Regional and international conventions will be the basis for determining the share of each side, he said. "We also agreed to look at the Jordan Valley project as a comprehensive project to discuss the development of its infrastructure and to develop large projects which will be discussed for the future," he said. "We agreed to conduct a number of studies that will pave the way to establish large development projects in the area," Dr. al-'Anani said. In this context the major project is a desalination project linked to a Jordanian-proposed canal connecting the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and this proposal will be studied closely, Dr. al-'Anani said. The minister said a Jordanian agreement to accept the presentation of an American paper on the Jordan Valley did not mean that the Kingdom was dropping its reservations over launching such projects before the border and water issues are settled. "In the framework of studies at the present time, we cannot think of such projects except after reaching an agreement on the border issue," Dr. al-'Anani said. Regarding the economic issues, especially in light of the agreement reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in April on banks and trade, the Jordanian side clarified the implications of such an agreement on the Jordanian economy, because it limits, to a certain degree, Jordan's freedom of exporting its goods to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Dr. al-'Anani said. The Israeli side agreed to the expansion of Jordanian exports to the Palestinian territories and also agreed that if there were any proposals in the future to issue a Palestinian currency, Jordan would be notified before hand to give it sufficient time to take measures to protect its currency. "It also became clear that there were issues to be discussed trilaterally: A proposal was made calling for a Jordanian-Israeli- Palestinian economic committee to discuss some of the issues in order to develop it and to finalise it in a proper way," Dr. al-'Anani said. "In my opinion, these are very important results for Jordan because it achieves and contributes to asserting the geographic and demographic unity of Jordan," the minister told reporters. The delegates from Israel and Jordan signed three documents setting out a detailed agenda for further talks. The first text concerns water, energy and the environment, the second addresses security and the third concerns the border and other territorial issues. The security text pledges that Israel and Jordan will draw up security arrangements and discuss confidence measures between the two sides. The two countries decided to begin negotiations on their border dispute in July, together with talks on development projects. The final border decision must refer to the boundary drawn up in 1922 by Britain, which then held the Palestine mandate, when it set the borders for Transjordan. Jordan hopes to regain a strip of about 360 square kilometres from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as two square kilometres south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan valley. [passage omitted]
