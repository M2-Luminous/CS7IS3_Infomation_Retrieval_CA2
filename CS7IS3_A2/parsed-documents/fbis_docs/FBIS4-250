The Cape Verdian Government's decision comes only a few days before the first multiracial elections in South Africa. Two Cape Verdian observers -- who will form part of the international observer team that will supervise the polls -- are already in South Africa at the request of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Apartheid. Trade links have already been in existence for the past several years between the two countries. Such links notably take the form of landing rights for technical stopovers at the Sal Airport by aircraft of the South African Airways.
