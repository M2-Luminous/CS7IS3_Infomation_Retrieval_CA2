The facts of the case, concocted by Congressman Wolf, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, state that in 1991, "China's Beijing No. One Prison was exporting goods to the United States". This case has finally been vindicated by the facts. On 27 March 1991, Representative Wolf and others visited the Beijing No. One Prison. When they toured the prison's sock workshop, Wolf attempted to take away without permission several pairs of semifinished socks on the table, but he was stopped then and there by the prison staff. After the tour, the warden gave each and every visitor five pair of socks as souvenirs. A few days later, however, Wolf, through the media outside China, without grounds, accused the Beijing prison of exporting socks it produced to the United States. Testifying to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations after he returned to the United States, Wolf brazenly accused China, displaying the five pairs of socks given to him as gift, and claimed they were "proof" that China was exporting goods made by inmates in reformatories to the United States. Although China made an immediate clarification and explained the real situation on many occasions, Wolf still disregarded the basic facts and continued his totally groundless charges on many other occasions. Thus, the "case of the Beijing prison's sock exports" suddenly created a hue and cry in the U.S. Congress and in the media, creating a very bad impression of China. Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy in China submitted a request to the relevant Chinese authorities to send some officials to visit the Beijing No. One Prison, and the authorities made arrangements for three officials of the U.S. Embassy in China to visit the prison on 30 March 1993. During the visit, the officials conducted a detailed investigation of the matter regarding Wolf's accusation that the prison was exporting inmate-produced socks to the United States. The officials then reported the results of their investigation to the U.S. Government. Later, Wolf again spread the lies he created and attacked China, without grounds, at another news conference held in the United States in the summer of 1993. The Chinese authorities time and again urged the United States to publicize the results of the investigation conducted by the embassy officials. On 13 December 1993, the U.S. Government publicized the results of the investigation in the FEDERAL REGISTER, and thus the factory was vindicated. An official of the relevant Chinese authorities pointed out, with regard to products produced by reformatories, the policy of the Chinese Government is clear: Reformatory-operated businesses do not have the right to carry out economic and trade activities with foreign countries or to conduct import-export business. China has been strictly abiding by the "Memorandum of Understanding on Banning the Import and Export of Prison-Produced Products" ever since it was signed by China and the United States. Facts are the most convincing proof.
