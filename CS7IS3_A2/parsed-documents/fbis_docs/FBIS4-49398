"We plan to go ahead with a vigorous base closing in 1995. And we will propose to close as many bases as we can effectively and efficiently execute," Perry said in a radio interview. There were reports in recent days that the Clinton administration is considering the move so as not to inflict economic pains to some of the communities and to alienate voters there in the 1996 elections. Last year, Congress approved, and President Bill Clinton signed, recommendations to close 130 military bases and scale back 45 others around the United States. According to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission that made the recommendations, the base closures will save the U.S. Treasury about four billion dollars from fiscal 1994 to 1999. After the year 2000, the U.S. is expected to save about 2.3 billion dollars each year as a result of the base closings.
