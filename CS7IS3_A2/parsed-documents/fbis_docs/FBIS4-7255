Yi Han-tong, floor leader of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was extremely upset Thursday as the main opposition Democratic Party [DP] insisted on calling 51 witnesses for the parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scam. "Do they think they are some kind of commanders of occupying forces?" Yi said in a meeting with reporters Thursday, the last day of the National Assembly's current extraordinary session. "Right now, the opposition party is making its demands as though the ruling party hasn't got any choice but to surrender," Yi said bitterly. "How could there be compromises with an opponent like that?" the agitated floor leader asked rhetorically. Commenting on the hardline taken by the opposition party, Yi theorized that it probably resulted from the power struggle between Chairman Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Kim Won-ki. -- The presidential office at Chongwadae appeared to heave a sigh of relief as the opposition Democratic Party showed signs of retracting its demand that all cabinet ministers step down. However, Chongwadae officials acted nonchalantly, asking, "isn't it a matter of course?" One official was more cautious: "We have to keep watching the opposition party's attitude until the end." The DP had been critical of President Kim Yong-sam when the chief executive forced Yi Hoe-chang to resign as prime minister for challenging the president's authority. The opposition party has been tabling a kind of no-confidence vote against the cabinet. But realizing that under the current constitution and the presidential form of government, the National Assembly has no right to file a no-confidence vote against the cabinet, the DP decided to seek the resignation of each and every cabinet member. Then in a tricky parliamentary maneuver, the DP is demanding that all cabinet members be listed on one ballot slip with voting in one motion, in effect a no-confidence vote. -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party held a meeting of senior party postholders and renewed its determination to handle the three issues pending before the National Assembly Thursday, the last day of the extraordinary session. DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called on the opposition Democratic Party to cooperate in resolving the three issues based on the spirit of the constitution and parliamentary democracy. --Over at the Democratic Party headquarters, the DP also held a meeting of the Supreme Council and reaffirmed that it would demand that the National Assembly call all 51 witnesses including former and current presidents for its investigation of the Sangmudae scam. The issue of calling the 51 witnesses had been the main stumbling block in the current impasse over the DP's demand to investigate the Sangmudae scam. The legislation and judicial subcommittee agreed Wednesday night to conduct a parliamentary investigation for 20 days from Thursday.
