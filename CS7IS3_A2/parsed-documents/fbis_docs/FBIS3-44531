That is an assessment of gambling by the common people. Those who gamble, whether they win or lose, will certainly come to no good end. It is not now that the CPC and the people's government are opposed to gambling. In the past thousands of years, in this ancient country of civilization of ours, gambling has always been denounced and banned and subjected to punishment. Gambling money, gambling paraphernalia, stakes, gamblers, and inveterate gamblers have never been commendatory terms. As far back as in the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, cock fighting, horse racing, and other similar gambling conduct were denounced as "evil ways"; in the Tang Dynasty, gamblers were subjected to bludgeoning and whipping; and in the Song Dynasty, they were even beheaded. It was decreed in the early Song Dynasty: "Those gambling in the streets will be beheaded and those neighbors who shield, harbor, or fail to report them will be treated in the same way." Although the "Law of the Qing Dynasty" gave the Man people certain privileges, the penalty meted out to those guilty of gambling was even harsher than to the Han people. In the West, there as "legitimate gambling" or "nonprofit institutional gambling," such as casino gambling, horse racing, and lotteries. However, after repeated investigation and studies, it can only be regarded as "something with a deep-rooted dual nature in terms of ethics and philosophy and many outstanding social issues." In modern or ancient times, in China or elsewhere, decent people do not gamble and or are opposed to gambling. However, dying embers glow again and the dregs of society have come to the surface. In socialist China, gambling, which is a social plague, has spread again in recent years. It involves a fairly wide spectrum of people, old, young, men, and women in both rural and urban areas. The modes of gambling have also diversified, from the indigenous to the foreign ones. What merits special attention is that criminal syndicates with gambling as their profession have taken shape in some localities. The number of gamblers has risen, the stakes become bigger, and cases of gambling- related theft, corruption, bribery, mugging, and homicide have increased. Gambling, as an ugly phenomenon, has seriously polluted society and poisoned the people. It is a great pity that some people have wittingly or unwittingly defended gambling, saying that it is an "exciting recreational activity," "kindling the spirit of competition and fighting to win," and is a psychological experience of "expectation," "confrontation," and "trusting to luck." Others regard gambling and pornography as "tourist resources" like sunlight, beaches, songs, dances, and shopping. All this is preposterous. Gambling is gambling. It is harmful in the same way as drug-taking, prostitution, and going whoring. How many people have lost their family fortunes, broken up their families, and brought disgrace and ruin upon themselves by the 144 mahjong pieces and 54 poker cards. These kinds of tragedy have been enacted one after another. To make a lot of money, some people in the Xinhui Qiaoqu Economic Development Company, Guangdong Province, recklessly took a gamble on over 10 million yuan of public money in Macao; they lost and suffered stern punishments according to state law. To be able to play mahjong free from care, a female worker in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, unscrupulously drowned her eight-year-old daughter. Gambling is fiercer than tigers. Failure to wipe out this scourge will bring calamity to the country and the people. Gambling is not recreation. Those wanting to have amusements should not gamble because they are entirely different. Now that New Year's Day and the Spring Festival are coming, it is good for people to come together and have fun, but on no account should they gamble and turn a good thing into a bad one.
