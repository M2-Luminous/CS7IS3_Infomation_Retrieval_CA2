The first claims that the city had been attacked came from UNITA sources at the weekend and they were confirmed by aid workers who have been forced to suspend their flights into Huambo. The escalation follows hard on the heels of reports of dozens of deaths in UNITA's shelling of the besieged cities of Malange and Cuito over the last few days. Karl Meyer of the London INDEPENDENT newspaper is in Luanda. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked him what information he had about today's raid on Huambo. [Begin recording] [Meyer] Well, at about 1:30 this afternoon, some government jets came in and dropped some bombs on Huambo, apparently around Bairro Academico, which is right in the center of the city and near one of the main schools. It was very close to the of the house of the Irish Aid Agency, Concern, very close indeed, and there doesn't seem to be another raid this afternoon. So, [words indistinct]. [Isaacs] Now, these aid agencies that are still in Huambo -- are they staying put or they are trying to leave now? [Meyer] Well, right now, they are staying put, of course, because there is no plane going in there, as long the bombing raids continue. I think it will be very difficult to get some planes in there. I think some of them are coming out anyway; some of their workers are coming out anyway because they are already scheduled to come out. So, if a plane does get in there, they will be coming out. But, I think quite a few of them plan to stay on. It is very difficult to keep coming in and out of this city. So, I think some of them will stay on. I believe the Red Cross plans to stay on, for example. [Isaacs] Now, with the escalation of the fighting in Huambo and other cities, like Cuito and Malange, it has been very difficult for the relief flights, for the World Food Program, to get in. Any more news about that? [Meyer] No, as far as I know, they can't go in. I think in Cuito, shelling was continuing today, although it was less than it was before. In Malange, they are facing the same problem -- every time they try to take a plane in, UNITA mortar men put some shells in the airport area. Uige, of course, is the other city that has been blocked, that is in the north. But that is more of a decision -- if the aid (?can't get) into Cuito and Malange, then, the government is saying, well, you can't go to Huambo and you can't go to Uige.
