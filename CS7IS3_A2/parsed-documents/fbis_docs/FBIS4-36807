Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, instructed the Government to prepare this convoy within 24 hours, send it to Aden, and distribute it free of charge among the residents of Aden, the economic and commercial capital. Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal explained that in implementation of the instructions of the brother chairman leader, the Government prepared a convoy of 100 trailers, 40 carrying wheat, 30 carrying rice, 21 carrying various products including peas, broad beans, vegetable oil, ghee, and tomato paste, and nine trailers carrying various kinds of vegetables. Ba Jammal said that the Government informed the International Red Cross that it is preparing this food convoy as part of a plan for the free distribution of these products among the Aden residents in accordance with the UN plans and programs. At a news conference he held in Sanaa yesterday afternoon, Ba Jammal said that the Government yesterday received a message from the Red Crescent and the Red Cross through their regional representatives in the Arabian Peninsula stating they had met with other officials and that the matter needs the approval of the other party, which, unfortunately, views this humanitarian gesture as a political action. He said that this is the story behind the obstruction of our humanitarian initiative by those who remained outside the homeland for 25 years and now returned to speak on behalf of its sons and prevent this assistance from reaching the sons of heroic Aden. At the news conference attended by correspondents from the local, Arab, and international media in Sanaa, the brother deputy prime minister denied the allegations and falsehoods circulated by the trumpets of the gang of apostasy and secession to the effect that the aircraft of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy are launching raids on the Aden refinery. He said the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy are careful not to harm this refinery or other vital economic installations. Brother Ba Jammal said that contacts continue with the unionist leaders in the YSP, both in and outside Yemen. He explained that these contacts take place through national figures from other groupings. The deputy prime minister, replying to questions posed by the media correspondents, tackled the national issues pertaining to the current developments in the Yemeni arena.
