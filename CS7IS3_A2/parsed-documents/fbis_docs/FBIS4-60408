We started off by asking him whether he agreed with Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, who reacted yesterday by saying that 'Arafat was behaving as though he has shelved his agreement with Israel and is now doing as he likes. [Beilin] No, everyone can draw his own analogy. I think that we are essentially dealing with the agreement's first days. There are definitely a lot of problems. There are also a great many hopes. I can say that this agreement has granted the Palestinians many important things they have never had; however, I can also state that Israel has control of all the safety valves. Therefore, I refuse to get worked up about every single act that may constitute a violation of the agreement, because we can ultimately prevent any such violation. [Engel] Dr. Beilin, in one of your previous interviews to IDF radio in connection to other statements made by 'Arafat, you said that it would be great to have an alternative but, regrettably, although 'Arafat is no Mandela, he is all we have. Our question is whether you consider that to mean that we must always just shrug our shoulders in resignation and plow ahead? Are there any red lines that 'Arafat will cross soon, if he has not crossed them already? [Beilin] The red line is very clearly written in black ink. It is the agreement itself. We will not accept any violation of the agreement. Any violation will.... [Dan, interrupting] But we have already seen many violations. [Engel] Does his latest decree not constitute a violation of the agreement? [Beilin] If it constitutes a violation of the agreement, we will not accept it. What do you mean? Does the fact that he issued a decree mean that it will be implemented? What is the whole agreement about? This agreement really gives us a series of measures by which we can prevent many things from happening if the other side violates the understandings. Therefore, if a situation indeed develops in which the legislation which was previously in force becomes irrelevant.... [pauses] After all, in the meantime, it is just a decree; the question is what happens when it is implemented. We can easily prevent the Palestinians from taking any action to implement the decree. [Dan] Perhaps the question is more on the psychological level. There is a crisis of confidence between the PLO and Israel. With whom did we sign an agreement? With people who are in such a hurry to violate it? [Beilin] Well, the psychological aspect is more of an individual matter. Those who had complete confidence in the other side probably feel less comfortable. Since I belong to the camp with low expectations, I do not have complete trust in the other side. You quoted my remarks accurately earlier. It is true that I regard this agreement as more the product of what is possible than of what is ideal. We will have to continuously monitor things step by step and check whether the agreement is being upheld. Each day brings its own problems. At the same time, we must bear in mind that this is the beginning of a very complex and historic stage. It would be stupid to view every single step as being either the end of the agreement or proof of its total success. [Engel] Perhaps it would be wiser to simply say that whatever 'Arafat said will not be implemented, because people hear his remarks and receive the impression that we are incapable of putting 'Arafat in his place. He continues to issue these statements, and if the Israeli Government treats him like a leader, then it is only natural that people in the street will assume that his decrees will be implemented in the field. [Beilin] I am not in any way minimizing 'Arafat's leadership of the Palestinian people. I do not take his remarks lightly. I am not proposing that we take his proclamations or actions lightly. I definitely think that we should continue to monitor his statements and actions and take the appropriate action whenever the Palestinians violate the agreement.
