This is how we can sum up the results of two opinion polls carried out by Szonda Ipsos in October 1992 and March 1993 using a sample representing the composition of Hungary's population. It was commissioned by NEPSZABADSAG. Although the general picture has changed only minimally in the past 18 months, more substantial changes have taken place on details. The increase in political and ideological extremist demonstrations and activities has brought this phenomenon from a geographic and historical distance to our immediate proximity. This is also clear from the fact that, while 40 percent of the people refused to answer this question or evaluate the danger of extremist political trends in 1992, fewer people did so now, namely 30 percent. However, this does not mean that people regard the situation as dire, but they continue to express their concern. Summing all this up into a single scale ranging from 0 to 100 and representing the feeling of danger, we find 29 points for extreme left-wing danger in the autumn of 1992 and 33 points in the spring of 1993; regarding extreme right-wing danger, the figures are 38 in 1992 and 40 in 1993. Both in 1992 and 1994, a third of people said they did not notice any extreme left danger, which also shows that the public does not absolutize extremist demonstrations. On the other hand, the number of people who consider the problem to be insignificant is slightly smaller: a quarter in both cases. However, the increase in the number of people who regard both the leftist and rightist danger as a more serious problem shows the increase in the relative weight of fear of extremism: An increase from 8 percent in 1992 to 15 percent now regarding the leftist danger, and an increase from 17 percent to 22 percent regarding the rightist danger. We can also simplify the issue of extremist trends to alternatives if we only examine which trend is regarded as more dangerous by the people surveyed, leftist extremism or rightist extremism. Both in 1992 and 1994, the biggest group was made up of people who see the two types of extremism as equally dangerous. The number of people who thought so has increased even more over the past 18 months, from 45 percent to 54 percent. Among people who feel a difference between the two extremist trends, there are more people who think the right-wing danger is more serious (36 percent in 1992 and 30 percent in 1994). The opposite view, namely a more serious leftist danger, was held by 19 percent in 1992 and 16 percent in 1994. In this, the opinions of various social groups differ only slightly, people expressing identical fears form a majority, and there are fewer who fear left-wing extremist trends than those who fear right-wing extremist trends. In 1992, people with a basic education and currently living in villages proved to be most divided in judging this issue: The same number of people saw a greater danger from one side as those from the other side. Among high school graduates, more regarded right-wing extremism as more serious (51 percent) in 1992, and fewer than average regarded the two sources of danger as equal (34 percent). At present, the size of these two groups is identical and makes up 40-40 percent of intellectuals. If, in addition to this trend, we also consider the extent of the danger, we can conclude that every social-demographic group regards right-wing extremism as a more serious problem. Both in 1992 and in 1994, with the increase in the level of education, people found the extreme right danger increasingly insignificant. While the differences in opinions of various groups regarding right-wing extremism were small or non-existent in 1992, we can now notice a considerable difference: People in towns, and particularly in Budapest, are more afraid of right-wing extremism (42 percent and 44 percent respectively) than people in villages (34 percent). It is also worth analyzing the positions of the potential voters for individual parties. With only one exception, we could say in 1992 that the sum total of various camps considered extreme right manifestations more dangerous than extreme left ones. Supporters of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] saw this differently: In their opinion, the danger mostly came from the left. Today, the picture is much more varied: Among the supporters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], the KDNP, and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], there are more who consider the extreme left-wing danger more serious than the other danger; among the supporters of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], people stressed the danger of the extreme right. Regarding the extent of the danger, the opinions of Fidesz and MDF supporters changed most: Compared with 1992, the feeling of danger from the extreme left has increased considerably. Consequently, supporters of both parties consider the extreme left to be slightly more dangerous than the extreme right. The same way of thinking is characteristic of KDNP supporters, but their position is less marked than 18 months ago. FKGP supporters regard the extreme left danger much more serious than the average, but they also fear the advance of the extreme right. There has been no essential change in the opinion of SZDSZ and MSZP supporters: They consider the extreme right danger more serious than the extreme left danger.
