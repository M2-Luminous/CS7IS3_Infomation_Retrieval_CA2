FR940822-1-00008 FR940822-1-00002 e. 1996 Tier 1 Non-Methane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) Standard for LDT4 There is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT4s. Both EPA and vehicle manufacturers believe that the NMHC standard represents an increase in stringency over the THC standard for previous model year LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. The same manufacturer that expressed concern in meeting the NMHC standard for LDT3 has similar concerns in meeting this standard and will use a similar strategy to lower the emissions. For the same reasons stated in the above discussion of the NMHC standard for LDT3s, EPA does not propose to offer NCPs for the NMHC standard at either the intermediate or the full useful life. f. 1996 Tier 1 CO Standard for LDT4 EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 7.3 g/mi at full useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions with current manufacturers of affected vehicles, EPA believes that manufacturers will not have difficulty in meeting the new standard. Since there are no 1993 model year LDT4s with CO certification levels higher than the new standard at full useful life, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop. The half useful-life standard of 5.0 g/mi is generally considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard of 7.3 g/mi. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for these standards. g. 1996 Tier 1 NO X Standard for LDT4 EPA recognizes that the new NO X standard of 1.53 g/mi at full useful life represents some increase in stringency over the prior standard of 1.7 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions with current manufacturers of affected vehicles, and based on the fact that there were no model year 1993 LDT4s certified which would exceed the new standard at full useful life, EPA believes that substantial work, as described above, will not be required of manufacturers and that a technological laggard is not likely to develop. The half useful-life standard for non-diesel vehicles of 1.10 g/mi is generally considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard. For these reasons, EPA does not propose to offer NCPs for the new LDT4 NO X standards. h. 1996 Tier 1 PM Standard for LDT4 EPA recognizes that the new PM standard of 0.12 g/mi at full useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior standard of 0.13 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. As in the case of non-diesel LDT3s, no work should be required to meet the new PM standard for non-diesel LDT4s. And based on discussions with current manufacturers of diesel-fueled LDT4 vehicles and on 1993 model year certification levels, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop or that substantial work, as described above, will be required to meet the new PM standard. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for the new LDT4 PM standard. i. 1996 HDDE Urban Bus PM Standard The 1996 HDDE urban bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr is more stringent than the previous 1994 0.07 g/BHP-hr PM standard it is superseding. EPA recognizes that some work may be necessary for the urban bus engine manufacturers to comply with the new standard. Based on discussions with those manufacturers, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to exist. Reinforcing that belief is the fact that the 0.05 g/BHP-hr standard was originally proposed as a 1994 standard. Detroit Diesel Corporation successfully argued that they could not effectively comply by 1994, and that if the 0.05 g/BHP-hr standard was delayed until 1996, and a standard of 0.07 g/BHP-hr was adopted in 1994, compliance could be achieved more efficiently. Furthermore, compliance with the 0.05 g/BHP-hr standard has been demonstrated in certification using a particulate trap system. And a catalyst equipped 1994 urban bus engine tested as low as 0.05 g/bhp-hr, although it certified to 0.07 g/bhp-hr. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for the 1996 0.05 g/BHP-hr PM standard for HDDE used for urban buses. j. 1998 HDE NO X Standard EPA acknowledges that the 1998 HDE NO X standard of 4.0 g/BHP-hr is an increase in stringency over the present 5.0 g/BHP- hr standard. EPA also believes, based on discussions with current manufacturers of HDEs, that additional work will be required to comply with the new standard. Improvements to turbochargers, conversion of remaining mechanical fuel injection systems to electronic control, and, in some cases, the use of exhaust gas catalytic converters will be necessary. But, based on those same discussions with manufacturers, and considering the fact that the standard does not become effective for an additional four years from this time, EPA believes that a technological laggard is not likely to develop. Therefore, EPA does not propose to offer NCPs for the 1998 HDE NO X standard. III. Penalty Rates This proposed rule is the most recent in a series of NCP rulemakings. The discussion of penalty rates in the Phase IV rulemaking (58 FR 68532, December 28, 1993), Phase III rulemaking (55 FR 46622, November 5, 1990), the Phase II rulemaking (50 FR 53454, December 31, 1985) as well as the Phase I rulemaking (50 FR 35374, August 30, 1985) are incorporated by reference. This section briefly reviews the penalty rate formula and discusses how EPA arrived at the penalty rates in this proposed rule. Emphasis will be placed on procedures different from those used to derive penalty rates during Phase II, Phase III, or Phase IV. A. Parameters As in the previous NCP rules, EPA is specifying values for the following parameters in the NCP formula for each standard: COC 50 , COC 90 , MC 50 , and F. The NCP formula is the same as that promulgated in the Phase I rule. COC 50 is an estimate of the industrywide average incremental cost per engine (references to engines are intended to include vehicles as well) associated with meeting the standard for which an NCP is offered, compared with meeting the upper limit. COC 50 is based on typical engine technology, as nearly as EPA can identify it. As in the previous NCP rules, costs include additional manufacturer costs and additional owner costs. The other NCP rules did not include certification costs in the calculation of COC 50 , and none will be allowed in this proposed rule because both complying and noncomplying manufacturers must incur certification costs.
