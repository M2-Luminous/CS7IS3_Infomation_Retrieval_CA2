(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D., 54 FR 16422 (1989). Of the stated factors, the administrative law judge found that all were relevant and that there was a statutory basis for revocation based on findings that Respondent engaged in a definite and clear pattern of furnishing huge quantities of controlled substances and other prescription medication to customers without physician authorization, and that Respondent was unable to account for substantial quantities of controlled substances. Respondent offered as evidence statements made by some of the physicians that they had actually treated some of the customers, and argued that there was a potential that the physician records failed to reflect authorization of certain prescriptions. Judge Bittner found this to be speculative and insufficient to counter the overwhelming evidence that Respondent's behavior was egregious and a total abrogation of its obligations as a DEA registrant. The administrative law judge concluded that Respondent's continued registration would not be in the public interest. Respondent filed exceptions to the opinion and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge asserting that the administrative law judge failed to consider that Mr. Garcia cooperated with authorities in the criminal proceeding brought against him and, as a result, he was given the least possible punishment. Furthermore, he asserted that the administrative law judge failed to consider as evidence of future conduct, the fact that Mr. Garcia cooperated fully with DEA and State officials and Mr. Garcia was in compliance with this probation. Finally, Respondent argued that it has suffered enough revocation of its DEA registration would be devastating to Mr. Garcia and the low income community it services. The Deputy Administrator finds that the administrative law judge has fully considered the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Garcia's guilty plea, which however, were outweighed by the Respondent's recent pattern of fraudulent activity which led to the diversion of large quantities of controlled substances. The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of Administrative Law Judge Bittner in its entirety. Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the Respondent's continued registration would not be in the public interest. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AD0931407, issued to Dellmar Pharmacy # 4, be and it hereby is, revoked; and that any pending applications, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 6, 1994. Dated: August 30, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21830 Filed 9&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
