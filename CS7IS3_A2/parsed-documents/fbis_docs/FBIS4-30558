The Hata administration has become a minority ruling government. It has become impossible to know whether the political world is making progress toward the coming political realignment or is possibly taking a step backward, losing its way. What do you think? [Kubo] It is still less than a year since the coalition government came into being; therefore it is inevitable that there should be trials and errors. However, I think the current government will make progress toward a stable coalition era, even though it is going through such a process at present. [Tahara] I think the greatest cause of the Hata administration's confusion is the withdrawal of the SDPJ from the coalition government. The media reported various reasons for the withdrawal, but what is the direct motive that made you think "there is no alternative but to withdraw from the coalition government"? [Kobu] In the nomination of the prime minister on 25 April, the SDPJ voted for Hata in a body; therefore we had no doubts up to that stage. However, although there was a mutual understanding that immediately after the nomination there would be a party chairmen's meeting concerning plans for the formation of a cabinet, as well as a secretaries' general meeting concerning procedures for the formation of a cabinet, we were not informed of anything and the night fell. Before long, it was reported on television that the ruling parties, except the SDPJ, had formed a parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Renovation]. Although Komeito (Clean Government Party] knew of the fact, the party did not participate in the formation of "Kaishin." For the coalition government to keep its stability and to perform its role in response to the expectations of the public, I think there must be mutual trust as a primary condition. There is no coalition without faithfulness. If a parliamentary group comprising 130 seats was to be formed without notifying the SDPJ and before the formation of a cabinet, and if the parliamentary group "Kaishin" was to take the absolute leadership in the formation of a cabinet as well as in the reigns of government, it was inevitable that a serious question had been raised as to the significance of the SDPJ's participation in the coalition government. [Tahwara] In that process, did you not have a talk, for example, with Ozawa about "Kaishin?" [Kubo] There was none. [Tahara] Were you not informed of the matter by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]? [Kubo] I was not informed of anything. On that day, Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], who had advocated "Kaishin," visited SDPJ Chairman Murayama. When the Japan New Party [JNP], in the days of the Hosokawa administration, suggested the formation of a parliamentary group "Kaikaku" [Reform], Ouchi opposed that together with Murayama. This time, however, Ouchi said, "There has been a change in the situation within the DSP since then, and it has become impossible to oppose the formation of a parliamentary group any longer. I cannot remain isolated in the party any longer, so I want you to understand my position." Chairman Murayama did not take Ouchi's visit seriously, thinking, "After formation of the cabinet, Ouchi will take a position approving the formation of a parliamentary group. That is the reason he took the trouble to come and tell me about it." [Tahara] You did not think that a parliamentary group would be formed on that day? [Kubo] Ouchi seems to have thought that he had done his duty by the SDPJ. At about 2000 that day, we were informed of the holding of a secretaries' general meeting. At the meeting Ozawa said, "A parliamentary group called 'Kaishin' has been registered. In forming the next cabinet, the allotment of the position of ministers will be made on the basis of the numerical strength of each party -- 'Kaishin' -- 130 seats; the SDPJ -- 74 seats; Komeito -- 52 seats." I said in reply, "The problem is why the parliamentary group "Kaishin" has come into being. Telling us such a story at this stage makes us lose our interest in discussing the formation of a cabinet. The SDPJ itself has to make its position clear." [Tahara] How did Ozawa respond to that? [Kubo] Ozawa said, "That's too bad. There is no time for that, because we must form a cabinet some time today." Then, I replied, "Such an important change in the situation has to do with faithfulness among the ruling coalition parties. I will talk to you some other time after the SDPJ's position has been decided." Then, we parted. At 2000 that day, a parliamentary group of 130 members, including Toshio Yamaguchi, was registered and accepted by the Secretariat of the House of Representatives. The fact that the parliamentary group was accepted at the same time as the opening of the secretaries' general meeting shows that there was an intent to form a parliamentary group before the formation of a cabinet. An important question the SDPJ has is what was its aim. I do not mind very much about the formation of the parliamentary group itself. [Tahara] The parliamentary group was formed so that it could take the leadership in forming a cabinet, was it not? [Kubo] I cannot help thinking that the matter was being conducted without the SDPJ's knowledge. [Tahara] Was Ozawa too sure that the SDPJ would not withdraw from the coalition government? [Kubo] Ozawa said to me directly afterward, "When Ouchi told me about 'Kaishin,' I thought that he had already told the SDPJ about it. The truth is that I agreed to the idea because I had always been in favor of it." [Tahara] Is Ozawa the kind of man who did not inquire of you to ascertain the matter when he heard the story from Ouchi? [Kubo] It may be that from his long experience in the ruling party, Ozawa thought that those who once took part in the reigns of government would not leave power easily unless unusual circumstances compel it. [Tahara] To Ozawa, the withdrawal of the SDPJ was beyond his imagination. [Kubo] To the SDPJ, political power and ministerial posts are the targets to which it should devote itself intensely for the realization of its aims, not the targets to which it should cling. [Tahara] I see. The SDPJ devotes itself to the targets, but does not cling to them. That is where Ozawa made a mistake. [Kubo] That is a natural thing to do from the viewpoint of the conservative party. What Is the Condition for Returning to the Coalition Government? [Tahara] By the way, when you visited Dairen, China, on 21 May, you held a press conference and caused a sensation by saying, "The Hata administration should resign en masse and establish a new, stable coalition government. If the Hata administration resigns en masse, is the SDPJ ready to join a new coalition government?." What is your real intention? [Kubo] I had been thinking that this was the only way for the coalition government to gain the firm support of the public, so I conveyed my intention frankly. I never thought that would become such big news. [Tahara] However, according to the opinion polls, the majority of the public thinks that the SDPJ will remain an opposition party for the time being, while SDPJ members seem to be relieved to be an opposition party. Therefore, your remarks have "betrayed" their expectations in a sense. You think the SDPJ should not remain an opposition party, do you not? [Kubo] Taking the helm of state affairs is the broad policy of the SDPJ. [Tahara] For this purpose, you can either join with the current coalition government or join with the LDP. Are you not taking the latter policy? [Kubo] That is unthinkable. And we have no intention to join with the current administration, either. However, we have to make every effort to make the coalition government stable. Hata's minority government will have no alternative but to resign after early passage of the budget, which has luckily gained mutual consent. Then political parties with will and zeal should get together, have a frank discussion, and establish "a third-term coalition government." Whether this third-term coalition government can be a stable, majority government is the crucial point of whether a future coalition era can be successful. Every ruling coalition party chairman can be a candidate for the head of the third-term coalition government. Hata can be the head. Even if Hata is elected, a new administration headed by Hata is not Hata's reorganized cabinet, but a completely new administration. That is why the SDPJ can join with it. [Tahara] What is the SDPJ's condition for joining with the government after Hata reigns? Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] proposes three conditions: (1) disband "Kaishsin"; (2) call the responsible person to account; (3) establish a new decision-making system in place of the former secretaries' general meetings. [Kubo] I am in favor of the third condition. It is important that party chairmen's meetings should be clearly defined as a decision-making system. [Tahara] Both Murayama and Ouchi expressed their dissatisfaction that a party chairmen's meeting had never been held since the establishment of the coalition government. [Kobo] That is saying a little too much, because it was Yamahana who was the chairman of the SDPJ when the Hata coalition government was established. At that time, all the chairmen of the ruling parties were cabinet members, so a Cabinet meeting played the role of a party chairmen's meeting. However, along the way the chairmanship changed from Yamahana to Murayama. Murayama could not attend government ruling party chairmen's meetings because he was not a cabinet minister although he was the chairman of the party. It is a little unreasonable to say that there have never been party chairmen's meetings. [Tahara] What about the first condition, the dissolution of "Kaishin?" [Kubo] I do not interfere in the formation of a parliamentary group by like-minded persons, but on condition that the method of forming the group does not go against the faithfulness to be observed among the ruling coalition parties. In that sense also, "Kaishin" should be dissolved once. [Tahara] What do you mean once? [Kubo] If they stick to "Kaishin" at any cost, a conference among the ruling coalition parties must be a tripartite conference -- three persons representing "Kaishin," the SDPJ, and Komeito [Clean Government Party], respectively. Actually, however, the representatives of all the parties that compose "Kaishin" attend the conference for discussion. That makes one wonder what is the raison d'etre for a parliamentary group. [Tahara] You mean to say that one representative from "Kaishin" is enough? [Kubo] That is right. They talk with the backing of 130 members when that is to their advantage. When numerical superiority makes things easier, the parties that comprise "Kaishin" send their own representatives. That is too selfish. [Tahara] What about the responsibility for forming "Kaishin?" [Kubo] I expect each party will take proper measures concerning the responsibility for having formed "Kaishin." And, if Prime Minister Hata has decided to resign en masse to dissolve the unstable minority government, the responsibility for "Kaishin" will be considered to have been determined. [Tahara] You mean to say that a resignation en masse will exonerate them from their responsibility? [Kubo] We donot insist forever that they punish someone or another. If we stick to that kind of thing, a coalition government will not be realized. Is Ichiro Ozawa a Reliable Politician? [Tahara] An issue always raised by the media is the so-called "Ichi-Ichi [Ozawa and Ichikawa] team running out of control." You have actually attended secretaries' general meetings and talked to them in person. Does "running alone by Ichi-Ichi" really exist? [Kubo] It is true that Ozawa and Ichikawa agree with each other on various problems. However, the rumor that the two men have taken leadership not only at secretaries' general meetings, but also in the decision-making process among the ruling coalition parties is not correct in my opinion. [Tahara] So far, have you experienced a kind of surprise attack like the formation of "Kaishin," for example? [Kubo] I cannot say positively that there has never been such an atmosphere. When the two men and I disagreed with one other, I stubbornly held out, reaching a conclusion through mutual concessions in the end. For example, there was the problem of the national welfare tax. Ozawa and Ichikawa were in a position to encourage Hosokawa to implement it, but the SDPJ strongly opposed it. We even told Hosokawa that "we would have to consider bolting from the government," which brought about its withdrawal. [Tahara] Before Hosokawa announced the introduction of the national welfare tax, was there not a general agreement on it at the secretaries' general meeting? [Kubo] No, there was none. [Tahara] What I heard from Shinseito and Komeito members is that the SDPJ must have known about it, however vaguely. [Kubo] When Hosokawa said, "I will implement it on the basis of my judgment," I said in reply, "I have nothing to say if you assume full responsibility. But the SDPJ will not agree to it. I want to make that clear." And Chairman Murayama also said, "If you enforce it, we will have to consider bolting from the government." Then came a pre-dawn press conference. [Tahara] Now this is important. As far as I know from my news gathering, the SDPJ had taken a rather vague attitude before the announcement, so Hosokawa and Ozawa judged that "they could carry it through." However, when Hosokawa announced it, the SDPJ's opposition was surprisingly enough stronger than expected. This is similar to the problem of "Kaishin." [Kubo] At about 1900 before the announcement, a secretaries' general meeting was held in the Prime Minister's Office. At the meeting, too, I said, "The SDPJ cannot agree to it." Then we decided to meet again after each party had another discussion about the matter. Afterward Chairman Murayama and I went to see Hosokawa and told him that "we could not agree to it," we had a dispute with Ozawa and Ichikawa when they said, "Why did the chairman show up here?" We said, "It is right that the ruling parties should work out a tax reform policy for which they can take responsibility. We are proposing establishing a deliberative body to have full discussions about the matter among the ruling parties. We cannot give our consent to the way decisions are made without regard to our proposal." Ozawa became angry and even said, "Then, shall we stop holding a secretaries' general meeting?" [Tahara] I think that the withdrawal of the national welfare tax and the "Kaishin" turmoil were probably decided by Ozawa. Even if the SDPJ returns to the coalition government, can the party trust a man like Ozawa? [Kubo] I have no intention of giving my advice to a politician who takes the leadership in a party. However, Ozawa and I have wide differences of opinion about the world and the way of conducting politics. However, we can take the helm of state affairs together concerning the problem of what to do with Japan for the present. [Tahara] Why can you work together? [Kubo] Because I think that our fighting in the same government helps to make the government sound. [Tahara] You mean that your ideas are different from Ozawa's, but that you can work together because you have trust in him as a man and as a politician? [Kubo] That is right. He is a very influential politician. It is amazing to see him go head on with his strategy with tremendous force. That is why we must be in the government and play the role of a powerful brake. [Tahara] Ozawa plays the role of a powerful accelerator. [Kubo] There are times when he plays the opposite role. There are times when Ozawa, on the basis of his world view, puts the brake on what the SDPJ is trying to do. [Tahara] What do you think are the strong and weak points of Ozawa as a man? [Kubo] Since Ozawa and I are incumbent Diet members, I had better not evaluate him a man. Anyway, he has thought-out strategies, pushes toward his goal, and fells the other man with force if necessary. These are his strong points. However, these are also his weak points, which can be the enemies of democracy. [Tahara] A reckless man? [Kubo] Probably, he does not think of himself as a reckless man. [Tahara] Concerning the problem of "Kaishin," the media widely reported that Ozawa had launched a "surprise attack." Is he a man who uses such a trick? [Kubo] I do not think he uses many tricks. [Tahara] Now, this is a very important point. Ichiro Ozawa is said to be a man who plays tricks and streamrolls with force and numerical strength, and a politician who is capable of doing anything to achieve his end. He is not necessarily such a person? [Kubo] His speech and behavior make me feel that he has a tendency to brush aside and ignore those who oppose his ideas. [Tahara] Have you ever been tricked or ignored by Ozawa? [Kubo] I do not think there were many cases like that between Ozawa and me. Since Ichiro Ozawa and Wataru Kubo were the farthest apart in the ruling coalition parties, we had been wary of each other. On the other hand, however, we had a sense of solidarity in that we were the support and driving force of the common government, so I do not feel I was betrayed or deceived. [Tahara] You did not think you were deceived by Ozawa and the others in the "Kaishin" turmoil? [Kubo] In the end, I think the SDPJ suffered what is commonly called a "surprise attack." If Ozawa participated in the "surprise attack," I will have to amend the image of Ichiro Ozawa that I had. However, judging from what I heard from Ozawa, he seems to have had no intention of "launching a surprise attack." [Tahara] If Ozawa had launched a surprise attack, the SDPJ would not join with a new coalition government, would it? [Kubo] A coalition government cannot be realized unless it is based on mutual respect and trust. In that sense, I have neither the feeling that I was deceived by Ozawa nor the feeling that I deceived him, although there were many times when we opposed each other, having different opinions. The SDPJ, Too, Must Change [Tahara] You said before that there would be no coalition between the LDP and the SDPJ, but Chairman Murayama said, "If the LDP changes greatly, there can be a coalition with it." What do you think about this? [Kubo] To my mind, a coalition between the LDP, with more than 200 seats, and the SDPJ, with 70 seats, is meaningless and impossible if their policies remain greatly unchanged. By "a great change in the LDP," Chairman Murayama meant a breakup of the LDP. I think that a coalition is possible if the extent of the difference is such that they can hold political power jointly with regard to their ideas and policies. [Tahara] Then, if the SDPJ is to join with a new coalition government, what are the future plans of the SDPJ? Yamagishi and others propose "a union of liberal forces." [Kubo] When the coalition government was established last year, I talked with Ozawa about the reigns of government for the first time. He said, "I will accomplish political reform through the coalition government and create an era of two conservative parties." I refuted him by saying, "You have bolted from the LDP because you thought that the current LDP cannot shoulder Japan's politics and that new conservatism must be formed. What is the meaning of a new conservative party competing with the old LDP for political power?" The SDPJ must also change in the same way as the LDP. It would be ideal if a new-born SDPJ and like-minded people got together and formed a new reformist force, and if such a new reformist party and a new conservative party compete for political power. However, that will take considerable time under the current political situation. In that sense, I think a tripolar era will come: (1) an LDP which tries to transform itself into a new conservative party; (2) another conservative party centering around Shinseito; (3) a newly mustered reformist political force -- a force which is not particular about the history of the SDPJ or about the name of the party. It would be desirable for political power to be established through the union of either of the conservative parties on the basis of respective policies, with a new reformist party as the axis. [Tahara] In that case, what would be the slogans of the new reformist party? [Kubo] They would be "peace and justice," although they sound abstract. Thorough implementation of democracy and respect for self-government are the political methods to realize these slogans. The pillars of political measures to be promoted are disarmament, human rights, the environment, and welfare. It would be good if a wide circle of people who can agree on these matters got together. I do not think ideological problems are of great importance. [Tahara] Then, that is not very different from conservatism. The other day I said to LDP President Yohei Kono, "What is the difference between the LDP's flag and Ozawa's flag?" Kono said, "Ozawa seems to think that the state comes before its people. But we want to built a nation for its people and for the benefit of its people." Fundamentally, there seems to be no difference between your thinking and that of Kono's LDP. [Kubo] When Miyazawa became prime minister, I read his books or listened to his general policy speech, which made me feel that we had much in common. Kono may be the same. However, our political footings are different. Miyazawa changed when he became prime minister; probably he had to change. I once severely criticized Miyazawa saying, "There is a difference between what you have been saying and what the LDP is going to do." [Tahara] I want to ask you about "peace" in your "peace and justice." In referring to peace, Ozawa says, "Japan must make a contribution to world peace. The United Nations must restore peace and order when they are disturbed. Japan should participate with the United Nations." [Kubo] I also think that human cooperation should not be spared. However, it is clear that military cooperation is impossible under the current Constitution, and the United Nations has approved Japan's membership in it with the understanding of that fact. For this reason, Japan cannot be forced to make a military contribution under "the collective actions" listed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, nor should we choose that road. There should be other roles that Japan can play, excluding a military contribution, such as economic cooperation, medical services, natural disaster relief, and dealing with the aftermath of regional conflicts. To carry out such cooperation, I think it is better to raise forces equipped and trained in addition to the Self-Defense Forces. In connection with this, there was an issue on which Ozawa and I had divided opinions to the last in the policy talks immediately before the establishment of the Hata administration. [Tahara] That is the issue of collective actions and universal security, is it not? [Kubo] Ozawa ventured to take up only collective actions provided for in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. However, collective actions and peaceful means are written side by side in Article 1. Therefore I insisted: "Under the current Constitution, it is impossible for Japan to make a contribution to collective actions; therefore that should be deleted from the policy agreement." As far as peaceful means are concerned, that is, in my opinion, what Japan should do in response to the request of the United Nations, and there are ways of cooperation which can gain the respect of the world. [Tahara] I want to ask you about universal security. If United Nations forces are dispatched somewhere, can Japan render rear assistance for the forces? [Kubo] In my opinion, that is impossible. However, as for cooperation at military bases stipulated by the Japan-U.S. agreement, the extent of cooperation must be examined, to my mind. [Tahara] Another word I want to ask you about is "justice," which seems intelligible but is actually unintelligible. What does it mean concretely? [Kubo] Now all countries, including socialist countries, practice a market economy, and economic vitality cannot be produced unless the principle of competition is followed. And if the economy is activated, profit will become larger. Politics plays an important role in impartially distributing the profit among every citizen and every country. Concretely, "justice" has to do with the problems of tax systems and budgets. [Tahara] What Ozawa is always saying is "self-responsibility" and "self-reliance." In short, an underlying principle is "free competition," from which the idea of "deregulation" is derived. "Justice" is a little different from "free competition," is it not? [Kubo] That is right. I am opposed to the view that "every regulation should be abolished." To ensure social justice, the government must bear the responsibility for carrying out necessary regulations. The abolition of all regulations will bring serious consequences. [Tahara] Do you mean that regulations are necessary for the protection of the weak and that the strong must be restrained? [Kubo] That is right. [Tahara] If free competition is carried to the extreme, the weak becomes the victim of the strong. This is where you differ greatly from Ozawa. [Kubo] It is important to mind one's own business. However, as long as there is social inequality because of the existence of people who cannot mind their own business, the government must not forget to level off the inequality or to give political assistance; otherwise its reason for being is meaningless. Why Is the Amendment of the Constitution Through Interpretation Dangerous? [Tahara] In dealing with the problem of the Constitution, the SDPJ had once used the words "creation of the Constitution," which are a little unclear. What do you think about the Constitution now? [Kubo] There is a question about the Constitution: "Germany has already amended its Constitution dozens of times since the end of World War II. Why is the Constitution of Japan a code of laws that will be in effect forever?" The German Constitution is an organic law, which is different from that of Japan which is an idealistic law. Therefore, I think it important to institute concrete organic laws under the idea of the Constitution of Japan. The problem of the environment as well as the problem of security was nonexistent when the Constitution was established. Concerning the idea of the Constitution, I think that we should not interpret it differently with the change of circumstances. As you know, procedures for the amendment of the Constitution are stipulated in it. We think highly of the Constitution, including the procedures. [Tahara] In short, all we have to do is to amend the Constitution according to the procedures if necessary. [Kubo] That is right. In other words, nothing is more dangerous than to promote policies, taking "amendment of the Constitution through interpretation" for granted. [Tahara] Do you think that "amendment of the Constitution through interpretation" is in progress at present? [Kubo] Yes, I do. Ozawa's way of thinking is: We had better amend the Constitution through interpretation. It is a tremendous job to amend the clauses of the Constitution through those procedures; therefore the interpretation of the Constitution had better be done by the then incumbent government. I think this is a dangerous idea. [Tahara] However, if "amendment of the Constitution through interpretation" is already in progress, there is no alternative but to amend the Constitution or to restore the interpretation. [Kubo] "Amendment of the Constitution through interpretation" appears to be a concrete policy and is realized through its implementation. Therefore our duty is to change that in conformity with the idea of the Constitution. [Tahara] To put it concretely, do you think that the Self- Defense Forces and peacekeeping operations of today go beyond the idea of the Constitution? [Kubo] Yes, I do. Unless one recognizes the actual situation of Japan's society established through the procedures of parliamentary democracy under "the Constitution of Japan," one cannot join with the government. Therefore I am not of the opinion that unless a decision is reached as to whether the Self-Defense Forces are constitutional or not, one cannot join with the government. [Tahara] This is an important point, so I want to repeat it. The Self-Defense Forces of today and peacekeeping operations go beyond the idea of the Constitution. However, their deviation is not an unlawful deviation in the light of the procedures of today's democratic society; therefore you approve of the present situation. The SDPJ wants to restore that to an ideal condition in the future by joining with the government. [Kubo] That is right. To put it concretely, we promote disarmament, which has become the trend of the world. Although we do not know whether it will take 50 or 100 years, we should push disarmament while recognizing the existing circumstances. If we reach the ultimate in disarmament, there will be no disputes about constitutionality or unconstitutionality, which is the ideal of the Constitution. [Tahara] Your ideas may conflict with the ideas of Ozawa and others. Your idea is that conflicts make things better and that things are kept stable through the relationship between the accelerator and the brake. [Kuho] That is right. The characteristic of the coalition era is for people with different ideas to form a government. Basically, the Diet is exactly like that, is it not? If one says that people with different ideas cannot work together, one has to disband the Diet. The Diet is the place where people with different ideas have discussions and reach a conclusion. [Tahara] A place where there is no accelerator or no brake is dangerous. At present the bureaucrats have only an accelerator and do not have a brake, which makes the situation all the more dangerous.
