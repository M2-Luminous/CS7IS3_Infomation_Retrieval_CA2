FBIS TRENDS-2JUN94-SYRIA-PEACE SYRIA-PEACE PROCESS SYRIA-PEACE PROCESS Scoring "Phased Solutions," Syria Leaves Slight Wiggle Room SUMMARY Syria's blanket rejections of "phased settlements"--a prominent theme during Secretary of State Christopher's recent visits--are in effect conveying to the Syrian public that Damascus will not accept any peace settlement without prior Israeli commitment to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, while leaving open the possibility of gradual, reciprocal steps to exchange land for peace if full withdrawal is predetermined. Maintaining slight flexibility, Damascus has repeatedly articulated its opposition to any "phased settlement" by defining it as precluding total withdrawal and has refrained from publicly demanding a specific timetable for Israel's return of the Golan. END SUMMARY Against the background of the Secretary's 29 April-1 May and 15- 18 May shuttle visits between Syria and Israel, Damascus repeatedly stressed its opposition to the notion of a peace settlement in stages--a consistent theme in Syrian rhetoric since September 1992, when it began negotiating with a Labor government in Israel (see box). For example, reacting to a plethora of Israeli media reports on claimed Israeli draft proposals that were said to involve phased withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for measures to establish peaceful relations, one Damascus radio commentary criticized Israel for "talking about testing Syria's intentions" over "several years" and warned that "Israel wants to drag the Arab parties participating in the peace process into partial, phased agreements" (22 April). Coinciding with the Secretary's talks in Damascus on 18 May, the daily Al-Thawrah asserted that "since the beginning Syria has been aware of the fact that the path of peace does not pass at all through partial solutions, phased settlements, or individual deals" (Damascus radio, 8 May). Syria's closely controlled media have continued this line since the visits, with a Tishrin editorial on 1 June citing Israeli offers of "partial solutions and phased settlements" as evidence "that Israel is the party responsible for wasting time and for undermining the peace process" (Damascus radio). Accordingly, Damascus publicly dismissed the possibility of a "Majd al-Shams First" arrangement, rumored by Israeli media as a plan by which Israel would withdraw from four Druze villages in the Majd al-Shams area of the Golan Heights as an initial step toward a full peace settlement (Qol Yisra'el, 29 April). At the end of the Secretary's first series of talks in Damascus, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' was quoted by Reuters news agency as declaring in response to a question on phased withdrawal that "we will not accept peace in stages" (1 May). Asked about the "Majd al-Shams First" idea, he reportedly dismissed it as a "silly proposal." That reaction was echoed in somewhat milder but no less derisive terms in Syrian media, which compared "Majd al- Shams First" to "Gaza-Jericho First," the Israeli-Palestinian agreement that Syria regularly vilifies in its media (for example, Al-Ba'th, as reported by Damascus radio, 4 May). "Phased Settlement" Means "Partial Withdrawal" Nevertheless, Syria has tended in its public statements and media commentary to characterize the notion of "phased settlements" in such narrow terms as to avoid shutting the door entirely to any gradual measures to exchange land for peace. By consistently portraying "phased settlement" as virtually synonymous with partial Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the Syrian public line has focused exclusively on the demand for a clear Israeli commitment to full withdrawal. For example: -- During the SMEC's visit to the region last October, an editorial in the daily Tishrin rejected a phased settlement by maintaining that "Israel wants to transform the phased settlement into a permanent settlement; that is, it wants to buy time, prolong the negotiating process, and manipulate its course to keep Arab territories" rather than accept a commitment to full withdrawal (Damascus radio, 20 October 1993). -- In a joint press conference with visiting Secretary Christopher last December, al-Shar' was asked about rumors of a U.S. draft proposal involving a four-stage Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. While denying the existence of such a proposal, he nonetheless declared that "Syria rejects this proposal," explaining that "we in Syria will not accept the achievement of the aspired peace in the region unless there is full withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan" (Damascus TV, 9 December 1993). -- Following Secretary Christopher's 1 May talks in Damascus, al- Shar' was quoted by Syrian media as asserting that "Syria rejects peace in stages with Israel" and that "it insists on total withdrawal from the Arab occupied territories as a condition for the establishment of peace in the region" (Al-Bath and Al- Thawrah, 2 May). Al-Shar' was subsequently quoted by Damascus radio as telling a visiting Swiss official that "the Israeli proposals conveyed by Secretary Christopher during his latest visit did not help achieve progress because they were based on premeditated Israeli intentions not to fully withdraw from the territories that were occupied in 1967" (Damascus radio, 19 May). Through such rhetoric, Syria, in effect, appears to have limited the scope of its public rejection of phased settlements to a rejection of any such solution insofar as it precludes or fails to guarantee total withdrawal. The implication was underscored in Syrian media coverage of al-Shar's remarks to Reuters on 1 May. Omitting his characterization of the "Majd al-Shams First" proposal as a "silly idea," the media cited him as addressing the proposal by saying simply "that Syria's position is the return of the Golan in full" (Al-Ba'th and Al-Thawrah, 2 May). Demands on Timetable Vague Damascus also has continued to avoid wedding itself before the Syrian public to a specific timeframe for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In contrast to its consistent calls for "immediate" withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, Syria's demands for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan--since the start of the current peace talks in October 1991--have almost always either avoided the question of a timeframe or referred to it in vague terms. Accordingly, in December 1992, Syrian media made no mention of comments at a Washington news conference by Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, chief Syrian negotiator in the bilateral talks with Israel, in which he appeared to demand an extremely short timeframe for Israeli withdrawal (see Note 1). (Note 1) Al-'Allaf had stated in response to a question that an acceptable Israeli withdrawal would involve "not phases in terms of weeks and months but the necessary thing which is logistically needed" (Federal News Service transcript, 17 September 1992). Against the background of the Secretary's recent shuttle diplomacy, Syrian media stepped up general calls to establish an Israeli timetable for withdrawal but continued to avoid specifics other than urging that the timeframe be "quick" (for example, Damascus radio, 26 and 29 April; Tishrin editorials as reported by Damascus radio, 4 and 16 May). Another editorial in Tishrin used still more general wording, insisting merely that Israel commit itself to "full withdrawal from the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period of time" (Damascus radio, 15 May) (see Note 2). Since the visit, al-Shar' was reported by Egypt's official news agency, MENA, to have been asked during a visit to Cairo whether Syria could accept an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan over a period of three years. He responded, "We will not talk about these details until after Israel agrees to the principle of full withdrawal" (MENA, 31 May). (Note 2) Syrian delegation spokeswoman Bushra Kanafani used similar phrasing two years ago in demanding a timetable for Israeli withdrawal, but her comments--conveyed in response to a question at a Washington news conference--were not carried by Syrian media (Federal News Service, 14 September 1992). Implications Through its negative public treatment of "phased settlements," Damascus continues, in effect, to prepare the Syrian public for either a deadlock in the peace process or a peace agreement involving no less than an explicit Israeli commitment to full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Beyond this public bottom line, however, Damascus has in effect neither encouraged nor discouraged Syrian public perceptions that the government would consider reciprocal phased measures toward normalization of ties in return for Israeli withdrawal, if the Israelis were to commit themselves in advance to an eventual full retreat. In any event, the vagueness of Syrian demands for a withdrawal timetable likely reflects the recognition that if such withdrawal is agreed to, it will be undertaken in stages over a number of years. Box: No "Phased Settlements": A Staple of Syrian Rhetoric Opposition to a "phased settlement" has been a consistent theme in Syrian media through much of the current peace process. For example: -- In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in September 1992, al-Shar' declared that while "the road to a comprehensive and just peace is clear and well known, . . . any maneuvers to carry out partial withdrawal or phased steps will not bring peace to the region or Israel" (Damascus TV, 28 September 1992). -- Damascus radio asserted in December 1992 that "Syria will never go along with partial solutions or phased withdrawals" (16 December 1992). -- At the end of Special Middle East Coordinator (SMEC) Dennis Ross' visit to the region last July, a Damascus radio commentary claimed that "the problem is still in Israel," which it said "insists on a peace by installments and by phased settlements aimed, as they say, at testing the Arabs' peaceful intentions" (14 July 1993).
