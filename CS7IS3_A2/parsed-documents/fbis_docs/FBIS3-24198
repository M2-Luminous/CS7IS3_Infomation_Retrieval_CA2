Shilnikov, economic correspondent: "The Negotiations Are Over"] [Text] On 11 February "groups of experts from Tyumen Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, agreed on the following": Subsection One: "It is necessary and possible to combine" the drafts of the treaty submitted by Tyumen Oblast and the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs for the purpose of elaborating a single, agreed draft treaty on this basis. "Necessary and possible"--this is quite good in itself. What is the subject of the treaty? Take a look at the second subsection: "The subject of the treaty is the whole group of interrelations" between Tyumen Oblast and the two okrugs. Let us move on from the subject of the treaty to the title. It is listed in the third subsection: "The working title of the treaty is the Treaty on the Interrelations of Tyumen Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug--with a specific reference in the text of the treaty to the status of the parties to the treaty as autonomous and equal members of the Russian Federation." An old Russian adage tells us: "Go ahead and call it a pot if you wish, but do not put it on the stove." This is not the case here, and this is why I have quoted the third subsection in its entirety. This is the time to say something about the structure of the treaty. Experts are experts, and they make provisions for these "minutiae." This, therefore, is the structure: the preamble, the general provisions, the principles of interrelations, the interrelations of state governing bodies, interrelations with agencies of local self-government, interrelations with federal government agencies and their territorial structures, humanitarian contacts, the settlement of disputes, and the final provisions. As we can see, everything is specified in detail. This was the fourth and last subsection of the protocol of consent, and now it is time to move on to the protocol of dissent. It consists of only one sentence: "The groups of experts from Tyumen Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, could not reach a general consensus on the interpretation of the term used in Article 66 (4) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation--autonomous okrugs constituting part of the oblast--and the term proposed jointly by the groups of experts from the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs--`autonomous okrugs located within the territorial-administrative boundaries of the oblast.'" The protocol of dissent is cited exactly as written, down to the last comma. The fourth subsection of Article 66 of the Constitution is a serious matter and, in general, there is no reason to expect the parties to find a common language in a hurry. After all, why would an okrug want to give up its constitutionally guaranteed status as an equal member of the federation? The very fact that the experts met for this conference suggests that the oblast administration has reconsidered its methods of solving the problem of oblast unity and has given up making decisions "from a position of strength" in favor of making decisions "from a position of probability." This is not a bad change, particularly from the standpoint of the economy. After all, while they were fighting, they managed to cause considerable destruction. To put it more precisely, they managed to miss several opportunities. All I have to add is that the oblast administration was represented by the following experts: G. Chebotarev, L. Berezin, and S. Nikitin; the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug was represented by G. Tikhonov, N. Usoltsev, and V. Sharafilov; the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug was represented by A. Arteyev and G. Chudnovskiy. Now all of this is a matter of public record.
