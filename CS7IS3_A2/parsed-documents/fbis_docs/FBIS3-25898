Bei Ling, 34, editor-in-chief of the quarterly, said police authorities maintained the literature quarterly contained some "questionable" content. A veteran dissident in the democratic wall movement of 1979, Mr Bei was questioned at Shanghai airport and interrogated in Shenzhen for three days last week. The police did not identify the magazine as reactionary. Police especially questioned one article, `The Nightmare of the Post-Communist', written by Czech President Vaclav Havel and translated by Shen Tong, an active dissident of the 1989 pro-democracy movement. The magazine was blamed for publishing Chinese literature written by dissidents. It reports dissident poets such as Meng Lang and Mo Mo and the prominent dissident writers in exile--Liu Qin Zheng Yi and Bei Ming. Mr Bei said 2,500 copies will be published in Hong Kong and overseas.
