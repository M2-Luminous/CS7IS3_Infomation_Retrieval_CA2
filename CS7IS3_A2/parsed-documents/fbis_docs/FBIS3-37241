Nuclear fuel stocks at nuclear power plants are running out while fresh supplies from Russia have been stopped as of the beginning of this year. The TVEL concern, Russia's sole producer of nuclear power fuel, cites the ban by the State Committee for Supervision over the Safety of Work in Industry and Atomic Power Engineering [Gosatomnadzor]. The latter for its part points to the expiration at the end of last year of a corresponding interstate Russian-Ukrainian agreement. The problem has grown from purely economic into a political one. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed its Ukrainian colleagues that deliveries of nuclear fuel may be resumed only if Ukraine accedes to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Kiev leadership has asked Chernomyrdin to lift restrictions on nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia. It is hardly accidental that the conflict has flared up during the Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament in Kiev. It seems that the Russian side decided to play a trump which can effectively shut down Ukraine's nuclear power industry.
