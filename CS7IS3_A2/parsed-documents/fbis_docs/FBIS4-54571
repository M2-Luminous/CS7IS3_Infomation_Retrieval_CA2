This is what Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said in connection with the problem surrounding certificates required for foodstuffs imported from the Czech Republic into Slovakia. At the same time, he said that what is important is that the two sides have a political interest in preserving mutual cooperation and mutual links at least at the present level. He did not rule out the possibility, however, that the current cooperation in this form could cease to be convenient for either side.
