FR940503-2-00125 FR940503-2-00084 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Specifically, Amendment No. 1 raises the maintenance standards originally proposed by the Exchange by requiring the CBOE to ensure that at least 90% of the Index, by weight, is composed of securities that are eligible for equity options trading pursuant to CBOE Rule 5.3. As stated above, the Commission believes that this requirement has the effect of ensuring that the Index is composed of highly-capitalized, actively-traded securities which serve to minimize the possibility that the Index can be easily manipulated. Additionally, the Commission notes that this is the same standard that the Commission recently approved for the listing and trading of index options and index LEAPS on the CBOE Telecommunications Index. 35 As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis. 35 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33473 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3383 (January 21, 1994). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1.
