ACTION: Notice of Competitive Grant and Cooperative Agreement Applications for the Indian Health Service (IHS) Research Program. SUMMARY: The IHS announces that competitive applications for fiscal year (FY) 1995 are now being accepted for the IHS Research Program authorized by section 208 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1621g. There will be only one funding cycle for FY 1995. Grants and Cooperative Agreements shall be administered in accordance with applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars and HHS policies. This program is within the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 93.905. Executive Order 12372 requiring intergovernmental review is not applicable to this program. The Administration's budget request for FY 1995 includes $300,000 for the Indian Health Service Research Program. It is anticipated that $300,000 will be available to support approximately 15 competing awards averaging $20,000. This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds. This notice is being published early because awards to IHS components are made by special allotments which must be expended by September 30 of the FY. Research awards must be issued early in each FY to allow researchers full use of funds. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement is directly related to many priority areas, including nutrition, alcohol and other drugs, unintentional injuries, oral health, maternal and infant health, heart disease and stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic disabling conditions, human immunodeficiency virus infection, sexually transmitted diseases, clinical preventive services, and surveillance and data systems.
