Ways To Integrate Economic and Ecological Reforms in Ukraine"] [Text] Centralized administration of Ukraine's economy over a prolonged period of time caused it to develop with huge structural disproportions. The ecological problems it inherited are primarily the result of the improper use of natural resources. The inefficient economic system with ownerless property and administrative redistribution of funds promoted wasteful use of resources and inefficient energy consumption in monopolized production. Heavy industry with its resource-intensive technologies accounts for 61 percent of the gross domestic product in Ukraine's economy as against 34 percent in the economies of EC countries. The power-output ratio in Ukraine's gross national product is the highest among the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is nine times higher than in the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], and nearly four times greater than in countries with higher than average per capita income. This is what has created the "Ukrainian phenomenon" in the economy, which combines world prices with meager wages and a scarcity of goods. This same situation provides a key to defining the ways and methods for conducting economic reforms. The transition from centralized planning to a market economy must also include improving the environment by imposing harsh penalties for massive, unwarranted squandering of resources. The principal factors that could promote progress in improving the state of the environment include ending political and administrative interference in price formation and setting wage rates, introducing a system of incentives through taxes and payments, using economic methods to equalize starting conditions in state enterprises and sectors, eliminating the interdependence of prices and revenues and material outlays, demonopolizing and restructuring production potential, restricting the access of enterprises to government money (budget restrictions), and abolishing subsidies for the use of such natural resources as energy, minerals, and water. The decline in production is significantly reducing pollution. Market reforms provide an opportunity to preserve and reinforce this effect for the next decade by encouraging a shift towards resource-conserving and clean technologies and forms of activity. As industrial capital renewal proceeds, the dumping of most substances that pollute the environment can be maintained at a stable level or even reduced if there is rapid economic growth. Industrial restructuring will affect water pollution to a lesser degree, because most of these wastes come from agriculture, household plots, and public utilities. Consequently, in the long term, attention will have to shift from air to water pollution. In the process of economic reform, we may discover advantages in stimulating investments in environmental protection in the private sector, especially if it can reduce undesirable results. Investments in environmental protection in the industrial and power sectors must conform to the lowest-cost principle and to the process of making decisions in the private sector. On the whole, the key factor in improving the state of the environment lies in the integration of environmental needs with the structure of sectorial policy. Abolishing subsidies for energy will result in reducing consumption and promote the use of new resource-conserving and cleaner technologies. As a result of the critical shortage of available resources, divergences between economic and environmental interests will grow. Some of the old enterprises will continue to operate, because closing them would cause substantial social losses. Such enterprises must be required to implement environmental protection measures that do not require large financial outlays. Improvements can be achieved at most old enterprises simply by introducing "efficient management" (more painstaking repairs, combatting waste, installing improved regulating and monitoring equipment, applying more stringent standards in managing production and processing methods). These measures are very important, because it is not possible to introduce clean technologies on a large scale until new markets for the sale of various kinds of production are created and until the economic capability of enterprises is assured. Privatization will promote market reforms. The government can speed up privatization and promote progress in the field of environmental protection by establishing clearly defined rules regarding responsibility for causing damage (harm) to the environment in the past and by making new owners liable for all pollution by toxic substances that results from their activity. In many cases, the state itself must assume responsibility for causing damage to the environment in the past. An audit of balance sheets (inventory) in the field of environmental protection must be conducted immediately in order to distinguish between the pollution caused in the past and that being caused now. And if production at privatized enterprises does not meet the necessary standards, stricter antipollution standards should be gradually phased in. In the future, the structural reorganization of industry will lead to a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution on human health in a specific region as those employed in inefficient and harmful industries, which are subject to closing, are provided with opportunities to find new jobs, as economic activity picks up, and as the surviving enterprises accumulate sufficient funds to invest in new technologies. Conducting an ecological and technological audit will enable us to collect the most important data on enterprises that do not lend themselves to privatized operation and to plan tasks for the short term. In an economic system based on achieving gross production indicators, the state allocated less than half a percent of the gross national product for environmental protection, which failed completely to compensate for the damages and losses caused by the technogenic volume. Until now, an enterprise's economic liability for polluting the environment has been purely symbolic and has not exceeded 1.5-2.0 percent of its profit. The creation of a new economic system of environmental use and environmental protection measures as part of the transition to a market economy must become an integral part of the system for managing and regulating the economy. The principal elements of this economic mechanism must be: Payment for special use of natural resources; Payment for polluting the environment; A system for financing and extending credit for environmental protection measures (state and local budgets, environmental protection funds, banks, enterprise funds, foreign investments, etc.). To ensure that these fundamental goals are achieved and to create a system for financing environmental protection measures, a fixed percentage of the gross national product must be earmarked in the state budget for spending on measures to protect the environment. According to estimates prepared by the ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of the economy, this amount can and must be no less than 0.9-1.0 percent of the GNP. The greater portion of this money should come from payments for the special use of natural resources (water, minerals, etc.) and payment for land. The remainder of the environmental protection costs should be met by the local budgets, ecological funds, and the enterprises' own funds. An effort should also be made to encourage the development of ecological business enterprise and the extension of credit by banks for investment in environmental protection. Taking into account the present ecological state of Ukraine, it is necessary to increase the proportion of environmental protection expenditures to 3-5 percent of the GNP. The funds earmarked in the state budget of Ukraine for environmental protection measures should be kept separate and used to finance priority national and regional programs and measures. The construction of environmental protection projects using centralized capital investments must be conducted on the basis of government contracts. The ecological funds and banks must protect these funds against inflation. It is also necessary to create a favorable climate for investments and an effective system of realizing foreign investments in the Ukrainian economy in general, as well as in the protection of the environment.
