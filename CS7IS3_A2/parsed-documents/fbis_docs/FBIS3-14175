In the meeting, the need for expansion of trade ties and exchange of goods between the two countries was stressed. The two sides also agreed that two separate committees--comprising commercial experts of Iran and Syria--be formed to survey practical ways of promoting commercial cooperation between Tehran and Damascus. Another important point is that Iran and Syria--as two powerful states of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East--play a sensitive and strategic role in the trend of events in the two regions. They also have relatively common viewpoints on the events taking place in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. Based on this matter and also due to common stands of the two sides on such vital political issues as the compromise deal on Gaza and Jericho and occupation of south Lebanon by the Zionist regime, it is essential that the scope of political ties be expanded to also cover the domain of commercial relations. During his December visit to Syria, Iran's first vice president, Dr. Habibi, met and conferred with President Hafiz al-Asad and also Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. In the meetings, Dr. Habibi pointed out that Iran has constantly backed stands of Syria as a country in the front line of combat with the Zionist regime. From the standpoint of the Islamic Republic of Iran, this support or consensus between Tehran and Damascus is viewed to be an unavoidable necessity under the sensitive conditions currently prevailing in the Middle East region. Significantly, since the start of the so called Arab-Israel peace talks process, Syria has been under extreme pressure from America and its allies so as to divert it from the principled stand and to force it into accepting the compromise agreements brokered by America and Israel. Dr. Habibi, who had led high-ranking political and economic delegation to Syria--besides conferring with the key Syrian officials on political events in the region and the world--also spoke of the need for establishing and developing trade relations between the two states. Hence it is imagined that the Monday visit of Iran's commerce minister to Damascus aims at pursuing the earlier agreements on commercial exchanges and including practical ways to implement them. In general, regarding to Tehran and Damascus, it can be said that politics and economy are in fact two sides of a coin. Hence, enhancement of relations in one sphere makes the expansion of trade exchanges unavoidable. Talks of Iran's commerce minister with the Syrian officials too--in view of the commercial side of these relations--have duly stressed the bolstering of economic ties.
