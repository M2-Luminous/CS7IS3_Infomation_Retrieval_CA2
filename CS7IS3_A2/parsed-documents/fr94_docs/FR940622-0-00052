FR940622-0-00052 FR940622-0-00011 Stabilized Comment: Nine commenters stated that the definitions of ``stabilized'' or ``stabilization'' are too vague or ambiguous to be useful in determining whether a patient was appropriately transferred. Some commenters suggested alternative definitions while others suggested we prohibit transfers not based solely on explicit medical reasons. Response: The statutory and regulatory definitions of ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' are necessarily broad to apply to all types of emergency medical conditions. The basic precept of these definitions is to ensure that no material deterioration occurs to a patient's condition either as a result of the transfer or because the patient is outside a hospital, and thus without the facilities and services available in a hospital. We do believe, however, that at least one clarifying revision should be incorporated into the regulations to ensure that a patient with an emergency medical condition will not be transferred unless, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer. This revision is also consistent with section 6211(h)(1)(C)(ii) of OBRA 89. The regulations are being revised accordingly. The regulations do prohibit hospital-initiated transfers that are not based solely on explicit medical reasons. This does not imply, however, in proving that a hospital or physician violated section 1867 of the Act, that the Secretary must prove the transfer was effected due to an impermissible or nonmedical motive. (See Burditt v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 934 F.2d 1362, 1373 (5th Cir. 1991).) It should be noted that the regulations also allow an individual to request and receive a transfer for any reason as long as the individual is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer. Comment: One commenter stated that a woman in active labor should never be considered stabilized until after the baby is born. Response: COBRA and the proposed regulations require emergency medical conditions to be stabilized. We agree with the commenter and pursuant to sections 6211(c)(3)(A), 6211(c)(5)(B) and 6211(h)(1) of OBRA 89 we are revising ยง489.24(b), (d)(1)(ii)(B) and (d)(2)(i) to indicate that a woman falling within the scope of section 1867(e)(1)(B) of the Act is not stabilized at least until the child and the woman's placenta are delivered. Comment: One commenter suggested that the regulations mandate that if an individual is going through alcohol detoxification, 5 to 7 days is necessary to stabilize the condition. Response: We cannot specify the length of time that it will take to stabilize a specific condition, as a specific time period would rarely be applicable in all cases. The statutory definition, as applied, prevents a hospital from transferring an individual who is going through alcohol detoxification if that condition constitutes an emergency medical condition, until that individual can make the transfer without a material deterioration of the condition occurring during, or resulting from, the transfer. Therefore, we are not adopting this suggestion. Screening Examination Comment: Several commenters asked us to define the term ``appropriate medical screening examination'' so that hospitals and physicians are not subject to ambiguous requirements. Response: It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency department. What will constitute an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities and available personnel, including on-call physicians. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to detect whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in labor because the law only requires hospitals to provide screening and stabilizing treatment within their existing capabilities. Our current condition of participation for emergency departments contains basic requirements, the specificity of which were subject to public comment in connection with the revision of the hospital conditions of participation. Investigations Comment: Six commenters recommended that HCFA should notify the involved hospital or physician of a decision to investigate. Response: HCFA ordinarily conducts only unannounced surveys in response to complaints, as to do otherwise could compromise the investigation. Comment: One commenter stated that we have not been informing complainants of the outcome of investigations; another recommended that we consult with complainants during the course of investigations, especially when there is conflicting evidence or the hospital raises mitigating circumstances. Response: On June 4, 1987, HCFA issued interim implementing procedures requiring HCFA regional offices to notify complainants of the outcome of investigations. This is HCFA practice; complainants may address their specific inquiries to their respective HCFA regional offices. Complainants are consulted when there are conflicts.
