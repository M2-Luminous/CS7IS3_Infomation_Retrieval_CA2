A new and dangerous dimension has been added to the Kashmir militancy with the first ever recovery of the highly capable U.S.-made shoulder-fired surface-to-air Stinger missile by the army in the Valley on April 30. Initial reports had mentioned that a five foot long missile had been recovered by a routine army patrol close to the border in the Valley's high altitude Kupwara sector. Along with the missile, the army had recovered two rockets and a booster. However, while credible sources here confirm that the missile was a Stinger, it has been difficult to obtain further details in view of the claim that the missile was destroyed while being transported to an army formation headquarters. One army jawan was reported to have been injured in this claimed incident. This is the first substantive report among many rumours and claims in the past that the dreaded Stinger missile has actually entered the Valley. It is also the first time that a Stinger missile has been recovered by security forces in any of the terrorist and insurgency stricken areas in the country. The introduction of the shoulder fired Stinger adds a lethal dimension to Pakistan backed terrorism in the Valley. Not only does this U.S.-made missile render vulnerable commercial and VVIP [very very important person] aircraft flying in the valley, but it also impedes routine sortie flying and occasional air exercises undertaken by Indian Air Force fighter aircraft in the Valley. In winter when the Valley is cut off by road owing to heavy snowfall and landslides, the only link between the Valley and the rest of the country is by air. It is noteworthy to mention here that it had been the US made Stinger which had decisively tilted the balance against the Russians in Afghanistan despite the former's advanced military power. The Stinger, which has an advanced heat-seeking missile can detect the hot exhaust of an aircraft at even four miles away and upto 5,000 feet in altitude. The Americans no doubt have been making efforts to recover each and every Stinger missile it had initially given out but evidently has not been entirely successful in this mission. The more readily available Russian SA-7 Grail shoulder fired infra-red missile is way behind its U.S. counterpart in terms of accuracy and range. In the recent past, hauls of sophisticated weaponary in the Valley supplied by Pakistan have ranged from 107 mm artillery shells, fin stabilised 57 mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm mortars, high velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic grenade launchers, disposable rocket launchers, grenades of NATO origin, long-range high-frequency sophisticated wireless sets with multi-mode facilities and even U.S. made portable solar panels for charging batteries for wireless sets.
