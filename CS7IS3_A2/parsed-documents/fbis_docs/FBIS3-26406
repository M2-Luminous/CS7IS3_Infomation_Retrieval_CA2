Qi Huaiyuan also noted: China hopes to resume its status as a GATT signatory at the earliest possible date. The solution of this problem will further promote the development of trade and economic cooperation between China and other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, as well as strengthen the multilateral trade system. The annual World Economic Forum, which opened in Davos on 27 January, brought together 1,200 government leaders, entrepreneurs, bankers, and economists from various countries. Participants exchanged views on various economic topics. China's vibrant economy was one of the topics of interest to the participants. Qi Huaiyuan also briefed participants on China's economy and reform at the special session on China's economy. He said: Over the past 15 years, China has greatly promoted the development of its productive forces as it has gradually implemented reform and opened wider to the outside world. Its gross national product [GNP] increased 12.8 percent in 1992, while the increase in 1993 was approximately 13 percent. He said emphatically: The Chinese Government has not stubbornly pursued double-digit, high rates of growth. Using complete projections, it has initially decided to maintain this year's GNP growth rate at 9 percent. He pointed out: The goal of the Chinese Government is to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang zeng zhang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 1073 7022] in order to quadruple 1980's GNP by the turn of the century, and to help its people attain a fairly comfortable standard of living. The Chinese Government and people are fully confident of realizing this goal. Speaking on foreign trade, Qi Huaiyuan said: Over the past 15 years, China's foreign trade has consistently grown faster than its GNP, resulting in increasingly closer ties between China's economy and those of other parts of the world. China's total export and import volume rose from $20.64 billion in 1978 to $195.72 billion in 1993, and it ranked 11th in the world in 1992. China is no longer a huge potential market but rather a rapidly expanding market that has actually come into existence. Qi Huaiyuan said: China is now in a period in which the old economic system is shifting to a new one, and the two systems are overlapping each other. Some deficiencies under the old system persist, while a new system has yet to take shape; this is the deep-seated cause of problems in China's economic operations. We must further deepen reform if we want to fundamentally solve this critical problem hindering China's economic development. In 1994, we will introduce a set of new major reform measures covering many important areas: state-owned enterprises, banking, finance, taxation, foreign trade, foreign exchange, and investment. The Chinese Government will ensure that each and every one of these reform measures will remain within the bounds of national strength and the people's means. On foreign investment, Qi Huaiyuan pointed out: An important part of China's opening policy is to encourage foreigners to invest in China. By the end of October 1993, China had approved altogether 158,000 foreign-funded investment projects, with foreign capital actually invested in those projects totaling $51.7 billion. He said: China is prepared to open its markets further; it also plans to allow foreign enterprises to join in the operation of those sectors from which foreigners were banned previously, such as power stations, railways, airports, and expressways. As reform of the economic system deepens, China's investment environment will improve.
