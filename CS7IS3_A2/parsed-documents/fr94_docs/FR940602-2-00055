FR940602-2-00055 FR940602-2-00038 The proposed order makes clear that this alternative disclosure requirement does not relieve Beverly Hills of the obligation to substantiate any maintenance success claim, in accordance with part I.A. of the order, and it ``takes back'' the exception from full quantitative disclosures in short broadcast advertising if Beverly Hills makes a maintenance success claim that uses numbers or descriptive terms that convey a quantitative measure, such as ``most of our customers maintain their weight loss long term.'' Beverly Hills in that case would have to make all the required disclosures in the ad and provide the disclosures at point-of-sale. Fourth, for weight-loss and weight-loss maintenance success claims made through endorsements or testimonials that are not representative of what Beverly Hills idet program participants generally achieve, the order (part I.E.) requires that Beverly Hills disclosure either what the generally expected success would be for Beverly Hills customers, or one of several alternative statements, such as ``This result is not typical. You may be less successful'', which explains the limited applicability of atypical testimonials in accordance with the Commission's ``Guides Concerning Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising'' 16 CFR 255.2(a). Under the proposed order, Beverly Hills may satisfy the requirements of the first disclosure concerning generally expected success by accurately disclosing those facts in the following format: ``Beverly Hills clients lose an average of XX pounds over an average XX -week treatment period.'' Finally, the proposed order (part I.P.) generally prohibits the company from misrepresenting the performance or efficacy of any weight loss program. Rate of Weight Loss The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims it made concerning the average rate of weight loss for participants in its program. The proposed consent order addresses this practice (part I.J.) by prohibiting Beverly Hills from representing that participants in its programs will lose weight at an average or typical rate or speed, unless Beverly Hills possesses and relies upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating the representation. Projection of Weight Loss The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for its claim made during initial sales presentations that consumers will typically reach their desired weight-loss goal within the time frame computed by Beverly Hills personnel. To address this practice, the proposed order (part I.K.) prohibits Beverly Hills from representing that participants or prospective participants will reach a specified weight within a specified period of time, unless proposed respondent possesses and relies upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating the representation. Comparative Safety Claim The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for its claim that its weight loss programs are safer than other weight loss programs that do not include essential fatty acid supplementation. The proposed order seeks to address this practice in two ways. First, part I.M. requires the company to have competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim that compares the safety of its weight loss program with that of any other weight loss or diet program. Second, part I.P. of the proposed order prohibits the company from misrepresenting, among other things, the safety of any weight loss program or weight loss product. Monitoring Practices According to the complaint, Beverly Hills provides its customers with diet instructions that require the customers to come in to one of the proposed respondent's centers three times a week for monitoring of their progress, including weighing in. In the course of regularly ascertaining weight loss progress, respondent, in some instances, is presenting with weight loss results indicating that customers are losing weight significantly in excess of their projected goals, which is an indication that they may not be consuming all of the food prescribed by their diet instructions. According to the complaint, such conduct could, if not corrected promptly, result in health complications. In light of this monitoring practice, the Commission's complaint alleges that Beverly Hills has failed to disclose to consumers who are losing weight significantly in excess of their projected goals that failing to follow the diet instructions and consume all of the food prescribed could result in health complications. The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged monitoring misrepresentation cited in the accompanying complaint in two ways. First, the order (part I.N.) requires Beverly Hills to disclose in writing to all participants when they enter the program, that failure to follow the program instructions and eat all of the food recommended may involve the risk of developing serious health complications. Second, the proposed order (part I.P.) generally prohibits any misrepresentation concerning the safety of any weight loss program.
