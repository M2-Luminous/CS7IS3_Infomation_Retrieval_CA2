During his visit to Brussels on Monday [10 January], Salolainen met with, among others, Hans van den Broek, who is the EU Commission member in charge of membership negotiations. During the ensuing discussions, it was agreed that the first issue to be resolved would be the question of the permanent support Finland could receive, either from the EU or from its own appropriations. After the issue of permanent support has been resolved, a study will be conducted on how the solution reached will affect the Finnish food-processing industry. After that, attention will be focused on negotiations regarding transition periods, special arrangements in connection with such periods, and product quotas. This sequence of events deviates from that which the EU Commission expressed as its view on agriculture, which caused quite a stir in Finland. According to Finland's negotiator on agricultural issues, Esa Harmala, who accompanied Salolainen on his visit with van den Broek, the most central issue emerging from the commission's documents is not permanent support but the manner in which Finnish producer prices should reach EU producer price levels. In Harmala's view, this kind of progression has been "confusing." But the decision was made to first negotiate about permanent support, which, in Finland, could be paid due to unfavorable conditions or environmental factors. Salolainen referred to the consensus reached in this matter as "some kind of a breakthrough." However, he emphasized that agreeing on the marching order does not indicate agreement on the actual issues at hand. As far as these are concerned, it appears that they must be resolved using Salolainen's "crisis scenario," or, in other words, by working late into the night, racing against the deadline. Salolainen's visit to Brussels was not only due to the membership negotiations, but he was also there as the new chairman for EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which is the other party in the European Economic Area, EEA. The discussions were focused, however, on the membership issue, regarding which Salolainen also talked with Sir Leon Brittan, who is the EU commissioner in charge of foreign economic ties, and with the ambassador, Alexandros Saphiriou, of the new chairmanship country, Greece.
