The future development of the Bundeswehr remains "vague or has been described with concepts containing old thinking," Koppelin stressed. The Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], however, welcomed the statements on the preservation of defense technology. The cabinet adopted the "White Paper 1994" on 15 March. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) then announced that the Bundeswehr plans to establish forces for crisis operations within the framework of the United Nations. The White Paper presents the concept of the Federal Government's security and defense policy. It is the first such document in the united Germany. The previous White Paper was published in 1985. Koppelin pointed out that adhering to a Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 is hardly suitable for an unbiased discussion of the future of the Bundeswehr. These figures are "wishful thinking and do not correspond to reality." As early as by the end of this year, the Bundeswehr will be reduced to 345,000 soldiers as a result of austerity measures, he stressed. The Armed Forces are in an alarming situation. The motivation, the training, and the equipment of the soldiers must be assessed very critically. "The White Paper presented by Ruehe could hardly have been more contradictory." The BDI stressed that the White Paper makes clear the significance of a modern efficient and competitive national defense industry as an essential element of Germany's reliability as an alliance partner. On the basis of the prospects for the equipment of the Bundeswehr mentioned in the White Paper, industry must receive reliable planning data, and sufficient funds for investments must be made available. There must be an end to the drastic reductions in the defense budget and the lack of funds. During the presentation of the White Paper on 15 March, Ruehe explained the poor financial situation of the Bundeswehr and announced a further reduction of the army. He did not mention figures. The minister wants to present his ideas at the end of April on the occasion of the presentation of the "conceptional guidelines" for the Bundeswehr which are to initiate a reform of the armed forces. Newspapers reported about "model calculations," speaking of a peacetime strength of the Bundeswehr of "between 300,000 and 360,000 men." The White Paper points out that important projects must be given up because of the poor financial situation. Ruehe stressed explicitly that compulsory military service will not be abandoned.
