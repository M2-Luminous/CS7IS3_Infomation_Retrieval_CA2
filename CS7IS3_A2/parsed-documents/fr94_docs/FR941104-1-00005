ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule places into regulation a limited number of Federal staffing provisions that were formerly in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). The remaining ``provisionally retained'' portions of the FPM will be abolished by December 31, 1994. This proposed rule deletes or replaces regulatory language which references the FPM. Its provisions also define or clarify terms and describe procedures used in veterans' preference, reductions in force, veterans' readjustment appointments, term appointments, seasonal and intermittent employment, noncompetitive term appointments based on Peace Corps service, exemption of certain employees from coverage of the Part-time Career Employment Act, physical requirements for employment, and actions taken during a national emergency (including the possible appointment of relatives). They extend delegations to agencies for assigning persons serving under excepted appointments to the work of positions in the competitive service; making temporary appointments of worker trainees pending establishment of a register (TAPER); and extending time limits for overseas temporary appointments. The proposed provisions also delete requirements for a number of regular reports. In the case of part 351, Reduction in Force, and part 353, Restoration to Duty From Military Service or Compensable Injury, sections are reworded for clarity and consistency with decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415&hyph;0001 (FAX 202&hyph;606&hyph;2329). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diane Bohling, (202) 606&hyph;0960 with questions concerning the changes in 5 CFR 330; Thomas Glennon, (202) 606&hyph;0960 concerning the changes in 5 CFR 351; Raleigh Neville, (202) 606&hyph;0830 concerning the changes in 5 CFR 340, 5 CFR 353 and 5 CFR 930; and Mike Carmichael or Karen Jacobs, (202) 606&hyph;0830, concerning the other changes. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Vice President's National Performance Review (NPR) recommended that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ``phase out the entire 10,000 page Federal Personnel Manual (FPM).'' The President endorsed the NPR recommendations. In planning to abolish the FPM, OPM met over an extended period with representatives of agencies and employee unions to identify which FPM policies should be dropped, which should be continued in regulation, and which should be available as a helpful reference in an alternative format. The resulting recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the Interagency Advisory Group of agency personnel directors and by the National Partnership Council. This proposed rule carries out the recommendations of those groups to retain selected current policies. Regulations to establish new policies, including implementation of Pub. L. 103&hyph;353 (veterans' reemployment rights), will be proposed separately. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Personnel Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they apply only to Federal agencies and employees.
