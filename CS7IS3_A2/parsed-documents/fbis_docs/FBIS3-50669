The newspaper EXTRA reported that the self-styled Autonomist Movement of Guanacaste for Bread, Work, and Dignity [Movimiento Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan, Trabajo y Dignidad] has issued a communique stating that "we are at their disposal to send combatants." Jose Antonio Korea, the group's information [divulgacion] secretary, said that the organization has been present in other struggles, such as those in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. He added that Guanacaste residents identify with those of Chiapas, where the EZLN has staged a rebellion, because the Mayas influenced the two cultures. According to this leader, his group has "people ready" to be sent to fight in southern Mexico.
