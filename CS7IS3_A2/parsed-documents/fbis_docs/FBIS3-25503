Those officers said the head of Futungo de Belas is misinformed about the military situation in the country, since it is the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] who is currently involved in an offensive in the north, center and south of Angola. They added that at present the MPLA-PT is launching an offensive in the north of Bengo Province, in the east of Cubal, and north west of Lubango, displaying sophisticated war materiel recently acquired from Western countries. The FALA officers said Eduardo dos Santos' speech expressed the desire for war. Another source in Jamba said the speech was characteristic of warmongering generals who only prosper with prolonged war, and it is typical of communist generals to pretend to be victims while in fact they are the aggressors.
