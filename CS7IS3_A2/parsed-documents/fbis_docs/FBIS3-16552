It is here, in Nizhnyy Novgorod Oblast, that the Russian Federation nuclear center is located, and it is here that its honorable scientific leader, Academician Yuliy Khariton, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, lives. He was the first to be awarded the title of honored citizen of the city of Kremlev. Other former closed and numbered cities have also received official names: Krasnoyarsk-26 is now Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk-45 is Zelenogorsk, Penza-19 -- Zarechnyy, Sverdlovsk-44 -- Novouralsk, Sverdlovsk-45 -- Lesnoy, Tomsk-7 -- Seversk, Chelyabinsk-70 -- Snezhinsk, and Zlatoust-26 -- Trekhgornyy. So, address your letters according to the cities' new names. According to data from the newspaper ATOM-PRESSA -- the publication for workers in Russia's nuclear power sector and industry -- there are over 700,000 people in former closed cities located on the sites of enterprises in the nuclear munitions complex. The largest of these -- the city which is now Seversk -- has over 100,000 inhabitants. Right now, the production units located in these cities are experiencing enormous difficulties. The size of the state order has fallen sharply, insufficient budget funds are being allocated to implement conversion programs, and there is a delay in paying workers' wages. The sector also has its share of unemployed -- over 3,000 people are receiving unemployment benefit.
