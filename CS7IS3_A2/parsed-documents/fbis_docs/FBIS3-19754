Upon the instigation by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the issue was passed on to the Russian Security Council at the beginning of this month. Kozyrev recommends putting the Germans off for an indefinite period, even if this were to cause the Russians' desired project of a consulate general in Frankfurt/Main to fail. He wants to talk to his Bonn counterpart, Kinkel, who is visiting Moscow this week, in this spirit and warn against a relapse "into the Germanic urge to the east": In particular, the debate about Koenigsberg, which was started in the European Parliament upon the suggestion of German deputies, and the demand for a "special relationship" between the European Union and the Kaliningrad area are "pure impudence."
