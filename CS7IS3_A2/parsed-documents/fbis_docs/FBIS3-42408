Belikov: "Remote Mine-Laying Systems"] [Text] We discussed the GMZ tracked mine-layer in VOYENNYYE ZNANIYA No 10, 1991. Our readers, including Yu. Tarasov (Serpukhov), M. Feshchuk (Kamenets-Podolskiy), and others, request that we continue this topic. Remote mine-laying systems are understood to be the sum total of landmines, aircraft, rocket-artillery and engineer systems that are used to scatter mines and deliver them to the minelaying area and to disperse them on terrain. Remote mine-laying systems have a morale and psychological impact on the enemy and are utilized to reduce the mobility of enemy troops, to inflict losses using landmines and to create favorable conditions for destruction by other weapons. Minefields, laid using remote mine-laying systems, are characterized by their great depth, by the absence of precise borders and by the placement of mines on the surface of the ground (snow). The laying of minefields is carried out, as a rule, during the course of combat operations or directly prior to their initiation while taking into account other obstacles, fire plans and the nature of the terrain. At the present time, such systems as a universal mine-layer and portable minelaying system that have been accepted into the inventory in the 1990's have received widespread dissemination. A ZiL-131 high off-road capability motor vehicle, in the bed of which are installed six canisters with 30 canister rounds armed with antitank or antipersonnel POM, PTM or PFM mines is used as the base vehicle for the universal mine-layer. Their number in the basic load depends on the purpose and design and totals from 180 to 11,520 canister rounds. The universal mine-layer conducts the laying of an antitank or antipersonnel minefield at a distance of 30-60 meters from itself at an average minelaying speed of 10-40 kilometers per hour [kph]. After laying one basic load, it can be reloaded by other crew personnel consisting of two men in 1.5-2 hours. One mine-layer using one basic load can lay a 3-row minefield from 150 to 1,500 meters long, depending on the type of mine used. As a rule, it is utilized as a mobile minelaying detachment consisting of from 1-3 vehicles during the course of a battle. The mobile minelaying detachment commander receives the minelaying order by radio after which the vehicle advances to the minelaying point, moving along roads or virgin soil at an average speed of 10-25 kph. When approaching a line after the appropriate order, the operator selects the required direction of the canister and, utilizing the control panel located in the driver's cab, lays a one-, two-, or three-row minefield. The portable mine system consists of a mount with a launch tube, a blasting machine, and a wire communications link. Canister rounds, armed with one of the types of antipersonnel mines, are loaded in the launch tube. Having installed the system on a trench parapet, you can lay an antipersonnel minefield with dimensions of 10X20(40) or 20X10 meters at a distance of 30-100 meters (depending on the type of mine). Scattered laying is conducted on the surface of the ground by firing the mines from the canister. The system is carried by a one-man crew, it weighs 2.63 kg, and preparation time for employment is less than five minutes. The universal mine-layer and the portable minelaying system are employed for laying minefields that cover subunit positions, their flanks and the boundaries between them, fire positions, breaches in combat formations and paths in minefields and also for building up mined obstacles on armor approach routes. In the missile troops and artillery, remote minelaying is carried out by multiple rocket launcher systems, the munitions of which are armed with landmines. Here a Ural-375 high off-road capability motor vehicle is used as a base vehicle. Sixteen launchers with projectiles equipped with one type of mine (PTM, PFM) are mounted on the Ural-375's bed. Their number in a single projectile depends on the type and totals from several dozen to several hundred units. The dimensions of a minefield which can be laid by one combat vehicle (one salvo) depend on the type of system and the firing range (from 8 to 35 km) and can occupy an area of from 24 to 81 hectares. As a rule, multiple rocket launcher systems are enlisted to mine enemy targets that are located in the tactical depth and permit minefields to be laid with a significant depth and length directly at the targets. Aircraft (fighters, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack aircraft) and helicopters are utilized in aviation. Bombers and fighter-bombers are enlisted to lay minefields in the operational depth and ground-attack aircraft -- in the tactical depth. Canisters armed with cluster submunitions (cassettes) with antitank and antipersonnel mines are suspended from aircraft and helicopters. The capabilities of aircraft to lay minefields depend on the type of aircraft, their combat operating range (from 100 to 500 km), optimal combat employment modes (a mining speed of 400-800 kph; an altitude of 50-200 meters), the number of suspended small canisters, and the quantity and type of mine employed. Minelaying employing helicopters is conducted, as a rule, on friendly territory and in the depth of enemy combat formations while supporting combat operations of airborne assault units. The capabilities of helicopters also depend on the type of helicopter (Mi-8, Mi-24), the minelaying system, type of mine, and the optimal combat employment mode (a minelaying speed of 20-300 kph; an altitude of from 30 to 100 meters), and the expenditure of mines (mines per kilometer). Thus, a combined-arms commander has an adequately broad selection of remote minelaying systems to support the combat operations of friendly units and formations.
