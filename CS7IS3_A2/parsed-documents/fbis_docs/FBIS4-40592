Moscow thinks that the forum can be attended by other interested states, including France, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told State Duma deputies here today. "We have suggested the international conference in order to discuss the nuclear problem and security on the Korean peninsula, do away with any concerns of the DPRK as regards its security," said the minister. "We have suggested a conference with a clear number of participants. These are, first of all, Russia. It is also the United States which concern most of the claims of the DPRK. These are China and the neighbouring states of Japan and the Republic of Korea. Other states, including France, have shown their interest in the conference." In the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, France can participate in the forum "the more so it is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the Security Council."
