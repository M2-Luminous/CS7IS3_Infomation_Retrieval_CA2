But the interview did not work out. Sergey Nikitich delivered a passionate monologue on what, in his opinion, had made Russia a great power and what guarantees its greatness in today's world. Russia is about to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its Navy -- Kovalev smiled sadly. An organizing committee was even created to prepare for the celebration. But what will we celebrate? When Peter the Great was building ships, the entire country was watching. Every indentured serf knew that when the tsar introduced new taxes he would put the people's money mainly into the construction of a fleet for the powerful country. As they would say nowadays, Peter I was implementing a nationwide program at that time. Since that time, serving in the Russian Navy has been tantamount to serving the Homeland... When the Americans began to launch the first nuclear submarines, the entire country was watching this great experiment. Everyone understood that a program that was costly but vitally necessary to the United States was being implemented. Our nuclear fleet was built under the cover of strict secrecy and nobody knew the difficulties that were surmounted by our scientists, engineers, and workers in order to preserve for Russia the status of a great naval power. When the United States began to carry out the great strategic project Trident, the whole world was watching this. And few people knew that at that same time -- a year later, actually -- the USSR had begun to create an analogous strategic system, the Typhoon. Without any grandstanding we solved the most difficult problems, and with much less cost than the Americans did. We were able to have our own sea-based strategic weapons system, which is equal to the Trident, in place at practically the same time as they did theirs. It was having the Typhoon in place that put an end to the nuclear missile arms race between the USSR and the United States, although for some reason people have always remained silent about this and spoken only about mobile land-based missiles, which were supposed to have created the parity we all know about. No! Only the sea-based strategic forces that appeared in the USSR in response to the American challenge showed that there was no point in further increasing nuclear weapons. And now I have to talk about something I do not want to mention since it is stupid to put questions of the development of Russia's strategic forces up to public plebiscites; they should be decided in the corresponding staffs by specialists who are professionally trained for this. But the situation is developing in such a way that today even we people who are not used to public speeches have to appeal directly to the citizens of Russia through the media for moral support. What kind of country will we have to greet the 21st century: Either the great world power which it still is to this day, in spite of all the disorder, or indeed a likeness of "Upper Volta with missiles?"... This is by no means about another round of the arms race. On the contrary, it is about more efficient expenditure of the scanty state funds, about the possibility of preserving Russia's national independence in reality and not on paper. The fact is that today it has become especially crucial to decide the future of Russia's strategic nuclear forces and which to give priority to. At the present time we are just developing the concept of strategic weapons, which should be fully in keeping with the defense doctrine we adopt. And it does not seem quite right to me to publish articles of an openly promotional nature like the one in IZVESTIYA of 9 February under the heading "Topols Will Defend Russia" or openly defamatory ones like the one in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS for 26 March. Incidentally, today it has become acceptable to write only bad things about the fleet, so it is probably not worthwhile to respond to every "critical" article which is especially written in street language. The article that appeared in IZVESTIYA is a different matter, since the declarative heading itself seems to proclaim unambiguously: The decision has been made, only Topol land-based mobile missile complexes can defend Russia. In a brief newspaper article it is impossible, of course, to go into a detailed comparative description of various kinds of strategic weapons, but precisely as a result of a detailed comparison it would be possible to prove convincingly that it is by no means land-based missiles but only strategic sea-based forces, which are fully in keeping with the defense doctrine, that are capable of defending Russia from any attack. The fact is that only sea-based missile complexes have an immense advantage over land-based in terms of their ability to be retargeted to any object. There are many tactical devices to guarantee the concealment of submarine missile carriers, as distinct from land-based missiles, which are constant targets. Moreover the probability of destroying missiles launched from fixed starting positions (silo or "mobile") is considerably greater than those that start from under water. And, finally, a responsive missile volley even from just one submarine that has survived is much more effective than a volley from dozens of Topols which by some miracle have survived after the first aggressive enemy attack. But, I repeat, all these are specialized issues which the public must accept on faith or else not believe at all. We love to refer to the American experience. So let us look at what the Americans are doing today in the area of their own nuclear missile forces. The United States made a decision to completely do away with land-based complexes, giving all priority to sea-based forces alone. The fact is that the Americans quite reasonably saw that in the future land-based complexes could not be used as counterattack missiles; they are good only for those who have aggressive intentions. After investing a good deal of effort and money in the creation of the most complicated MX mobile missile system, the United States today is abandoning this complex as well. The Pentagon has recognized that even on the excellent American roads it is quite dangerous to transport nuclear missiles, which are exposed to everything, be it military aggression or a terrorist act. Today land-based nuclear missile complexes present a greater threat to the territory on which they are located and which they are intended to defend than they do to a hypothetical enemy. So by refraining from further development of strategic missiles on their territory, the Americans are actually showing concern for the safety of the United States and their compatriots. Perhaps our common sense should not be so different from that of the Americans. We must simply understand that land-based strategic missiles with any base have fulfilled their historic role and in the future should be mothballed altogether. The only effective means of restraining and preventing aggression both for the Americans and for us are sea-based strategic weapons systems. OUR NOTE For many years Sergey Nikitich Kovalev was one of the most concealed designers of our Homeland's defense complex. And he probably did more to establish the USSR nuclear submarine fleet than was done in the United States by Admiral David Rickover, who was practically a national hero across the ocean. Well, we sometimes do not know our own defense industry heroes as well as we do foreign ones. But they are the ones, these hidden academicians, who created the potential of hidden power that makes it possible for Russia's leaders to feel that they are leaders of a great power.
