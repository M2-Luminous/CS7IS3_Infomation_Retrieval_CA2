Is this so? [Al-Shiqaqi] There is much talk about this, but we have not yet reached a point that permits us to announce a political front or a political party inside Palestine by tomorow. However, this is how things look. We do not want any sort of collision with the new Palestinian Authority. Since we do not want collision and since armed collision is wrong, then what we are required to do is to intensify our political, social, and cultural activity in the self- rule areas, but of course not at the expense of our jihad. This leads us to think of establishing an Islamic-national-popular bloc that could act as a political opposition to the settlement and to the Zionist trends that currently exist within the self-government authority without colliding with them. Debates are now underway within the movement to find a mechanism for this. Discussions are also under way with our friends in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] on the nature and type of this framework, etc... However, some obstacles and many unanswered questions still remain before us. [Salman] So you are talking about a framework that is not confined to the "Islamic Jihad" only? [Al-Shiqaqi] Such a framework, if established, would not act as a substitute for the Jihad Movement. The Islamic Jihad Movement will continue to exist and operate covertly inside the occupied territories. It will play the same role it is playing now. On the other hand, if such a framework is established it will not be a party exclusive to the Islamic Jihad. We will try to make it a party or a framework grouping all the oppositionists. We could fail, but at least we always try to make it broader than the Islamic Jihad and to involve other popular figures. [Salman] What is the response of the other quarters you are contacting? Are they positive? [Al-Shiqaqi] In principle, yes. But questions and complications always come up. The reality we live in inside Palestine is still difficult. Questions arise about the nature of the self-rule authority, how it will assume its role, and how it will deal with the opposition and with the enemy. All these questions are put forward making us unable to come to a final or decisive picture of the framework of which we are thinking. [Salman] You said that the Jihad Movement will continue to play the same role it is playing now. Does this apply to the entire West Bank and Gaza or are Gaza and Jericho excluded? [Al-Shiqaqi] Our work will continue in all Palestine. The self-rule area makes up 2 percent or less of the total area of Palestine; that is, there is 98 percent of Palestine that will be open for jihad against the enemy as the case was before, and we hope it will grow. Within the self-rule area, our decision is that the occupation still exists; in fact its military presence has intensified. Thus, so long as the occupation remains, we believe that it is our right to confront this occupation by force. The military operations we have carried out following the redeployment [of Israeli troops] or following the entry of the [Palestinian] police sought to prove to the world and to our people that the occupation still exists. The operations were carried out in the northern, southern, and central parts of Gaza. We clashed with soldiers wherever we found them. Thus, the Israeli withdrawal is a trick and is not real. So even in these areas we will continue until we see a real withdrawal. Once we see a real withdrawal from the self-rule areas we will stop. But if the occupation remains, we will continue our jihad. [Salman] How can a confrontation with the Palestinian Authority be avoided? [Al-Shiqaqi] We always appeal to the Palestinian police and the new Authority to examine our objectives and pay heed to the fact that we really give priority to the avoidance of any clash with them. Nevertheless, we cannot allow [Israeli] soldiers to remain around us while we sit back and watch them. In all our statements, we address the Palestinian police on this issue, saying that we cannot halt our jihad as long as we see one Israeli soldier able to come into the Gaza Strip and pursue our mujahidin. This whole issue remains under discussion but we still give priority to non- confrontation with the police and the Authority. [Salman] Have the Palestinian police given any signs of their intentions toward the movement? [Al-Shiqaqi] In the past few weeks, the Palestinian police have arrested more than one brother from the Islamic Jihad Movement. They were subsequently released but their detention came as a surprise to us. We believe it was not a step in the right direction. Still, we have discovered that they want to start a dialogue with the movement inside Palestine. We are not refusing, particularly if the dialogue is conducted inside Palestine with the aim of avoiding any clashes, which can happen at any time. We have also heard that people from other groups have been arrested. We are surprised that the Palestinian Authority, already accused of being a tool of the Zionist enemy, should take steps to prove this charge by detaining mujahidin formerly wanted by the occupation authorities. Despite our goodwill and willingness to avoid clashes, and even our abstention from sharing authority with them, the situation remains unclear and the Authority's attitude to the opposition remains confused. [Salman] Have you actually begun a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority or is this still just an idea at this stage? [Al-Shiqaqi] When the recent arrests took place, some brothers, Islamic Jihad sympathizers, conducted a dialogue with the new Authority to secure the release of the detainees. [Salman] Was the dialogue limited to this issue? [Al-Shiqaqi] Naturally the dialogue branched off onto other issues. Just as the brothers made demands, the Authority made demands. These arrests have been partly a form of political blackmail. They held some young men as hostages to make the movement change its policies toward the occupation. We harbor no violent designs against the Palestinian Authority. We have political designs. They want us to alter our policies toward the occupation in return for releasing our brothers. Of course we rejected this logic and insisted on exercising our right to resist the occupation as long as it lasts. [Salman] Some movements opposed to the agreement have said that they will not alter their policies but will alter their "tactics" in the future. Does this apply to Islamic Jihad also? [Al-Shiqaqi] This is possible. When we speak in a political context, this signifies an alteration of tactics. It was impossible to speak in a political context when the occupation authorities were still here, or in the areas where the occupation continues. This proves that we can alter our moves. [Salman] Has anything been decided in this context or is the issue under discussion? Changes on the political front are merely one form of alteration. [Al-Shiqaqi] The movement is still debating the question of military action against occupation troops in the autonomy areas. Our decision at this moment remains to confront the occupation forces. [Salman] Some opponents of the Islamic Jihad Movement say that the movement's only chance of survival is to adhere to its opposition of the Declaration of Principles since it does not possess the popularity or the seniority of the other Palestinian movements, which someday could be prepared to join the National Authority. What do you say? [Al-Shiqaqi] First: The Islamic Jihad Movement is well established in Palestine. Everybody knows that it and Hamas are the two most prominent opposition movements inside Palestine. It is present in every city and village in Palestine. True, its presence is less than that of Hamas, but its history is very recent and financial resources are very limited. So any comparison between us and Hamas would no doubt show that our presence in Palestine is less than Hamas'. We have very limited resources compared to the other Palestinian organizations, but we have managed to maintain a relatively active presence. Second: We are not the only opponents of the Declaration of Principles. There are 10 or more factions opposed to the Declaration of Principles. Even the Communist Party, which is now called the People's Party, has issued a statement opposing the Cairo Agreement. This means that the People's Party has agreed to the Oslo Agreement but rejected the Cairo Agreement. The only movement that supports the Declaration of Principles is Fatah; that is, part, but not all, of Yasir 'Arafat's group. So if we are talking about opposition, we are not the first or last oppositionists. The opposition is comprehensive and wide. But if we are talking about military action, this is another story. [Salman] But with the signs indicating that some other movements are prepared to join the National Authority, is your refusal to join this Authority what makes you stand out? [Al-Shiqaqi] The opposition movements inside Palestine, be they Hamas or other national forces, still refuse to join the authority. For us, it seems that not everybody is convinced of participating in the authority and when we say so we mean it. This stems from the nature of the ideology and ideas we believe in and from the nature of our stand vis-a-vis the Zionist enemy and the new authority. Throughout our history, our friends, allies, and even adversaries know that we do not deceive or double-talk and that when we say something we mean it. Thus, the question of non-participation is not due to the insignificance of the movement as much as it is the result of a firm conviction held by every individual within the movement. [Salman] How do you assess the Jihad Movement's relations with Hamas? [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Hamas are excellent. Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood and represents the shift within the intifadah. Before the intifadah, we used to differ over some theoretical and practical matters inside Palestine, particularly the need for immediate jihad. This issue was a source of disagreement between us. But with the outbreak of the intifadah, the gap narrowed and the sensitivities diminished. This was accompanied by several official meetings from the two sides over the past five years. We met inside Palestine and abroad and held lengthy discussions in an attempt to find as much common ground as possible and coordinate between us. At the theoretical and political levels, our relations are very good, but there is still a distance we have to travel toward establishing things on the ground, such as the formation of a stronger front or stronger institutions. We have not yet succeeded in this matter, but in the theoretical and political domains, there has been great understanding and coordination in the past years. There is a tendency toward establishing more coordination with Hamas. Meetings have been held recently toward that end. [Salman] Were the meetings held inside and abroad? [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes. [Salman] What about Al-Jihad's relations with the Fatah movement? [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Yasir 'Arafat have never been positive. There are no personal sensitivities between us. We have never met in a battle or at a dinner table. Relations have not been positive because of the political line followed by 'Arafat during the past years, his constant plotting against the Islamic al-Jihad Movement, and his attempts to tempt and disrupt the movement's ranks and create dummy organizations under the "Islamic al-Jihad's" name. Therefore, and to protest this political and scheming line, we have always refused to even meet him despite his persistence and his dispatch of envoys to us. But this does not prevent us from having ties of friendship with some of Fatah's cadres or youths inside the occupied territories. They were serious in resisting the occupation from outside and inside the prisons. This has also not prevented us from receiving in our offices and houses some Fatah figures whose views differ from 'Arafat's. [Salman] Al-Jihad Movement says that it refuses to have a dialogue with 'Arafat, while he says that he does not want to have a dialogue with you in the first place? [Al-Shiqaqi] He has never said that he refuses to have a dialogue with us. He has sent one delegation after the other to this office. (Police commander) Yusuf Nasr was one of those he has sent and Nasr said in an interview few days ago that he is having a dialogue with the "Islamic al-Jihad" movement. [Salman] A dialogue through the detainees? [Al-Shiqaqi] No. The dialogues were held inside [the territories]. Messengers from Yasir 'Arafat came here to this office several times. We told them that we are not opposed to having a dialogue with those whom we respect personally, but we are not willing to start a dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. This is our stand that they always took back with them despite the many messeges that were sent. They even contacted us on behalf of Yasir 'Arafat exactly two weeks ago to ask us to initiate a dialogue. They contacted us here and said that 'Arafat wants to open a dialogue with us in order to solve the problems inside. We rejected any form of contacts outside the territories and said that the problems must be solved in the field between those involved in them. [Salman] Is it true that you were offered seats on the Palestine National Council [PNC]? [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes, when the 19th or 20th PNC session was held in Algeria. The number of seats was not specified but they said that the PNC is open to us and we could participate. We replied in a letter distributed to all the members. We also issued a statement in which we said that we were not seeking seats but a solid and strong stand, which we would support even if we did not a have a seat in the PNC. National unity is not merely a framework but a solid program. [Salman] Does this mean that the dialogue with the PLO is severed until Yasir 'Arafat's downfall? [Al-Shiqaqi] I do not know if there is still a PLO or not. There is today a new self-rule administration. Will there be talks with the self-rule administration or not? As to the PLO, it is difficult for Yasir 'Arafat to say that he is talking on its behalf today. There is nothing called the PLO anymore. There is in fact a new authority that cancels all the past. [Salman] What about the dialogue with the new authority? [Al-Shiqaqi] We are pragmatists. Inside Palestine, we will be ready to disengage from any clash with any party, whether it is the new authority or others.
