When TADA was debated in Parliament in 1987, there was a huge outcry describing it as a draconian law. In 1991, when the Act came up for renewal, the opposition was muted; something must have happened to show the civil libertarians the uselessness of shedding tears for terrorists. People of Punjab have shown that civil society is willing to pay the heavy price required to maintain peace. And this is the logic behind public endorsement of TADA. Going for the substance, the Supreme Court has lamented that the scope of TADA has not been progressively reduced but has rather increased. Since less than 1 percent of those arrested under TADA have been convicted, society must take serious note. TADA has been upheld, but the Court has also put the onus on the authorities to enforce it properly. As in other parts of the world, the Indian police are not necessarily kind and gentle. When the police are also engaged in trading bullets with terrorists, the state has an additional problem as to how a force armed to the teeth and trained to kill is going to police the by-lanes of small-town India? Punjab is currently facing this problem. TADA or no TADA, the crux of the matter is to control the police. The steps recommended by the Court must, of course, be incorporated into the TADA procedure, but at the same time the police must be trained, educated, and better led. If the police system is brought back into order, then TADA will cease to be so controversial.
