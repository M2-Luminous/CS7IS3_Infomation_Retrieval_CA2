Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji's statement last Friday in the House implied that the government was all but ready to approve the Dunkel Draft. The government is aware that prices of drugs will increase when we join Gatt and the farmers' use of seeds will also be effected. The seeds patented by foreign companies will become instrumental in exploiting the farmers. There has been a demand for one or two years to hold a national debate to direct the Indian government's attitude toward Gatt. This controversial issue was also discussed in the Parliament a couple of times, and proposals were also made to have a joint parliamentary committee study the Gatt proposals. However, the central government did not pay much attention to these questions of national importance. The government never presented the real picture associated with the Dunkel proposals in front of the people. It is natural to ask whether patenting the seeds can be practical. It is said that Indian people will not be able to use leaves, fruit, and skin of the neem tree like in the past as its various uses will have been patented in the United States of America and those patent laws will be imposed on India also. The question arises: Why should U.S. laws be imposed in India? It would be unfortunate to increase prices of drugs and the result of this increase can be very serious. The question of state governments' rights were also raised in the Parliament. The Indian Constitution allows some rights to states and the central government cannot pass laws in those areas. If the Dunkel draft is approved, international laws will be imposed in those specific areas. Keeping in mind India's weak economic condition, it is not a secret how little involved India will be in making international laws. India was the leader of developing countries during Indira Gandhi's rule. Even during Rajiv Gandhi's government, India refused to bow down, and other developing countries looked at India with hope. However, India gradually lost its right to lead the developing nations due to the ambiguous attitude that it adopted during the governments of V.P. Singh and the prime ministers that followed him. This resulted in the cancellation of the summit meeting of Group-15 and expression of helplessness by our commerce minister in the Parliament. The government may be helpless but if the new Gatt agreement results in creating additional problems for the people, these problems will find their own solutions!
