FBIS4-60114 "drnes099dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Security Official on Self-Rule, Opposition's Rights Security Official on Self-Rule, Opposition's Rights JN2105203194 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1730 GMT 21 May 94 JN2105203194 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with Jibril al-Rujub, official in charge of Preventive Security in the West Bank, by correspondent Basim Abu-Sumayyah; place and date not given -- recorded] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril al-Rujub, there is another challenge. This is the Israeli presence, specifically the presence of settlements on Palestinian soil. This constitutes a constant factor for friction. How will you address this issue? [Al-Rujub] I spoke about intrinsic challenges. But concerning objective challenges, there is certainly the issue of settlements and settlers. I believe that there can be no stability, security, tranquility, and the Palestinian national authority will not be able to impose its national presence in an ethical manner so long as there are settlers and settlements. There is a challenge of another type, that of Jerusalem, the question of East Jerusalem should be settled in a manner that fulfills the minimum level of our aspirations. By this, I mean the withdrawal from East Jerusalem. [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril, since we are speaking about Jerusalem, is there actually a secret Israeli commitment to President 'Arafat on the future of Jerusalem? [Al-Rujub] I do not know. What I know is that there is a U.S. pledge to continue tackling East Jerusalem as occupied. [passage omitted] [Abu-Sumayyah] How do you assess the implementation of the agreement on the ground over the past period? [Al-Rujub] From the Palestinian side, I believe there are some difficulties. However, we should overcome them. We in the PLO are not a major power. We work within our limited resources. In spite of this, we managed to transport our forces. We managed to take over the duties of the police force and to impose a minimum of political respect. I view this as an achievement when compared with the means we have. We must not forget the economic siege the PLO has been experiencing since the Gulf war. [passage omitted] [Abu-Sumayyah] Are there negotiations for releasing more Palestinian detainees, is there a timetable for this, or what about the question of the detainees in general? [Al-Rujub] With respect to the detainees, there is a two-point agreement. The first point is to release 5,000 prisoner during a record time, and a committee will be formed from the two sides to discuss the vehicle for releasing the rest. The upshot of this means that all the prisoners and detainees will be released without any consideration to their affiliation, and the reasons for which they were arrested. This is because we in the PLO look at ourselves as negotiators and speakers on behalf of the entire Palestinian people with all their political and social sectors. From this premise, we signed the agreement in the name of all the Palestinian people. That's why we consider that we are responsible for releasing all who have resisted occupation, and those who have exercised their natural right in confronting an illegal occupation of our land. After releasing them and implementing the Palestinian national authority, we will be responsible for making this citizen respect the agreements signed by the Palestinian National Authority, or try to topple them in a democratic manner through the Palestinian arena. We do not accept, in any way whatsoever, the principle of classification or discrimination by saying this one belongs to this faction and that to another faction. We reject this. We also refuse to consider the reasons that led this or that to be detained as a cause for keeping him there because we have fought, and many of our people were killed and punished by Israel. What is the meaning then that our fighters and strugglers remain in prison while those who fought us and killed us from their side enjoy happiness and freedom? [Abu-Sumayyah] Will the Palestinian authority allow freedom of expression and the press and the pluralism of parties? [Al-Rujub] From my position within the PLO as a member of the Palestine National Council, of the PLO's higher military council, and as the official in charge of preventive security and within the limits of my prerogatives and my position as a Palestinian nationalist, I promise that we will give the opposition forces the natural right and the right that is acknowledged by all laws to express their opinion in a civilized, democratic, and ethical manner without physical and verbal violence. [Abu-Sumayyah] As well as political and press freedom? [Al-Rujub] The freedom of the press and expression, the right to demonstrate and to criticize, and to hold seminars praising or criticizing the sound or wrong performance of the national authority. [Abu-Sumayyah] Will there be Palestinian military censorship on the press? [Al-Rujub] The censorship will not differ from that exercised by the most democratic states in the world. [passage omitted]
