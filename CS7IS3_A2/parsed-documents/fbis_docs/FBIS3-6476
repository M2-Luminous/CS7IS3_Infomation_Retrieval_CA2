Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today declares it reveals Japan's intention to promote arms buildup and overseas aggrandizement more openly. The news analyst says: No country in the world now can match Japan in the growth rate of military spendings and the scope of armed forces reinforcement. Japan's move to become a military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons fully reveals the Japanese reactionaries' wild design to build up enough strength to enter into the scrambles for world supremacy. They intend to extend the operational scope of the "self-defence forces" worldwide and realise their dominationist ambition with strength, crying for Japan's "international role commensurate with its power." In order to legitimate their dangerous nuclear armament and overseas aggrandizement, they are making a fuss about the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved fundamentally and it becomes a nuclear-free zone, the Japanese reactionaries will lose the pretext for turning Japan into a military power and promoting its nuclear armament and will be unable to stage a comeback to the Korean peninsula, a part of their old dream of "the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere". This is why they are creating obstacles to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, hurling mud at the DPRK, and are aggravating military confrontation and tension in this part of the world. They must know that their reckless act will only precipitate their self-destruction.
