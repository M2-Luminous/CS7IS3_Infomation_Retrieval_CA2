FR940803-2-00074 FR940803-2-00060 Issuer Delisting; Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Regency Health Services, Inc., Common Stock, $.01 Par Value; 61/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003) File No. 1&hyph;11144 July 28, 1994. Regency Health Services, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and the debentures are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and the debentures commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on April 5, 1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. In making the decision to withdraw its common stock and the debentures from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock and the debentures on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for the common stock. Any interested person may, on or before August 18, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
