But there was also a friendly welcoming from a quiet but curious crowd--mostly elderly folk and young children--who followed him on a short walkabout through the township and into a local spaza shop. The protesters--who followed the De Klerk entourage at a distance -- toyi-toyied [protest danced] and whistled, shouting: "Hamba [go away] De Klerk," "This is our country--go away," and "This place belongs to Mandela." Mr de Klerk gave a short speech in which he condemned political intolerance and criticised the pulling down of NP flags before his arrival in the township. In the spaza shop, the last stop of Mr de Klerk's Mooiloop tour, the NP leader bought fruit gums for three young boys who had followed him into the premises. By this time the ANC supporters had grown into a noisy crowd and Mr de Klerk, looking calm, retreated to his armoured limo and left for the next stop -- Lynnville, another central Witbank township. The trip to Hoalanikhale (Mooiloop) started with a visit to three men wearing men NP paper caps standing by their metal shanty. Mr de Klerk spent some time speaking to them and addressing the crowd from their small yard. "Tonight they (the local NP supporters) die," an ANC supporter was heard to say. An NP organiser said this was standard ANC reaction and that the party would rely on the local peace committee to help their supporters. At Lynnville, Mr de Klerk made a short stop to visit Theresa Mathemba whose tiny quarters in a converted hostel was too cramped to allow reporters to enter.
