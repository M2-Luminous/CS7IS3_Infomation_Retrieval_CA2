I greet you on behalf of the Iraqi people. I also value your stand and thank you for the difficulties you endured during the long journey, especially since you had to come by car most of the way as a result of, as you know, the air embargo imposed on our country. I am sure that all the Iraqi people are well aware of what your stand means. As you also know, one loses many loved ones, particularly if one is an official and not an ordinary citizen. We have lost many loved ones but at the same time we have won many friends. We have won you as well as others who have truly understood the nature of our stand and why the conflict had taken place. We have lost many beloved ones. However, the experience enabled us to expose some false friends who used to speak about friendship before the war. The experience also enabled us to expose on a large scale many of the enemies as their enmity was not based on a worthy cause and did not stem from a just stand. I am certain that you know, as I know, many of the details concerning the real state of affairs. That's why I will not burden you with a review of the details of what you already know, or what you could come to know. But I believe it is my duty and it is your right that I contribute as best as I can to entrenching the basic pillars of your concept on how to combat injustice. Some of those who spoke a few moments ago said that they are trying to convince the public opinion in their countries to remove the injustice done to the Iraqi people. Although they have made large strides when compared with where they started, they believe they still have much to do to make the public opinion in their countries understand the situation as they themselves understand it. I would like here to comment and say that your work is of the constructive type. It achieves advancement. Therefore, do not expect to gain much at the beginning. The major calls and missions, including the prophets' missions to communicate God's message to mankind started with a small group, then spread to millions, as you know. One of the male or female speakers has said that the public opinion in Europe has started to comprehend and has started to become aware of part of the deception practised against it at the beginning of the incidents, not to mention the injustice that has befallen Iraq as a result of the aggresion. I would like to say the following on this issue: We rejoice at these positive manifestations you spoke about. However, what is more important is that the European public opinion not be deceived once again. If the European and world public opinion is no longer deceived as it had been deceived by the false U.S. claims and the claims of the Kuwaiti rulers who oppress the Kuwaiti people, if the real cause which led to the deception is known, and if this cause is remedied, then we will all be satisfied because the blood of the Iraqis would have achieved an important gain on the human level in terms of making the truth known to all and exposing the evildoers without their being able to deceive others for a long period of time. In any case, what is important is that we pinpoint where the mistake is and the party responsible for it. But, it is in mankind's interest that we all cooperate to prevent mistakes. But, if mistakes are committed, then we all have to do what we can to minimize their impact as much as possible, particularly if they have to do with humanitarian issues which directly affect the individual and his rights. Some speakers said that they have noticed that many quarters used to believe that the injustice emanating from this or that country would last for a long time. But that now they no longer believe this. They also used to believe that some would collapse from the blows that were dealt against them. As of now, they no longer say this and, instead, affirm that Iraq cannot collapse as a result of the blows it is dealt. I would like to comment on this by saying the following: We must pinpoint how the opposition behaves, whether this side is right or wrong in what it does. This is an essential requirement of scientific research and analysis. However, what has more value for us are those who support what is right, irrespective of their preliminary assessment of whether right will triumph within a specific period of time, or will only triumph on the longer term. I believe that your stand is more sound than any of the stands adopted by the others who approach matters from a technical point of view. They support wrong when they believe wrong will triumph, and they support right when they believe it will triumph. What is important to us, from a humanitarian and principled standpoint, is that we support right irrespective of the results -- irrespective of whether right will triumph or not, from a technical point of view, within a specific period of time, or whether wrong is defeated or not, again from a technical point view, along with its defeat on the ideological level. As a person from Iraq, and as an official from Iraq, I place high value on your stand because you supported right irrespective of the technical results it might attain in its confrontation with these major blocs with their immense material potential and because you opted for this honest and sound stand. Humanity has many worries. This dictates that all of us must work hard for its sake. However, the most important thing that will save mankind from the pitfalls into which the leaders drag it is an honest and frank dialogue among the people and nations, whether through their popular organizations, or even through their rulers. Although some rulers speak about dialogue and how important it is, about democracy and how necessary it is, and about themselves and the influence they can have on others, they, in reality, do not like dialogue. You know, for example, that former U.S. President Bush mobilized all media organizations to tarnish the image of Iraq. He wanted to affect the people of Iraq with his propaganda. We proposed that he directly address the people of Iraq. We also proposed that we broadcast his address or the debate, which we proposed to conduct with him, and, at the same time, have the debate broadcast in America so that the American and Iraqi people would make their judgment in light of the results of this debate, its nature, and its components. Our objective was to help those who stood on the side of justice or against it. He, however, rejected the proposal. In order to tackle the embarrassment caused by his rejection, he addressed a brief message to the people of Iraq that smacked of threat rather than a spirit of dialogue. In any case, we should always know how to differentiate between the democracy that is only a political practice to serve the interests of the rulers, on one hand, and the democracy that stems from a principle based on respecting people and their will and on providing an appropriate atmosphere for this people to exercise their role in political life, on the other. I have no doubt, and I know, that rulers in all democratic countries in the West pay great attention to public opinion in their countries. Why? This is because public opinion decides whether or not they will be reelected. However, when certain rulers believe that public opinion will not affect the results of elections they ignore public opinion in their countries. Therefore, if a ruler discovers that there is a journalist, a newspaper, or a television station that is ready to falsify some matters to promote his chances of winning -- or to hide a fact from public opinion so that his chances of winning will increase and the opportunities to weaken his winning chances will diminish -- he will not be disturbed. Neither will he say that such distortion is illegal because this has affected public opinion. He will not be disturbed by this. In fact, some of those rulers would work in order to provide such an atmosphere, given the rule we mentioned earlier with regard to the issue of elections. The effects of any problem could be small when this problem is confined to one country. However, this problem could become bigger when some rulers, of the kind we spoke about, emerge in these countries. Despite this, they talk about themselves as being a country whose democratic approach must be followed by others, when, at the same time, they deny other peoples the right to choose their own approach. Let us take another example you know, from America. You know that the war would not have broken out and the Security Council would not have adopted its resolution against Iraq had it not been for the American decision. Human blood was shed regardless of its source, whether a Frenchman was killed, an Iraqi was martyred, or an American was killed. They all were killed because of this war. False information contributed to making the war decision. False information was disseminated in America and the U.S. President and his aides were aware of it. They learned about the story of a young girl, who was the daughter of a Kuwaiti official, who was introduced to a film director in accordance with a special scenario, and who acted falsely when she cried on television. She told a story in which she said that she saw Iraqi soldiers taking incubators from Kuwaiti hospitals to take them to Baghdad. This story was later exposed and it became clear that the whole thing was fabricated. However, what happened to those who fabricated this story? This story was responsible for shedding the blood of many people. It played a role in making the American public accept the war idea. Thus, U.S. public opinion was deceived, and as a result of this deception, it gave in to the American rulers' premeditated intentions. So, as peoples, wherever we find an official in charge who understands the peoples' principles and has faith in human relations, we must work hard to reach a sound level of human relations and of relations among peoples and nations. The prophet says that a Muslim cannot commit adultery. Nor can a Muslim steal or lie. A Muslim cannot lie. So, when a Muslim ruler lies then he has lost every legitimate right to be a ruler. And you know that one of the Ten Commandments is: "Thou shalt not lie." I do not want to take much of your time. Although we know that this is an uncommon opportunity, you are friends and guests in Iraq, and we should not bore you and or take advantage of your presence as guests here to explain all our problems to you. The work you are undertaking is considered great by almighty God and the people of the world, because you are truly democratic and because you want others to enjoy what you yourselves are enjoying. Meanwhile, the others -- those who speak about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter people and persist in killing and starving them to death. If we wish, we could become friends with this type of people overnight. But friendship for those rulers who mobilized their armies against us means that we should be illiterate, that we should disrespect our people, and that we should divide our people's wealth between us and them. They want this wealth to be personally divided. In other words, they want us to take the share that they give us so that we put it in the banks of Switzerland, England, America, or France, leaving our people hungry. They want us to give them the bigger share. Besides, they want us to rule in an autocratic way and to tell them that we accept any decision they make for us. Isn't this the situation of their friends in the Third World, or at least in our region? Do you not know their names? Such behavior cannot exist among the people of Iraq. The Iraqi people will not accept a ruler or a leader of this kind. If facts should be plain and the public should be left to realize matters as they truly are, then I do not think that the American people would wish to have such friends. Nor do I think that the American or the French people, who are known to be an enlightened people, or the Greek, German, English, and all European and world peoples would wish to have such friends. Please convey our greetings on behalf of the Iraqi people to all those who attended your conference in Athens and told the truth. Please convey our greetings to all those who asked you to convey their greetings to the people of Iraq. I also hope that George Kaloi [name as received] from Britain will convey my greetings to the Palestine Club that asked him to convey its greetings to us. This is what democratic thinking dictates. A democrat should be honest. It shows respect for others' opinions to convey the message honestly. If you, Mr. Kaloi, try to note what the English papers have said, you will not find a wide favorable response. You are welcome.
