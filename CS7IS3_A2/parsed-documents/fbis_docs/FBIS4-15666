Meanwhile, according to information in SEGODNYA's possession, Russia is ready to go ahead with a unilateral demarcation of its borders in the northwest. In spite of the failure of the latest, 18th, round of talks, when Russia finally refused to pull out its troops before 31 August 1994, stating that this time frame is unrealistic because the question of ensuring the rights of military retirees and pensioners has not been settled yet, Ambassador Kahn stressed that Estonia is ready to continue the negotiations at the level of interstate delegations but only if the Russian Federation observes the international obligations it has assumed. "We believe that many problems could be resolved by a summit of Presidents Yeltsin and Meri. The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, however, with a persistence we cannot understand, rejects the idea of a summit, saying that it is possible only after the entire package of documents has been signed." True, Mr. Kahn noted, such meetings are becoming less and less probable, a case in point being the refusal by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to visit Moscow on 20 April in response to President Yeltsin's decision to create military bases on the territory of the CIS and Latvia.
