Commentator Nina Hradiska, writing in the 2 May NOVE SLOVO BEZ RESPEKTU, charged that unspecified writers are becoming increasingly vocal in support of their candidates and, "forgetting their proper social mission," some of them are acting as unabashed partisan activists. "With great zeal, they are turning into politicians...day in and day out, they display the irresistible urge not only `to be with it' but also `to be in it.'" This misplaced enthusiasm, according to Hradiska, is particularly noticeable when there is an opportunity "to get publicity and an equally important chance to get lucrative rewards." This, she said, reminded her of a popular joke from the communist period: "Why do we build socialism with such enthusiasm? Because it is easier than to work!" She concluded: "Today the easiest thing is to dabble in politics." A recent article printed in the weekly LITERARNY TYZDENNIK, published in Bratislava by the Syndicate of Slovak Writers, an organization leaning ideologically toward former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, seems to bear out Hradiska's critical contention. Writing in the 29 April issue of LITERARNY TYZDENNIK, the veteran novelist and essayist Vladimir Minac attacked by name a number of prominent Meciar opponents who support the current anti-Meciar coalition. With emotion, Minac rejected their political credentials and characterized them as turncoats, who have abandoned "the cause of Slovak freedom. " He found them to be a peculiar kind of "political transvestite," without principles and conscience, who shun daylight and public disclosure, preferring "to change their clothes and their makeup under the cover of darkness, often behind the castle walls [an allusion to the residence of the Slovak president], because they hate it when people catch them while they are changing their disguise; they would much rather appear in public already freshly remade, complete with their old speech defects and their brand new faults." One after another, Minac presented his fanciful character sketches of Ludovit Cernak, Roman Kovac, Michal Kovac, and Peter Weiss. Cernak and Roman Kovac were described by him as musclemen showing off their newly acquired muscle power. Michal Kovac--the name in Slovak means "blacksmith"--is presented as attempting to shoe an unruly, kicking horse (Meciar), while Peter Weiss, previously "the humble servant of the working man," was portrayed sporting the "armor of power," which prevents him from "hearing the voices of his neighbors." The brunt of Minac's derision was reserved for the KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] chairman, Jan Carnogursky, who was presented as "the senior master of Slovak political transvestitism." Minac accused him of hypocritically pretending to be a champion of Slovak independence while exerting great effort to extinguish it." In a cryptic and bizarre reference to Carnogursky's involvement with the German Adenauer Foundation, Minac also charged Carnogursky with being in the service of the Order of German Knights," which for many centuries efficiently and charitably kept exterminating Carnogursky's dear neighbors, the Poles." Carnogursky, suggested Minac, "either has no historical memory or is a man...without norms and thus also without conscience." Minac summed up his observations by charging that the contemporary Slovak "political scene is rapidly being victimized by bolshevism" and that "lies are becoming rampant in it." He branded the present "broad" governmental coalition of left and right parties "a fusion of black cassocks with pink panthers," a political arrangement that is bound "to accomplish the full rebolshevization" of the country. Should it succeed, warned Minac, "that would be it, amen, darkness." He then proceeded to criticize also the Slovak media, which he accused of subservience and a lack of moral convictions. Slovak journalists, charged Minac, "are literally outdoing themselves in enjoying their new mercenary role as they provide the new ministers [of the Moravcik government] the most fitting answers to appropriately chosen questions--the same way it used to be during the dullest times of the old regime." He concluded: "They find themselves in a state of bliss because now they have available a great number of new orifices they can crawl into. Transvestites dance to their own peculiar music. That is why transvestite politicians need their own transvestite media."
