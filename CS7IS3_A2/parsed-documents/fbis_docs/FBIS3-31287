The law, which has been enacted by the Sejm, is the result of legislative measures undertaken four years ago. The law's first draft was submitted by the government before the First Term Sejm on 11 March 1992, but work on the law was not finalized due to the Sejm's having been dissolved. A new draft of the law was submitted by the government in front of the Second Term Sejm on 6 November 1993, with a motion to have the law enacted urgently. Representatives of scientific, creative associations, and authorship organizations, as well as producer organizations, took part in the Sejm's work on the draft. Opinions and comments by these groups regarding specific provisions of the law, were debated upon and, in a majority of cases, taken into account. The final text of the law enacted on 4 February 1994 is the result of a compromise that takes into account the interests of all those concerned with the copyright law, of authors, performers, video and audio [fonogram] producers, computer software producers, and radio and television organizations. The law will replace the Copyright Law of 1952, which was in effect up to now and whose provisions are inadequate to suit the country's new economic conditions, or to the new world system for protection of intellectual property. The legal provisions of 1952, given the enormous development of new areas--for instance, video, audio, and computer software production--are obsolete under today's conditions and are not suited to the existing international standards. The necessity of enacting the new law was also a result of Poland's international obligations in the area--in particular, the treaty on trade and economic relations between Poland and the United States of 21 March 1990. Under the treaty, Poland obliged itself to adapt its copyright law to existing international conventions by 1 January 1991. Apart from that, the phenomenon of piracy of intellectual property, which has been increasing radically in Poland and which was pointed out by authors and international opinion demanding that firm, legislative measures be undertaken to counteract the piracy, was another incentive for initiating urgent legislative proceedings concerning the new law.
