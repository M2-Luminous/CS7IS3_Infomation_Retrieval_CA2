Maybe the source of that miracle water is the over 50,000 troops, most of whom are between 18 and 20, in the EJT [Youth Labor Army], which he has commanded since 1977. Division General Rigoberto Garcia cannot only take credit for training these young men, but he has also added more luster to the stars on his shoulders by producing 632,000 tons of food for the Cuban people, as the EJT tends over 15,000 "caballerias" of land planted in crops as important as sugarcane, coffee, tobacco, citrus fruits, and a variety of other crops. [Carrobello] Will these officers and soldiers propose a new method of agricultural work? (I am addressing this and other questions to the man whom some people now call "The General of the Fields.") [Garcia] The EJT, founded in 1973, was conceived at first as only a support force. They had no permanent presence in the areas where they worked. Their constant transfers created problems and a great deal of disorganization. So we established ties with the areas where the troops stayed, and tried to create stability. With sugarcane, for example, where in the beginning we only worked on cutting the cane, we began to get involved from the beginning, starting with plowing the fields and working through the harvest. When a man is involved in all aspects of the crop, he begins to feel more committed. There was also a dual structure handling the same mission, the state farm system and our organization. We tried to work this out, and then we took over full responsibility for the work. [Carrobello] And the organizational transformations? [Garcia] In the past, as I told you, our forces were scattered, and they worked in different areas at the same time. We set up a bloc system. This means concentrating resources and labor on the first job, and then moving on to another. This made the farm leadership council, composed of both civilians and military, remain fully involved in the field of action, seeing the needs and handling the forces in an operational manner. [Carrobello] Is this the integral farms method? [Garcia] Yes, we have over 90 all over Cuba. (The general takes out a pocket diary listing all the production units the EJT has working. They are classified by municipality, and full information on the farms is provided.) They work according to a weekly schedule where we list normal, additional, and preventive work. The additional work is to be done if the normal and preventive jobs are completed. So if fuel shortages, problems with rain, or if any other complications arise, they will know what to do. We have also eliminated quotas. With quotas, there was a tendency to slack off. When the quota was met, nothing else was done. I have often found soldiers sitting down because they had finished. Now we talk of possibilities. There are many possibilities for young men between 18 and 20 to do more. [Carrobello] Do you think all these features make the EJT the most productive force in the fields? [Garcia] We are not the most productive in everything. There are agricultural groups that outpace us. But looking at our work in a general way, we are not being immodest in considering ourselves in the forefront. Some people think we achieve this because we are military. There is no question that a military structure and the ages of our soldiers are two fundamental reasons why we are more efficient. But there are also factors like discipline, stringent requirements, and organization. These are not solely military attributes; these are qualities within the reach of anyone who wants to improve. Our soldiers now harvest between 80 and 90 quintals of potatoes and our working tools also have an impact on that performance. We have found that if the right equipment is not used to hold the bag open properly, a man can harvest only 50 quintals and it takes up to 13 minutes to fill a bag, which otherwise would be filled in three. I emphasize the preparation of the tools we use. If a cutting tool does not have a shielded tip, a soldier's hands get hurt more and he cuts less cane. Without the right tools in good condition, there is no reliable productivity. [Carrobello] Like any battle, a "green battle" also has its obstacles. What are they? [Garcia] One difficulty is with the minimum amount of fuel we are supposed to get, that is assigned to us, but that does not reach us. That does not allow me to establish a systematic fuel conservation plan, as should be done. But without a doubt, our major problem is the collection system for our harvested crops. I know this issue is controversial, but I take full responsibility for what I am saying. We have been hurt by late collections of our produce. That happened with potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and plantains, which were left out in the sun too long. The collection system has all kinds of mechanisms that cause damage to meats and vegetables; I will give you an example. Plantains are picked and then taken to a storage area; from there they are taken to be weighed, and then sent to the wholesale market, then another truck takes them on to other destinations. That item is loaded and unloaded no less than seven to eight times. It takes a long time to get it to the people, and during its lengthy and cumbersome trip, it runs the risk of being stolen. If we had responsibility for direct deliveries, I would not steal my own products. I would make sure they got to the markets fresh so they would be top-quality produce, and so people would have the quality they deserve in the products they are buying. [Carrobello] So far we have talked about the virtues of the EJT. What are its defects? [Garcia] The young men's complaints are primarily related to not getting enough passes. That upsets them because they work hard, and there are leadership personnel who are incapable of providing adequate answers, arguments they can understand. In general, the food is accepted. They understand the existing situation and see the efforts we are making to improve it by producing our own food and exchanging products with other farms. But we do have difficulties with recreation. There are not enough resources and equipment, and the cultural brigades are late in getting to the camps. And there are also shortages of clothing and shoes for the soldiers. [Carrobello] Prospects, goals? [Garcia] We will increase our sugarcane, citrus, and coffee production. But our main goal is to consolidate this new system of agricultural work, which demonstrates how much more can be accomplished when people are willing and organized.
