Representatives of different parties, movements, public organizations, district (?hakimats), various nationalities, and intelligentsia gathered together in the State History Museum building. Bishkek Mayor Ibraimov addressed those present. He drew their attention to the fact of the utmost importance of the meeting between the head of state and citizens of Bishkek. He said that major intellectual, scientific, and industrial forces are represented in the capital. Bishkek is a sort of a barometer of Kyrgyzstan's conscience. President Askar Akayev emphasized the importance of the meeting. He presented a speech, saying that all the regions of the country were attempting to equal Bishkek. It should set a good example of stable peace and prosperity. Therefore, topical problems have to be solved first in the capital. One of them is the restoration and revival of industry. Kyrgyzstan should develop further as an industrial state and Russia should become its main partner. This choice was made by Kyrgyz ancestors who understood the importance of the union. We should hand on the friendship baton to future generations. The president reminded those present of the unselfish assistance that was rendered to Kyrgyzstan by Russia at times of emergencies. He also said that the spring sowing campaign is approaching and we do not have any machinery or spare parts. We are short of fuel and mineral resources. Around 1 billion soms will be needed for the sowing campaign. Where can we get this money? We pin great hopes on the upcoming visit to Kyrgyzstan by Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. It is expected that a number of documents on economic cooperation will be signed. Our main goal is to preserve the intellectual potential which is the important asset of the country, said the head of state. We should cleverly use our experts. They represent our nation, it is a locomotive which is ascribed to play a major role in lifting the country's economy out of crisis and help in building an industrial state. Of course they need to be socially protected. Commissions have been set up in the government so as to supervise the timely payment of wages [to them] since these categories of workers mainly rely on their wages. The president also spoke about dual citizenship. The president believes that the migration of Russians could only be stopped provided we show our good attitude -- by introducing dual citizenship. Akayev urged people to get rid of the psychology of national self-conceit and to get rid of it, not only in politics, but also in everyday life. Let us be united and set a good example to other regions. Each ethnic group should feel safe and secure in Bishkek. By doing this we will maintain our independence, strengthen it, defend sovereignty, and build a healthy market economy. Only peace and stability can contribute to facilitating economic reforms.
