The chemicals group's Stammwerk plant, which has already produced 8,100 tonnes of these ozone-damaging substances in the current year, was shut down on Thursday and will be demolished for scrap. A smaller production plant at Hoechst Brazil will cease production by 1995 at the latest, the company has announced. Used CFC's will no longer be reprocessed by Hoechst in the future, but broken down into their chemical components. There is thus only one CFC producer left in Germany, Solvay in Hannover. A Solvay spokesman has said that this firm, too, intends discontinuing production within the next few weeks. Last year, Solvay produced 21,000 tonnes of CFC's. Hoechst, which enjoyed 40 percent of the domestic and 5 percent of the world market, states that it is the first producer in the world to cease CFC production. It used to produce up to 90,000 tonnes a year. The group decided in 1989 to cease production, which will be banned in Germany from 1995 onwards. Chlorinated CFC's, which are in widespread use as coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, constitute the main threat to the ozone layer, which protects the earth against ultraviolet solar radiation, at altitudes between 15 and 20 kilometers. The chlorine contained in these substances destroys the ozone chemically. Even now, a million tonnes of CFC's are still concealed in chilling and air-conditioning systems and plastic foams the world over. Hoechst has recently begun producing the ozone-friendly R134a coolant as a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons. Environmentalists, however, complain that this substance still contributes to the greenhouse effect. There was an explosion in the new R134a production plant a few weeks after it entered service, in mid-March. Since then the plant has been at a standstill by order of the authorities.
