FBIS3-20146 "drweu059i?_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 FRANCE Juppe on Mideast Peace Process, Iran, Algeria PM2503142494 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 25 Mar 94 pp 1, 4 PM2503142494 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din and Arlit Khuri: "Juppe: We Fear That Lebanon May Pay Price for Syria's Participation in Settlement"] [Excerpts] Paris -- French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said yesterday that there is concern over Lebanon's sovereignty and unity, stressing France's refusal to allow the abandonment of Lebanese sovereignty to be the price for Syria's participation in the peace process. He said that the disbanding of the "Lebanese Forces" while Hizballah continues to retain its weapons is tantamount to adopting a double standard. However, he stressed his support for the Lebanese Government, pointing out that the meeting he is going to hold today (Friday) with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is the sixth of its kind in one year. [passage omitted] During a breakfast banquet he held at the French Foreign Ministry with a number of Arab journalists in Paris, Juppe dealt with the situation in Algeria. He stressed that there has been no change in French policy toward Algeria, emphasizing France's willingness to support it financially. He pointed out that a new development is the appeal to French nationals "whose presence in Algeria is not essential" to return to their country because of the deteriorating security situation, which he hopes is temporary. He stressed that French policy in the Middle East is still balanced and that his country is committed to the relations binding it to the Arab states and Israel. With regard to Iraq, Juppe said that the information available to the United Nations about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction justifies an experimental phase, whose date is to be determined by the international committee. On his opinion of the Lebanese Government's decision to disband the "Lebanese Forces" and prevent -- temporarily -- the media services in Lebanon from broadcasting [political] news bulletins, Juppe said that, "if that is true, it is not possible to settle problems by gagging the press." [passage omitted] He added: "When we say that we are eager to prevent Lebanon from paying the price for peace in the region, this is clear -- and I have emphasized this before in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. Frankly, we do not want Lebanon's sovereignty to be the price for persuading Syria to participate in the peace process." However, he added: "We have good relations with Syria, and we hope to keep them so. But we continue to stress the need for Lebanon to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity." Asked whether he was concerned about Lebanon's sovereinty and unity, Juppe said: "Yes there is concern. Who is saying what I am saying? I hope other states will start to do so as well." With regard to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, he said that "the Lebanese Government's position urging Israel's willingness to withdraw in accordance with Resolution 425 and to negotiate a timetable does not conflict with my reasoning. Once the security problem in southern Lebanon is solved, there will be no need for foreign forces to remain in Lebanon." Asked whether he believes it is fair to disband the "Lebanese Forces" while Hizballah retains its weapons, Juppe said: "It reflects a double standard." [passage omitted] He said that the "ugly crime committed against two Frenchmen in Algeria increases the number of French killed there to eight so far. As a result of the deterioration there, we have urged our nationals whose presence in Algeria is not essential to return to France. It is a matter of conscience. Some saw this as playing the extremists' game. But do we have the right to keep our nationals there amid very serious conditions? I do not believe so." He added: "I must tell you that we are increasingly concerned as a result of the escalating violence. And we would like to hope that dialogue is still possible." He stressed the need to help Algeria "financially and by rescheduling its debts. This reflects the fact that France is probably the only country which offered Algeria 6 billion francs in 1993, and this year too." He said that "our ability to intervene (in Algeria) is very limited and cannot go beyond lending advice. We have for several months been giving advice regarding the need for political dialogue and economic change. France cannot do more than that, and the solutions are in the hands of the Algerian authorities and the Algerian people." [passage omitted] Asked whether the French Embassy in Algeria is making contacts with the Islamists, Juppe said: "Our embassy makes contacts with anyone who supports dialogue, but, of course, we have no contacts with those carrying out the assassinations." Asked whether France intends to provide military aid to Algeria, Juppe said "no." With regard to the Middle East, Juppe described as untrue reports of a change in French policy in the region. "It is not new to say that France is a friend of both the Arabs and the Israelis. This has not changed. But it seems that it is not easy to convince everyone of this." [passage omitted] Answering a question about Iraq, he said: "We do not need lessons from anyone at this level. It is natural for French institutions to prepare for the stage that will follow the [lifting of] the embargo imposed on Iraq. All the big powers are working on this basis." He stressed that the French position on Iraq remainsthe same, and it stipulates "the safeguarding of Iraq's unity, on the grounds that it is a fundamental factor for the region's stability. Anything liable to harm this unity worries us, because it would affect stability. Besides, the Security Council resolutions do not entitle the United Nations to choose the Iraqi regime. That is not among our aims. It is an Iraqi question. I am often told that under a totalitarian regime words are always easier than actions. But this applies to many of the regimes in the region. France is seeking to compel it [the Iraqi regime] to fully implement all the international resolutions adopted against it." Juppe stressed that "questions related to freedoms and human rights are not negotiable: Either they are respected or not." He added: "With regard to the elimination of the weapons of mass destruction, protracted and thorough investigations have been conducted in this connection by the special UN committee headed by Rolf Ekeus and we have noted that the Iraqis responded to it, sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly. On the basis of the available information, it has been decided to impose an experimental phase on Iraq to ascertain the extent of its compliance with the removal of the weapons systems in its possession." He stressed that "the special committee has to set a date for the start of the experimental phase, because that falls under its, not France's, jurisdiction." He said that Iraq had sent a message to the United Nations in which it stressed its respect for Kuwait's sovereignty, but failed to mention respect for the common border. Asked whether he supports U.S. policy on the dual containment of Iraq and Iran, Juppe stressed that "we have no fundamental disagreement with U.S. policy in the region, but we do not use the same phrases. What we want from Iraq is implementation of the international resolutions. As for Iran, we are pusuing a critical dialogue with it." He pointed out that "some Iranian positions are causing problems for us, including, for example, the issue of the writer Salman Rushdie and Iran's position on the peace process in the Middle East -- a position which we cannot describe as constructive. There is also ambiguity in terms of Iran's relations with some terrorist movements. All this explains the critical dialogue between us." With regard to Libya, Juppe said that there has been no further development in the Libyan position. "They told us in a message of their willingness to respond to the specified legal demands, but this willingness has not materialized yet." On events in Yemen, he expressed his hope that the agreement signed among Yemeni parties in Amman would be implemented. He pointed out that "France will participate in the proceedings of the Omani-Jordanian military observation committee."
