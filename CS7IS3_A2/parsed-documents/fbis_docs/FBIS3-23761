The provincial modesty for which even elections to the Moscow Duma were noted apparently does not suit the city on the Neva. The campaign for 50 seats on the City Assembly, which operates on a "volunteer basis," meets once a week and is only entrusted with the functions of a representatives' club, has produced an unexpected burst of political activity. Every party, movement and ideology will be represented in the election -- no one has decided not to participate or to declare a boycott. This activity was mainly inspired by the city administration, which laid down playing rules that are acceptable to a majority of political organizations. The "sound and fury" of Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, despondent over the Russian Democratic Reform Movement's poor showing in the December election, and the audacity with which jurist Sobchak handles constitutional standards, have really gotten the city's political circles excited. For example, the Election Statute approved by the mayor denies the right to vote to St. Petersburg's 100,000 students, cadets, military personnel and citizens who have not met the "residency requirement" (something not envisioned by the Constitution), and candidates must be at least 21 years old instead of 18! An amendment to the Election Statute that was released on 22 January finally convinced everyone that the mayor is capable of "extrapolating" constitutional law ad infinitum. Now suddenly one finds the caveat that deputies from both the State Duma and the Federation Council may not be elected to serve in the City Assembly! It is no secret that this latest innovation is personally directed at Aleksandr Belyayev, the former city soviet chairman and currently a deputy from St. Petersburg to the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. Especially since Aleksandr Belyayev is head of "Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg" -- the bloc with the best chance of winning in the city -- and is regarded as the most likely candidate for City Assembly chairman. Expecting nothing good to come of that, the mayor has little by little been creating problems for "senator" Belyayev: on Thursday he was excluded from the special communications system, on Friday his official car was taken away, and on Saturday he was denied the right to participate in city elections. The administration's legal escapades have resulted in essentially every organization, from the communists to Democratic Russia, now rejecting this "hip pocket" version of the City Assembly as decreed by Sobchak, and coming out in favor of expanded rights for the legislative branch. Incidentally, they also reject the previous St. Petersburg City Soviet model just as unanimously. One of the principal shortcomings programmed into it was deputies' inclination to constantly extrapolate their position to the Russia-wide political level. The mentality of the "second capital," a city whose voice is heeded in any situation, constantly prompted the deputies to undertake messianic initiatives, such as the struggle against the central USSR government, participation in the "constitutional process," and so on. Now the universal image is of deputies who deal primarily with city issues and are familiar with the structure of the city economy and the interests of the various social and professional groups in the population. The political configuration of campaign associations (a total of 34 organizations and blocs have been authorized to collect signatures!) is highly specific. Naturally city leaders will inevitably exploit the symbolic potential of their party "stars" from Moscow. But the correlation of forces in the city is by no means an exact copy of the Russia-wide political landscape. Here we see the effects of special connections which formed in the past between politicians and various organizations. One shining example of this is "Democratic Unity of Petersburg," which unites 29 organizations, many of which participated in the December election independently or else as part of other blocs. These include Democratic Russia, Memorial, PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Consensus], PES [Economic Freedom Party] and social democrats and republics attached to Yabloko. Among the candidates from this bloc, which is headed by Aleksandr Belyayev, are many former deputies of the St. Petersburg City Soviet and businesspeople. It also includes well-known jeweler Andrey Ananov. Among the bloc's campaign slogans are demands for a new mayoral election, because under Sobchak "city hall's actions have been shrouded in deepest secrecy; it has assumed all the functions of the KGB." Belyayev has filed suit against the mayor and together with a group of St. Petersburg politicians went to Moscow to raise the issue of Sobchak's activities. Aleksandr Belyayev's bloc is in competition with the "All of St. Petersburg" association. It was established by businesspeople, bankers from the three largest banks and public officials involved in privatization. Its leader is Sergey Belyayev, chairman of the Federal Administration for Enterprise Bankruptcies under the Russian Federation State Committee for State Property Management. Many of the organizers of "All of St. Petersburg" were formerly members of the "Russia's Choice" movement. However, now those who represent big business have decided to defend their interests separately, rejecting a temporary alliance with the "experienced" but penniless veterans of the democratic movement. Despite the fact that these blocs are backed by various business circles and financial groups, there is still a chance that they will conclude a "non-aggression pact" among themselves. For example, on a list of "untouchable" candidates. However, it is already becoming clear that they will not be able to transform their associations into "civilized" parties. Despite original intentions to create a professional political elite, "Democratic Unity" has been transformed into a temporary alliance between various political organizations. And "All of St. Petersburg," which has not been able to form a broad political coalition, remains a closed, elitist club for those who "have already become established in their fields," a society that is counting on the current elite, not the formation of a new one, and therefore supports the principle of a "non-professional" City Assembly. The extreme "implacable" opposition is divided into two mutually hostile factions. The ultra-communists (the BKPB, the RKRP [Russian Communist Workers Party], the RKP [Communist Party of Russian] and "Laboring Leningrad") have joined together with the nationalist radicals ("Ours" and the "Union of Officers") to form the "Motherland" bloc. They reject all contacts with both the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and with Zyuganov's KPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], which they regard as provocateurs. In addition, "patriots" independent of the communist groups have established a "purely nationalist" bloc called "Great Russia" (comprised of ROS [Russian National Union], the Russian Party and the Russian National Assembly). Finally, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has not deviated from its rules and will campaign separately. With approximately 400 people in its organization, it hopes to win 15 City Assembly seats. It is noteworthy that its slogans are largely in line with the ideas of the "radical democrats" --merger of city and oblast, a new mayoral election, expanded rights for the legislative branch, an end to restrictions on voting rights, etc. Of course, the whole campaign still lies ahead, but even now there is reason to expect that the future City Assembly will involve a tactical coalition comprised of two-thirds of the deputies and directed against the current administration chief. And, come what may, that outcome will inevitably result in a redistribution of political roles within St. Petersburg's ruling class.
