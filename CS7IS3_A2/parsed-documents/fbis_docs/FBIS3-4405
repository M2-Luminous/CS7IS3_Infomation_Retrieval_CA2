That afternoon, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered an important speech at the conference. Comrade He Zhukang's speech falls into four parts: 1) Strengthening propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall situation; 2) propaganda and ideological work is valued for construction; 3) build a contingent of propaganda and ideological workers with good quality; and 4) continue to strengthen the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work. In his speech, Comrade He Zhukang said: Right after the conclusion of the national propaganda and ideological work conference, the provincial party committee's standing committee listened to and conscientiously studied and discussed the guidelines of this conference, defined through research the province's opinions for implementing the guidelines and some major issues on strengthening propaganda and ideological work, and then decided to hold the current provincial propaganda and ideological work conference. This provincial conference is devoted to relaying and implementing the guidelines of the national conference and to further unifying ideas, defining tasks, and strengthening leadership in an effort to create a new situation in the province's propaganda and ideological work, to better exploit propaganda departments' role of propaganda and guidance, mobilization and inspiring, and education and encouragement in deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability, and to better cement the strength of the people throughout the province to continuously press forward the magnificent cause of building Jilin into a development border and near-the-sea province. He Zhukang said: Over the past 15 years since the commencement of reform and opening up, guided by the theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the party's basic line, and based on the realities of reform and development, the province's propaganda and ideological workers have vigorously armed the people with theory, propagated just cases, carried forward the main melody, upheld correct orientation of the media, and carried forward the role of uniting and inspiring the people, thus helping promote all the work of the province. He Zhukang pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work is the manifestation of fine tradition and political advantages of our party, which has always occupied an extremely important position in the work of the whole party. Under the new historical condition, the strategic position of propaganda and ideological work is tended to be strengthened, rather than being weakened. Therefore, during the new period, strengthening propaganda and ideological work, correctly guiding ideology and public opinions, and firmly controlling the orientation of the media have a direct bearing on the building of socialist spiritual civilization and on the overall situation of the socialist modernization. At present, China's reform and opening up as well as the modernization drive have entered a key period. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall situation of the whole party and the whole country. Standing on the height of this overall situation, propaganda and ideological workers should fully understand the major responsibility and historical mission invested on them during the new period and should positively and enthusiastically serve the progress of reform and opening up. Under the situation in which many reform measures have been set forth altogether, the dynamics of reform has been increased, and the degree of difficulty of reform has been enhanced, propaganda and ideological workers should propagate, based on a new starting point, the importance and necessity of reform and the series of new reform measures adopted by the party and the government. At the same time, toward the new contradictions and new problems resulting from the readjusted relations of interests, propaganda and ideological workers should positively persuade the people and answer in vivid and correct terms the questions to the common concern of the people in order to turn negative factors into positive ones. He Zhukang said: The current world opinion is conducive to accelerating China's economic development. Propaganda and ideological work should be aimed at creating a good ideological and public opinion atmosphere for economic development. Propaganda and ideological departments should make great efforts to propagate Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic idea on accelerating development, strengthen the people's consciousness in accelerating development, and disseminate the excellent situation and tremendous achievements scored in economic construction of the whole country and the whole province since the commencement of reform and opening up in order to arouse the fighting will of the people and enhance the morale of the people. Propaganda and ideological workers should publicize the conditions of China and Jilin Province by seeking truth from facts, make a scientific analysis of the contradictions and difficulties in economic work, guide the masses to show concern for the overall situation of economic development, help cadres and the masses embrace a new idea on development, and make the people more confident in achieving success in reform and surmounting difficulties. Propaganda and ideological departments should go all out to propagate the theory of market economy, popularize modern economic knowledge, and make the people more enthusiastic in participating in market economic activities. The endeavor of improving the people's quality should be regarded as the most fundamental work in the process of socialist modernization and, this work should be grasped constantly in the perspective of enhancing the long-term competitiveness of the province's economy. He Zhukang said: Maintaining social stability is the prerequisite for deepening reform and accelerating development. Party members and cadres throughout the province as well as the propaganda and ideological front must pay high attention to various kinds of unstable factors in social activities, give full play to the power of propaganda and ideological work to give correct guidance, take a clear-cut stand in carrying forward healthy tendencies and condemning unhealthy ones, and check erroneous ideas at the outset in order to promote and safeguard stability. He Zhukang said: Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line are the essential guide to propaganda and ideological work, and the major tasks of propaganda and ideological work are to arm the people with scientific theory, guide the people with correct public opinion, mold the people with noble spirit, and inspire the people with excellent works. The above-mentioned guide and major tasks have defined the essential objective of propaganda and ideological work as strengthening the common understanding and the cohesive force of the people of the whole party and the whole country. The province's propaganda and ideological work must be focused on strengthening the common understanding and the cohesive force of the people, on arming all the party members and cadres in the province with the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, on using new ideas, that are suitable for the modern economy and for the situation of economic and social development, to correctly guide public opinion and [words indistinct], on firmly and unswervingly upholding the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, on [words indistinct] and strengthening management with the purpose of bringing the people's ideas into line with the overall situation of the whole party and the whole country. He Zhukang said: Building a contingent of propaganda and ideological workers of good quality constitutes an organizational guarantee for achieving success in propaganda and ideological work. At present, propaganda and ideological workers must keep abreast of new demands, carry forward the cause pioneered by predecessors, forge ahead into the future, and make continued efforts to further strengthen themselves. In politics, propaganda and ideological workers should be firm and steadfast by embracing a strong sense of dedication and a high degree of the sense of responsibility. In profession, they should constantly improve their skills to become specialized in propaganda and ideological work and should enhance their confidence to maintain a good mental state. Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: Strengthening the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work is the consistent tradition of our party. During the new historical period, party organizations at all levels should all the more attach importance to and strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work. He stressed: Party committees must attach importance to propaganda and ideological work, provide sufficient and competent cadres for the leading bodies of propaganda and ideological departments, give full play to the role of propaganda departments under party committees, increase the input in propaganda and cultural undertakings, and actually help propaganda and ideological departments solve practical difficulties and problems. He Zhukang said in conclusion: This year is an extremely important year, in which, reform will be promoted in an all-round way, and efforts will be made to make breakthroughs in major aspects. This year is also the last year to conduct the activity of pushing the province's economy onto a new stage in three years. The current situation and tasks are important and arduous, and the vast numbers of cadres on the propaganda and ideological front are shouldering an important mission. The provincial party committee expects that the cadres on the propaganda and ideological front will enhance their morale and do an even higher level of work to mobilize the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to forge ahead in unity, to deepen reform, to expand opening up, to promote development, and to maintain stability in order to make new contributions to building Jilin into a developed border and near-the-sea province and to building the socialism with Chinese characteristics.
