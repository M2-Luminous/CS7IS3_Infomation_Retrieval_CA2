The two fires started seven days ago. One is in the western section of the forest, which was reported to have been brought under control. The other is in the eastern and southern parts of the forest, which is still blazing, due to strong winds and difficult terrain. The fire fighters, mainly forest police, armed police, border police, men of the People's Liberation Army and local people, are still fighting the fire.
