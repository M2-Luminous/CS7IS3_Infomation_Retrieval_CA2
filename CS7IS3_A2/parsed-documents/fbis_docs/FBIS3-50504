In a session rife with criticism of President Carlos Menem and his government the committee approved the plan submitted by the UGTT [expansion unknown] and UTA [Motor Transport Workers Union] transport workers unions to walk off the job if the government ignores the labour movement's major demands. These include loosening up on the austerity measures that have caused unrest in the country's poorer provinces and dropping the plan to reduce employer contributions to union-run health care and other services. Notably absent from yesterday's session were such staunch government supporters as the head of the ANSSAL [National Health Insurance Administration] social security administration, Jose Luis Lingeri, Obras Sanitarias Waterworks union, Ramon Valle, and UPCN [National Civil Service Personnel Union] civil servants union, Andres Rodriguez, who is currently in the United States. Also absent were UOM [Metalworkers Union] metalworkers leader Lorenzo Miguel and restaurant workers chief Luis Barrionuevo. In a critical statement the CGT warned that the government could not expect its belt-tightening measures -- which would result in the dismissal of thousands of provincial employees among other effects -- to be successful "if a strong network of social protection is not simultaneously erected." As regards the government's plan to roll back employer contributions by up to 80 percent in order to cut the so-called "Argentine cost" of doing business, the CGT said: "(It) conspires against social justice and contradicts the more developed policies in that area." The government's plans to make labour legislation fared no better as the confederation said they would "increase unemployment, underemployment and marginalization." The CGT attributed the government's policies to "a dehumanizing, anti-Christian concept of the economy stemming from the savage capitalism that degrades humanity and seeks to convert it into one more raw material for economic production." Numerous labour leaders made statements similar to those expressed by health industry leader Carlos West Ocampo. "We don't give a darn about twisting the President's arm," said West Ocampo. "This government has condemned thousands of workers to hunger and misery and the Justicialist Party is at his service."
