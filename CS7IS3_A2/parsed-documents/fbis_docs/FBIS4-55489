It is easier for civilians to cross from one part of Sarajevo to the other than from the eastern to the western part of Mostar and vice versa, Rose said, adding that the freedom to cross from one part of Mostar to the other was like the freedom to cross from East to West Berlin during the Cold War. In his talks with representatives of civilian and military authorities of the western part of Mostar, he said that much more had been done in central Bosnia to implement the Washington agreement, and in particular to provide free movement of civilians. Representatives of authorities of western Mostar said it was better to normalize life in Mostar slowly but surely, than hurry and make quite possible mistakes, which could reverse the peace process back to the starting point. What has been done so far to completely end the fighting is a lot for Mostar, representatives of Croatian authorities said, adding that the latest Croat-Bosniak political agreements would certainly stimulate the normalization of life in Mostar.
