[passage omitted] The program is introduced by Luca Livoni: Today, we have a very important program. We will be linking up soon with Tbilisi, where we have our special correspondent Alessandro Cassieri. [passage omitted] So, this morning Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] E. Shevardnadze will be asked many questions by the guests in the studio or by people with whom we have linked up on the telephone. These are Giorgio Napolitano, president of the Italian Parliament Chamber of Deputies, Senate President Giovanni Spandolini, Giuseppe Giacovazzo, deputy minister of foreign affairs, Stefano Silvestri, professor at the Center for International Relations, Raiuno director Demetrio Volcic, who was special correspondent in Moscow for many years, and my colleagues Giuseppe Chiseri and Carlo Napoli from Radio Two's foreign department. [passage omitted] [Shevardnadze]First and foremost, I would like to greet Batonebi Napolitano, Spandolini, and all the radio listeners and express my gratitude to all the organizers of this broadcast. Regarding the situation that has taken shape in Georgia, it is very difficult. However, certain positive events did take place in 1993. These were the general consolidation of our people and the defeat of such destructive and semifascist forces as the supporters of the former president and their armed opposition against the authorities and the Georgian people. There existed the fundamental danger of the division of the nation, but this has been eliminated since the supporters of the ex-president were defeated politically, morally, and militarily. As for Abkhazia, almost more than one-half of the population of Abkhazia has been evacuated. Of the population of 500,000 in Abkhazia, 250,000 persecuted Georgians are now in different regions of Georgia. Tens of thousands of Georgians have been destroyed and shot simply because they were Georgians. Unfortunately, this problem cannot, as yet, be resolved. The first round of negotiations is currently in progress in Geneva. The main point in this agreement is that the refugees should return immediately to their homes. The next round will also be held in Geneva on 11 Janury and we will be going there with definite hopes. If this is realized and the refugees return to their homes, a peaceful regulation becomes realistic. [Cassieri] The beginning of the conflict in this part of Georgia is naturally connected with the new composition of the Soviet Union. However, what, in your view, was the direct motive and basis for the intensification of the autonomous movement in Abkhazia; what process that has taken place in the former Soviet Union over the last two years was able to contribute to this? [Shevardnadze]This is the manifestation of the reactionary separatist movement. Not everyone knows that this is Georgian land on which Georgians and Abkhazians have been living for centuries. If we speak about proportionate figures, Georgians make up one-half of the population, whereas the Abkhazians constitute only 17 percent. Who is supporting this 17 percent and how is it possible that 17 percent has been able to persecute 50 percent? This happened because the Abkhazian separatists were backed by Russia's reactionary force: Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and the communists, fundamentalists and communists who were in the Supreme Soviet at the time. They rendered financial and material assistance and sent weapons and thousands of mercenaries there. This 17 percent is demanding that Abkhazia secedes from Georgia and unites with Russia. [Cassieri] Apart from the responsibility of the old nomenklatura of the former Soviet Union, those people holding Soviet views, who, just two months ago, suffered another "purge," you specifically demanded that the Russian Government also assume responsibility, particularly when you were in Sukhumi in August and September by which time the Abkhazians had surrounded the city. That is to say, you demanded that Yeltsin, whom you felt was not giving you the necessary support in order to defend Georgia, should assume direct responsibility. [Shevardnadze]I believe that Yeltsin was unable to control the situation, as the Supreme Soviet at the time was putting up considerable resistance and the majority of deputies supported those separatist actions by the Abkhazians. Yeltsin was unable to overcome this opposition in his conflict with these people. The opposition between these two forces gave rise to and aggravated the conflict in Abkhazia as well. You know that I was in Abkhazia at that time. It was terrible to see the destruction of this most beautiful part of Georgia. [passage omitted] [Napolitano] First of all, I would like to say to Batoni Shevardnadze that I have often thought about him and his brave step to struggle against so many problems that have arisen in Georgia. I respect you very much and admire your character. At the beginning of October, President [as published] Shevardnadze appealed to those countries in Europe on whose help he was counting. I would like to ask Batoni president to what extent have those questions that were raised been coordinated on an international scale and what help is needed and what can the West do in this respect. [Shevardnadze]Thank you very much. I likewise greet all of you and thank you for such an appraisal of my activities. My appeal, which has just been mentioned, signified our saving Georgia and democracy. It is a question of the salvation of democracy here, as Georgia has chosen a difficult path in a region that is already very difficult from a geographical point of view. The problems that were mentioned in my appeal are still pressing; the situation in Georgia remains very serious. There is total hunger. Georgia use to be a rich country where the people lived well. However, we now have hunger and cold. This is the fate of our nation. There are now hundreds of thousands of refugees in Georgia. If it were not for the help from the West, in particular from Italy and other countries, the situation in Georgia would be much worse. I appeal once more to everyone to whom the ideals of democracy are dear, to help Georgia so that, through our combined efforts, we can save this small but, at the same time, great country that has a centuries-old civilization. Once again, I thank you very much for your help. [Giacovazzo] In spite of the great sympathy that I feel toward Batoni Shevardnadze, I do not have such a good knowledge of the problems in Georgia. I am more interested in issues related to Russia. The Zhirinovskiy problem is of concern to everyone at the moment, a problem that relates not only to the present time, but also to the future. Is is possible that this populist, ultraright- wing leader -- I don't know what to call him -- will enjoy even greater success in the 1996 presidential elections? To what extent is he a serious threat? Will we not see a unification of the left around Yeltsin? I have one more question that directly concerns Italy: You know that, this year, Italy is presiding over the Security Council that unites 54 states including all the republics of the former Soviet Union. Italy wants to make active use of its status in the council and bring to a hasty end all the different conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union, in particular those taking place in Georgia. I would like to know how effectively Batoni Shevardnadze thinks this role may be used and what is possible for Italy to do this year as council president? [Shevardnadze]I will try to answer in brief these difficult questions. I assumed that this process would occur in Russia and that 15-20 percent would support Zhirinovskiy. I was mistaken, but this had to take place in Russia. I think that this is due not so much to the victory of Zhirinovskiy's ideas, but rather to confusion among the electorate. Zhirinovskiy should have appeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, it is unfortunate that the forces that were standing alongside him enabled him to acquire such influence. This is indeed worrying. However, there is the other side of the coin: Following Zhirinovskiy's success, Russian society has come to its senses. Unfortunately, prior to the elections, many democrats did not view him as a serious force and, therefore, I think they were justly punished. I am left with the impression that Russia's democrats have to unite and I believe that this will indeed happen. They will unite to prevent the emergence of fascism. If they unite, fascism will not take hold. If the democrats do not unite and fascism strengthens its hold, this will be terrible not only for Russia, but also for Europe and the whole world. However, I believe that this will not happen. Russia achieved great success when it adopted a new constitution. This creates a serious guarantee of democracy and this Constitution will enable President Yeltsin to eradicate fascism and dictatorship. I think that President Yeltsin will make use of this. Regarding the Security Council, I pin great hopes upon it. It should adopt an even more firm position particularly regarding such questions as ethnic conflicts. The Security Council can do this. Conflicts characterize the Caucasus, particularly Georgia. Europe should think how, as one force, it can overcome the economic crisis. If this crisis is not overcome on such a large territory, chaos could ensue, which will cost the world dear. I pin great hopes on Italy's presidency of the Security Council. We are ready to cooperate in every way possible so that your presidency will make an appreciable contribution.[passage omitted] [Spandolini] I warmly greet President Shevardnadze and I fondly remember our first meeting in Rome in 1991 when your book "Freedom for the Future" was being presented. I recall your comments, which proved to be incredibly correct, a few months before the coup in Russia, about Gorbachev's future actions and your view that this transformation may not have brought the expected results. The freedom that was written about in that book is now more urgent than ever, as is the independence of Georgia.... [Shevardnadze]Thank you. Let me give you my answer. The likes of Gamsakhurdia, Zhirinovskiy, Ardzinba in Abkhazia, and certain others in Russia are a dangerous phenomenon and I believe that, after World War II, the world paid less attention to fascism and analogous movements. In my view, this has cost the world very dearly and, therefore, we have to be vigilant and, what is more, analyze aggressive separatism and not tolerate what has happened in our region. As for Zhirinovskiy's supporters -- Gamsakhurdia and the others -- I myself know, through having had direct contacts with them over two years, that they are surrounded by many inexperienced people. Our people, for example, realized very quickly what Gamsakhurdia represented. This was the reason for his defeat. The great majority of his supporters are cooperating with us today. I am certain that we will cooperate with almost all of them as Gamsakhurdia propagated the ideas of national exclusivity, irreconcilability with other nations, and religious intolerance, and they could not have any future. People realized this and we are now cooperating with them. Many of Zhirinovskiy's supporters have chosen a different path. It only requires the unification of the democrats and Zhirinovskiy will no longer be dangerous. [Cassieri] As the former [Soviet] foreign minister, you naturally know all the Soviet Union's secrets. When Zhirinovskiy threatened to use the "ultimate weapon," whom do you think he had in mind? The future destruction of their arch enemy or awkward neighbors? In your view, what was meant by this, if anything at all? [Shevardnadze]I think that what Zhirinovskiy is saying represents the nostalgia of certain circles in Russia. Of course, it is based on Russian chauvinist ideology. We should view this as a chauvinist movement and a type of fascism: A chauvinist world outlook and imperialist nostalgia -- these are the two main characteristics of this movement. I would like to repeat once more that, in order to overcome this, it is essential for all democrats in Russia to unite. [Spandolini] I realize that the European model is more acceptable for the CIS than the U.S. one. I am pleased to hear your view that Yeltsin will be able to curb the fascist-chauvinist wave that is currently affecting Russia. However, is Batoni Shevardnadze aware that the European Community is facing a great danger? Separatist movements have intensified in certain EC countries. Do you think that the same danger awaits the CIS? In short, is there a risk of a second Yugoslavia in Russia? [Shevardnadze]When we compare the prospects for the development of the European Community and the CIS, I believe that the principle underlying the unification of the countries in the CIS should be the same as that which underlies the European Community. If this happens, the CIS will be a viable prospect. This is the first thing. The second demand: The CIS will survive provided that Russia proceeds along the path of democratic development. This is an essential condition. God forbid that it will happen, but if dictatorship becomes established in Russia and Russia's reactionary forces are victorious, naturally, the CIS will perish and I am convinced that Russia, likewise, will no longer survive. Therefore, the future of the CIS and Russia lies only along the path of democratic development. I think that Batoni Yeltsin understands this well. I will remind him of one step that has been taken: One of my friends, Aleksandr Yakovlev, a well-known Russian democrat, has been made head of Russian television. I think this is a very important fact. There should be more of these actions. [Silvestri] I do not want to talk about the so-called "ultimate weapon" as I think that Batoni President Shevardnadze was right in saying that the ultimate weapon of war was political force. Moreover, Russia does have the ultimate -- atomic -- weapon, which is enough. It is more difficult to achieve stability in this region. Proceeding from this, I wanted to ask President Shevardnadze whether it will be possible to create elements of stability in the Black Sea region if there continue to be prolonged national conflicts between Muslims and Christians, in the main, in the Caucasus region. [Shevardnadze]Thank you. This is how I see it: Given that there existed such a grandiose and most-powerful empire as that of the Soviet Union and that very little time has elapsed since the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian system, we should not be surprised that such a short period of time has been extremely dramatic. I believe that the world should take a better look at these processes. The changes that have occurred on our planet since the collapse of the Soviet Union are the subject of a separate discussion and the events in our region are taking place precisely against the background of this process. We have to take into account that not all the people were ready for independence. We are now passing through this difficult school. I firmly believe that we will achieve stability and that the Caucasus will likewise become a stable region. I would like to highlight two points here: 1. The importance of the CIS, if only from the point of view that it is necessary to revive the economy and it is impossible to do this unless ties are restored between the republics of the former Soviet Union; 2. The great unification of neighboring countries. The foundations for such an alliance have already been laid between the CIS and the countries of the Black Sea basin. Their principles of collective security are gradually coinciding and I believe that Europe and NATO should direct their attention to such regions as the Caucasus. The Caucasus is no less an explosive region than the Balkans. Therefore, I think that, in order to achieve peace, we have to implement collective measures. An explosion in the Caucasus could have the most serious consequences on a global scale, if we take into account what states could become involved in such a conflict. I would like to be more optimistically minded and think about peace and stability. [Chiseri] As the program is coming to an end, we would like to draw certain conclusions: You correctly pointed out that one important factor that created a big danger to peace was aggressive separatism. Don't you think that there exist many reasons in the world for such a danger, for example, Islamic integration, which has surfaced in your region as well? [Shevardnadze]I don't think this is the main reason. Such countries as Georgia have a centuries-old experience of religious coexistence. In this small country, whose population is only some 5 million, members of the Orthodox Church, Muslims, members of the Armenian national church [grigorianelebi], and Catholics have lived together for centuries. Georgians and Jews have lived together for 26 centuries and there have never been any conflicts between them, either of a religious or any other nature. It is precisely because we are located on the border between Islam and Christianity that history has enabled us to acquire experience, on the basis of which I am able to say that Georgians will live peacefully with people of all religions. I believe that it is possible to achieve a peaceful and stable situation. We also have to take into account the economic crisis. I think that, as soon as we overcome our economic difficulties, it will become easier for us to achieve stability as well. [Napoli] We have been speaking of Islam and Zhirinovskiy's "secret weapon," but the greatest danger to Europe is presented by those four republics, in particular Ukraine, that were left with nuclear weapons following the collapse of the Soviet Union. [Shevardnadze]I have very close relations with Ukraine's political forces. I know very well how they are disposed to this issue and I believe that the existence of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is being dramatized too much. The right course was not taken from the very start when we should have spoken with Ukraine as a country that possesses nuclear weapons. All the different nuances were not taken into account in time. I am certain that Ukraine will adhere to a position that befits a civilized country. I do not think that Ukraine presents any threat. I exclude such a danger. [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask you a question that any Italian might ask. You were a great friend of Gorbachev. Some three years ago, you separated from one another amid great uproar. Have you maintained personal relations with him? Do you think that Gorbachev is planning a political comeback? [Shevardnadze]As regards my personal relations with Gorbachev, they are excellent. I respect him greatly and believe that he is one of the greatest persons of our century. As for his political future, I do not think that my good friend has a big political future. However, politics is full of paradoxes and one cannot exclude anything. If we reason according to the established laws of society, we should conclude that he has already fulfilled his mission and he will probably not be given the chance to embark on another.(passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] What is your personal view of U.S. President Clinton? [Shevardnadze]I believe that the American people have elected a worthy president. [Cassieri] A few months before his departure from the political arena, Gorbachev said in self-criticism that the unification of the two Germanies had been a premature step, a political mistake [defekti]. The same has been said by U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. If you were speaking as foreign minister, what would you say in self-criticism? [Shevardnadze]Regarding the unification of Germany, I believe it came too late. If this unification had occurred earlier, say in 1986, it would have been better. As for self-criticism, had both Gorbachev and I been able to control the collapse of the empire, this, naturally, would have spared us many problems. [passage omitted]
