The guest on "Live Dialogue" today is Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov, the first president of the Republic of Crimea. May I congratulate you on your election and wish you all the best. [Meshkov] Thank you, Andrey Georgiyevich. [Skryabin] I would like to introduce my colleagues working with me in the studio today. They are Lyudmila Olegovna Telen, commentator for the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper, and Yuliy Aleksandrovich Semenov, commentator for Mayak radio. I am Andrey Skryabin, commentator for Ostankino television. [passage omitted] Your questions, please. [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, you have become the first president of the Republic of Crimea within the composition of Ukraine. All the same, however, everyone knows that the disputes surrounding Crimea's status have not yet abated. They were especially acute during your electoral campaign. Every candidate running for this top post had his own special view on the status of Crimea. How do you see this status, and how do you intend to act? [Meshkov] The status is defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea--the Constitution that was adopted on 6 May 1992. Then, as you know, there were some changes in the contents of the Constitution. There were some illegal changes, but the genuine and first Constitution of the Republic of Crimea says that mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine are built on the basis of treaties and agreements. These are reasonable, normal, and civilized relations between republics. [Skryabin] Continuing from what you have just said, there is persistent talk in the media--in Ukraine, in particular--about a federal and territorial organization of Ukraine. How do you see the possibility of such a federal organization of Ukraine and, accordingly, of Crimea being part of the federation? [Meshkov] Well, first of all, this is economically based, and there is an economic need for the federalization of Ukraine. Initially, the idea was rejected completely, but now it is winning support in Ukraine. I expect the Kuchma-Grinev bloc will use a similar proposal to reorganize the state. The bloc is gathering strength, and obviously there will be a chance to implement this proposed federal organization of Ukraine. [Telen] Do you expect that, in that case, some sort of federation treaty would be signed within a Ukrainian framework, or would the relations between Kiev and the future territories be built on the basis of some sort of bilateral relations? [Meshkov] Well, that is the Ukrainian leadership's problem, and the way the question is solved will depend on which forces win at the elections for the Supreme Soviet and then for the Ukrainian president. [Semenov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I would like to join my question with a comment by viewer Mukhamed Minachev, a Muscovite. [passage omitted] He makes an interesting remark: It is one thing to be a candidate and to make biting statements during an election campaign, and another when you become an elected president who has to make responsible decisions. People following events closely have noted a certain change in the nuances of your position. For instance, your electoral campaign focused on the idea of Crimean independence. How do you think this idea looks now, and how can it be implemented? [passage omitted] [Meshkov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, the question already contains part of the answer: Naturally, I have a lesser degree of freedom now. It is sad but true that an official has less opportunity to make frank--or if you like, sharp--statements. They have to correspond more to the real political situation, and they must take into account anticipated changes in the situation. This responsibility leaves less room for maneuver. That does not mean, however, renouncing declared principles and aims. The methods and forms of implementation may undergo certain changes, but not the content. [passage omitted] [Telen] All the same, let us come back to the referendum question. What is your attitude toward this idea? How realistic is its implementation? And, perhaps the most acute question, what does Crimean independence mean if the question is put to a referendum? [Meshkov] It is as realistic as the implementation of a law on a referendum is realistic. The question of independence is not being posed at the level of independence as separation. It is based on a directly opposite idea--the separation or tendency toward separation of the Ukrainian economy from the Russian economy. We stated quite emphatically right from the outset that this would be ruinous for Ukraine. Reality has more than confirmed even our most gloomy fears. What is now happening to the Ukrainian economy is hard to bear for both the people of Ukraine and the people of Crimea. The question is formulated as follows, however: Are you in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in union with other states? The main point in holding a referendum and implementing its results lies precisely in the words at the end of the question: in union with other states. That is to say, this is our natural and understandable economically-based desire to be united with the economic zone of Russia and the CIS countries and Ukraine too, but on a fundamentally new basis, which takes the interests of the Republic of Crimea into account to a maximum degree. [Skryabin] Thank you, and my colleagues -- and, Yuriy Aleksandrovich, permit me to read out a number of questions, which have come from television viewers and I have put together. [Meshkov] Please do, I am ready. [Skryabin] Georgiy Alekseyevich Tukhmanov from Moscow asks whether you are not worried about finding yourself in the situation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and that that is where it started too -- if Karabakh was given to Azerbaijan in 1921 then the Crimea was given by Khrushchev in 1956. Please respond to this analogy put to you respectfully from the Muscovite Tukhmanov -- this is his question. [Meshkov] Dear Georgiy Alekseyevich, my reply to you will be as follows: Unfortunately, you have been affected by a campaign around Crimea that is on the conscience of certain people working in the media, a campaign to compare the situation in Crimea with the hot spots on the territory of the former USSR. There are no grounds whatsoever for this. Thank God, there are no preconditions whatsoever for even the possibility of such a situation evolving in Crimea. I am sure now, especially now, when the people of Crimea expressed their will unanimously -- you know the figures, of course, what powerful support the first Crimean president and his program received -- this rules out any precondition whatsoever for this inside Crimea. As for outside, there is a danger of some forces outside Crimea imposing some instability on us and making attempts to organize confrontation. But these forces are so insignificant and odious that one is not really seriously afraid of them. So, Georgiy Alekseyevich, you can plan your next vacation in Crimea. I invite you and your family to Crimea which is and will be peaceful, completely peaceful. [Skryabin] That is if you have enough money. [Meshkov] Well, that is another matter. [Skryabin] Yuriy Alekseyevich Tkachenko gives his phone number: How will you form your team? I have experience of high-level work in the state administration, I am a Crimean, I am 42-years-old, and am ready to work with you. So how will you form your team? [Meshkov] I can tell Yuriy Alekseyevich and everyone else that the main criterion of selection is professionalism. My political opponents are stating that the Russia block that I represented in the presidential elections does not have its own team. Now it can be said completely calmly: There is a team. Authoritative experts, well-known in Russia, have agreed to take part in the program of emergence of the economy of the Crimea. And of course, your proposal and the proposals of all those who wish the Crimean Republic well, and who have the forces and intention to carry out their potential in the Crimea, are in the surprising and unique situation now when everyone can give real help and support. We are ready to accept this help and place it in any organization -- the government, administration of the president -- wherever you can show yourself to your maximum. And thank you for your offer. [Telen] Could I continue a bit? You said that talks were already being conducted with some people about joining your team and you said these were well-known names. Could you name them? [Meshkov] You know, I have an urge to present everything literally and share my joy above all with my compatriots in the Crimean Republic and with my compatriots in Russia. But allow me nevertheless, to restrain myself a little. My Moscow program is not yet exhausted and when it is entirely fulfilled I will be able to answer that question. [Simenov] I think our conversation started rather rosily. I hear you saying that the Crimea is so quiet, come and visit us and so on. But surely you have a crime problem that has in fact grown into a problem of terrorism... [Meshkov, interrupting] Politic... [Simenov, continuing]...even political terrorism, and if you will excuse me, even you were hunted by such terrorists. What can you say about this and how do you intend to resolve this problem? [Meshkov] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, the fact is the hunters and the prey have swapped places since 30 January. And there is every reason, and I can with full responsibility assure all Russians, that by the start of the spa season everything in this sense will be quiet. It was not a crime problem. It was not a political terrorism problem. It was a problem of power -- fragile, helpless, incapable of reacting to change in the surrounding situation. They were people who were always placed in the hierarchical pyramid of power where they were sheltered from above and carried out everything from above, taking it down to the lower strata of the pyramid, but who never took and could not take responsibility upon themselves and could not react to change in the surrounding situation. They could not do anything with that avalanche of crime and outburst of political terrorism which yes, unfortunately, did take place in the Crimea. All that will be stopped by the toughest methods, well of course in the framework of... [Simenov, interrupting] They were professionals acting on political orders? [Meshkov] Yes. [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, our paper wrote widely about the murder of Andrey Lazebnikov, the Black Sea Fleet press secretary. Naturally, MOSCOW NEWS readers are interested now in how the investigation of this crime is progressing. It was specifically this murder that was evidence of the terror that existed, as you said, in the Crimea. Could you give a more detailed account of it? [Meshkov] It is premature to give the details because I--restricted by my professional limitations, one could say--cannot talk extensively about an investigation that has not been concluded. This is the more so because the results of an investigation are summed up by the court, as you know. I can say, however, that there is no doubt that it was a political act. There is no doubt that professionals were involved, and attempts were made during the initial stages of the investigation to prevent the officials of the Russian federal services from investigating this case. I can assure you, however, that the presidential administration, and now the state bodies of the republic of Crimea, will give the maximum necessary assistance in investigating, searching for, and punishing the criminals that organized and carried out this act of political terror. [Skryabin] I see, Lyudmila, that you have a large set of questions on the economy. Nonetheless, this set of questions from our television viewers is, evidently, a considerably larger one, as I can show you now. These are questions connected with the problem of the Tatars, the Crimean Tatars. So I will take the liberty of reading out several questions on behalf of the television viewers that I will ask you to answer. Idrisov, from the town of Yevpatoriya: Are you going to apologize to the Crimean Tatars for the ethnic genocide carried out by the hand of Moscow in May 1944, as Mr. Kohl has done to the world concerning the Germans? Do you recognize the right of the Crimean Tatars to self-determination? The Crimea is multinational, like Moscow, Ufa, and Kazan, but each nation has a state, a motherland. For the Crimean Tatars, it is the Crimea. Arkadiy Nikolayevich Semenov asks what your attitude is toward the slogans that can be seen in the Crimea, such as: No to the totalization of the Crimea! Do you not think that this is a fascist slogan? Ernest Kudusov: Does Mr. Meshkov intend to strive to gain the acknowledgement and respect of the indigenous contingent of the Crimean population? It voted against him. If that is his intention, what steps is he going to take? What solution do you envisage for the settlement of the Crimean Tatar problem? Well, there are many other questions. Galina Romanovna Batskevich: What does the Crimean president think about relations with a small, indigenous Crimean people--the Crimean Tatars? Ismet Khalyukovich Sheykh-Zade asks how you envisage relations with the indigenous people? Well, and so on. Is there a program for the return of the Crimean Tatars? There are many, many more questions. [Meshkov] it is an extremely serious question because it touches upon the most painful and sensitive--and widely exploited-- ethnic feelings. I can say to Mr. Idrisov that neither Moscow, nor I, as Crimean president, nor the citizens of the Republic of Crimea have any reasons for apologizing for those illegal measures in which he sees the hand of Moscow. It was not the hand of Moscow, but an absolutely concrete policy of the thing that we call a totalitarian regime. The situation has no comparison with the situation of Mr. Kohl and the German people. The Republic of Crimea is a multinational republic. There is no reason to single out or isolate any ethnic group on any grounds. We would never have achieved peace and accord in the Crimea. We have achieved these, and the president and the state authorities will make every effort to preserve this national peace. The basis for it is an equal attitude toward all the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, without exceptions. There can be no question of us singling out an ethnic group and, moreover, giving it political powers on the grounds of its ethnicity. I have not seen the slogan--No to the Tatarization of the Crimea--in all the time that I have lived in the Crimea on any wall or any poster, and I travel all the time. So let Mr. Semenov have this slogan that he cited on his conscience. As for the claim that the Crimean Tatars unanimously voted against the Russia bloc representative and against me as a candidate for the presidency of the Republic of Crimea, this is an erroneous statement and does not correspond to the facts. Moreover, I can say that numerous branches and groups within the Crimean Tatars' national movement openly proclaimed their support. They were openly saying that they supported my candidacy. At some polling stations, thousands out of a 2,000-strong [figure as heard] electorate, thousands of Crimean Tatars voted for me. This is a problem of relations between the powers that have gone and the bosses of the Crimean national movement and the leadership of the Majles. That is their problem. It is not a problem of relations between the president and the Crimean Tatars, citizens of the republic of Crimea. This is because in the presidential administration--and I can say this--key posts are occupied by Professor Memetov, whom I deeply respect and who is in charge of a very important part of the administration. (Anife Situmer Kyzy Ilyasova) is in one of the key posts. This is normal and should be so, and it is. As to what future decision will be made and whether there is a program, I, in particular, demanded that such a program should be adopted. I demanded that the process of the return of the Crimean Tatars should be based on an officially adopted program. It was not adopted, and with the exception of sops that were even insulting to some extent-- nothing was implemented. I have said before and I can confirm now that the state must compensate for damage it inflicted on its citizens and for the damage it inflicted on the citizens of the Republic of Crimea--on the Crimean Tatar nationality, in particular. This is one of the topics at the talks I am having here in Moscow. I do not know yet. I cannot tell you what the final result will be. I have asked, however, for 50 billion rubles for this program. [Skryabin] Thank you. [Semenov] Lets talk about the economy. One of your slogans during the election campaign was the wish to set up direct economic ties with Russia, to enrich them, and maybe even to join the ruble zone. How do you envisage this? In particular, do you see the ruble as a national monetary unit? And what about the karbovanets? Do you understand what can happen to the Crimean financial market if both currencies are used simultaneously? And, in general, what is the general concept, at least the main points? [Meshkov] I understand, Yuliy Aleksandrovich. I gather from your question that you are more concerned, not with what will happen to the ruble, but with what will happen to the karbovanets? That is nearer the truth. Well, so far they will circulate simultaneously. The Kiev administration and a top official have agreed to the circulation of the ruble in the Crimea. We have drawn up and prepared all that is needed for the implementation of the program for the ruble to be a means of payment in the Crimea. So the preparations can proceed smoothly, and I hope no political intrigues over the Crimea will hinder the restoration of Crimea's economy and the presence of the ruble in our republic. There is already a bank for this presence.... [Semenov, interrupting] I just wanted to ask what are the functions of the bank? [Meshkov, continuing] ... with its definite functions, the function of monitoring money circulation in the Crimea, the function of permission, i.e. the registration of banks of other republics on Crimean territory. With respect to the budget and the taxes, all 100 percent will remain in the Republic of Crimea. Only the joint programs of Ukraine and the Crimea will be financed. Such will be the first steps. [Semenov] That is a precedent. [Meshkov] I hope that this will help to implement the general tendencies that unite the economic space. This will happen inevitably. The Republic of Crimea is marching forward. [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, excuse me, but I do not quite understand the setup for Crimea's entry into the ruble zone, because an accord with Kiev allowing the use of a parallel currency is one thing, while agreement with Russia is something else. After all, Russia is the center issuing the currency, and apparently you are counting on receiving rubles from Russia. [Meshkov] Well, naturally there is nowhere else to get them, but we will not be obtaining them through any issues by the Central Bank of Russia. We will be getting them as a result of normal economic relations--by fulfilling orders, providing services to the Navy, and marketing, say, those material values that will be freed as a result of conversion. This will include the supply of our own goods and our own agricultural produce and also, I hope, a strong influx of tourists and what we call holidaymakers, with their rubles, during the holiday period in Crimea. Indeed, everyone with cash rubles will feel very comfortable since the exchange relationship of the ruble to the coupon is, as you know, approximately at a ratio of one ruble to 30 coupons. That is to say, all of this will help us to tackle this problem without holding out our hand and without sacrificing Russia's good relationship toward Crimea to the need for issuing currency and to a complication of the economic situation in Russia. This is all a chain of actions steadily bringing us back into a unified economic zone without any complication of the situation in Russia and without any conflict situations in Crimea. [Skryabin] Following on from that question, what should come via you? [Meshkov] Since the fleet is situated on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, the financing of the fleet should naturally be via the Republic of Crimea. [passage omitted] I regard it as my primary duty to defend the legal rights and interests of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, and what strength I have will be put into carrying out that defense, above all, in the economic sphere. [passage omitted] [Telen] All the same, let me go back to the ruble zone. Have any, at least preliminary, talks been held with the Russian leadership, with the Russian Government, with the financial circles and the Russian bank on the introduction of the ruble in Crimea? [Meshkov] This program has been talked about with specialists of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Crimea. The specialists have reached agreement and have devised a unified and streamlined program. It will be implemented with the help of Ukrainian specialists and Ukrainian banks and by relying on the Ukrainian economy. Of course, it will be done primarily by relying on Russian banks--by that, I mean commercial banks--and on relations with the Russian economy and Russian specialists. [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I am sorry to be so persistent, but are these specialists or officials? [Meshkov] Lyudmila Olegovna. Until we have finally decided the press release and the communique on the results of the talks, I (?cannot) answer this question. I realize that it worries and concerns you. It worries the citizens of Crimea just as much; however, I can reassure them. The fact is that results have been achieved that exceed the hopes with which I went to Moscow. [passage omitted] [Semenov] How do you see the future of the fleet? And, in your idea of the structure of Crimea, do you think there is a special role or special status for Sevastopol? [passage omitted] [Meshkov] Regarding the problem of the fleet, I was reproached for saying one thing before the election campaign and subsequently making a completely contrary statement. My remarks to the effect that the problem of the fleet had been resolved by the presidents were cited. The problem of the fleet has indeed been resolved by the presidents. I mean the Massandra agreement. However, it has to be implemented. If the principle of international law that treaties should be implemented exists and is recognized by the Ukrainian leadership, then this treaty, this agreement, should be implemented. It envisages a single Russian Black Sea Fleet. This fully reflects the interests of the Republic of Crimea. Our naval seamen--we will not divide them--will have the maximum protection that is provided for citizens of the Republic of Crimea. Regarding the Sevastopol permit system, it is unnatural, abnormal. We will, of course, be removing this abnormality. The issue of dual citizenship is urgent and will be resolved by a law on dual citizenship. This, of course, requires coordination with the Russian Federation. Russia put forward an initiative long ago. The Ukrainian Government has a draft on dual citizenship proposed by Russia, but it has been put on the back burner and has not yet been examined. I think the Republic of Ukraine could resolve the citizenship problem more quickly. [passage omitted] [Telen] Is the Crimean leadership willing to some extent to share the burden of some of these problems with Russia? Does Crimea have the financial resources? [Meshkov] Regarding financial resources, let me say straightaway that it does not. As for sharing the burden of maintaining the Black Sea Fleet, yes, it will. Crimea is as committed as possible to this because the presence of the Black Sea Fleet in the Republic of Crimea is a guarantee, a long-term guarantee, of stability and peace in Crimea. [passage omitted] [Telen] Some of Russia's nationalistic organizations see Crimea as a base for themselves and a chance to apply their forces. How dangerous is Russian nationalism to Crimea? [Meshkov] Fortunately--and thank God that I live in Crimea and that the citizens of our republic also live in Crimea--a thousand years of Crimean history prove that Crimea has never had what is described as interethnic strife. All waves of nationalism, irrespective of where they came from, subsided on approach to Crimea. They found no support here. The nationalistic forces can count on no support at all, or on the support of 3 percent of the people at the most, if the circumstances are extremely favorable. There is no nationalism in Crimea, and there never will be, God forbid. [Skryabin] Can I ask you the last question? It is not a very serious question, but I think it might be of interest to many people. During the August 1991 putsch, you were the first person who tried to get into Gorbachev's dacha. As far as I know, they simply did not let the future Crimean president in. [Meshkov] They even arrested me. [Skryabin] Yes, arrested you. What is happening now to Gorbachev's dacha? Presidents seem to be superstitious, and nobody wants to move in. Nonetheless, something is going to be done with it, right? [Meshkov] Nobody, including me, wants to live in Mikhail Sergeyevich's dacha. I really tried to help him against the will of our Supreme Soviet and its head. Moreover, I even resorted to open insults. I told them: It is your general secretary there, after all. Forget that you are officials and act as communists at least. You must change the situation, and you must help him. Mikhail Sergeyevich was probably aware who did what--when and how. Yes, I was actually arrested during that attempt, but everything turned out all right. The interest in Gorbachev's dacha in Crimea is very great. It should, of course, belong wholly to the Crimean Republic. At present, it is not used for recreational purposes, and no one wants to use it as a holiday place. As for us--I mean the Crimean republic--we should do everything we can to turn it into a site for the general public. Such interest and such attention exist. After all, people should be allowed to see what they want to see. Gorbachev's dacha should be opened to the public, since it is no longer an individual's property but a symbol of the entire period in our history. The Crimea is rich in symbols and monuments, and this one should be added to them. [passage omitted] [Skryabin] A question from Anna Grigoryevna Kulakova. Do you think that the same tactics are used both in Abkhazia and in Crimea-- namely, first to cut off these territories and then hand them over to Russia? [Meshkov] I do not think so. This is not the expansionism and imperial manner of the Russia of the past, but a natural desire of the former regions and the present regions that are detached from the single economic area. This is an economic problem. If this problem is resolved, all political problems will disappear. [passage omitted] I would like to answer a question that you have given to me. [reads questions] Who are you going to be with: Russia, or Ukraine, or on your own? Give a detailed answer, please. The independence of the Crimean republic is a guarantee that we will resolve our economic problems. [Skryabin] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, as we agreed with you, you have one minute left until the end of the program to say what you want. [Meshkov] Esteemed Russians, dear citizens of the Crimean republic. I would like to share with you the feeling of joy that I have experienced during my stay here. I have been given an extremely welcome reception here, and I have experienced an extremely cordial attitude here. I would like to stress that all this will soon be implemented in specific steps in the sphere of culture and in the sphere of strengthening our indissoluble ties. I thank everybody who has been watching the program and also its participants. Thank you. [Skryabin] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, thank you for making time to attend our program. I thank our viewers for their questions. Unfortunately, it was not possible to answer all questions sent to us, but I will hand them over to you, if you do not mind. All the best.
