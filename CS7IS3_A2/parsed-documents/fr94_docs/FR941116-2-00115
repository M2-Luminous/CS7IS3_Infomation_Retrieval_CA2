DATES: The closing date for comments on the petition is December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket number and notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh St., SW, Washington, DC 20590.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I)) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable federal motor vehicles safety standards. Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA published notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then published this decision in the Federal Register . J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;006) has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicles that J.K. believes are substantially similar are the 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars that were manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by their manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars to their U.S. certified counterparts, and found the vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards. J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars, as originally manufactured, conform to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as their U.S. certified counterparts, or are capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars are identical to their U.S. certified counterparts with respect to compliance with standards Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence *␣*␣*, 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems, 106 Brake Hoses, 107 Reflecting Surfaces, 109 New Pneumatic Tires, 112 Headlamp Concealment Devices, 113 Hood Latch Systems, 116 Brake Fluid, 124 Accelerator Control Systems, 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, 202 Head Restraints, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System, 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement, 205 Glazing Materials, 206 Door Locks and Door Retention Components, 207 Seating Systems, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies, 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages, 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps, 216 Roof Crush Resistance, 219 Windshield Zone Intrusion, 301 Fuel Systems, Integrity, and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials .
