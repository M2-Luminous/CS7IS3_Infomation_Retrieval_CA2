FR940921-0-00133 FR940921-0-00016 87. Section 86.1221&hyph;90 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(2) and (b)(3), and adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: §86.1221&hyph;90 Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. * * * * * (a) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon response. (The HFID used with methanol-fueled vehicles shall be operated at 235 ○ # 15 ○F (113 ○ # 8 ○C)). Analyzers used with gasoline-fuel and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel shall be optimized using propane. Analyzers used with natural gas-fuel may be optimized using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon reading. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator. * * * * * (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the analyzer a propane (or methane as appropriate) in air mixture with a propane (or methane as appropriate) concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most common operating range. * * * * * (b) * * * (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in air (or methane in air as appropriate) calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent of each test point shall be used to determine concentration. * * * * * (e) FID response factor to methane. When the FID analyzer to be used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled vehicle hydrocarbon samples has been calibrated using propane, the methane response factor of the analyzer shall be established. To determine the total hydrocarbon FID response to methane, known methane in air concentrations traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall be analyzed by the FID. Several methane concentrations shall be analyzed by the FID in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response to methane is calculated as follows: r CH4 = FIDppm/SAMppm Where: (1) r CH4 = FID response factor to methane. (2) FIDppm = FID reading in ppmC. (3) SAMppm = the known methane concentration in ppmC.
