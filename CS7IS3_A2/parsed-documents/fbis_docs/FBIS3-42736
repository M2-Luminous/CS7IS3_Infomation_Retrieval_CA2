Current statistics, however, do not always reflect precisely the real state of affairs, do not provide the ability to separate the accidental from a pattern. General trends acquire shape only from a distance, and without the knowledge of these trends, it is hard to forecast further changes in the political situation in Ukraine in 1994. It is from this angle that we would like to analyze the dynamics of public opinion regarding power structures, parties, and politicians of Ukraine from January to December of 1993, because the trends revealed in the course of research represent more than historic value today. I. Confidence in Authorities: No Comment Needed No comment is indeed needed, since the trends in changes in the confidence in Ukrainian power structures are quite clear and consistent.

Over the entire year, in the environment of deepening economic crisis, the level of confidence in major institutions of state authority in Ukraine--the president, the Supreme Council, and the government--steadily declined. Only the confidence in the president rose temporarily in September (after he took charge of the government), but not for long. For all practical purposes already in the first half of the year the level of Ukrainian citizens' confidence in the president, the government, and the Supreme Council dropped so low that a referendum on confidence in them would indeed be superfluous. 2. It would be naive to think, however, that new parliamentary and presidential elections would drastically change for the better the problem of confidence in power structures. First, on the local level the degree of confidence in the executive and representative authority is even lower than in the center, and also continues to drop. Which means that a reform of authority will not be accomplished in these elections. Second, research shows that each subsequent government at the time it is elected starts off with a lower credit of confidence than the preceding one. The same will be true with respect to the new parliament and president. In order to raise this level of confidence, a change for the better in the economic situation is needed, which is even less likely in 1994. II. Political Parties: Their Number Keeps Increasing, And They Are Still As Far Removed From the People As Before The number of political parties almost doubled over the course of 1993, to more than 30, but their popularity among the populace remained extremely low. As a year before, half of the populace did not trust any of the parties. The adoption of a majority-based election law exacerbated even more the crisis of the multiparty system in Ukraine and the split of the populace along political and party lines. Thus, a vicious circle has formed: Without multiparty elections, parties will remain discussion clubs, but without a politically structured society, multiparty elections will turn into (as happened in Russia) a dangerous game with unpredictable consequences. That is why it is very difficult to analyze the trends in the changing popularity of parties in 1993. And although the popularity of the parties of national-democratic orientation (Rukh, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party) lately increased and they are faring much better than both left-wing parties (the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Labor Party) and the parties of liberal-social-democratic orientation, nevertheless, even on the threshold of new elections this does not tell us much. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dynamics of Electoral Preferences of the Ukrainian Populace Regarding Politi-| |cal Parties and Movements (%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parties and movements fo-|May-June 1993 |October-November 1993 | |r which respondents woul-| | | |d vote in the elections | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |People's Rukh of Ukraine |7.5 |8.4 | |(NRU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Democratic Party of |5.6 |14.3 | |Ukraine (DemPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Communist Party of U-|4.5 |4.1 | |kraine (KPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Greens Party (PZU) |4.3 |4.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukrainian Republican Par-|1.8 |3.2 | |ty (URP) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Socialist Party of U-|1.1 |1.9 | |kraine (SPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Ukrainian Labor Part-|no data |1.9 | |y (UPT) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Ukrainian Peasant-De-|1.6 |1.7 | |mocratic Party (UKDP) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The People's Party of Uk-|2.4 |no data | |raine (NPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Party of Democratic |2.5 |1.4 | |Rebirth of Ukraine (PDVU)| | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Social Democratic Pa-|1.4 |0.5 | |rty of Ukraine (SDPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Party of Order and J-|2.7 |no data | |ustice | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Ukrainian Party of B-|no data |1.5 | |eer Lovers (UPLP) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Christian Democratic |no data |1.4 | |Party of Ukraine (KhDPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Liberal Party of Ukr-|no data |0.5 | |aine (LPU) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukrainian National Assem-|0.2 |1.8 | |bly (UNA-UNSO) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other parties |5.9 |4.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |34.1 |26.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Will not participate in |28.7 |22.8 | |elections | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Data of sociological surveys by the Institute of Sociology of the Ukrainian | |Academy of Sciences and Democratic Initiative center) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First, a majority-based system will be used in the elections; in this arrangement, a candidate's personal popularity--especially in villages and small towns--means more than his party affiliation. Second, a considerable number of supporters of the Democratic Party and the Greens Party represents more likely a positive response to the ideas of democratism and protection of the environment (that is, a party's pretty name) than to a particular party with its particular leaders. Third, the process of forming political blocs has begun, which may change substantially the political situation on the threshold of the elections. For instance, a December poll of Kievans conducted by the Ukraine Sociology Service [as rendered] showed that the creation of the Kuchma-Grinev Inter-regional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] by itself already has changed substantially Kievans' electoral attitudes. While a month ago Kievans preferred Rukh (10 percent), the DemPU (4 percent), New Ukraine (4 percent), the KPU and SPU (4 percent), in December 17 percent intended to vote for the MBR (or, to be precise, for Kuchma and Grinev), 15 percent--for Rukh, 6 percent--for the KPU and SPU, and 6 percent--for the DemPU. Still, it is clear that given our patriarchal-authoritarian mentality, it is political leaders rather than blocs and parties that will determine the results of parliamentary and presidential elections. Dynamics of Political Leaders' Ratings: No Surprises There were no substantive changes with respect to the popularity of the leading figures on the political Olympus of the Ukrainian leadership in 1993. The main trend of the year is the struggle for the top spot in popularity ratings between Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma. Having burst into the Ukrainian political elite at the end of 1992, Leonid Kuchma quickly became not only one of the top five leaders in terms of popularity, but also surpassed the indisputable leader of the 1991-1992 seasons--the president--in the spring. And although the Kuchma government eventually achieved nothing with respect to reform and stabilization of the economy, this did not hurt Leonid Danylovych's image. As research shows, the prime minister's lead in June-July 1993 became a real threat. Having "swallowed" Leonid Kuchma, the president regained leadership in September, but the former prime minister's latest steps show that he has not yet exhausted his potential. Quite likely, the competition for the president's job in the summer will center on these two figures. Right now there is little likelihood that Ivan Plyushch, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, and Igor Yukhnovskyy, let alone Vladimir Grinev, Kostyantyn Morozov, and other politicians, will be able to get in. As 1993 showed, ratings do not change very quickly, and therefore even with the remaining half a year it is almost impossible even for these politicians to pull enough percentage points away from Kravchuk or Kuchma. If the MBR nominates as its presidential candidate Grinev instead of Kuchma, it would be naive to hope that the former prime minister will be able to convince his supporters to vote for the former deputy speaker--most likely his electorate will swing to Kravchuk, Plyushch, and other representatives of the "power party."

Even the share of those who named him as the politician of the year has not changed, although in terms of ratings the president more than once lost the lead to the prime minister. We, of course, congratulate both Leonid Makarovych and all of us on the occasion. Because in the environment of continuing economic collapse, hyperinflation, and impoverishment of the citizens, few politicians in the world could hope for such support. Either we have a different political mentality, or there are just too few politicians known to the people.... It is enough to look at the top eight politicians of the year to confirm that they are all familiar faces. The only difference perhaps is that former Prime Minister Vitold Fokin has disappeared into oblivion, and the only discovery of the year was--by now also former--Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk, who placed sixth in the poll. The year of 1994 is not only a Year of Blue Dog--it is also a year of parliamentary and presidential elections. And most likely we will be electing new leaders from the old deck. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |For Whom Will the Citizens of Ukraine Vote in the Presidential Elections (in | |%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Potential candidate |January 1993 |December 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Leonid Kravchuk |15.3 |16.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Leonid Kuchma |5.8 |16.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vyacheslav Chornovil |7.0 |9.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Grinev |2.8 |4.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ivan Plyushch |1.0 |3.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Igor Yukhnovskyy |1.7 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Levko Lukyanenko |1.5 |2.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Data of sociological surveys conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the | |Ukrainian Academy of Sciences [January] and Sotsis-Gallup joint enterprise [-| |December].) | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
