The sources said: Such an agreement between China and North Korea was discussed between the key leaders of the North Korean party and government, who visited China in early June, and the relevant high-level officials of the Chinese party and Army. As a result, a final agreement was reached during the visit by Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, to China on 7 June. Prior to these remarks, a military source in Hong Kong once said that according to the China-North Korea Friendly Treaty signed in 1961, China has formulated plans to support North Korea by sending ground troops between 50,000 and 75,000 soldiers -- who belong to the three divisions of the 39th Shenyang Military District Army stationed in Dalian -- as well as approximately 10,000 rapid deployment troops [sinsok paechigun] of the Jinan Military District to the latter. The source said, however, that China will send its troops to North Korea only if North Korea is cornered as a result of an invasion by the United States and South Korea, and that if North Korea invades South Korea, China will not directly provide military support to North Korea, except for spare parts or ammunition for the Chinese-made weapons North Korea currently possesses. The sources said: Prior to the China visit by Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, North Korea had sent over 10 high-level leaders from each ministry -- such as the Workers Party of Korea, the Army, the Ministry of People's Armed Forces, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Metal Industry -- to Beijing to discuss the issues -- such as China's participation in a war if it breaks out on the Korean peninsula, as well as its economic support for North Korea if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions on North Korea -- with the relevant Chinese authorities, including leaders of the Communist Party of China and its People's Liberation Army. In return for China's support for North Korea, North Korea has proposed that it will grant China the right to use the ports in the East Sea areas, and that it will provide materials such as nonferrous metals and cement to China. They also said: Kim Kyong-hui, younger sister of Kim Chong-il, a director of the Light Industrial Department of the Workers Party of Korea, visited Beijing in late May to hold working-level meetings with the Chinese side in order to discuss its economic support for North Korea. She is expected to return home around 13 June.
