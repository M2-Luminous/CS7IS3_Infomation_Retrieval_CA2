[Makki] Actually, the assassination of six leaders of the Fatah Hawks in Jabalya -- and I mean assassination -- was deliberate while peace talks were in progress yesterday to resume Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. This caused a very severe shock in Gaza. The Gaza Strip is in a very sad and volatile situation. The streets are volatile and the people's feelings are inflamed. People are upset because of the loss of good young men who were assassinated without warning and without any resistance on their part. They were not going to war but to attend a ceremony when they were assassinated by special forces or Israeli military units.... [Al-Jundi, interrupting] Israel's justification that the Israeli (?forces) thought they were members of Hamas is unacceptable. We would like to note here that there is no difference between the Hamas Movement and the Fatah Movement, as both are Palestinian movements. [Makki] This is certain. As for us, we do not distinguish at all between all the Palestinian movements. Today we are speaking about peace, but how can we speak about peace while these youths are being killed by those who say that they are negotiating with parties belonging to Fatah? The death of these youths caused severe agitation among the public and general resentment in the strip. Furthermore, the Strip is under a security siege and in a bad economic situation and people view peace as an Israel trick on the Palestinians. One hand negotiates and the other kills the Palestinian people. [words indistinct] and this is totally unacceptable. [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the current deterioration of the situation in the occupied Arab territories is a natural result of the delay in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord? [Makki] We have repeatedly said that the continued occupation of Palestinian land in Gaza, the West Bank, and Hebron is a source of friction and agitation. The Israelis must now withdraw immediately, leave the Palestinians to handle their own affairs, and allow the Palestinian police to enter the West Bank and Gaza. These malicious settlers who do not understand any human ethics and relationships also must not remain among us in Gaza, Hebron, or elsewhere because they represent time bombs in the West Bank and Gaza, causing friction, disturbances, and problems between the Palestinians and Israelis. If a genuine peace is sought, I believe that the settlements--and this fact has been proved--cannot exist under a real peace between the Arabs and Israelis. [Al-Jundi] What do you think about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's previous statements that he is not willing to evacuate the Jewish settlers from the Palestinian city of Hebron? [Makki] We tell all the Israelis: If you truly seek peace and not world publicity -- they gained a great deal in the peace process [sentence incomplete as heard]. We say to Mr. Rabin that if he sought a genuine peace, Rabin had the opportunity to remove these settlers after what they did in the Hebron massacre, which is a disgusting act for anyone. [Al-Jundi] Can we say that there can be no peace in the occupied lands as long as there are settlements, which are time bombs? [Makki] Most certainly, if these settlements remain on Palestinian land the word peace will be meaningless. I know these settlers well. They are charged and hateful. They hate every Arab, every Muslim, and all Palestinians, and they are armed. Hence, we believe that to achieve a genuine peace surgery should be performed to remove all factors that hamper the process. I believe that the most important thing is for the settlements to be removed immediately and for Israel to implement the peace agreement by withdrawing its forces. Of course, we seek peace from the bottom of our hearts and this makes us wonder how can we face the public. The Palestinian people are very aware. We talk with them [the Israelis] openly and sit with them in Taba, Cairo, Madrid, Washington, and New York while our people are being killed everywhere. What happened in Gaza today is considered a massacre, a slaughter. The Hebron killings happened inside the mosque, but scores were also killed outside the mosque. This confirms that there are instructions issued to these military forces to immediately kill anyone carrying a stone, wearing a mask, or belonging to this or that organization.
