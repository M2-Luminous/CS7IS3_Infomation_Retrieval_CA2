This was stressed by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, during his recent inspection tour of Hulun Buir League. From 18 to 21 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region, led responsible persons of departments concerned to make a four-day inspection tour of Hulun Buir League. During the tour, they inspected some shareholding cooperative enterprises and township enterprises in Hailar city and Chen Barag Banner, visited some households specializing in breeding milk cows and some enterprises and households with difficulties, listened to the reports on the situation of Manzhouli city and Ergun Banner in foreign economic relations and trade, and had talks with responsible comrades of Daxinganling Forestry Administration, Yimin Coal and Electricity Corporation, Hailar Farm and Herd Farm Administration, and Zalantun Pulp Mill. Comrade Wang Qun spoke highly of the achievements scored by Hulun Buir League Experimental Zone over the past six years and fully affirmed the methods of Hailar city and Zalantun city in transforming the operational mechanism of enterprises and invigorating the management of enterprises. On 19 January, Wang Qun, Zhou Weide, and other leading comrades travelled, in spite of the piercing wind and the bitter cold with a temperature of minus 30 degrees centigrade, to the Tuanjie village in suburban Hailar city, where they visited Zhang Shengxiang and Sha Yanju, who specialize in breeding milk cows. Then, these leaders made a journey of more than 100 li to Bayi gacha in Baorixile town in Chen Barag Banner to investigate and learn about the situation of the village specializing in breeding cattle. At the house of Zhang Shengxiang, a household specializing in breeding milk cows, Comrade Wang Qun entered the cow shed and the ensiling cellar and talked with Zhang Shengxiang to learn about cow breeding and the management situation. Comrade Wang Qun said to Zhang Shengxiang: You should break with the traditional breeding methods left over by our ancestors, engage in modernized and scientific breeding, make more investment, seek high output, and increase economic returns in order to take the lead in becoming prosperous. After hearing the report on animal husbandry production of Chen Barag Banner, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play to the advantages of animal husbandry, combine agriculture with animal husbandry, combine the cropping trade with the breeding trade, expand the scale, accelerate the growth of animals, increase economic returns, and accelerate the development of the commodity economy. After hearing the reports on the opening up of border areas and on the foreign economic relations and trade of Manzhouli city and Ergun Banner, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Border trade is boundless and should develop in depth and toward a high level. Border trade should aim at conducting economic and technological cooperation to link itself with the international market as quickly as possible. He said: We should pay attention to studying the changes in the international market, gain the initiative on the international market, and know how to deal with changes in view of the objective situation. We should take the road of integration, engage in import and development, expand the scope of foreign economic relations and trade, and extend ourselves to Northeast Asia in the east and to Western Europe in the West. He demanded that Hulun Buir League should record in 1994 a big breakthrough in developing foreign trade, particularly in organizing economic and technological cooperation, and should establish a number of economic cooperation projects with foreign countries to bring along the development of foreign economic relations and trade in the entire region, border areas in particular. In Zalantun city, Comrade Wang Qun talked with directors of a plywood plant, a starch plant, a pulp mill, and a silk factory. Comrade Wang Qun stressed: To transform the mechanism of enterprises and invigorate enterprises, the key lies in leadership. Leaders should enhance their sense of reform and understand that reform is the only way out and refusing to carry out reform will inevitably lead to ruin. Leaders should emancipate the mind to seek truth from facts and should rely on the initiative of the vast numbers of workers and staff to seek the operation and management methods that are commensurate with the development of enterprises. At the same time, attention should be paid to comprehensive coordination. On the afternoon of 20 January, after hearing the work reports by the party committee and the administrative office of Hulun Buir League, Comrade Wang Qun emphatically dwelt on the following five opinions. First, we should conscientiously review and summarize the experiences gained by the Hulun Buir League Experimental Zone over the past six years, affirm achievements, find out where we lag behind, and continue to pioneer the road of advance. He said: The Hulun Buir League Experimental Zone has scored remarkable achievements in construction and recorded quadrupling growth in many fields, and the people there have really benefited and tempered from the experiments with reform. The valuable experience of this experimental zone is exactly the emancipation of mind and the boldness in trying something new and going ahead. Whether we can effect constant development depends chiefly on the emancipation of mind and on the boldness in trying something new. The achievements of the zone have been scored through the emancipation of the mind and from the pioneering work. Second, now we are confronted with the period of breaking a new path and with the opportunity of rapid growth. We must seize this opportunity to pioneer the road of advance and work hard in unity to make the economic development of Hulun Buir League march at the head of the entire region. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: Currently, we are confronted with many new circumstances, new problems, and new difficulties. If we refuse to make progress through hard work, we will lose the initiative in breaking the new path. He said: Breaking the new path is like a boat sailing against the current that must forge ahead, or it will be driven back. It will not do to pace up and down and to be muddled all day long. Hulun Buir League should seize and cherish this opportunity to make best possible use of its own advantages. Third, we should carry out reform and experiments by leaps and bounds with a view to pressing forward the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, foreign economic relations and trade, township and town enterprises, nonpublicly owned enterprises, and large and medium-sized enterprises. Fourth, we should transfer part of the cadres of party and government organizations who have good professional quality and are good at management to the first lines of production and construction to strengthen the capacity of first lines, foreign economic relations and trade units, township enterprises, and comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry service trades so that they can keep pace with the development of productive forces. Such cadres should not be left unused at the organizations to waste their abilities. Such cadres should be encouraged to become better-off first. At the same time, the strengthening of the grass-roots units should be integrated with organizational restructuring in order to actually streamline the overstaffed organizations and help overcome bureaucratism and improve work efficiency. Fifth, we should strengthen leadership and combine political work with reform and opening up by persisting in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands. We should strengthen the unity in all fields, seek unity of thinking and action, and provide an effective ideological and political guarantee for accelerating reform and opening up.
