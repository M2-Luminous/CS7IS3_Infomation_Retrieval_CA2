FR940527-1-00080 FR940527-1-00014 Example: A hospital with a cost reporting period beginning July 1 qualified as a referral center effective July 1, 1992. The hospital has fewer than 275 beds. Its 3-year status as a referral center is protected through June 30, 1995 (the end of its cost reporting period beginning July 1, 1994). To determine if the hospital should retain its status as a referral center for an additional 3-year period, we will review its compliance with the applicable criteria for its cost reporting periods beginning July 1, 1992, July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1994. The hospital must meet the criteria in effect either for its cost reporting period beginning July 1, 1995, or for two out of the three past periods. For example, to be found to have met the criteria at §412.96(c) for its cost reporting period beginning July 1, 1993, the hospital's case-mix index value during FY 1991 must have equaled or exceeded the lower of the national or the appropriate regional standard as published in the September 1, 1992 final rule. The hospital's total number of discharges during its cost reporting year beginning July 1, 1991, must have equaled or exceeded 5,000 or the regional standard as published in the September 1, 1992 final rule. For those hospitals that seek to retain referral center status by meeting the criteria of §412.96(b)(1)(i) and (ii) (that is, rural location and at least 275 beds), we will look at the number of beds shown for indirect medical education purposes (as defined at §412.105(b)) on the hospital's cost report for the appropriate year. We will consider only full cost reporting periods when determining a hospital's status under §412.96(b)(1)(ii). This definition varies from the number of beds criterion used to determine a hospital's initial status as a referral center because we believe it is important for a hospital to demonstrate that it has maintained at least 275 beds throughout its entire cost reporting period, not just for a particular portion of the year. F. Determination of Number of Beds in Determining the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment (§412.105) Section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act provides that prospective payment hospitals that have residents in an approved graduate medical education program receive an additional payment to reflect the higher indirect operating costs associated with graduate medical education. The regulations regarding the calculation of this additional payment, known as the indirect medical education (IME) adjustment, are at §412.105. The additional payment is calculated by multiplying a hospital's DRG revenue (including outlier payments) by the applicable IME adjustment factor. The adjustment factor is calculated by using a hospital's ratio of residents-to-beds in the formula set forth at section 1886(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act. Section 412.105(b) states that the number of beds used in the resident-to-bed ratio is calculated by dividing the number of days during the cost reporting period into ``the number of available bed days during the cost reporting period, not including beds assigned to newborns, custodial care, and excluded distinct part hospital units *␣*␣*.'' Since we added this language to the regulations in the September 3, 1985 final rule (50 FR 35679 and 35690), there has been some confusion over whether this definition includes or excludes bed days attributable to neonatal intensive care units. This confusion has resulted in some hospitals contesting their fiscal intermediaries' inclusion of intensive care neonatal intensive care beds in the hospitals' count of available beds. Prior to the adoption of §412.105(b), the definition of available beds was at section 2510.5A of the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 1, which was originally used to establish bed-size categories for purposes of applying the cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act. That definition excluded newborn beds but specifically included beds in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other special care inpatient hospital units. This exclusion of newborn beds was consistent with the exclusion of newborn days and costs from the determination of Medicare's share of allowable routine service costs (see section 2202.11B of the Manual). If a neonatal unit qualifies as an intensive care unit, however, the costs of that unit are included in determining Medicare's costs (see section 2202.7.II.B of the Manual). Correspondingly, the days in a neonatal unit that qualifies as an intensive care unit are counted as intensive care type days rather than nursery days (see section 2202.7.II.A of the Manual). Finally, section 2510.5A of the Manual clearly indicates that intensive care unit beds and special care unit beds are included in a hospital's bed complement. In the September 3, 1985 final rule, we added the definition of available beds to the regulations governing the IME adjustment (then §412.118(b)). The expressed purpose for the change was to stop counting beds ``based upon the total number of beds available on the first day of the pertinent cost reporting period'' and to begin counting based on ``the number of available bed days (excluding beds assigned to newborns, custodial beds, and beds in excluded units) during the current cost reporting period divided by the number of days in the cost reporting period'' (50 FR 35679). We did not change the definition of available beds. Our current position regarding the treatment of these beds is unchanged from the time when the cost limits established under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act were in effect and is consistent with the way we treat beds in other hospital areas. That is, if the bed days and costs are allowable in the calculation of Medicare's share of inpatient costs, the beds within that unit are included as well. Some hospitals have asserted that when we excluded beds assigned to newborns, we changed our treatment of neonatal intensive care unit beds. However, we note that the term ``newborn'' has historically been used synonymously with nursery. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this is the definition of a ``newborn inpatient day'' as a day that ``an infant occupies a newborn bed in the nursery'' (see section 2815 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 2.) This definition dates back at least to 1975. If §412.105(b) was indeed meant to change our established policy, we would have referenced that intent at the time. This would have been necessary since neonatal intensive care costs and days were still included in the calculation of Medicare's costs. Finally, in August 1988, we issued Provider Reimbursement Manual Transmittal No. 345, revising section 2405.3G of the Manual, which provides implementing instructions for the IME adjustment. As part of this revision, the definition of the number of beds was clarified to specifically exclude beds ``*␣*␣* assigned to newborns which are not in intensive care areas *␣*␣*.'' Those arguing that §412.105(b) excludes neonatal intensive care unit beds from the hospital bed count also argue that this Manual issuance is contradictory to the regulations. In order to clarify our policy, we are proposing to revise the regulations at §412.105(b) to exclude specifically only beds assigned to newborns in the nursery. Thus, neonatal intensive care beds would not be excluded from the bed count. We would like to stress that this does not represent a policy change in our bed counting rules, but rather a reaffirmation of our longstanding position. Revising the wording of the regulations should alleviate any future misunderstandings, as well as clarify our position regarding previous application of this policy, both before and since the original publication of our bed counting regulations now specified at §412.105(b). We are also proposing to make a technical change to §412.105(d)(1) to correct a reference.
