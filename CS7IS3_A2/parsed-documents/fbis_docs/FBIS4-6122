Zieleniec, who is accompanied by more than twenty Czech entrepreneurs and businessmen, will also attend economic seminars in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The seminars are meant to acquaint Vietnamese partners with the economic changes and business conditions in the Czech Republic. "I consider Vietnam the main goal of my Asia tour," Zieleniec, who is also to visit Malaysia and Australia, told journalists. He said that Vietnam had been coming through an important stage in its development and besides, it has been ever more actively participating in the developments of the Asian region which is intensively developing. Vietnam cannot be regarded in isolation but as the region of operation of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which has a future, Zieleniec said. He said that for a centrally managed economy, as the Vietnamese one, it is important to establish contacts on the government, official level, adding that it could be proceeded from the traditional economic relations between Vietnam and the Czech Republic. For Vietnam the Czech Republic represents a sort of transfer to Western technoloogy. The changes which have occured in the Czech Republic since the November 1989 revolution were the reason why countries with a centrally planned economy made the Czech economic situation difficult to understand, Zieleniec said, adding that it was important that his presence demonstrate to Hanoi the Czech Republic's interest in cooperation. Asked about the Czech government pro-export policy and of how the government sought to facilitate Czech firms' entrance into foreign markets, Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic did not have a tradition of managing all the economy by the state. Nevertheless the Czech government supported exports with such measures as, for example, his current visit, Zieleniec added. On the problem of unsettled Czech claims in Vietnam Zieleniec said that they would be discussed but stressed the need for "balance." He said that unsettled debts sometimes prevented further cooperation the profit from which would have been bigger than the very debts.
