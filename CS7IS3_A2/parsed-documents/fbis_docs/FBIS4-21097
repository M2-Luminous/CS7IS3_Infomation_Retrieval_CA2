On 12 January, three people, a member of the Zhujie Township, Changning County joint defense force; a leading comrade from Yangjie Village; and a village forest protector, went up the mountain on forest protection. At 6:30 p.m., while walking at the foot of Jinjia, Yangjie Village, they saw two middle-aged men coming at them from a distance. One man carrying a two-shoulder backpack was walking in the front and one man carrying two bulging woven plastic bags was walking in back peering around flustered. Our three people were suddenly suspicious. Waiting for the three suspects to approach, our three people, carrying pistols and assault rifles, came forward to interrogate them. The two people appeared more flustered and hemmed and hawed. As the member of the joint force was preparing to search the two woven plastic bags, the middle-aged man with the backpack suddenly pulled a hand grenade from his waist and wildly smashed into the body of the member of the joint force, and after throwing the hand grenade at his body, rolled on the ground. Seeing the smoking hand grenade, our three people quickly fell back on the ground and the instant that the hand grenade exploded, the two suspects jumped into a ditch overgrown with foliage and fled. After the sound of the explosion had passed, our people quickly followed in the direction of the fleeing suspects and discovered that one suspect had already run to a hill 80 meters away and the other had vanished without a trace. One after the other, they lifted their rifles and fired and then and there they shot one of the suspects and confiscated 17.93 kilograms of heroin. Our people arrested the drug dealer and took him to the village public security station and immediately reported to the county and the township. The township party secretary and the county public security bureau leader one after another led cadres and police to the scene and conducted a detailed reconnaissance of the scene. It was determined that the wounded drug dealer was Li Laoqi [2621 5071 0003] from Guogang [2654 2413] in Burma. Presently, Changning County public security organizations are organizing police forces to apprehend the escapee and are trying the case.
