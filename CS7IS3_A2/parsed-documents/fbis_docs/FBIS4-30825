How successful has the Czech Republic been in preserving its good reputation now, when the attention of the United States in Europe is focused more on the southeast and east? [Zantovsky] Political and economic respect cannot be measured by the number of newspaper headlines or public statements. Serious international problems and crises attract most of the attention, but our country has been spared them, fortunately. The continuing political respect -- which was best expressed by President Clinton's visit to Prague in January this year -- as well as the continuing economic interest -- documented by that fact that more than half of all foreign investments in the Czech economy in 1993 came precisely from the United States -- show that our mutual relations have maintained a constantly high level, which is without precedent in our modern history. The Czech Republic has the reputation of being a stable, reliable, and economically very promising partner. The United States is still interested in our market, access to our market, and investments. A mission from the government agency for foreign private investments, OPIC, will arrive in Prague in June, bringing with it several dozen interested American entrepreneurs. We only have to look at the activity of the U.S. Embassy commercial section, foreign services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic, to see that the United States does not underestimate its access to our market. [Subrtova] There is no doubt about the fact that President Bill Clinton's visit to Prague in January was important for American-Czech relations. Is there any specific evidence yet that the impetus that this visit could, and should have brought for the development of relations between our two countries in the political, cultural, and, particularly, the economic sphere is being implemented? [Zantovsky] The start of the Partnership For Peace project -- which all the participating countries in the Prague summit and a number of other countries have joined -- was the main result of President Clinton's visit to Prague. Now, the program is in the stage of preparation, while presentation documents are being handed over. These documents will determine the specific modalities of the participation of individual countries. It is important that we have succeeded, for the time being, in preserving the principle of the equality of all countries participating in the program. By granting special status to any country, the program would be downgraded. The conference in the fall on free trade between the United States and the countries of central and Eastern Europe will be the result of the impetus in the economic sphere. In this connection, we can observe a revival of American interest in the idea of a free trade zone between the United States and the CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] countries. I believe our American partners will be able to prepare a program for the conference that could result in a larger opening of the market to our products and build on the steps that the U.S. Government took at the beginning of the nineties. The Czech Republic may have acquired a permanent most-favored-nation clause, but there are still quantity restrictions on some of our commodities, for instance, in the form of quotas on the import of our cheese or textiles. One of the positive steps could be the preservation, or even a further extension of the system of customs preferences for our products. [Subrtova] Today, Czech diplomatic missions in the world largely supplant the role of commercial and economic "reconnaissance" [vysadek]. What is the activity of the embassy whose head you are? [Zantovsky] Along with the center of the Czech Republic's economic activity being transferred to the sphere of private enterprise, the role of embassies in this sphere is also being changed. We see our role particularly in transmitting high quality economic and commercial information in both directions, and in promoting the potential of our economy and our economic results, not only in Washington, but all over the United States' territory. [Subrtova] What problems are you encountering in this activity, and what success, if any, have you achieved? How could our domestic (Czech) economic sphere help you in this respect? Moreover, what can you offer, or what advice can you give to our businessmen, bankers, and entrepreneurs? [Zantovsky] I dare hope that we, too, deserve some credit for the continuing interest of American businesses in investing in the Czech Republic, and for the successful course of negotiations on certain larger-scale economic projects. We are paying primary attention to the economic sphere. Our monthly bulletin, CZECH THE NEWS, which is now in the second year of publication, also plays a positive role in that respect. Since January 1994, our bulletin has been available also in electronic form on the Internet network. We organize a number of events, lectures, and seminars regarding these problems. At present, we are preparing a lecture on privatization to be delivered by R. Sabela, deputy minister of industry and trade, a seminar with our representatives in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and we are cooperating in the preparation of a seminar on the development of tourism in the Czech Republic, in which Economy Minister K. Dyba should participate. We would also welcome it if we managed to organize this year a publicity trip for Minister of Industry and Trade Dlouhy to several places in the United States, a trip that would focus on business and investments, like the one to Canada recently. America is not just Washington and New York; it is also the midwest, Texas, California, and other states. In all those places there are potential opportunities for expanding our economic relations. Whenever possible, I try to help develop these relations when personally visiting various regions in the United States. In comparison with some comparable European countries, we feel that the presence of the Czech Republic should be stronger on such a large market as the American one. It would help us very much if the concept for the pro-export policy were completed and included provisions for providing company service, searching for partners, and furnishing information on their credibility, etc. Our representative office should not engage in this activity, but other entities should, such as the Economic Chamber or the Association of Industry. The Association of Industry should set up UNIDO offices, where Czech investment specialists are active, also in Washington, apart from Europe and Tokyo. A possibility has arisen to open a CZECHINVEST branch in California. It would be very beneficial if a Czech tourist center could be independently active here. I believe it is important for the further development of economic activity also to expand -- following the example of other countries -- our diplomatic presence on the territory of such a vast country as the United States. The opening of the Consulate General in Los Angeles, which is being prepared, and our efforts to establish honorary consulates in a number of the states are related to this. The forthcoming opening of the Czech Center in New York plays an important role here. Our national agencies and businesses help us most by providing us with high quality information on the macroeconomic situation, and also on entrepreneurial and business opportunities on the microeconomic level. We would like to receive more information and more often. Regarding providing advice, I will be more cautious. It is easy to give advice where other peoples' money is involved. If I may give advice, then I would say that it is very important to adopt in business and other negotiations something that they call here "follow through" [previous two words published in English], which means, approximately, "carry matters to completion." This is commonplace here. Any letter or fax, or telephone call that is not answered for a long time, reduces the probability of a successful result. It is equally important to remember that in American business ethics an oral agreement has practically the same weight as a written one, and is considered binding by both parties. I dare say that, if local demands on speed, promptness, and meeting obligations are met, Americans are the most reliable partners in the world. Independence and initiative are additional prerequisites for a business success in the United States. Sometimes, I have the feeling that it is the absence of these qualities that prevents us from making better use of the great prospects in the sphere of small and medium-size enterprises. A number of U.S. manufacturers would be interested in manufacturing their products, or parts of them, with incomparably lower costs in our country and would welcome offers from our side. Within our possibilities, we try to transmit even this information. However, this is a task, above all, for non- government economic and commercial representative offices. [Subrtova] What is your personal experience regarding the possibility of equitable cooperation between a small Central European country and the only world superpower today? [Zantovsky] I, myself, am of small stature, but I have never had difficulty in cooperating with people who are 15 inches taller. In cooperation between two countries, size is not of primary importance, either. The important thing is whether one country has something to offer the other. We have so much to offer that, despite all the work I have to do, I can still find moments in which I can be proud of being a Czech.
