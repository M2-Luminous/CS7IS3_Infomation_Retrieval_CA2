In his words, "if the situation is further destabilized in the Crimea, the Ukrainian authorities will do their best to have the Constitution of Ukraine respected and observed in the Crimea." Mikhalchenko emphasized his absolute confidence that the new Ukrainian parliament will confirm the views of the previous one on the Crimea. He said that certain people in the Crimea had for months been trying to provoke a deterioration of Russo-Ukrainian relations. Mikhalchenko emphasized that Ukraine had on every occasion responded to specific violations of the Constitution and the law, "never precipitating the events. Kiev has done nothing that can be described as extremist or provocative." He asked, "How can the Crimea be allowed to do what its authorities want while the Crimean president teaches contempt of legality to his citizens?"
