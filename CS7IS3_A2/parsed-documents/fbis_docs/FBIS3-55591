The statement was prompted by some actions and pronouncements of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party which has the largest single faction in Russia's new parliament. According to Yegor Gaydar, these prononcements and calls fall clearly within the scope of those articles in the criminal code of the Russian Federation which outlaw the propaganda of war. "We will raise a question about due legal assessment of violations of this ban," Gaydar said. He was evidently referring to Zhirinovskiy's threats to Germany, Europe and NATO, and Gaydar's Deputy Boris Zolotukhin said a call for war was unmistakable in Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last Push to the South". According to Gaydar, Russia's Choice reached an agreement about solidary voting of 94 faction members in the parliament, whenever a decision on such voting is adopted by a two-third majority of faction members. As concerns interfaction cooperation, Russia's Choice tends to interact with all factions in the State Duma's bodies, but "is unable to collude with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Communists and Agrarians against other parties". Gaydar expressed apprehension that these factions may seek to "usurp control over the key committees and commissions of the State Duma, in particular, over the commission in charge of defence and international relations." As concerns the constructive programme of Russia's Choice, the faction has prepared a package of initiatives in the field of social and economic policy, including initiatives in the housing sphere. The new parliament's law-making activity should focus on this key issue of the development of society, Gaydar said. He added that his faction has worked out proposals for legal and economic guarantees of the freedom of the press. The faction Secretary Sergey Yushenkov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that the faction fully supports the journalists' demand that the government resolution be repealed before the prices of periodicals increase six-fold. As concerns relations between faction and the government, Gaydar distanced himself from the cabinet decisions which stipulated the expansion of subsidies to enterprises in 1993, and led to the increasing budget deficit and unjustified procurement of farming produce, all of which resulted in a financial crisis of the state. Russia's Choice is planning to support in parliament those members of the government who share the faction's objectives. Gaydar said he has come to realize the need to establish a single party of liberal reforms to coordinate the activity of all democratic forces in Russia.
