Both sides are striving toward this," General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army General Staff has told a PAP correspondent after talks at the Bonn Defense Ministry. On day one of a three-day visit, Gen. Wilecki had talks with his host, Gen. Klaus Naumann, inspector general of the Bundeswehr, about joint undertakings by the two Armies and about Partnership for Peace. They agreed on closer contacts between the staffs of the Polish Army and the Bundeswehr; between military districts, our Pomeranian and Silesian, and their counterparts across the Odra; and between the Navies. Cross-border cooperation will be continued. According to the generals, some units could establish twin partnerships and, bewteen them, exchange training experiences. An agreement will be signed in the near future to provide formal permission to commanding personnel and servicemen's communities. This would apply to several land and Naval units, especially those stationed close to one another in the border zone. Twin partnerships mean not only mutual observation of exercises, but also contacts between families. Asked about the role of Germany in our defense policy, Gen. Wilecki replied that it was in Poland's interests to maintain good contacts with all of our neighbors, including the Federal Republic. "Until now we have had better relations with our other neighbors; now we are levelling these." The general conceded that in our public's consciousness there undoubtedly were obstacles against rapprochement with Germany. But this process has to be started. If we are seriously thinking about Partnership for Peace and integration with NATO, Germany is our first natural neighbor along the road to Brussels. "It plays one of the main parts in these structures and I cannot imagine us not maintaining good contacts with them. The leadership of the Bundeswehr views this cooperation favorably," noted the chief of the Polish Army General Staff. Gen. Wilecki will spend the next two days in Bavaria where he will be familiarized with the air defense system and the training of highland infantry and engineering and ordnance troops.
