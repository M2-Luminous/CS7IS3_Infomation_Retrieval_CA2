This was stated by Majles Deputy Speaker Hasan Rowhani, who had gone to Syria at the head of a delegation, after his return to Tehran last night. He said that his talks with Syrian officials and combatant Palestinian and Lebanese groups covered Middle East problems and recent developments in the occupied territories. The Majles deputy speaker added that in these talks all the combatant Palestinian and Lebanese groups emphasized the fact that under current sensitive conditions, arrogance should be strongly confronted and the disgrace of compromise with the Zionists should not be accepted. He said that talks with these groups, which focused on the consolidation and continuation of the struggle against world arrogance and the Zionist regime, were fruitful. During his visit to Syria, in addition to his discussions with the Syrian president and other officials, Rowhani also met with some Hizballah deputies in the Lebanese parliament.
