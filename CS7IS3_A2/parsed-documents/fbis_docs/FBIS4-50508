Grass-root level and front lines of economic construction will be the main focus for selecting national model workers and advanced work personnel. Advanced figures known for their persistence in upholding the party's basic line, in consistently working hard without being upset by criticism, and in promoting reform with new creations and outstanding deeds should be selected. Minority women and people should be selected according to fixed proportions. Through selection activities, we should widely publicize the exemplary deeds and lofty spirit of advanced individuals from various trades and professions, in a bid to mobilize the broad masses to take them as example when striving for new success in reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Meanwhile, the National Model and Advanced Workers Recognition Rally Organizing Committee held its first meeting in the afternoon of 27 April, presided over by its chairman, Luo Gan.
