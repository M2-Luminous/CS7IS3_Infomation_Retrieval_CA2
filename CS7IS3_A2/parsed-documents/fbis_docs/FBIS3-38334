There was "apparently a problem because he is the fourth general who has been `worn out' in former Yugoslavia by the United Nations system," he said. "This system must be going wrong somewhere." Cot's withdrawal, at Butrus-Ghali's request, follows that of French general Philippe Morillon and Belgian Francis Briquemont, who in various ways criticized the UN's apparent impotence in former Yugoslavia. Juppe's comments were echoed by Defence Minister Francois Leotard who said there was "a crisis" at the UN, adding that France was planning to send the world body a memorandum demanding to "determine the conditions of employment of French forces" in Bosnia. "If there is not a crisis between France and the UN, there is a crisis within the UN itself." UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived here late Friday for a two-day private visit but diplomatic sources said he could meet government officials during his stay. Shortly after arriving from Amsterdam he met Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze who was ending an official visit to France and who delayed his departure to meet the UN head.
