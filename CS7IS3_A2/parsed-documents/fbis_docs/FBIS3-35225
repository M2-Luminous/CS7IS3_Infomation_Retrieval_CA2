[passage omitted] In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, President Salih thanked the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, represented by His Majesty King Husayn, for hosting the signing of the accord document. He said: On the sidelines of the occasion, we held consultations on issues of interest to the Republic of Yemen and the Hashmemite Kingdom of Jordan, and we discussed several issues pertaining to our Arab and Islamic nation--issues on which both countries maintain identical positions and views. Although we have overcome the challenges of the crisis in our Yemeni homeland, we, as Arabs, still face more general and more comprehensive challenges, which we should confront seriously and honestly. This will not take place unless we patch up our differences and consider higher national interests above other, narrower regional interests. These other interests are distracting our countries' attention from promoting collective pan-Arab action and formulating the situation in accordance with a responsible desire to restore and enhance Arab solidarity. We must do this in order to meet the minimum aspirations of our peoples at this time, a time in which we see a new trend of regional relations that conflicts with the collective action for which we yearn.
