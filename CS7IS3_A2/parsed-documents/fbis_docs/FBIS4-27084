Maize makes up one-third of the grain production in the three northeast provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, which are growing 5.7 million hectares of maize this year. Sown areas for major crops like maize and soybean have largely been expanded this year as farmers have been encouraged by price incentives and various preferential measures by central and local governments. An average northeastern Chinese farmer has 0.27 hectares of arable land, well above the national average. The three provinces have turned out over 50 billion kg since 1990. The region's grain output reached a record high of 60 billion kg last year, 25 billion kg of which were sold to the state, making the region a major bread basket in China.
