The chairman of the joint negotiating team, Mr. Namukolo Mukutu, declined to give the percentages of the increases. Speaking at a joint signing ceremony at Dalvadia Hostel in Lusaka this afternoon, Mr. Mukutu said it is important for Zambians to realize that negotiations for salaries and conditions of service are private matters between employers and employees. Mr. Mukutu explained that the negotiations are based on ensuring the wellbeing of the workers and ensuring the negotiations do not create undue pressure on the national economy. The public service unions had earlier declined an offer by government of a 30 percent increase calculated on the amount of 12 billion kwacha set aside for the negotiations by the state.
