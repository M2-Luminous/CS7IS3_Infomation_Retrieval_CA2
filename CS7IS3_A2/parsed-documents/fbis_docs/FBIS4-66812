FBIS4-66812 "jpnea027___94053" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 23 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA BJP Executive Meets in Hyderabad BJP Executive Meets in Hyderabad Report on Closing Session 94AS0274D Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE in English 23 Mar 94 p 9 94AS0274D Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE English CSO [All quotation marks as published] [Text] Hyderabad, March 22 (UNI)--The National Executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday asked the Union Government to treat Pakistan as a terrorist State and warned that its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which was the "real super-government of Pakistan," was now concentrating on south India after having spread its tentacles to the North-East. In its resolution on the "Threat to national security," released at the concluding day of its three-day session here, the Executive cautioned that Hyderabad, Bangalore, Cochin, Kozhikode, Bhatkal and Gulbarga in the south had currently become major centres of ISI subversive activities. Pointing out that six tonnes of the deadly RDX [Cyclotrimethylene Trinitramine] explosive was seized in Coimbatore, the Executive said "at this rate, Pakistan could land a tonne even of fissionable material to let off a nuclear explosion on our soil. It alleged that the ISI had a nexus with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Tamil Nadu, with the small fishing village of Kyalapatinam serving as the `nerve centre.' There were reports that mysterious STD [Subscriber Trunk Dialing (telephone)] calls, whose bill came up to Rs one lakh in the day, it said. Expressing concern at the increasing subversive activities of the ISI in Kerala, the Executive charged the Chief Minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, and the main Opposition (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) with soft-pedalling on the issue. The Executive criticised the Union Government for its `inaction' for protecting criminals and for its failure to punish even one conspirator in the Bombay and Delhi bomb blasts it also charged the ruling CPI-M Government in West Bengal with protecting the man behind the Calcutta explosion and the main Opposition Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Musleemeen (MIM) in Andhra Pradesh with protecting anti-national elements for electoral reasons. In an overview of the security threat, the executive pointed out that the ISI activities continued uninterrupted despite changes in the government. They set Punjab on fire, but normalcy was fast returning in the border State. However, it was not so in Jammu and Kashmir, it bemoaned. "Specifically, Pakistan is behaving like a terrorist State and we should treat it as such, and not deal with it as if everything is normal." The ISI, with its local agents and foreign patrons, was today the principal subversive in India. "What, however, is extremely disturbing is the wholly condemnable inaction of the Union Government in the face of ISI's deliberate and continued acts of subversions," it said. Calling upon the Union Government to shed its weakness of will, give up its defensive postures and take effective steps, the meeting said the menacing threats to national security could not be met with `kid gloves.' The Executive said 15 million Bangladeshis had spread themselves far and wide in India and lakhs of Pakistanis visiting India on tourist visas never went back. The situation in Hyderabad was "explosive" with 20,000 Pakistanis living illegally in the city, it added. Alleging that the Hizbul Mujahideen, a Pakistan-based militant wing operating in Kashmir, was "thick as thieves" with the MIM in Andhra Pradesh, the resolution said unemployed youths were being recruited for training in subversion and sabotage. Already, three Sangh Pariwar men had lost their lives at the hands of these anti-national elements, it said. The National Executive noted with "extreme concern" the lists of subversive acts in Kerala. Mysterious land deals amounting to crores of rupees "even by indigent persons," have been reported from Kozhikode and the Kozhikode airport of Karipur, which is in Mallapuram district, had become a "hot bed" of ISI activity. Even the government had "admitted" sighting unidentified vessels off the Kerala coast near Tirur in Mallapuram. On the disappearance of Chekannur Moulvi who had raised his voice against communalism and fundamentalism, the resolution said he was abducted months ago and was presumed to be dead. But the government did not hand over the case to the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] inspite of Moulvi's wife's appeal. The Executive expressed amazement at the Kerala Chief Minister, Mr Karunakaran, contradicting the Union Home Minister's statement the very next day after Mr Chavan had admitted in Thiruvananthapuram in the first week of February last that ISI was active in Kerala and the Union Government was aware of it. Mr Karunakaran, just to save his coalition with Muslim League, came out with the statement and the CPI-M, the main opposition party maintained a "guilty silence" on the matter with "hopes of capturing the communal vote bank," it alleged. On the Andhra Pradesh issue, the National Executive suggested constitution of a high-level body like the special investigation team (SIT) with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) assistance to look into the anti-national and ISI operations in the State. It suggested taking into custody of communal outfits having interlinks with Pakistan and a careful watch on passengers from Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh.
