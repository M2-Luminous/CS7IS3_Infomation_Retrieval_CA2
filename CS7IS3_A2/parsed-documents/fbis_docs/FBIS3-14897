[Tsygankov] What is your attitude toward the proposal by one of the Russian Duma legislative factions about the political unification of Belarus with Russia? [Hryb] This issue was never discussed -- either at the meeting of the prime ministers in Moscow or the Interparliamentary Assembly in Saint Petersburg. We are interested only in an economic union and a common ruble zone. I can assure you that no official circles ever considered the political union. [Tsygankov] When will the Belarusian prime minister go to Moscow? [Hryb] As is known, both prime ministers are ill now. Once they begin to recover, I think their meeting will actually take place. I talked with Kebich -- the government heads are planning to meet in early March. Viktor Chernomyrdin even called off his foreign visits.
