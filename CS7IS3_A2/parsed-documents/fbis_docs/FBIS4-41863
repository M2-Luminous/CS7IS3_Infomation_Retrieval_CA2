He has devoted 28 years to investigative work as an ordinary investigator, criminal prosecutor, investigator for especially important cases, deputy chief of an investigation unit, and then chief of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office department for the investigation of crimes against the person. He has the solving of many of the most dangerous crimes to his credit, including, incidentally, the Chikatilo [serial killer] case. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Issa Magometovich, a heated debate has broken out over the president's edict. What do you make of this document? [Kostoyev] If we are talking about the tasks the president has set the law-enforcement organs, they are the same as those stated in the five similar edicts of recent years. A long, long time ago someone should have said: Bring the culprits to book. Why have you boys not been implementing these edicts? [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What have been the specific consequences of the failure to implement the previous edicts? [Kostoyev] Well, for example, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] staff are now working for private firms, banks, and commercial offices. And their new bosses are completely satisfied with them. They do not take just anyone but will hire, in particular, anyone who has had to fight organized crime during his service and anyone who has lawful credentials and the right to carry a gun. In the morning this man turns up at his own section: He says that he is going to meet one of his agents, but he actually goes to a private office. Incidentally, a militiaman must always be on call, even in his spare time. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Be that as it may, the draft Federation Council decree prepared by your committee instructs the general prosecutor to ensure rigorous observance of citizens' rights and freedoms and to establish strict monitoring of the conduct of investigations. Do you therefore see a possibility of using the edict within the framework of existing legislation? [Kostoyev] Under one article of the Constitution the president's edicts must be implemented on the territory of the entire Russian state, under another an edict must conform with the constitution and federal laws. All we can do as jurists is try to put up a barrier against anything that contradicts the law, so that innocent people do not suffer. Edict No. 1226 contradicts the constitution, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity, the Law on Banks and Banking Activity, and the Law on Operational Investigation Activity. I think that, like the previous edicts, it will not be fully implemented and will not have the desired results. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How does this edict relate to the federal program to intensify the fight against crime for the years 1994-1995? [Kostoyev] Very strangely. The 24 May edict instructs the Russian Federation Justice Ministry, jointly with other interested federal executive branch bodies, to prepare within two months proposals on, I stress, making appropriate amendments to Russian Federation legislative acts, making provision for giving the militia the right to search buildings and premises of enterprises of all forms of ownership, etc. But what has emerged is a direct-action edict based on such wishes instead of legislative acts. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Nonetheless, what is needed to stop crime? [Kostoyev] The aforementioned federal program was recommended by deputies, invited specialists, and representatives of ministries and departments at the April parliamentary hearings on this subject. It was decided to give priority consideration to laws aimed at protecting the constitutional rights of citizens, witnesses, and people administering justice -- in short, aimed at taking appropriate counteraction against organized crime. I think that precise compliance with the federal program and the quickest possible adoption of laws, many of which have passed their first or second reading, are what will put up a real barrier to crime.
