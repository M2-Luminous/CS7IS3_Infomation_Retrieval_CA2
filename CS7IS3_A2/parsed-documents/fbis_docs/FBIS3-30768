For the new DPS leader, Dragisa Miletic, the way chosen by the Serbian people is much more agreeable -- they demand an explicit constitutional recognition of the Serbs, as a guarantee of their equal rights with all other minorities in Macedonia. In other words, the Macedonian Government is to include the Serbs in its official list of minorities in the country, in 18 months. Otherwise, the next step of DPS will be raising of the Serbian question in Macedonia in front of international institutions, Miletic said.
