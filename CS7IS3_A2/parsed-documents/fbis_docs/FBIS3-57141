"It is necessary to persuade the president that unless he relies on a clear and definite support from reformers, he risks finding himself in isolation," he said. "In that case, serious shocks may occur, including the hysteria around a possible resignation of the government." We must do all we can to prevent Boris Yeltsin from becoming alienated and isolated, he added. Burbulis considers that the government, with its present composition, "has the resources and the country has the professionals to continue reform-oriented policies." As for the reform strategy itself, "it is in danger but not fatally so." Burbulis did not rule out that "many work collectives might seriously express their discontent" in April and May. However, the president and the government are in a position to prevent this happening. "A search for mechanisms of social and professional rehabilitation of the workers who are under threat of lay-offs should start today," he stressed.
