On this topic, the president said he trusts these first rapprochements will yield good results in order to, later, insist on a peace agreement. [Begin De Leon recording] We have learned that the first stage of the preliminary meeting, a discreet meeting, was held today, aimed only and exclusively at establishing the mechanisms, procedures, and frames of reference for establishing a formal dialogue. This means that this preliminary meeting is not meant to analyze the plan. The plan is being carried out in its first two stages: The national reconciliation here in Guatemala and the struggle against poverty, which is the second stage, or a response to the economic and social needs, which is also being developed. The third stage, however -- the dialogue between the government and the URNG to end the internal armed conflict, which is more than 30 years old -- is the one that today, in the first session or meeting, was started through a preliminary meeting. I know today's meeting agenda was thoroughly discussed; that is why we said the meeting was not successful, but just normal, I would say. The URNG representatives and the representatives of the government I head talked about and completed the agenda for today; tomorrow, the meeting continues, and, I can say, with great hope and faith that the political will of the parties will be presented and demonstrated at this first meeting and, of course, in the others too. This could lead us, in the short term, to the possibility of reaching peace, to later dedicate ourselves to peace, and not just to end the internal armed confrontation; this is not just peace as an absence of bullets, but also to build peace here -- economic, social, and overall peace with social justice for all Guatemalans. [end recording] The president added that the armed rebellion in Chiapas State, Mexico, will not have a negative influence on the peace talks with the Guatemalan guerrillas. [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ... favorable in a way, because I believe that this, pressures -- to use an adequate and simple term -- the URNG to speed up the peace process, mainly taking into account the fact that one Guatemalan has already been captured after participating in those subversive activities, those illegal actions, outside the law of Mexico; and therefore, I think this in no way hurts the peace talks. On the contrary, I think it speeds up the process. It is another external aspect that contributes to the fulfillment of that political will by the URNG. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the Mexican Army, however, has repeatedly accused Guatemalan refugees in Mexico of starting that rebellion. What is your opinion on this? [De Leon] We respect the events that take place in other countries, the treaties, and the sovereignty of other countries, and therefore, we limit ourselves to commenting on what we know, what the Mexican Government has stated, and what the media has reported to us. Later, we will be able to provide official statements from the Guatemalan Government, but, for the time being, we only know what the Mexican Government has stated, and we stick with that because we respect their statements.
