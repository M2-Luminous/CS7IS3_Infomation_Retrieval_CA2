Bogdan Pek accused the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance of a rather large mistake in fixing the price of the Bank Slaski shares, adding that it was not they but rather the exchange and the economic condition of the enterprise that should have decided on the share price. In his opinion, the state budget was the loser in the privatization of Bank Slaski, while bank employees profited in availing themselves of "unjustified" preferences. In general, they cleared 5.8 trillion zlotys [Z]; management representatives profited by nearly Z15 billion. Bogdan Pek was born in 1953 in Krakow. He completed the Zootechnical Department of the Academy of Agriculture. He is a professional politician: Active in the PSK [expansion unknown], he became a member of the Board of Directors and president of the Krakow branch of the party. In last year's parliamentary elections, he received 8,188 votes and, for the first time in his career, won a seat in parliament. In the Sejm, he serves as chairman of the Commission on Ownership Transformations [aka Privatization]. He is married and has a 9-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son, who, he asserts, "would have priced the Bank Slaski shares better on his own calculator." His hobby is fishing.
