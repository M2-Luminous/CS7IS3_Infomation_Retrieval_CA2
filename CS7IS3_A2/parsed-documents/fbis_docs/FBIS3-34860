What this penalty means in the final analysis is that instead of the full $2 billion in U.S. guarantees Israel would receive in 1994, it can now expect a maximum of $1.563 billion. On the surface of things, Washington's "punitive" move is predicated on its appraisal of Israeli spending on settlements in 1993 in excess of what was originally expected and agreed upon between the American and Israeli governments in 1992. The catch is that any penalty against continued Israeli building of settlements does not affect the $3 billion a year aid package to Israel. Had the White House been really serious about punishing Israel for its illegal settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it would have opted to cut drastically its direct financial, economical and military support programmes to the Rabin government instead of relying solely on reducing its loan guarantees. Still, the U.S.' reaction, ineffective as it may be, confirms Arab suspicions that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is still bent on populating Palestinian territories with Israeli settlers at a time when he pretends to be suing for peace with the Arab side, especially the Palestinians. This is the newest evidence yet that the Israeli pious pleas for a just and durable peace in the region are cynical and hypocritical at best. At the rate the Israeli colonisation programme is developing, there would not be much Palestinian territory left to talk about at the end of the 5-year transitional period. This is where the U.S. can be expected to do more by way of frustrating the Israeli settlement plans by cutting deeply into its concrete aid to the Jewish state. It could be the only language that Rabin understands, given the failure of all other methods of persuastion. What adds insult to injury, though, is the reaction of pro-Israel activists in Washington who have expressed their dismay at the announcement of the so-called penalty. Now Israel and its supporters are pinning hopes on the U.S. Congress to reverse the administration's decision. If congressmen end up accommodating Israeli lobbyists on this score, then there is no escape from the conclusion that what the executive branch in Washington offers in support of the peace process on the one hand, Capitol Hill readily takes away on the other.
