A good model leads to the welfare of individuals and society in a particular environment in a process of interaction between the model and those who deal with it and are close to it. The opposite also exists. The model in general is between fathers and mothers, between the administrative official with his employees and others, and between the employee and the citizen. It is between the party comrade and his comrades and the people who surround him in the home, the town, and the party organization. The son looks to his father and mother and to his older brother, how they behave in life; he is affected by them and learns from them. The student looks to his teacher and learns much from him, taking on his character, though incompletely. The employee learns from his superior, and the citizen first trusts a particular employee and a particular department on the basis of recourse to this employee and this department. I am not calling for an ideal society in a material world. I cannot dream, even for the sake of dreaming, of a nation of angels; for that contradicts the nature of life, which is motivated by the laws of good and evil, angel and devil. I am not looking for miracles, whose age ended with the death of the Seal of messengers and prophets, Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace). I am seeking something else that unites idealism in action and behavior with a lawful human livelihood through legitimate gain and effort to realize a certain economic profit in the spirit of fair and legitimate competition and no other spirit. I am looking for teachers of the sort who taught us to read and thereby acquired us as their servants--with a debt of conviction and gratitude, not in the sense of the servile slavery--after everyone has spoken and still speaks critically, talking about teachers who have bestowed of their knowledge in costly private lessons and have been as stingy as possible to their students in the schools, colleges, and institutes. Some have dispensed with formality between themselves and their students not out of humility and to create bridges of trust between the professor and the student and pupil, but for other reasons basically material. I am looking for doctors who do not give a patient in their private clinics more than they give to one in the government hospital and the people's clinic--doctors who do not force the patient to return three times to the private clinic for diagnosis and go to a particular laboratory and particular pharmacy on the pretext of the professional knowledge of the laboratory doctor and the pharmacist. Of course, I am sure that physicians need greater care by the government in salary, provision of scientific resources, and making a qualitative shift in the life of the physician and pharmacist in various areas of scientific and social life. I am looking for lawyers and judges who are great in all things, now that time has buried the names of lawyers and judges who were renowned for learning, knowledge, justice, and honesty in Iraq's political and legal history. I am looking for sons who do not call their fathers by their names or by nicknames such as "Abu So-and-so," and for fathers who do not encourage their children to smoke, drink, and do other things in the name of changing times and overlook their truancy from school or lack of diligence. Party work had a sanctity, and the party official was an object of respect: such was secret party life in Iraq. Thus it was and thus it ought to be in public life, but society's shortcomings have left their mark on the life of many party figures from the point of view of the people. The meeting no longer retains its old spirit, as I, who am not enrolled in any party, hear. The meeting has come to be regarded as one regards a job that permits vacations, laxity, and absence for various excuses and pretexts. What will others do when the traffic policeman neglects to fasten the seat belt in his car, goes through the light, and crosses the street not at the crosswalk? How can someone sick because of smoking heed the advice of his attendant physician who smokes? How will an employee deal with a citizen when his superior deals bureaucratically with him? What position will the citizen take toward an official who gives him such and such advice, while not carrying out anything he has promised to do? Aristotle says that anyone who would do good should avoid its opposite, or else he will be called evil. In political science it is an error to retreat from a gain that a group of people has realized for the entire nation. In government departments and institutions the anger of an official often leads to unacceptable measures against a particular employee or group of employees for various reasons. As everyone knows, any number of thank-you letters cannot prevail against a letter of sanction against a certain employee. We thank God that our nation has preserved its historic characteristics of courage, generosity, and patriotism. Yet certain individuals from this great nation have deserted "village ethics" in the name of progress. Using the blockade as a crutch, they justify theft itself. They justify bribery by the persistence of the blockade and the complexity of economic life. They regard crime as something normal under such circumstances, as something similar to what goes on throughout the world, though in mitigated form. Among these people are some who have good social and professional positions. Where is the model in this type of person in the positive sense? The inferior will continue to regard the superior with an eye of wonder, admiration, and the force of the ideal and the principle, or with an eye of disapproval. My following proposal may seem difficult to realize, but it is not impossible to implement. Simply stated, it calls for electing the model official at the level of ministers, governors, district administrators, and institution heads--with this or another title--in accordance with the standards and principles contained in the revolution and the thoughts and views of the leader Saddam Husayn for behavior that will not be so negative and that will not occasion disapproval and pain on the part of the majority. There are those who commit excesses because their director or section chief, if it is a government department or institution, scorns creditable behavior and dealing despite the slogans he has raised among his employees and others concerning work, serving the people, developing the country, and following the principle of criticism and self-criticism by officials. Being essentially members and supporters of the Ba'th Party, the latter must, as the leader Saddam Husayn has recommended, carry the party's traditions into their departments, not the reverse.
