Representatives of the 17 commissioners approved proposals for establishing works councils in large multinational companies operating in more than one EU country. The aim is to ensure employees are consulted about key corporate decisions which could affect their livelihoods. The plan, which is now certain to be agreed by the Commission next week, will be this year's main item of social legislation in Brussels and it is likely to become the centre of a battle between the EU employers and trade unions. Its significance for Britain and the Euro-sceptics on the Conservative backbenches is that the Commission's lawyers believe UK-based multinationals cannot escape obligations to comply with a directive agreed by the other 11 member states without the participation of UK ministers. A big company with a headquarters in London and substantial subsidiaries in other member states would have to set up consultation machinery for its employees in mainland Europe. Although the management of the UK operation could legally refuse to take part, Commission officials think it would be divisive and impractical if British workers were denied access being offered to employees elsewhere in the EU. Multinationals based in one of the other 11 member states would be "obliged to invite the management and employees of their UK branches or subsidiaries to participate." The proposal is the first test of how the Maastricht social protocol will work. It is being brought forward initially as an attempt to achieve a consensus between the EU employers and unions which might avoid the need for binding legislation. In practice, however, such agreement is unlikely and the plan is likely to be turned into a binding directive. The German government, which takes over the EU presidency in July, wants it passed into law by October when its general election will be held. Chancellor Kohl thinks this item of progressive EU legislation would be popular with the voters and potential future coalition partners. Emilio Cabaglio, secretary general of the European TUC [Trade Union Council], said yesterday that the Commission plan was a "complete U-turn" on the previous works council proposal which was approved by 11 member states last year under the pre-Maastricht procedure, but fell because of British opposition. It was "suprising and totally unacceptable," he said. Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the European employers' confederation, said his members would refuse to take part in negotiations which the Commission was stacking dangerously in favour of the unions. Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, appeared to be relaxed last night about being under fire from both directions. He believes the new version of the proposal will help employees of multinationals to negotiate consultation machinery with their managements which best suits the circumstances of their companies. The union side would be strengthened because the employers would know the Commission's plan could be imposed if no agreement was reached. But the unions would still have an incentive to compromise because these default powers would only apply from 1999. "The paradox of this directive is that it will succeed best if it is never applied, but if it did not exist nothing would happen," Mr Flynn said. The proposals apply to firms with more than 1,000 employees anywhere in the EU. British workers will count towards the total. But the machinery for establishing consultation rights cannot be triggered without the support of 500 workers from the other 11 member states. Mr Flynn has dropped the description "European works councils" from his text in an effort to placate Unice. Under the Maastricht social protocol, British ministers can attend debates among the other 11 member states, but have no vote.
