FBIS3-25069 "drafr025_c_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Problems Reportedly Plaguing New Peacekeeping Force MB0702103894 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 6 Feb 94 p 1 MB0702103894 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Chris Barron] [Text] Just two weeks after its formation, the peacekeeping force due to be deployed in hot-spots around South Africa in five weeks' time is in a shambles. Top instructors have told of a collapse of discipline, desertion and drunkenness among the 3,500 volunteers at the SADF's [South African Defence Force] De Brug training camp outside Bloemfontein. In addition, hygiene conditions at the base are inadequate and there are nearly 200 cases of serious disease. Now SADF instructors seconded to the force are so disillusioned that nine have gone on "strike", refusing to obey any orders that have anything to do with the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). One instructor was sent home on Friday and the others, according to sources at De Brug, "want out". At least 100 statements have been submitted by SADF volunteers who also want to return to their units -- and between 60 and 80 percent of SAP [South African Police] volunteers have already left. A senior SAP source said about 40 percent of the police contingents from the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei] states had also returned home. The picture painted this weekend of the fledgling Peace Force, precursor of a fully integrated National Defence Force, is grim. It shows a disparate force crippled by lack of discipline and demoralized by a shortage of facilities and equipment. Career soldiers, charged with welding former enemies into a credible force to ensure free and fair elections, said the peace troops "do pretty much as they like". "If a guy threatens someone or disobeys a command, there's nothing we can do. If you try to punish anyone and something happens, you're in trouble," said a senior SADF officer. Some MK [Umkhonto weSizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] members had refused to wear regulation overalls. About 45 soldiers are listed as being absent without leave. The worst incident occurred last Saturday night, when about 600 MK soldiers, many drunk, began toyi-toying and shouting slogans such as "One settler, one bullet" and "Down with FW". They demanded on dead SADF member and one dead SAP member before sunrise, and at least two SADF instructors were assaulted. Terrified members of other groups refused to sleep in their tents. They slept in the bush and instructors had to persuade them on Monday to return. An MK colonel was asked by an SADF officer to mediate with his men, but he refused, saying he would be risking his life. The temporary commanding officer, Colonel Fred Burger, could not be located that night and was unaware of the incident until the next day. Colonel Burger has been criticised by this officers and instructors for downplaying the situation for "political" reasons. Compounding the difficulties is the way MK soldiers are apparently promoted from the ranks to senior leadership positions overnight. "We have at least one sergeant major of 19 and at least one regimental sergeant major of 21," said the SADF veteran. Because of a shortage of facilities, troops have been using showers and wash basins as toilets. There is only one bathroom for each company of 200 men. There have been about 40 cases of malaria and about five of cerebral malaria among MK soldiers. There are "easily" more than 100 cases of venereal disease and about 50 of TB. Alcohol abuse is a problem, with shebeens reportedly operating in the camp. Colonel Burger refused to answer questions from the Sunday Times, and after threatening to call the Military Police, ordered us off the property. NPKF commanding officer Gabriel Ramushwana visited the camp last week and will hold a media conference on Thursday.
