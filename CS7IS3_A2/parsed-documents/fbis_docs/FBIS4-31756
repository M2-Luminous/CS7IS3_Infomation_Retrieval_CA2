The negotiators worked out a draft text of a joint proposal which will be submitted to the two parties" general political coordination forum on Tuesday for approval. The draft extends to the cooperation of the coalition partners within government, the working order of the cabinet, cooperation between the parliamentary groups, appointment rights, and the coordination mechanism between the two parties. Speaking to journalists after the talks, Szekeres said discussion between the two parties about these issues could possibly be completed on Tuesday. These issues received special emphasis in the course of the talks because this is the first time that the basic principles of the coalition cooperation are to be set down in writing. The MSZP politician did not wish to provide further details about his talks with the SZDSZ official. However, journalists were told that personnel issues were not discussed, as the general political negotiating forum and the party chairmen are the ones who coordinate such matters. The Socialists and the Free Democrats are not forced to conclude a coalition, but they are negotiating in the interest of the country, Szekeres said in answer to a question from the press. As regards the chances of a coalition government, Szekeres said the likelihood of the two parties reaching agreement in the course of their talks is quite good.
