In a statement to the public, the association warned of "the disastrous results of the policy of extremist Albanian political parties" in Kosovo-Metohija, manifested in the mass quitting of jobs, schools and university. This policy has deprived a whole generation of young Albanians of proper schooling. On the other hand, leaders of extremist Albanian parties and war profiteers secured a good life for themselves and their children, usurping for themselves the benefits that belong to all in the province. They therefore have no moral right to speak on behalf of all Albanians, said the statement. The separatist ethnic Albanian leadership, which advocates Kosovo-Metohija's secession from Yugoslavia and joining it to neighboring Albania, exerts constant pressures on its fellow countrymen to disregard the laws of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to leave their jobs and refuse to pay taxes. Succumbing to these pressures, a majority of ethnic Albanians boycotted the 1990, 1992 and 1993 elections.
