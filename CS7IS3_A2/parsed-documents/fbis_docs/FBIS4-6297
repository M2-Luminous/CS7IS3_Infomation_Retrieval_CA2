Asked to comment on the U.S. tight money policy at a news conference on 19 April, Finance Minister Hiroshi Fujii said, "I have no intention of commenting on another nation's monetary policy." Being affected by the U.S. tight money policy, Japan's bond prices plummeted and long-term interest rates jumped on 19 April. Influenced by a fall in stock prices in the United States, the yen has further appreciated against the dollar. At the news conference, Finance Minister Fujii did not raise any objection to the "U.S. tight money policy aimed at keeping inflation in check" but rather expressed his understanding of the U.S. policy. The G-7 talks of finance ministers and central bank governors [to be held on 24 April in Washington, D.C.] will almost certainly take up for discussion the issue of high long-term interest rates worldwide. The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan for now have no intention of claiming at the G-7 summit talks that the U.S. tight money policy has triggered a worldwide rise in long-term interest rates and that the policy has adversely affected the world economy. The Bank of Japan says: "The United States is raising long-term interest rates to rein in inflation. If the tight money policy generates the effect of curbing inflation and if the U.S. economy stays stable for a long time, long-term interest rates will go down." The Finance Ministry takes the view that "monetary authorities can only manipulate short-term interest rates, and long-term interest rates are determined on the financial market" (according to the International Financial Bureau). The Finance Ministry stresses that the high long-term interest rates in the United States will not become a major item on the agenda of the G-7 talks. The Japanese Government has almost firmed up Japan's stand at the G-7 talks. At the G-7 talks, Japan will stress two points: 1) The Japanese economy is increasingly showing signs of a recovery, and Japan has steadily been taking steps to expand domestic demand; and 2) Japan has been promoting improvement in its economic structure while mapping out in March a package of measures to spur its economy. Japan intends to stress the two points in a bid to avoid being criticized at the G-7 talks for its huge trade surplus. The Japanese Government takes the view that it is a good policy for Japan to take the position of explaining its domestic measures rather than commenting on the economic policies of the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations. If Japan clumsily criticizes at the G-7 talks the United States for pursuing its tight money policy, it would come under a barrage of criticism from other nations for its trade surplus, which hit a record high in 1993. In particular, the United States is still strongly discontented with Japan's failure to cut taxes more deeply and to take more aggressive steps to correct the trade imbalance between the two countries. Japan's "huge sums of trade surplus" have become its weak point. Japan is different from European nations that are in a position to express relatively candidly their concerns over the step taken by the United States to raise long-term interest rates. Japan will be placed in a difficult position at the G-7 talks. Japan's long-term interest rates are not necessarily affected directly by U.S. long-term interest rates. The recent increase in Japan's long-term interest rates was triggered by Japan's own financial factors. Japan's long-term interest rates have been increasing since January, when the government announced plans to sell bonds to raise funds to finance public works projects for economic stimulation. The high long-term interest rates in the United States have increased Japanese enterprises' cost of raising funds. Japan's high long-term interest rates, coupled with the appreciating yen, will undermine Japan's economy, which is just showing signs of bottoming out. Private sector banking institutes are voicing concerns that the high U.S. long-term interest rates will have an adverse impact on bond prices in Japan and on the yen's exchange rate against the dollar.
