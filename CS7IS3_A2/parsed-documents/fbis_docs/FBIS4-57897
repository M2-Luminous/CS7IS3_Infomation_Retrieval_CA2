First reports stated that the new secretariat would directly report to the Presidency of the nation and would control all national security forces. This means that the Federal Police, the National Border Police, and the Coast Guard would all come under this new secretariat. Its official name would allegedly be the Secretariat for Community Protection and, according to what has been officially disclosed, it would be headed by Julian Licastro. Subsequent reports stated that some members of the cabinet are against the all-encompassing role that the government intends to give this secretariat. They suggest that the National Border Police and the Argentine Coast Guard continue under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. Those who support the first position -- the one that encompasses all agencies without distinction -- contend that it would be more suitable to unify the management of the nation's security forces and to coordinate their respective intelligence services to enable a greater control of government domestic security spending and the optimum use of resources for drug enforcement. Those in favor of the second position argue that it is not necessary to unify the management of security forces because there is already a unified command -- that vested in the president of the Republic, under whose natural command come all the government's agencies in one way or another. It is also alleged that the project for unification contradicts several laws (internal defense and security, among them) and that it ignores the fact that the Border Guard currently carries out external security functions in addition to its task of internal security. It is stressed that the creation of the super secretariat could lead to an exaggerated concentration of power in one branch of government and that it could encourage the idea of the intention to create a repressive structure, which does not coincide with the style and stamp of democratic societies. Whether these arguments are valid or not, the proposal does not seem to follow an imperious need at the present time. The internal security problems facing Argentine society do not come from the fact that the respective organizations are not in their correct positions within the state's current organizational chart, but from other factors, some of which have been frequently mentioned in this column: The lack of budget resources for the sector, the ever-increasing deterioration of police professionalism, and the obvious fissures in the judicial system, among others. Nothing presupposes a change in the jurisdictional aspect of the organizations will help to correct the endemic weakness of the national security system or help to attenuate in some way the feeling of a lack of protection that Argentine society is experiencing in the face of an upsurge in crime and uncontrolled drug trafficking. One error that most governments have committed stems from the presumption that problems can be resolved by the creation of new and enormous state structures. Experience shows that this formula generally leads to a completely useless expenditure or to the overlapping of organizations with similar or parallel missions. Internal security is, without a doubt, one of the fundamental values that the state must safeguard, but the right way is not through atypical organizational mechanisms; it is through the good use of existing structures and the removal of the obstacles that prevent its efficient functioning. The Interior and Defense Ministries have clearly established missions and functions. If for some reason they are not carrying them out with the necessary efficiency, then the needed adjustments and behavioral changes must be made so that the organizations can face the needs of society today with adequate moral and technical competence.
