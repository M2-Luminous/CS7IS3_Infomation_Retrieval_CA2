Generally, the comments of local exchange carriers (LECs) and interexchange carriers (IXCs) raise issues concerning the basis upon which they are to calculate their fee payments, the need for a definition of the term ``subscriber,'' and a date for calculating their fee payments. 36 36 Allnet and MCI point out that resellers and pay telephone operators are not among those regulatees listed in the fee schedule. We will review whether these entities should be directly subject to a fee payment in the course of our proceeding to determine regulatory fees for FY 1995. 96. We will adopt our proposal to permit the holding company of local exchange carriers to aggregate fee payments due by its operating companies and submit a single payment to cover the fee requirements of its subsidiaries. 37 We have considered the proposals of several commenters, including Ameritech, Nynex and SWB, that LECs submit fees based upon ARMIS data. However, ARMIS data is required from comparatively few LECs and we would still need a mechanism to calculate the fees due from the vast majority of LECs. Therefore, we have decided that all LECs are to calculate the amount of their regulatory fees based upon the number of working loops as described in section 36.611 of our rules, governing the submission of Information to the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA). 38 We believe that this definition will be simple to administer since the LECs currently compile subscriber loop data, and it will provide a consistent formulation for the assessment of fees from all LECs. 39 As noted, for FY 1994, we will require LECs to calculate their fee payments for FY 1994 as of December 31, 1993. 40 37 We agree with Allnet that entities operating as both LECs and IXCs are subject to a regulatory fee for both categories of service. However, as GTE suggests, we will require a carrier to submit only a single payment when a single commonly-owned line serves as both a presubscribed line and an access line. 38 NECA has proposed to process regulatory fees on behalf of its pooling exchange carriers and to submit their consolidated fees to our lockbox bank in a single instrument of payment. We have no objection to NECA's submission of the fee on behalf of its pooling exchange carriers or others. However, we remind entities subject to the payment of a regulatory fee that the regulatee, not an agent, such as NECA, is responsible for ensuring that the payment is made that it is subject to penalty for failure to submit the entire fee due in a timely manner. LECs will be expected to pay their fees based upon the number of access lines as determined by NECA. In case of a dispute between a carrier and NECA concerning the carrier's line count as of December 31, 1993, NECA will certify its calculation of the carrier's line count and the basis for its calculation. 39 We expect competitive access providers (CAPs) to submit fee payments based upon their line count as required under section 9(g). Ameritech, GTE and other interested parties may submit their views on the proper method of assessing regulatory fees for CAPs in our proceeding to establish fees for FY 1995. 40 Several LECs, including Ameritech, GTE, NYNEX and Bell South, opposed by Allnet, contend that their regulatory fee payments qualify for exogenous treatment under the price cap rules and ask that we allow their regulatory fee expense to be charged directly to their subscribers. Their request is beyond the scope of this proceeding. LECs seeking to charge their regulatory fees directly to subscribers should petition for a waiver of the Commission's rules. 97. In the NPRM, we invited comments concerning section 9(g)'s assessment of regulatory fees from IXCs on a subscriber basis. In response, AT&T, opposed by Wiltel, Inc., argues that fee payments by IXCs should be based on gross revenues, not by the number of a carrier's subscribers. We decline to reach the merits of AT&T's argument at this time because, as indicated above, we shall not adjust the fee schedule for FY 1994. Any reformulation of the basis upon which IXCs are to base their fee payments would constitute a substantial adjustment to the fee schedule that Congress enacted. IXCs shall file fees based on the total number of common lines presubscribed to that IXC as determined pursuant to section 69.116 of the rules. 47 C.F.R. ยง69.116. AT&T may submit its views concerning the appropriate method of assessing fees from IXCs in our proceeding to establish regulatory fees for FY 1995. 6. International Bearer Circuits 98. Panamsat requests clarification concerning the assessment of regulatory fees for international circuits. Section 9(g)'s Schedule provides that the fee is to be computed ``per 100 active 64 KB circuits or equivalent.'' The fee is to be paid by the facilities-based common carrier activating the circuit in any transmission facility for the provision of service to an end user or resale carrier. Private submarine cable operators also are to pay fees for circuits sold on an indefeasable right of use (IRU) basis or leased in their private submarine cables to any customer of the private cable operator. In the NPRM, we stated that the fee would be based upon active 64 KB circuits, or equivalent circuits. Under this formulation, 64 KB circuits or their equivalent will be assessed a fee. Equivalent circuits include the 64 KB circuit equivalent of larger bit stream circuits. For example, the 64 KB circuit equivalent of a 2.048 MB circuit is 30 64 KB circuits. Analog circuits such as 3 and 4 KHz circuits used for international services are also included as equivalent 64 KB circuits. However, circuits derived from 64 KB circuits such as circuits derived by the use of digital circuit multiplication systems are not equivalent 64 KB circuits. Such circuits are not subject to fees. Only the 64 KB circuit from which they have been derived will be subject to payment of a fee.
