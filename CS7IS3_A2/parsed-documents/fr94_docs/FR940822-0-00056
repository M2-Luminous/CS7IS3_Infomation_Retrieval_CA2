FR940822-0-00056 FR940822-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Parts 217 and 220 [FRA Docket No. RSOR&hyph;12, Notice No. 3] Railroad Operating Rules and Radio Standards and Procedures RIN 2130-AA76 AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: FRA is amending its Railroad Operating Rules and its Radio Standards and Procedures by removing requirements that railroads file their operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, annual summaries on operational tests and inspections, and their radio rules with the Federal Railroad Administrator and by substituting requirements that railroads retain such records and make them available to FRA representatives during normal business hours. FRA is also amending the Railroad Operating Rules by eliminating the requirement that Class III railroads file their operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator. In addition, FRA is making technical changes to require railroads to record specific information when conducting operational tests and inspections of their employees. Finally, FRA is changing the Railroad Operating Rules and the Radio Standards and Procedures so as to allow retention of certain records by ``electronic recordkeeping'' ( i.e. , retention of a computer record in lieu of a paper record). These amendments are intended to eliminate nonessential reporting requirements while enabling FRA to review meaningful data to determine the safety of a railroad's operations. EFFECTIVE DATE: The rule becomes effective on November 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jon Kaplan, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0635) or Dennis R. Yachechak, Railroad Safety Specialist, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone: (202) 366&hyph;504). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 19, 1992, FRA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') on amendments to its Railroad Operating Rules (49 CFR Part 217) and Radio Standards and Procedures (49 CFR Part 220). 57 FR 47603 (1992). FRA proposed to remove requirements that railroads file their respective operating rules, radio rules, operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections with FRA in Washington, D.C. and to substitute requirements that railroads retain these records and make them available upon request for inspection by FRA personnel during regular business hours. FRA believed that these proposed amendments, if adopted, would remove nonessential filing and reporting requirements while concurrently reducing the burden borne by the railroads in paperwork and mailing expenses.
