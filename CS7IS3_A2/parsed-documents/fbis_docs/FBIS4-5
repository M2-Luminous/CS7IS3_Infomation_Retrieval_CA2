FBIS TRENDS-04APR94-CROATIA-YUGO Croatia-Yugoslavia Croatia-Yugoslavia Serbs Agree to Ceasefire But Still Press Claim to Statehood SUMMARY While tensions may be lessened in the near term by the ceasefire agreement between the Croatian Government and the leaders of the self-proclaimed "Republic of Serbian Krajina" (RSK), neither the Krajina Serbs nor the regime of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic have shown any sign of compromising on the fundamental dispute between the Serbs and Croats in Croatia. The Serbs claim that the RSK is not part of Croatia and has the right to join other Serbs to create a Greater Serbia. At the same time, Milosevic and the RSK leadership appear to be willing to delay the establishment of a Greater Serbia, perhaps hoping that this would be viewed as enough of a contribution toward a peaceful settlement to justify the lifting of the UN's economic sanctions against Belgrade. END SUMMARY Although willing to accept a ceasefire with the Croatian government and hinting at a willingness to open communication and transportation lines closed since the 1991 war, the Krajina Serb leadership continues to press its demand for recognition of the RSK as an independent state. Following the signing of the 30 March ceasefire agreement in Zagreb, RSK "President" Milan Martic claimed that the participation of the United States and Russia constituted, "in a certain way, recognition" of the RSK and its "acceptance" as a "state with its own territory, authorities, and population." He predicted that formal international recognition would follow "in the next phase" of the negotiating process (Belgrade TV, 30 March). However, Martic suggested in an earlier interview that the Krajina Serbs were willing to delay the fulfillment of their longstanding goal of union with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY--Serbia and Montenegro). While he predicted that a "solution" to the "question of unification" would be found "this year," he suggested that its actual implementation might be a protracted process. He warned that the Serbs would need to display much "patience" before their "great aim" was realized (Vecernje Novosti, 27 March). Support From Belgrade Recent statements by leaders of the FRY indicate that Belgrade continues to support the Krajina Serbs' separatist claims: -- FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told an interviewer that, Croatia's recognition as an independent state by much of the world community did not apply to Krajina because recognition had been granted at a time "when Croatia had not established sovereignty" over the RSK (Le Monde, 29 March). This comports with recent statements by the RSK leadership that the territories they now hold were never controlled by the Croatian Government and are thus legally still a part of the former Yugoslavia. -- On the day the ceasefire was signed in Zagreb, Milosevic- controlled Belgrade television highlighted Martic's claim that the negotiating process implied the recognition of the RSK's claim to the status of an independent state (Belgrade TV, 30 March). -- A member of the FRY Government, speaking in Serb-held Tenja (a town in eastern Croatia) at a meeting of a local branch of Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia, reassured the Krajina Serbs that the party "shall continue" to do "everything" to support the RSK's "right to self-determination" (Novi Sad TV, 3 April). No authoritative voice from the FRY political leadership or media has been observed to suggest that the Krajina should submit to Croatian sovereignty over the RSK. At the same time, Milosevic may seek to gain a lifting of the sanctions against the FRY by portraying his willingness to delay the Serbs' eventual unification as a compromise contributing to a peaceful resolution of the armed conflict. In an interview with an Amsterdam newspaper, Mihailo Markovic, vice president of Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia and an adviser to the Serbian president, suggested that "Serbia should not regard" uniting the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with the "Serbian 'motherland'" as its "highest priority." He proposed that the "first goal" for the RSK and the neighboring "Republic of Srpska" in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be to "develop a very good independent existence" with economic ties to Serbia and other neighboring countries. After a consolidation stage that "could last a very long time," he said, a decision "must be made" about their permanent status, including "possible unification" with the FRY. He said he was "certain" that the Krajina Serbs did not want to be part of the Croatian state, but insisted that "Serbia would not oppose" the outcome "in any way" if the Krajina Serbs voted in a referendum to join Croatia (De Volkskrant, 1 April).
