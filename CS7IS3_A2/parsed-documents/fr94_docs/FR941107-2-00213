Refer to the Notice published on March 30, 1994, in the Federal Register (59 FR 14996) for information on EDA's general policies and other requirements. Authority Support for this program is authorized under the contingency fund provided to the President under Public Law 103&hyph;211, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) The Special Economic Development and Adjustment Assistance Program_Long-Term Economic Deterioration (LTED) and Sudden and Severe Economic Dislocation (SSED) is listed under CFDA 11.307. Program Objectives Funds will be used for the creation of a local Infrastructure Development Fund that will make funds available to repair or upgrade local infrastructure damaged by the earthquake which is not eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance. The Infrastructure Development Fund will be capitalized by EDA and will be administered by the City of Los Angeles and other local jurisdictions. These funds will be used to leverage existing financing through matching grants, loans, and subordinated debt. Local communities will identify the infrastructure projects to receive assistance. Eligible projects would include earthquake damaged non-public infrastructure ineligible for FEMA assistance, such as a privately-owned water system, and repair projects in which it makes economic sense to upgrade the infrastructure beyond pre-earthquake specifications. Additional program objectives are described in the Federal Register of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15005) announcing the policies and application procedures for EDA's Fiscal Year 1994 programs. Funding Availability Funds in the amount of $50 million are available for this disaster recovery program and shall remain available until expended.
