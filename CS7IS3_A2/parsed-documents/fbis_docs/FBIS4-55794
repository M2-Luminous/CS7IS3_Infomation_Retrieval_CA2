Only Stefan Savov [leader of the Union of Democratic Forces parliamentary group] showed up for this meeting. At lunchtime President Zhelev met with Professor Nikolay Vasilev and Georgi Kostov, representatives of the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy], and with Ruslan Semerdzhiev and Ivan Pushkarov of the Assembly for Democracy [SD]. At the meeting they discussed possible ways out of the present political situation. President Zhelev suggested that a definite date should be fixed for holding early parliamentary elections, which, in his view, should take place at the end of September or the beginning of October. Once this date had been determined, the political forces should reach an agreement on electing a government. During this period parliament should concentrate on passing the most urgent economic legislation. Two months before the date fixed for the elections, the government should become a caretaker and start preparing for early parliamentary elections. President Zhelev also explained his views on the way out of the present political situation with Aleksandur Tomov, GOR [Civic Alliance for the Republic] leader. As Tomov said a few minutes ago after the meeting had ended, they discussed the possibility of signing an agreement on early parliamentary elections within the next 10 days and of ensuring a smooth transitional period until the elections are held.
