The first question is to what extent can the National Assembly Intelligence Committee control the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP]. The means for the National Assembly to control administrative departments are through budget and policy review for legislation. Unlike in the past, the National Assembly is known to have considerable, although not complete, control. The NSP will submit to the Intelligence Committee all detailed data required for actual review of all budgets. This means that, from now on, the NSP will be on the National Assembly's review list as far as the budget is concerned. In the past, the NSP only reported to the National Assembly the total amount of NSP expenses and intelligence costs without any supporting documentation and thus, passed National Assembly review without disclosing any details. The Intelligence Committee budget review will not be open to the public, and only the total amount of the budget will be reported to the speaker and notified to the Budget Committee. The NSP director could still refuse to answer questions in the National Assembly but, unlike in the past, will be preceded by the notification that the issue is critical to national security. The position of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], however, is that the committee should refrain from questioning concrete matters of the department because they are state secrets. This is why the committee members have dual memberships. The DLP asserts that pending issues should be discussed by the National Assembly as the Intelligence Committee is banned from leaking secrets. Hence, considerable disagreement is expected between the ruling and opposition parties regarding the management of the Intelligence Committee. Another matter of interest is the structure of the Intelligence Committee. Since the members have to deal with state secrets, important post holders of the Democratic faction, including the Chairman of the Defense Committee Sin Sang-u (six-time elected) and former DLP Secretary General Hwang Myong-su (four-time elected) are possible candidates to chair the Intelligence Committee. As agreed during the last floor-leader meeting between the ruling and opposition parties, 12 DLP and five Democratic Party lawmakers will be assigned to the committee. The members should belong to a negotiation group and the floor leaders of the ruling and opposition parties will have positions. Members should include those from the six standing committees, including the Operation, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Unification, Home Affairs, Defense, and Administration and Economic Committees. Such limitations on the qualification of the committee members is due to the confidentiality of the committee activities.
