It hopes to first carry out this plan in preparation for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to form a framework for unity among the ruling coalition parties, in view of the next general election. Prime Minister Hosokawa has proposed setting up a "policy study group," but a "freeze" has been placed on this plan due to opposition from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and other parties. Therefore, the JNP hopes the four parties, which have many points in common regarding policies and other matters, can act as a catalyst in promoting moves toward unifying the ruling coalition parties. However, rough sailing is expected since not only is the SDPJ, which has been left out of the plan, reacting against it, but there is hardly any possibility that Sakigake, which already has formed a parliamentary group with the JNP, would accept the idea. JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka and other JNP executive officials met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 4 April. They informed him of their plan for the formation of a parliamentary group, and Hosokawa approved the idea. A senior JNP official explained: "As we have gained the understanding of Sakigake, which has opposed the planned formation of a policy study group, the four parties will come together first, and hopefully, the SDPJ and Komeito will join us in the future." At a 29 March meeting, executive officials from the JNP, DSP, and Sakigake agreed on a plan to form a parliamentary group among the three parties. Later, however, the JNP decided to change its original plan to form a parliamentary group among the four parties because, among other reasons, the three-party group would not be able to become a nucleus of the ruling coalition alliance, since the total number of lower house seats these three parties currently hold would only add up to 74 -- the same as the number of lower house seats currently held by the SDPJ. In reaction to such JNP moves, Sakigake has made critical comments. A senior party official said: "The merging of Sakigake and the JNP, which we have promised to the people, has precedence."
