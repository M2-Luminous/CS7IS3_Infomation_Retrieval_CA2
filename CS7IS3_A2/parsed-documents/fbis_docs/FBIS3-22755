In an official document, the government admitted that the implementation of the MTCR guidelines does not imply any sort of limitation on special national programs or harm international cooperation in such programs. In addition, the government commits itself to complying with export control rules compatible with the MTCR guidelines as soon as draft bill No. 2535/92 takes effect. This decision, which was announced 11 February, befits the efforts made by the Brazilian Government in the last few weeks to show the international community that the country is contributing to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and that its nuclear and aerospace programs have strictly peaceful objectives. Thus, the government believes it has taken one more step toward obtaining sensitive technology.
