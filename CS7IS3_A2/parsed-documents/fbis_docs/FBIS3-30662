He said that in the "super-election year" of 1994 it was easier for Austrian politicians to capitalise on disputed Czech issues. Jajtner recalled the words by Austrian President Thomas Klestil during his visit to the Czech Republic last December that "not even Temelin might violate our good relations." In the meantime, however, the two countries' relations have worsened, the ambassador admitted, and described a welcome in Linz during his recent visit as "very cool." Jajtner said he understood the concern of Upper Austrians (who live close to the Czech border), but, as he said, there was no reason for panic. The Prague government had considered Austria's concern and would operate only half of the plant's envisaged capacity. Temelin's completion, however, is a significant step towards the improvement of environment in Bohemia, Jajtner said. "Children and trees in the most severely affected region of northern Bohemia must breathe," he said. After the completion of Temelin, two thermal power plants which harm the environment most will cease to operate, he concluded.
