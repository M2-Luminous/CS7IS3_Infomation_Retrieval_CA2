Particular zeal in this respect has been shown by a Mrs. Selivanova, whose byline appears on a number of articles in SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Such close attention on the part of the press, or to be more accurate on the part of a single writer, to a structure that cannot be found even in government handbooks prompts a legitimate question: Why is this? First of all I want to say thank you to Mrs. Selivanova. Were it not for her articles I, first, would still find it difficult to decipher the abbreviation FGCIA (Federal Government Communications and Information Agency) and, second, would not know that the FGCIA is a powerful pillar of the state and that there are termites trying to undermine that pillar. Why do I reach these conclusions? Because, now that I have familiarized myself with the substance of the question, I have arrived at the opinion that Selivanova's articles "Yeltsin in Gorki-1994" and "Sparkling Days of Kremlin Administrators" (SEGODNYA) and "Mind What You Say: Walls Have Ears" [Slovo ne vorobey: poymayut -- vyletish] (KOMMERSANT-DAILY) contain so many fantasies and distortions that you get the firm impression that the author is interested in achieving certain aims that are not expressed in the articles. But before citing examples, let us say a little about the FGCIA and about what the Federal Agency does for the state. Only someone who is utterly uninformed can argue that the FGCIA has a monopoly in the sphere of providing information support to state structures (and Mrs. Selivanova speaks precisely of monopolism). In fact the FGCIA is part of a system of information support for organs of state power which also includes the independent channels of the Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Committee for Statistics, Federal Counterintelligence Service, Foreign Intelligence Service, and others. But it is precisely the FGCIA that brings together the best scientific minds in the field of cryptography, specialists capable of closing any channels for the leakage of information of state importance. Recent events in the life of the intelligence services again prove that foreign states' special services have by no means slackened their work. They have perhaps just slightly reoriented it toward the economy. They are now stepping up their efforts to intercept and analyze large amounts of non-secret information, obtaining as a result valuable data about Russia's life and activity. U.S. National Security Agency intelligence satellites constantly orbit over our country's territory, vacuuming up information from unprotected communication lines and relaying it to powerful processing and analysis centers. Who can shield and safeguard information of state importance from any forms of intelligence, including satellite intelligence? The answer is clear -- only the FGCIA, with its powerful scientific and technical potential and many years of experience. Nor is there any doubt that the development of information and telecommunication systems has always been ensured by a proper level of protection of those systems. This has always been the case in all countries. I will not be able to briefly list all the conclusions of the SEGODNYA and KOMMERSANT-DAILY author regarding the FGCIA -- anyhow there is no point in doing so. I will dwell on the main ones. The elimination of the Information Resources Administration (IRA) within the structure of the President's Administration and its transfer to the FGCIA structure as a main administration is declared to be virtually a disaster. If you proceed from the essence of the matter, this merger was aimed at implementing a unified technical policy, removing the duplication that existed, enhancing the reliability and security of information and telecommunication systems in Russia's organs of state power at the center and at local level, and also precluding the unjustified and ineffective use of budget funds intended for the creation of new communications and computer systems without regard for the existing information and telecommunications resources in our country. Translating this semiofficial language into something more intelligible, let us ask: What is the point in funding several communications systems from the state budget and why should a single consumer receive the same information from two sources? But that is precisely what happened when the IRA existed. Now this kind of duplication and overspending is ruled out by the president's edict. But this is where we found Mrs. Selivanova's first "greetings" from the other side. I call it that because I can only conjecture about whose interests she is attempting to uphold. And she does this so clumsily that you can only marvel. Thus in February she reported that the president had not signed the edict about the merger of the FGCIA and the IRA because he had been warned by the newspapers. That is all the president has to do -- read papers containing articles about the IRA. Incidentally, even the "newspaper outcry" existed only in Mrs. Selivanova's articles. Perhaps she is defending the interests of former IRA leader V. Kupriyanovskiy. Defending them zealously, even stooping to slander. One of the articles says that 400 IRA staffers have been accused of political unreliability. This is sheer fantasy. Practically all IRA specialists are continuing to work in their former jobs in implementation of the president's edict "On Improving Activity in the Sphere of the Computerization of Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation." Why is Mrs. Selivanova fighting so hard for the former IRA leader? I don't think it's because of personal sympathies. But nor do I want to claim that valuable information came into the hands of the publications featuring Selivanova and their masters from the former IRA leader. As yet there is not all the necessary information on this score. I do not want to break the law. But V. Selivanova does this with little thought for the consequences. In all her articles, and especially in KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 12 March, she directly accuses the FGCIA of illegal, anticonstitutional activities in eavesdropping on the telephone and office conversations of top officials and compiling so-called "telephone files" on this basis. As is well known, the procedure for carrying out investigative operations, including eavesdropping on telephone and other conversations, is defined by the law "On Investigative Operation Activities in the Russian Federation." This indicates the range of organs entitled to carry out this activity. The FGCIA is not among them, and, in my view, the agency has proper grounds for demonstrating in court that tittle-tattle in a newspaper is very different from tittle-tattle in a kitchen or on the doorstep. I think that the persons in the president's immediate entourage whom the author of the articles is trying at all costs to set at loggerheads will also not remain indifferent to tittle-tattle in the press. Nevertheless, if you read Mrs. Selivanova's revelations closely with pencil in hand, you get the impression that the author's "greetings" could even come from the other side of Russia's state border. After all, the attack is precisely on the line of increasing the information security of organs of state power. Whether deliberately or not, Mrs. Selivanova's articles serve the interests of foreign special services, which even now, during a worldwide thaw, openly state that they obtain a considerable proportion of their information about Russia's life and activity from technical means of information transfer. Or maybe the "greetings" come from Russian mafia structures? After all, because of the flaws in bank systems they have been able to steal hundreds of billions of rubles from the state, in other words, from you and me. Remember the numerous cases of bogus advice notes. It was the FGCIA which blocked this channel for the loss of state funds. A standard for digital electronic signatures has been developed in conjunction with the Central Bank. This technical solution makes it possible to establish the addressee and the authenticity of a financial document. Forgery is now impossible. The FGCIA ciphers are good for decades, that is, it will take that long for anyone to be able to find the keys to the ciphers. All this confirms yet again the timeliness of the president's edict "On Improving Activity in the Sphere of the Computerization of Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation." And all this yet again refutes Mrs. Selivanova's newspaper articles. I also have to say a few words about the lies in her articles. I'm sorry, but it's true. FGCIA leader Aleksandr Starovoytov -- doctor of technical sciences, professor, and honored scientific and technical figure of the Russian Federation -- came to the Government Communications Agency at a time when government communications required radical renewal and modernization. As a leader of a science and production association, he came as a recognized and experienced specialist in the telecommunications sphere. That was essentially how his active service began. And what about the claim about magnetic fields surrounding the government White House? This gibberish is apparently designed for people who did not complete their elementary education. It is also totally untrue that the FGCIA engages in business by signing commercial contracts with foundations of dubious origin to supply them with "open-source information" from government structures. And the style of Mrs. Selivanova's articles: "...after two years of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable consequences of 1991 the `underground Sverdlovsk Oblast Committee' in the Kremlin in close alliance with the `underground Gazprom' in the White House and other similar structures is finally restoring both information-political and organizational control over Russia's top state leadership." Take newspapers from 1936 or 1937 -- the spirit of their articles is just the same. I am not going to ape Mrs. Selivanova in this regard and describe enthusiastically what happens to people who undermine a pillar of the state. In a democratic state everything is decided by conscience and the courts. But in the very near future we will describe the varied, useful, and very interesting activities of various structures of the Federal Government Communications and Information Agency.
