Giuseppe Tatarella, a former member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), which is now merged with the National Alliance, arrived at 0900 in the morning to attend a council of telecommunications ministers. His colleague from the Ministry of Agriculture, Adriana Poli Bortone, followed him in the afternoon, but she had already been through her trial by fire during a very courteous informal council meeting in Greece. "I Do Not Forget" In the elevator they took, and in the nerve centers of the European building, somebody had put up stickers commemorating the victims of Italian fascism. The stickers said "I do not forget." Nor has Elio Di Rupo forgotten, and he aimed to make this clear to his colleagues by reading a three-page statement in which be noted that Europe has welcomed -- for the first time within its walls -- a "political group which claims to be the heir to the form of totalitarianism that was Italian fascism in the 1930's and early 1940's." The minister from Mons, himself the son of an Italian immigrant, took his place in the meeting room a good quarter of an hour late to "show his difference." A little earlier, in front of the photographers, his colleagues also avoided shaking hands. Mr. Tatarella sat down as if nothing had happened between the Irish and Spanish delegations. The Politics, Not the Man In his speech, which he did not have officially published, Elio Di Rupo did not call either Italy or his neofascist colleague into question, but rather "the politics he symbolizes, the past which this politics evokes, and the reference it could be elsewhere in Europe." To better underscore what separates him from his Italian colleague, he then cited the universal values of Europe, such as the respect of freedoms, democracy, and others "without distinction as to nationality, religion, or sex." Speaking to the Italian press, Elio Di Rupo was even more explicit. "I had to find the line between the duty of state and the duty to keep a clear conscience," he said, sweeping aside the criticism that he would work for the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party], which is in the middle of an election campaign. All the bilateral questions between Italy and Belgium will be dealt with by the administration or through the Foreign Ministry, he added. Only the Greek minister supported the Belgian statement. Moreover, in Athens Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou also regretted the fact that the arrival of the Italian fascists "went so smoothly" in Europe. Italian Republic For his part, Giuseppe Tatarella, who has the rank of deputy prime minister in the Berlusconi government, is playing down his party's links with fascism. He sees the emergence of a new "democratic and popular" Right in Europe, and suggested meeting with the Belgian deputy prime minister to explain to him the "reality" of the National Alliance. Rome, he recalled, is preparing to welcome U.S. President Bill Clinton: "I respect all judgements, from Clinton's pragmatism to Di Rupo's perplexity." Today the National Alliance has overall responsibility for the MSI, a party which openly maintains the memory of Mussolini while playing the parliamentary game. Three ministers, including Mr. Tatarella, come from its ranks. Two years ago, the party -- which defines itself as "postfascist" -- celebrated the 70th anniversary of the march on Rome in 1922, when the blackshirts imposed the Mussolini dictatorship with the consent of King Victor Emmanuel.
