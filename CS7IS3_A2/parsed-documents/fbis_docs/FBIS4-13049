The difficulties are being resolved and the exiles could be brought together in Egypt or Jordan Monday from where they could be transferred to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Sha'th told reporters here. The delay resulted from the fact that Palestinians who were outside Jordan and Egypt needed to gain visas for the two countries, said Sha'th, who is leading negotiations with Israel on Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank town of Jericho. An official from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organisation said 17 out of the 50 Palestinians would have gone to Gaza from Egypt Sunday but for the technical problems. A first group of 50 banned Palestinians returned to the occupied territories on April 5.
