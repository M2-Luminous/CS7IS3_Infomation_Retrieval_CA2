Addressing the national and international media, the FPI leader touched on the current political, economic, and social problems facing our country. These include the devaluation of the CFA franc and its effects--whether good or bad--on us all; the political transitional period following the death of the first Ivorian president; some sections of our country's Constitution, especially the point concerning the succession issue; as well as other topics such as the election issue. Now let us listen to Laurent Gbagbo reaffirm his party's stand on Article 11 of the Constitution. [Begin Gbagbo recording] The FPI is definitely against Article 11. It is against the current application of the article. It is against Article 11 today and tomorrow. It is also against the ideology on which Article 11 is based. Republican power is not given out in hereditary manner. Power should be won and regulations must be defined for the conquest of power. There is something fishy about the fact that the authorities, after the 1990 events, rushed to rearrange this Article 11, so we must stand against it. We opposed it, we are still opposed to it, and we will still be opposed to it in future. [end recording]
