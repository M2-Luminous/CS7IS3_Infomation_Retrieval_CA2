FR940208-1-00003 FR940208-1-00001 Intergovernmental Consultation For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice, 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983) and FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;J, ``Intergovernmental Review of Farmers Home Administration Programs and Activities'' (December 23, 1983), Emergency Loans are excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Programs Affected These changes affect the following FmHA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 10.404_Emergency Loans. Environmental Impact Statement This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that the proposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Civil Justice Reform This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section 2 of the E.O. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0090, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This proposed rule does not revise or impose any new information collection or recordkeeping requirement from those approved by OMB. Discussion of Proposed Rule It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of considering disaster related assistance or compensation in the EM eligibility calculation. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the need to provide immediate assistance to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result of natural disasters also justifies the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below. Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern States and drought in 3 Southeastern States, will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance. In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the 1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require financial assistance from FmHA. The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Farmers have concluded 1993 operations, and are consulting with their lenders to plan for 1994. Farmers who have suffered severe production losses are in dire need of disaster program assistance to repay creditors and suppliers annual production loans, open supplier accounts, and installments due on intermediate and long term debts and to otherwise repair and continue their farming and ranching operations. FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the 15-day comment period.
