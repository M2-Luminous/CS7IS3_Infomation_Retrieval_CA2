FR940511-1-00125 FR940511-1-00016 (ii) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30 days of receipt of the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance fees owed will result in the claims contained within the petition being forfeited. (f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed, the payment of the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which assessment work is not required pursuant to §3851.5 of this title. However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made to the mineral patent applicant. 29. Section 3833.1&hyph;7 is revised to read as follows: §3833.1&hyph;7 Filing requirements for maintenance fee waivers. (a) A small miner exemption certification previously filed for the assessment year ending at noon on September 1, 1994, under the Act of October 5, 1992, and the pertinent regulations in effect on August 31, 1993, will be considered proper certification for a waiver of payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994. (b) The affidavit of assessment work performed by a small miner claiming a maintenance fee waiver shall be filed with the proper BLM office pursuant to §3833.2 and shall meet the requirements of §3833.2&hyph;4. (c) To obtain the small miner's waiver for the assessment year ending at noon on September 1, 1994, the affidavit of assessment work for the period of September 1, 1993, through September 1, 1994, shall be filed on or before December 30, 1994, in the proper BLM office. The certified statement required by paragraph (d) for those who are not covered by a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed in the proper BLM office on or before August 31, 1994, and shall contain all of the information required in paragraph (d). For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the filing of a certified statement pursuant to any of paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section will satisfy the requirements for filing of a notice of intention to hold pursuant to §3833.2&hyph;5, when such notice of intention to hold is otherwise required. (d) In order to hold mining claims or sites for the assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1994, each small miner shall file a certified statement on or before August 31, 1994. Each small miner shall file a certified statement on or before August 31 each year thereafter to hold the claims each assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1 of the calendar year the certification is due, through August 31, 1998. The small miner shall support the claimed waiver for each assessment year a small miner's waiver is claimed, certified, and attested to under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001. The certified statement shall contain: (1) The mining claim and site names and BLM serial numbers assigned to the mining claims and sites held by the small miner; (2) A declaration by the claimant and all related parties that they own no more than 10 mining claims and sites in total nationwide on the date the waiver is due; (3) A declaration that specifies that the assessment work requirements have been completed for the assessment year just ending; (4) The names and addresses of all owners maintaining an interest in the mining claims and sites; and (5) The signatures of all the owners of the mining claims and sites for which a waiver is claimed. (e) Pursuant to the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act, and §3851.6 of this title, a military person entering active service may file, or cause to be filed with the proper BLM office, a notice of his or her entry into active military service. (1) The notice shall be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active duty status. (2) The filing of the notice exempts the person from performing assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until 6 months have passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 months have passed from release from a military hospital, whichever is later. (3) The performance of assessment work or the payment of maintenance fees shall resume in the assessment year next following the assessment year in which the person was released from active duty or a military hospital. (4) The notice shall be filed as a certified statement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and shall list all mining claims and sites affected by claim/site name and BLM serial number. (f) Claimants holding claims that are excused from performance of assessment work by other statutes are also excused from payment of maintenance fees as part of their waivers. The claimant/owner shall file a certified statement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section on or before each August 31 in the proper BLM office, identifying the statute that exempts the claims from assessment work. 30. Section 3833.1&hyph;8 is added to read as follows: §3833.1&hyph;8 Refundability of service charges, location fees, rental and maintenance fees. (a) Service charges submitted for new recordings under §3833.1&hyph;2 are not returnable or refundable after the document received has been docketed and/or serialized. (b) Service charges submitted with documents to be filed pursuant to §§3833.2 and 3833.3 are returnable or refundable if, at the time of submission, the affected mining claim or site is determined to be null and void or abandoned and void by operation of law. (c) Rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees are not returnable or refundable unless the mining claim or site has been determined, as of the date the fees were paid, to be null and void, abandoned and void by operation of law, or otherwise forfeited.
