At a news conference Rugova said that "what is valid for Muslims and Croats must be valid for Albanians as well," explaining that the option chosen by the DSK and other Albanian political parties was "an independent and neutral Kosovo." This option is also the minimum [of Albanian demands] -- nothing less than that could be acceptable in the talks with the Serbian leadership, he said. This would be a compromise both for the Serbs and for the Albanians [as received], he believes. Rugova today denied the existence of "the Defense Ministry and other ministries of the Kosovo republic" and called [the Serb claims of their existence] "a stage-managed political process." He also denied the role of his close aide Anton Koljaj in the group, which had been discovered recently, saying that these "arrests were organized with the aim of discrediting certain personalities and efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo question." Speaking about Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for a summit of leading European and U.S. statesmen [on Bosnia], Rugova said that this was unnecessary and that "there can be no alternative to a global approach to the resolution of the crisis in former Yugoslavia." "We do not want another Yalta and a reorganization of the Balkans into spheres of interest; instead we advocate integration processes," Rugova said, and added "Russia's role in the Balkans cannot be one-sided, but it must be adapted to the international community's principles." Rugova welcomed the signing of the "Partnership" agreement between Albanian President Sali Berisha and the NATO alliance, describing it as "important for Albanian, all [ethnic] Albanians, and for the whole of the Balkans."
