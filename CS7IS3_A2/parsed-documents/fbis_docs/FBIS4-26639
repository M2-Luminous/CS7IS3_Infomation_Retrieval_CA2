The circular also laid out specific measures for providing loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises with bank loans, stipulating: State-owned industrial enterprises which are capable of producing readily marketable products and generating good economic results but lack circulating funds, shall apply to specialized banks for loans so as to acquire sufficient circulating funds. The local economic and trade commissions at all levels across the province shall take the initiative to assist the relevant specialized banks to investigate and verify the operational needs of state-owned industrial enterprises. Furthermore, the specialized banks shall actively assist state-owned industrial enterprises in this connection, particularly those enterprises that are capable of producing marketable products and generating better economic results, thereby enabling loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises to resume normal operations at an earlier date. Nevertheless, the circular stated, different situations should be handled in different fashions. For example, specialized banks shall provide proper assistance to state-owned industrial enterprises capable of reducing losses or turning losses into profits before the end of this year, thereby helping them tide over the current difficulties as quickly as possible. The circular noted: Under the leadership of the local party committees and people's governments, economic and trade commissions at all levels across the province shall cooperate with the specialized banks and departments in charge of enterprises in amalgamating and combining long-standing loss-making state-owned industrial enterprises that are incapable of repaying bank loans or cutting losses in order to enable these enterprises to either transform their production lines, develop readily marketable products, or engage in tertiary industrial development. Those state-owned industrial enterprises that are unable to improve operations after being amalgamated or combined should be declared bankrupt without delay in accordance with the law. In so doing, the circular stated, appropriate measures should be adopted to guarantee the basic livelihood of the staff and workers.
