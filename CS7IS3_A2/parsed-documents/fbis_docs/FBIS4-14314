The General Committee reviewed developments on the local scene in light of the regrettable incidents witnessed at the 'Imran camp yesterday. The General Committee issued the following statement: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle thee. And he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic verse] O masses of our great Yemeni people: The GPC has observed, with extreme concern, the developments of the regrettable criminal incident witnessed by the city of 'Imran on Wednesday. At 1200 that day, a group of the 3d Armored Brigade, acting at the behest of the separatists within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], carried out a treacherous, cowardly act against the members of the 1st Armored Brigade and innocent citizens in the city of 'Imran. They used tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery, firing shells at the personnel of the 1st Armored Brigade, when the personnel were having lunch peacefully at the dining hall where the members of the joint military committee were present. The joint military committee was on a visit to the camp as part of its efforts to check military developments and pave the way for implementing the military part of the accord document. Consequently, many members of the 1st Brigade were martyred and injured. The military situation inside the camp also flared up. The comrades-in-arms inside the camp had previously stayed together peacefully for over four years enjoying a spirit of amity and camaraderie. However, the influential separatists did not like this, so they sought to sow discord and ignite fighting between the sons of the Yemeni Armed Forces, using the commander of the 3d Armored Brigade and his accomplice in the crime and sabotage, who is called Yahya Dahish 'Alyan. Both were used as pliable, criminal tools to ignite fighting between the members of the two brigades, causing the loss of dozens of innocent martyrs of troops and citizens in the valiant city of 'Imran. The shells of the 3d Armored Brigade did not spare the homes of those citizens, thus claiming the lives of dozens of innocent martyrs and victims as a result of this treacherous, cowardly act. In addition, many homes and public facilities in the valiant city of 'Imran were destroyed. The General Committee of the GPC condemns and deplores this heinous crime, which was carried out by certain YSP leaders and which happened at a time when national and political peaceful efforts are being dedicated to the implementation of the accord document, signed in Amman on 20 February, 1994. The crime also took place at a time when efforts were being exerted to bring the state institutions closer to a peaceful and positive relaxation of the crisis, which was engineered by the advocates of separation who rebelled against democracy, unity, peace, and peaceful coexistence. This stand is being repeated with every step made toward a relaxation of the crisis and containment of its developments and the beginning of the implementation of the accord document. It began in Abyan when the situation flared up against the forces of al-'Amaliqah, Shabwah and Harth Sufyan, in addition to the reckless acts carried out by the camp of the Ba-Fahd Brigade, terrorizing defenseless citizens in the city of Dhamar. This situation is being repeated today in the city of 'Imran through the forces of the 3d Armored Brigade, which caused the martyrdom of dozens of victims. While expressing its regret, warm sympathies, and consolation for all the families of the innocent victims who fell in the premeditated criminal incident -- all of them being sons of the one Yemeni homeland and whose chaste blood and precious lives are dear to all of us -- the General Committee appeals to the heroic troops, noncommissioned officers, and officers of our valiant Armed Forces to rise to the level of their national responsibility and match the expectations of their people as protectors of the homeland and a shield of its unity and democratic approach. It also appeals to them to be vigilant so as to avert all schemes that target the homeland, its unity, security, and stability. They should not heed the orders issued by the influential separatists within the YSP who seek to throw them into an inferno of death and fighting with their brothers and comrades-in-arms, who stand with them in one trench defending the homeland, the revolution, the republic, and unity. Those influential separatists want to satisfy their sick whims and narrow personal interests, having been blinded by the glitter of [word indistinct] money paid by the enemies of the Yemeni homeland to ignite fighting between the sons of the Yemeni people, divide the homeland, and harm its unity and democracy. The General Committee also appeals to all parties, factions, and mass organizations and unions to condemn such criminal stupidity, reject calls for separation and division, and close ranks to unify the sincere national will so as to implement the accord document by showing collective responsibility. This will spare the homeland the danger of falling into the trap of this conspiracy that targets the will of the people, their unity, security and stability. The General Committee stresses dialogue as a means to resolve all differences. It also asserts that the accord document should be translated into reality, without hesitation or procrastination, since this document is the common denominator between all parties, in order to build a modern Yemeni state. The General Committee urges the masses of our people to demonstrate more vigilance and alertness and reject and denounce this conspiracy that aims at dragging the country toward more fighting, fragmentation, and sedition. It also reiterates the appeal made by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the GPC, to the constitutional, legitimate institution -- the House of Representatives -- to assume all its legal and constitutional responsibilities to put an end to these stupid, criminal acts that threaten the safety, security, and stability of the homeland and citizens. This will safeguard and protect unity, enhance and protect constitutional legitimacy, and protect the citizens and the homeland from the intrigues of enemies and conspirators. Glory and immortality to the martyrs of unity; death to plotters against unity. Allah will certainly aid those who aid His cause; for verily Allah is full of strength, exalted in might, able to enforce His will. [Koranic verse] Issued by the General Committee of the GPC.
