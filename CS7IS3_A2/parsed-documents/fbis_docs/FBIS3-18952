Pascal Lissouba went to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Yesterday he was received by President Mitterrand. He also had talks with Michel Roussin, the minister of cooperation. To sum up for us so far on Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris, here is Monique Mas: [Mas] Pascal Lissouba has decided to turn the page on the Franco-Congolese quarrel. He hopes that French severity was perhaps the expression of the fact that it had entertained too high hopes of him, and the Congolese president is stressing that he has already taken a first step by settling the oil dispute to the benefit of French interests and to the detriment of the American Oxy oil company. He also denies having tried to play on Franco-American rivalries. In Lissouba's view, the Cold War is over anyway, and no one is interested in Africa any more. Nevertheless, Congo greatly misses its oil revenue. With a 70 percent debt to France [as heard], Lissouba's predecessor had obtained advances from the French oil company Elf, and Congolese oil is mortgaged until about 2010. The coffers are empty, but President Lissouba has no choice but to rise to the challenge both economically and as far as domestic politics are concerned. Having got his fingers burned by his first experiment with a government with 60 percent of the ministers coming from the opposition, he is now counting on decentralization to ensure civil peace. [Announcer] Congolese students in Paris invaded the premises of their embassy this morning to protest at the nonpayment of their scholarships for 16 months.
