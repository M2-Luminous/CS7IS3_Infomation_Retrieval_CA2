IV Prohibited Conduct Defendant is permanently enjoined and restrained as follows: A. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that obtains branded ATM network access from defendant to obtain any ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant. Defendant shall not maintain or enforce any rule, policy, contract, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which defendant requires any depository institution to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant; that prohibits or purports to prohibit a depository institution from obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any third party processor; or that conditions MAC membership or availability of MAC or any successor branded ATM network access on any depository institution's obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant or not obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor. B. Defendant shall not sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing or authorization processing services from any other person. C. Defendant shall not establish as any condition, agreement, or understanding with respect to access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, or the price or terms of such access, membership, or switching, that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing or authorization processing services from any other person. Defendant shall not impose any additional fees on any depository institution based on its obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any person other than defendant, except that defendant may impose additional fees for set-up and establishment of the network. Defendant will not require an unreasonable amount of set-up and establishment testing and certification. The aggregate of set-up and/or establishment fees charged to a depository institution, as allowed by this paragraph, and/or its third party processor, as allowed by paragraph IV.E.2 of this Final Judgment, shall not exceed $100 per person hour expended by Defendant up to a maximum of $1,000 unless significant difficulties that require additional work are caused by the third party processor or the depository institution. In such case, Defendant will charge $100 per hour for the next 40 person hours and $250 per hour for each additional hour that it expends. The hourly rates and maximum fees set forth in this paragraph may be adjusted over the term of this Final Judgment in accordance with the Consumer Price Index. D. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of a depository institution to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing for access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant from any qualified third party processor. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that obtains ATM processing or authorization processing from a third party processor to obtain any other service that is not required to provide such ATM or authorization processing from that processor or from any other person. E. Defendant shall provide qualified third party processors with nondiscriminatory branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant that is at least equal in type and quality to the access defendant: (a) Provides to intercept processors, and (b) provided to intercept processors as of the date of the commencement of this action. Defendant shall not deny any qualified third party processor access to telecommunications ports or links necessary for the third party processor to provide ATM processing or authorization processing for depository institutions obtaining ATM network access from defendant. Defendant shall permit qualified third party processors to aggregate transactions of multiple banks over one or several telecommunications links and ports as technically reasonable, and defendant shall not require third party processors to obtain a separate link or port for each of its depository institution customers. A third party processor is qualified, within the meaning of this Final Judgment, if it completes defendant's certification process and meets: 1. The technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors that provide services to only one depository institution established by defendant and in effect as of the date of commencement of this action, or such other reasonable and nondiscriminatory technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors hereafter established by defendant; and
