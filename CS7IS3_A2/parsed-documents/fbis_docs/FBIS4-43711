This is an offensive which the prime minister hopes to contain by relying on his political contacts, especially within the liberal-centrist confederation, and by relaunching the government's action. The UDF and RPR leaderships did not take long to learn the lessons of the majority's division in the European elections. Charles Millon, chairman of the UDF group in the National Assembly who is close to Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on the one hand; and RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe and his deputy Jean-Louis Debre, who are both close to Jacques Chirac, on the other, have reached the same conclusion: The majority will find it difficult to present a single candidate in the first round of the presidential election. It is the success of Mr. de Villiers' list in the European elections which has just reduced this likelihood, they explain, without regretting it too much. The chasm into which [former Socialist Party, PSF Secretary General] Michel Rocard, the former "natural candidate of the PSF," fell on 12 June permits an extremely bold stance. For instance, Mr. Millon has just stated that the "majority union is not enough." Mr. Debre talks of "the obvious impossibility of preventing a particular majority figure from seeking the supreme office...." Mr. Juppe, also thinking about the presidential election, wondered whether it would not have been preferable in the European elections to "organize a competition with one candidate for each of the big families" of the majority. From questions to calculations, the UDF and RPR leaderships postponed the question of the single candidate in 1995 and proposed, in the meantime, a "contract" to the majority leaders. In his "contract," Mr. Millon calls on the UDF and RPR each to establish a plan for the coming seven-year term. After that, he explained with false naivete, the majority will see whether it should have one or several candidates in the presidential election. Mr. Juppe, speaking on the RPR's behalf, has just given approval to this approach. In his "contract," Mr. Debre was anxious to reaffirm that "the political parties should not impose their plan on the candidate for the supreme office," because it is for him and him alone to present his plan, according to Gaullist precepts. Chirac in Readiness This detail comes at the right time, because Jacques Chirac is now ready to present the broad outlines of his presidential platform. The ideal, for the Chirac supporters, would therefore be for the UDF and RPR leaderships to agree to "bury," at least temporarily, the principle of the single candidate. Then, between now and the long vacation, Jacques Chirac should sound out the majority with some of his proposals. If no more than some 20 UDF deputies, among all those who are being approached by the RPR leadership, approve of the broad outlines put forward, Jacques Chirac, taking care not to officially enter the race, would have given greater credibility to his candidacy for the highest office. This is obviously all just conjecture. Mr. Chirac, who had discovered on his return from Vietnam that his close aides were thinking of him to head the majority list in the European elections, is currently in the United States. In addition, [Interior Minister] Pasqua and [Assembly Speaker] Seguin are due to express their views on Sunday [19 June]. The most elementary courtesy therefore makes it necessary not to move too quickly. For his part, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, who also hopes to play his presidential card, has announced that between now and the summer, he would make proposals "for the return to full employment." But the UDF president is not in a good position in the opinion polls, and the Republican Party leadership, currently the guardian of Mr. Balladur's interests, is trying to resist him. "We want to exist and we do not want others to make decisions for us," Ladislas Poniatowski said yesterday on Monte Carlo Radio, to explain the PR deputies' latest acrobatic maneuver. This party's spokesman said that "we must seek a candidate who attracts the greatest possible consensus." And that "it is obvious that" Edouard Balladur "now has this image more than the others."
