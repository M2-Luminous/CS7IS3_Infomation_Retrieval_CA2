Netanyahu told a Tel Aviv news conference that a year ago he presented a map in the Knesset showing the stages of withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and Rabin denied the remarks. Today, Netanyahu said, I have proof that it is precisely the map Christopher is presenting President al-Asad in Syria. Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Refa'el Eytan submitted a paper offered to him as a basis for negotiations on his joining the coalition three months ago. He said the paper claims that no settlement would be uprooted, the Golan settlements would be strengthened, and all the completed apartments would be inhabited. These points were also shown to be false, Eytan said. The prime minister's bureau said in response that there has not been any change in Israel's position on peace with Syria since the establishment of the government, and the commitment to hold a national referendum prior to any signing of a peace agreement with Syria that involves territorial concessions remains intact .
