FR940928-2-00117 FR940928-2-00067 (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The USAR safety analysis assumes five MSSVs per steam generator are operable. However, as shown above, this change results in no steam generator overpressure event or increase in the radiological dose. Therefore, this change will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Changes to Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.b ``Auxiliary Feedwater System'' The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and TS 3.4.b governing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators are being combined and titled, ``Auxiliary Feedwater System.'' This change is consistent with the format of ``Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,'' NUREG&hyph;1431. In addition to the formatting changes, a number of technical changes are being proposed. These are: _The correction of an inconsistency between current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and current TS 3.4.6.2.A. _The addition of a seven (7) day Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for one steam supply to the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump. _An addition to allow the AFW control switches located in the control room to be placed in the ``pull out'' position and valves AFW&hyph;2A and AFW&hyph;2B to be in a throttled position when below 15% reactor power without declaring the corresponding AFW train inoperable. An inconsistency currently exists between current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and current TS 3.4.b.2.A. TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 requires the system piping and valves directly associated with providing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators to be operable, with a corresponding 48 hour limiting condition for operation (LCO) action statement if this requirement is not met. TS 3.4.b.2.A allows one auxiliary feedwater pump to be inoperable for 72 hours. This arrangement can cause a conflict regarding which TS is applicable depending on which component in the auxiliary feedwater flowpath to the steam generators is inoperable. By moving all TS action statements to TS 3.4.b, the inconsistency between TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and TS 3.4.b.2.A will be eliminated. The requirement to maintain the operability of the system piping and valves directly associated with providing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators remains, but is being modified to prevent removing both AFW supply headers from service for 48 hours. Proposed TS 3.4.b.2.A is being added to allow one steam supply to the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump to be inoperable for seven days. This addition is consistent with ``Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,'' NUREG&hyph;1431. The seven day completion time is reasonable based on the redundant steam supplies to the pump, the availability of the redundant motor-driven AFW pumps, and the low probability of an event occurring that requires the inoperable steam supply to the turbine driven AFW pump. For these reasons, this change will have no adverse affect on the health and safety of the public. Proposed TS 3.4.b.5 permits the AFW Pump control switches located in the control room to be placed in the ``pull out'' position and valves AFW&hyph;2A and AFW&hyph;2B to be in a throttled position when below 15% reactor power without declaring the corresponding AFW train inoperable. This change is proposed to resolve concerns regarding the cycling of the AFW pumps and the throttling of valves AFW&hyph;2A and AFW&hyph;2B during plant startups and shutdowns. Analysis shows that control room operators have a minimum of ten minutes to initiate auxiliary feedwater flow after a design basis accident with no steam generator dryout or core damage. All accidents which rely on AFW flow for mitigation were reanalyzed to support this change. These analyses were completed assuming an initial power of 100%. However, a 15% reactor power restriction has been implemented on placing the AFW pump control switches located in the control room in the ``pull out'' position and throttling valves AFW&hyph;2A and AFW&hyph;2B. This restriction in effect limits use of TS 3.4.b.5 to plant start-ups, shutdowns and other low power operating conditions. This change alters the assumptions of the safety analysis for the Small-Break Loss of Coolant Accident, the Steam Generator Tube Rupture and the Loss of Normal Feedwater due to their dependence on the AFW system to start and supply AFW for heat removal. To support this change, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation performed an analysis of the Small-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident using the NOTRUMP code assuming ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. This analysis resulted in a Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) of 1053 ○F from an initial power level of 100%. All other acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 were [also] met. This large margin to the 2200 ○F PCT limit supports ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. Furthermore, WPSC has analyzed the Loss of Normal Feedwater and the Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident assuming delays in the initiation of auxiliary feedwater. The Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident with a ten minute delay in the initiation of Auxiliary Feedwater does not result in any adverse condition in the core. It does not result in water relief from the pressurizer safety valves, nor does it result in uncovering the tube sheets of the steam generators. Also, at all times the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) remained greater than 1.30. The Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident with no auxiliary feedwater flow was also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that neither steam generator empties of liquid and at least 20 ○F of reactor coolant system subcooling is maintained throughout the transient. Also, there is no increase in the radiological dose to the public. Ten minutes is an acceptable time for operator action because four independent alarms in the control room would initiate operator action to place the AFW pump control switches to the ``auto'' position and initiate AFW flow to the steam generators when necessary. These include two steam generator lo level alarms (one per steam generator), and two steam generator lo-lo level alarms (one per steam generator). Provisions also exist to add additional low level alarms on the plant process computer. In addition to these alarms, control room operators have twelve other indications of insufficient, or no, AFW flow to the steam generators. These indications include three auxiliary feedwater pump low discharge pressure alarms (one per AFW pump), two auxiliary feedwater flow meters (one per steam generator), two AFW pump motor amp meters (one per motor-driven AFW pump), two ``ESF in Pullout'' alarms (one per Engineered Safety Features train) and three pump running lights (one per AFW pump). The ten minutes for operator action was discussed in a telephone conversation between WPSC and Mr. R. Laufer (NRR). Ten minutes for operator action is further supported by Branch Technical Position EISCB 18. Scenarios have been completed on the KNPP simulator to support ten minutes for operator initiation of AFW flow. In all cases, operators manually initiated AFW flow within the allowed ten minutes. For these reasons, this change will have no adverse affect on the health and safety of the public or significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
