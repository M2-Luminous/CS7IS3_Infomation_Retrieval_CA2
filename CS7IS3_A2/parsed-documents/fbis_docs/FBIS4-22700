Words and Deeds": "A Rehearsal of the Southward Charge?"] [Text] Krasnodar-Moscow--It is hard to work with the common voter at present. No inducements will lure him into politics. Besides, Zhirinovskiy has set Russia on its ears, and he still will not quit. However, the Communists of the Kuban would not surrender. They have traditionally called on their electorate to be active, hoping to keep their position in the region through elections to the local legislative assembly. However, there is no way that they will outdo the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. The people will not be carried along by the mind, the honor, and the conscience now. The school of communism is behind us, and Zhirinovskiy's PTU [Vocational Technical School] is beginning. In the Kuban the PTU is headed by Vladimir Serdyukov, whose hallmarks are a quick wit and obedience. So, he appeared to have made it to the State Duma on the LDPR ticket, and he would be now sitting in Moscow, at the Mir hotel, eating bananas. However, following a meeting with the leadership in Moscow he did not covet bananas, but surrendered his seat to whoever it was due. Well done, fine fellow, everyone should know his place. This is the kind of cadres Vladimir Volfovich has! Communists and democrats who man different sides of the barricades are looking on with envy. However, this is not the only forte of the hero of the LDPR. Working in the kray newspaper KUBANSKIY KURYER, in the past the only powerful democratic newspaper, he adapted it to the needs of the party. The newspaper produces the right advertisement, gets the brains of the electorate ready for the difficult moment of elections, and...the LDPR headquarters has premises, too. However, it is, of course, not Serdyukov alone that makes the Kuban of the LDPR tick. Paid emissaries annunciate Zhirinovskiy's truth to the cities and villages day and night, at times enticing (or perhaps fooling) 40-50 of our citizens at one go. By now there is not a rayon seat, not even the most inconsequential, in which an LDPR chapter has not been created out of its supporters. Are there 50 seats in the legislative assembly of the kray? This means that there will be 50 candidates, one in each district. Serdyukov is confident, he has done good work with the branch; besides, there is money. Therefore, 20-30 LDPR candidates will definitely make it to the assembly. However, Serdyukov is modest and keeps silent about the main actual invention, the patent for which is worthy of a PTU. How and where did he come up with the candidates for power? So, the Zhirinovists (or more precisely, Serdyukovists--knock on wood, or it might go to his head) work with the second echelon of the now active executive authorities. Young deputy leaders with promise who have authority in the collective are the objects of their closest attention. A marvelous pie emerges: In some places the Communists have made their way to the top of the bill, and the Zhirinovists are second. The former think that they are in in earnest and for a long time to come once again, and they even put portraits of the beloved Ilich back in their old places. The latter yawn apathetically--power is almost within their grasp, and suddenly look back convulsively to see whether the first ones have not joined up with the third ones. Since time immemorial the agro-industrial complex has been the third political force in the Kuban. It is very powerful. However much Dyakonov, former governor of the kray, tried to convert to owner-operated farming and to organize strong peasant farms (17,000 peasant farms were created under him in 15 months), he was "made to go" long ago. This statistic has not increased; on the contrary, it is about to slip sharply. The new governor Yegorov is convinced that only kolkhozes can feed Russia. This is precisely what the agrarians named the block in which they united: "Rich Kuban--Rich Russia." The block does not intend to engage in doing the old material over. Its membership is respectable: In addition to the leading kolkhoz members, the corps of directors and the leaders of the largest organizations of Krasnodar Kray belong to it. Besides, the task set by the powers that be is respectable, too. The supreme echelons of power have resolved to flex their muscles and play Russia's card by creating the Azov-Black Sea Republic. Given this, one sees the name of the bloc as ambiguous. In theory this maneuver should get Mr. Shakhray interested. We will set out further into the boundless political expanse of the Kuban, this time looking for democrats. Where are they? Will we hear their voice from the Kuban? Valeriy Fisyun, chairman of the executive committee of the Congress of Democratic Patriotic Forces of the Kuban, informed us with a hint of sadness: "Indeed, very little room is left for the democrats; the political niche has been virtually filled. Finding 50 candidates in order to win the elections to the legislative assembly is a very difficult task." What kind of organization is this one that stands ready to pick an unequal fight with the local colossi? "The Congress was formed in October of last year. Virtually all democratic parties of the region, the Cossacks--the so-called White Cossack host of the Kuban, the Cossack association of Russia, the farmers--AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and various creative arts and scientific unions joined the Congress. In the region, most of the parties are small and cannot influence the political situation on their own. This is why the idea of an association developed, all the more so that an election to the Federal Assembly was forthcoming, during which we got our first 'baptism by fire.' Along with the Congress, which adopted programmatic resolutions On Power, On Grain, On Land, and On Privatization, a party was created--the Kuban Revival Union. The democrats stated that at present there is no democratic power in the Kuban; this means that it should be fought for, and it should be explained to the population that the democrats were not the ones to bring about decay in the Kuban, the perversion of privatization, and other troubles. They have never had anything to do with this. The party has got itself a newspaper now; its first issue is being prepared for publication under the title KRAY KUBANSKIY. Much is being concealed from the population. It will wake up once and learn that nothing belongs to it anymore, that land, means of production, and everything else have owners. We must tell the population the truth. Very soon people will learn the documented truth. We are preparing, and will soon hold the second congress on the topic 'Corruption of Power.' It is a pity that Kazannik has quit as prosecutor general." "What would you have told him about?" "We would have told him about the political underpinnings of the affair involving the merger of the city of Anapa with Anapskiy Rayon and plans for the creation of the resort region of Anapa, in keeping with which the liquidation of the city executive authorities is planned, as well as the removal from his duties of the mayor of Anapa, Korolev, who (in keeping with a directive of the government) has for two years been preparing documents on granting Anapa the status of a federal city and the all-Russian family-type children's resort for recreation for parents with children. "We would have told him about a gas terminal which they intend to build on the Taman; this may influence the ecological situation in the area of Anapa adversely. However, this private, joint Russo-American enterprise has close ties to Chernomyrdin's son. "We would like to tell many things. We have enough documents in which the personal interests of supreme officials in the Kuban are traced." As you can see, the democrats have things to say; the agrarians have things to dream about; the Communists know how to restore order, whereas the Zhirinovists will take power in the Kuban by creeping into the legislative assembly without any unnecessary noise.
