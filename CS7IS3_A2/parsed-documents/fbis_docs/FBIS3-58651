Now, however, Gianfranco Fini, secretary and the "ferryman" of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] toward the National Alliance, is taking another step. On the very eve of the two assizes that, just a few days apart, will lead to the birth of the "Alliance" and will restore the MSI, Fini disclosed to IL GIORNALE: "The National Alliance will be the confederation of several players and not just an electoral cartel. What must unite the MSI and the Alliance is a strong awareness of values. Let me explain: The full acceptance of democracy as a system as well as a method, faith in the free market, labor as a player in the economy, and the nation as a focus for synthesis and solidarity. The aim is clear: We must avoid Italy falling into the clutches of [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto." [Guiglia] Is the "democratic" turnaround a strategic move or is it merely propaganda to be able to participate in the "moderate pole?" [Fini] There is an electoral and political bargaining table on the Left where Communist Renaissance Chairman Cossutta and Republican La Malfa are about to sit down with Occhetto from the PDS. On the other hand, the Italian people must know that we are now back to square one, since a similar and opposing alignment is needed -- but there is none. Italians must also know that it is not the fault of the Right if the moderates are split. The person responsible for that is called Mario Segni, the leader of the national rebirth "hesitaters," and the one who deceives the electorate by maintaining that he wants to be different from Occhetto but refusing to have anything to do with us. PDS man D'Alema is right -- deals are done with those who have the votes: the MSI in the center and south and in the border regions, and the League in the north. Segni is not an alternative to the PDS but is the whitewashed savior of [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli and Rosy Bindi of the new People's Party that is not yet born but which is already suffering from its fatal attraction to the PDS. [Guiglia] How can you speak of the "free market" when you are accused of representing a "statist" party? [Fini] Here there are at least two major misunderstandings to clear up. The National Alliance will not be statist, just as the MSI does not want to be statist. Believing in the state means caring for its weakest members and giving those regions in difficulty the conditions enabling them to develop themselves. National solidarity -- and even the pope has said this -- is exactly the opposite of patron-and-client welfarism and of the choices of real socialism implemented by those who have been in power for many years. The other major deception is called federalism. In Italy we need strong decentralization which does not, however, distance citizens but brings them closer to their -- today inefficient -- state. Presidentialism is the freeway of the Second Republic. [Guiglia] Do you accept the definition of you as a "liberal-democrat?" [Fini] Labels do not make any difference. Now even Zhirinovskiy considers himself to be a liberal-democrat, only to ally himself with the neo-Nazis in half of Europe. I simply feel myself to be a nationalist in the modern and Western sense of the word. I reject any kind of chauvinism or imperialism. I love my country as much as I love freedom. [Guiglia] Be honest: Do you really think that with the PDS in the government we will see Cossacks coming to drink at the fountains of Saint Peter's? [Fini] There will, of course, be no return to the events of 1948. However, that is not a good reason to accept that the legitimate heirs of communism should take control thanks to a new electoral system that may give them the majority of seats in Parliament, even though they will certainly not win the majority of the Italian people's vote. To carry out the operation we need to find someone like Segni, ready to gather the consensus of the moderates and then become prime minister and head of a coalition of the People's Party, the PDS, and the Democratic Alliance. Naturally this would be under the banner of a precondition -- the requirement of nonetheless having to form a government of guarantee because of a uninominal electoral model that did not include the direct election of the prime minister or of the president of the republic which we repeatedly urged. [Guiglia] To be together, everyone must give something up. The League no longer speaks of federalism. What will be the National Alliance's "step back?" [Fini] Certain hypocritical moderates have applauded [League Secretary Umberto] Bossi who was one day waving the flag of federalism and the next day was happy with regionalism. They are the same people who now are trying to say no to the National Alliance, even knowing full well that if we won tomorrow we would not be forcing anyone to put on the black shirts again. The reality is that Bossi is just putting on a show, whereas the National Alliance is a true change of direction. Give something up? We will give up the presumption that Segni has not given up: believing that we can win on our own. [Guiglia] Who should be the moderates' candidate for the Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? [Fini] Certainly not Bossi, who is not at all popular in the center and south and seriously losing his popularity in the north. [Guiglia] Is [Fininvest chairman Silvio] Berlusconi a colleague or an opponent to be fought? [Fini] Berlusconi is an important interlocutor who, unlike Segni, is clear and straightforward. The one we have to beat is Occhetto.
