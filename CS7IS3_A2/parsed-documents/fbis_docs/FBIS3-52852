If Syria is willing to establish full diplomatic relations and open borders, Israel is willing to withdraw on the Golan -- not from the Golan -- following the formula that the depth of withdrawal equals the depth of peace. Speaking to our correspondent, Deputy Minister Beilin said that an agreement has been reached with the Palestinians that the entire West Bank will be demilitarized with no Palestinian army or guns, and that Israel will militarily supervise the entire West Bank. At the same time, whether an Israeli military presence at every location in the West Bank is necessary still needs to be discussed.
