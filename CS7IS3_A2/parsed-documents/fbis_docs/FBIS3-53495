In a statement to JANA, the source said "while we welcome the Chinese stance and support it, we would like to stress that this stance coincides with continuous call of the Great Jamahiriyah for the [word indistinct] reconstruct the U.N granting all peoples a role on the basis of justice and equality in accordance with its charter to which those peoples responded to the invitation to join this international organisation especially as the smaller nations began to fear for their future before the current state of the U.N which became the voice of only the major countries hence the international organisation is being harnessed to serve the interests and objectives of most powerful countries. [no closing quotation marks as received] The source pointed out that the Great Jamahiriyah, being at the forefront of the peoples harmed by the current situation and control of the Security Council by the major powers, sees in the stance of China a major support for the position of the smaller nations who are fearing for their future in the light of the change of international organisation into an instrument of threats against peoples and plots against their future and spreading war amongst them instead of being a secure refuge for peoples seeking to safeguard their future, an instrument for the protection of their rights and maintenance of a genuine peace in the world. The leader of the revolution pointed out, on many occasions, that the time has come for the restructuring of the U.N and changing the Security Council as an organ of all nations and that this change is the right of all member states and peoples to whom it should be referred and discussed and express an opinion about it and that the move towards opening the door of granting permanent membership and veto in the Security Council only to the industrial major powers is an orientation to crush the smaller nations who suffered a great deal from the monopoly of veto by the major powers for which these nations continue to pay the price. Thus the revision of the veto power is required so that the decision making power should lie in the hands of the General Assembly or the in the hands of all member peoples of this organisation.
