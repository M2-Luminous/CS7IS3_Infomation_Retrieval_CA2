The remarks came moments before it transpired that Macri would be summoned to court on charges of tax evasion while importing cars to the country. "Nobody can doubt that Francisco Macri is one of the people to have brought the highest amount of investment into the country and that he has breathed new life into the car industry," Menem told reporters in Government House before leaving for Chile yesterday to witness today's inauguration of new Chilean President Eduardo Frei. However he added that his personal view should in no way influence the decision of the national courts and in particular that of Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, who has been investigating the claims of tax evasion. In reference to other news Menem touched upon the controversy surrounding alleged bribes demanded by the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners medical plan, saying that the accusations against the organization's head, Matilde Menendez, were part of a "scaremongering" campaign. He also hinted that Menendez, who will be standing for election to the Constituent Assembly on April 10 on behalf of the Justicialist Party in the Federal Capital, was being targeted as part of a political witch-hunt. "These (accusations) will continue to be bandied about by real mafiosos who are part of the political set-up and are intent upon damaging her candidacy," Menem told reporters. [passage omitted]
