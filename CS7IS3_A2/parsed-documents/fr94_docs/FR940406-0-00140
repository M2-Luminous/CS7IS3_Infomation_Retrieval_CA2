FR940406-0-00140 FR940406-0-00011 25. A new §86.098&hyph;24 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;24 Test vehicles and engines. Section 86.098&hyph;24 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.096&hyph;24. Where a paragraph in §86.096&hyph;24 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;24, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24.'' (a) introductory text through (a)(4) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24. (a)(5) The gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be divided into groupings which are expected to have similar evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics (as applicable) throughout their useful life. Each group of vehicles with similar evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate evaporative/refueling emission family. (a)(6) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative/refueling emission family, vehicles must be similar with respect to the items listed in paragraphs (a)(6) (i) through (xii) of this section. (i) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, crankcase). (ii) Basic canister design. (A) Working capacity_grams adsorption within a 10g. range. (B) System configuration_number of canisters and method of connection (i.e., series, parallel). (C) Canister geometry, construction and materials. (iii) Fuel system. (iv) Type of refueling emission control system_non-integrated or integrated with the evaporative control system. Further, if the system is non-integrated, whether or not any other evaporative emissions, e.g. diurnal or hot soak emissions, are captured in the same storage device as the refueling emissions. (v) Fillpipe seal mechanism_mechanical, liquid trap, other. (vi) Fill limiter system. (vii) Vapor control system or method of controlling vapor flow through the vapor line to the canister. (viii) Vapor/liquid separator usage. (ix) Purge system (valve, purge strategy and calibrations). (x) Vapor hose diameter and material. (xi) Canister location (front, rear, mid-vehicle). (xii) Onboard diagnostic hardware and calibrations.
