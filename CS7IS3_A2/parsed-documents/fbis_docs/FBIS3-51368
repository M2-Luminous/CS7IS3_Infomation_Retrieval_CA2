According to official estimates, Honduras will produce 35 million cases in 1994, compared to 40 million produced in 1993. The reasons given for this were floods at the end of 1993 and EC protectionist measures. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1637 GMT 12 Jan) Honduran international reserves dropped approximately $100 million during the past few months, to the point that there are only $131 million in the Central Bank vaults. This is only enough foreign exchange to back imports for one month, official sources reported on 12 January. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1632 GMT 12 Jan 94) Finance Ministry official William Chong reported that the government failed to collect 1 billion lempiras in taxes, including sales and income taxes. Chong admitted that this is due in part to corruption and irregularities in the Customs Department. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 3)
