Our correspondent Ihor Bak was present at this briefing. [Begin Bak recording] First of all, I would like to clarify the matter for those who had not read this article. It says that Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, disclaims responsibility for the safety of nuclear missiles deployed on Ukrainian soil. He reported on his decision in an official letter to the Russian defense minister. IZVESTIYA cites this letter and the facts which, as IZVESTIYA puts it, can cause social explosion in the missile units deployed on Ukrainian territory and produce unforeseeable consequences. Therefore, at the briefing, Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian deputy defense minister, refuted all the figures and facts cited by IZVESTIYA. He admitted as trustworthy only the information on the number of launchers for SS-19 and SS-24 missiles which remained in combat readiness. Ivan Bizhan deemed as an invention claims that the commander of the 43d Missile Army Uladymir Mikhtyuk was forced to swear the Ukrainian loyalty oath. He is commander of the Army in which the prevailing majority of officers and warrant officers had voluntarily sworn allegiance to Ukraine. Moreover, history [as heard] makes officers -- who for some reasons do not want to do it -- swear loyalty to Ukraine. Due to the fact that they are specialists needed by Ukraine, nobody dismisses them from their positions. The officer strength level in the Ukrainian Missile Forces stands at over 85 percent and not at 60 percent, as IZVESTIYA reports. There are no reasons to make a fuss concerning the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, stated Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk, at the briefing. At the same time, he drew the attention of the journalists to the fact that IZVESTIYA had more than once published texts of coded messages and other classified documents. Therefore, this newspaper violates the agreement on state secrets signed by CIS states. [end recording]
