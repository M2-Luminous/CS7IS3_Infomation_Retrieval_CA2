He told a news conference in Kiev on Monday [16 May] that each country would detail a motorized infantry company for the exercise, to take place in Poland. Radetskyy said Ukraine's Odessa and Cis-Carpathian Military Districts had already prepared training grounds for future Partnership for Peace exercises. He said none of the participant states should be allowed to "enjoy priority" in the scheme, which "some of the states seek." Earlier the same day Radetskyy said "the content of the neutral status of Ukraine needs a more precise definition." "Our noninterference in efforts to ensure the security of the common European home would be difficult to understand," he said at a news conference held for him and his visiting Austrian counterpart, Werner Fasslabend. "It is not only the security of Ukraine that is our concern. What's happening to our neighbors also concerns us. If there's trouble in a neighboring state, it may speread to our country too," he said.
