Their aim, according to a UN spokesman in Kigali, is to clear the road between the capital, Kigali, and Butare, south of it. Violent fighting took place today. The government forces are concentrating their efforts north and south of Kigali. The evacuation of civilians in the town by the United Nations has been suspended because of a lack of gasoline. In a separate development, the White Fathers have announced the killing of a Spanish missionary. He is believed to have been shot in the zone controlled by the RPF. Three other missionaries are still reported missing in the prefecture of Byumba, in the north of the country. That zone is controlled by the RPF.
