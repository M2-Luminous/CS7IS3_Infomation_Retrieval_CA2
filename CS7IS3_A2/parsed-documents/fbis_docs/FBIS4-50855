According to official newspapers, since June 1992, the six priests, including Hsia Yu, have entered Fujian repeatedly, carrying large quantities of "Tien-tao" classics and ceremonial equipment under the cover of making investments and running factories. They have made wide contacts with possible followers and propagated "Tien-tao" teachings everywhere. They did not hesitate to spend large sums of money to support the construction of pulpits. They set up eight fixed altars and one temporary altar in eight places, including Zhuanghu Lane and Donghu Road in downtown Quanzhou, the town of Fuqiao, the city of Nanan, Huian County, and the city of Zhangzhou and recruited more than 400 followers. On 17 April this year, while once again making their way into Fujian and conducting activities there, the six priests, including Hsia Yu, were caught red-handed. The Quanzhou police are currently interrogating and educating the six priests, including Hsia Yu. Altar masters at home, including Xu Huilian, were given subpoenas and education and were ordered to remove their pulpits.
