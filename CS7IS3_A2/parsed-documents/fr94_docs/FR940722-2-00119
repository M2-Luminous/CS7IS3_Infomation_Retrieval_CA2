FR940722-2-00119 FR940722-2-00074 Federal Railroad Administration Petition for Waiver of Compliance In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received a request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) [Waiver Petition Docket Number PB&hyph;94&hyph;3] Amtrak is seeking a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Power Brakes and Drawbars Regulations, 49 CFR Part 232. Amtrak is requesting that it be permitted to extend the clean, oil, test and stencil (COT&S) period from 36 months to 48 months on all passenger cars equipped with 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment. Section 232.17(b)(2) states_``Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired, lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less frequently than as required in Standard S&hyph;045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices of the Association of American Railroads (AAR).'' Paragraph 2.1.2 of Standard S&hyph;045 (AAR Manual Section A, Part III) currently specifies 36 months for 26&hyph;C Type Brake Equipment. FRA Docket Number H&hyph;91&hyph;2 authorized Amtrak to conduct a four year test of the 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment on 50 cars of their 103 Horizon car fleet built between May 1989 and January 1990. A tear down inspection of five representative cars was conducted after the four year service period. The test has now been concluded and a final report indicating satisfactory performance of the brake equipment over the four year test period has been issued. As a result of this performance, Amtrak has requested that the COT&S period for all cars with 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment be extended to 48 months. Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number PB&hyph;94&hyph;3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before August 22, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9:00 a.m.&hyph;5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.
