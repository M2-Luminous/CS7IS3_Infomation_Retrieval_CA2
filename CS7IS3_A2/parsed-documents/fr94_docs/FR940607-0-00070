FR940607-0-00070 FR940607-0-00017 The agencies believe that the authority of OMB to ensure that federal agencies adopt appropriate real estate appraisal standards eliminates the need to list specific loan programs for which this exemption applies. Moreover, OMB is monitoring the implementation of those appraisal programs and has required any federal agency not having appraisal standards and practices in place to submit an implementation plan and schedule to OMB. If the agencies later determine that a particular federal loan program poses a threat to the safety and soundness of regulated institutions, the agencies have retained the authority to require appraisals in such situations. This exemption also applies to certain other real estate-related financial transactions involving government agencies or government sponsored agencies. For example, the U.S. Postal Service typically contracts with a developer to erect and lease a special purpose building for the Postal Service's use. Applicable contract procedures normally require only cost estimates when determining who is awarded the contract. The Postal Service also enters into a lease with the developer. The lease payments, which are assigned to the lender, are sufficient to repay the loan. Because the developer is complying with applicable contract procedures, which require only cost estimates, it would be an unnecessary burden for the developer or the lender to also obtain a Title XI appraisal. (10) Transactions That Meet the Qualifications for Sale to a United States Government Agency or Government Sponsored Agency The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions that meet the qualifications for sale to any U.S. government agency or government sponsored agency. By referring to any U.S. government agency or sponsored agency, the exemption includes not only loans sold to federal agencies, but also any transaction that meets the qualifications for sale to agencies established or chartered by the federal government to serve public purposes specified by the U.S. Congress. These government sponsored agencies are: •Banks for Cooperatives. •Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). •Federal Farm Credit Banks. •Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). •Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). •Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). •Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae). •Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This exemption permits regulated institutions to originate, hold, buy, or sell transactions that meet the qualifications for sale to any U.S. government agency and the above listed government sponsored agencies without obtaining a separate appraisal conforming to the agencies' regulations. The exemption contains a modification to the original proposal that permits regulated institutions to accept appraisals performed in accordance with the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for any residential real estate transaction, both single family and multifamily, regardless of whether the loan is eligible to be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This modification clarifies that a regulated institution's ``jumbo'' or other residential real estate loans that do not conform to all the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but that are supported by an appraisal that meets the appraisal standards of these agencies, will qualify for this exemption. This exemption expands the prior exception to the regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS for transactions involving 1-to-4 family residential properties that had appraisals conforming to the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition, the OTS exception applied to existing multifamily properties. These transactions were not required to comply with the additional supervisory standards set forth in the prior regulations. The Board did not have a similar exception in its prior regulation. Some commenters requested that the agencies continue the prior exception allowing the use of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac standards for any loans involving 1-to-4 family residential real estate. Other commenters stated that the proposed exemption should not be adopted because the agencies would not be meeting their statutory obligation to set appraisal standards for transactions within their jurisdiction. The agencies believe the appraisal standards of the U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies established to maintain a secondary market in various types of loans are appropriate for these exempt transactions. Recently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac revised their 1-to-4 family residential appraisal standards and report forms to incorporate the USPAP as the minimum appraisal standards. Further, the appraisal standards and forms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are recognized as the appraisal industry's standard for residential real estate appraisals. The agencies have concluded that those appraisal standards should protect federal financial and public policy interests in the loans that are eligible for purchase by U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies. The agencies also believe that compliance with these standards will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions. The agencies believe that permitting regulated institutions to follow these standardized appraisal requirements, without the necessity of obtaining a separate appraisal or an appraisal supplement for conformance with the banking agencies' regulations, will reduce regulatory burden and increase an institution's ability to buy and sell these types of loans, improving the institution's liquidity. (11) Transactions by Regulated Institutions as Fiduciaries The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other law. The amendment clarifies that regulated institutions acting as fiduciaries are not required to obtain appraisals under the agencies' appraisal regulations if no appraisal is required under other law governing their fiduciary responsibilities in connection with those transactions. Prior to adoption of this amendment, it was unclear whether the agencies' appraisal regulations required appraisals for all real estate-related financial transactions in which regulated institutions participated as fiduciaries. For example, other law may not require an appraisal in connection with the sale of a parcel of real estate to a beneficiary of a trust on terms specified in the trust instrument. While financial institutions were in general agreement with the proposed exemption, some of these commenters stated that a fiduciary should be exempt from meeting Title XI appraisal requirements regardless of whether other laws require an appraisal. Commenters opposing this exemption believe that fiduciaries should be required to obtain a Title XI appraisal for all their real estate-related transactions. The agencies have concluded that a Title XI appraisal should not be required when regulated institutions engage in real estate-related financial transactions as fiduciaries and no other law (including state common law establishing the responsibilities of fiduciaries) requires appraisals for those transactions. Losses as a result of these transactions would not, absent some negligence by the institution, be incurred by the institution. Therefore, exempting these transactions from the Title XI appraisal requirement should not adversely affect the safety and soundness of financial institutions. When a fiduciary transaction requires an appraisal under other law, that appraisal should conform to the requirements of the agencies' regulations. (12) Appraisals Not Necessary To Protect Federal Financial and Public Policy Interests or the Safety and Soundness of Financial Institutions This provision was added to the rule to make clear that the agencies retain the authority to determine in a given case when the services of an appraiser are not required. Only a few commenters addressed this issue. One commenter expressed the concern that the agencies are granting themselves the authority to create new exemptions without the benefit of public comment. The agencies have the authority to implement and interpret regulations under their jurisdiction. The specific exemptions of the regulation describe the major categories of transactions that would not require appraisals. As a result of their experience in implementing their regulations, however, the agencies recognized that it is impossible to identify all types of transactions for which the services of an appraiser should not be required under Title XI of FIRREA and proposed this exemption to confirm their authority to determine that individual transactions do not require the services of an appraiser. The agencies will adopt any new exemptions covering broad categories of transactions in accordance with notice and comment rulemaking procedures.
