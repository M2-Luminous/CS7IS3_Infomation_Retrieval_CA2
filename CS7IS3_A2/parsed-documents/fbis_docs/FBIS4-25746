The proposal was put forward by PWC political sub-group members at a two-day meeting which ended in Beijing yesterday. One delegate, Professor Lau Siu-kai, said members felt proportional representation was more appropriate for the territory. He said it would preserve the nature of the legislature as a watchdog to the Government, with reasonable representation from various political groups. Professor Lau said the group would discuss various models later in the year. Adoption of a proportional representation system would mean voters choosing between political parties rather than individual candidates when casting their vote. Seats obtained by each party would be in proportion to the percentage of votes they had won. The news came as legislators and academics expressed fears the Government's voter registration drive was heading for disaster. With less than three weeks before the campaign's July 1 deadline, 1.66 million eligible voters have yet to enroll. The situation is even worse among people aged 18 to 21 who will be able to vote for the first time in September's district board elections following the recent lowering of the voting age. Only 28 percent, or 56,000, of the 200,000 potential electors have enrolled, according to figures released by the Registration and Election Office. The two-month campaign has reaped just 340,000 new voters, marginally increasing the proportion of Hong Kong's potential 3.9 million electorate who are registered to 57 percent, or 2.24 million. The apathy was evident yesterday at a registration drive in Kwun Tong. One potential voter said: "I'm not interested in politics and I don't believe any of the politicians could genuinely represent my interests." A queue of potential electors lined up in front of the Telford Gardens registration counter in Kowloon Bay yesterday, proved on closer inspection to be collecting free balloons given away as part of the drive. The registration campaign has cost $6.6 million. But legislator and Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood chairman Frederick Fung Kin-kee was shocked by the response. "I would have expected at least half of eligible voters between 18 and 21 to have registered," he said.
