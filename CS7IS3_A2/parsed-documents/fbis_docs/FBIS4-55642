Zhirinovskiy is to arrive for a private visit to Bratislava on May 21, at the invitation of Ladislav Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in Bratislava, and Jozef Lauko, who attended the LDPR April congress as an honorary guest. Any Russian citizen can arrive in Slovakia when invited, as Slovakia has visa-free relations with Russia, Pittner said. "The situation would be different if the visitor did not keep to Slovak laws," Pittner said, adding that in this case police would act according to the law.
