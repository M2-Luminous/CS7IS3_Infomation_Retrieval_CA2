Frejolito's central proposal is that the United Left should become a party. This means eliminating the United Left's various factions, reorienting its socialist discourse with neatly Peruvian -- "Mariateguist," as he put it -- foundations, and leaving aside the dogmas of Moscow or Beijing. The leaders of the party, at all levels, should be elected democratically by grassroots committees. A few days ago, PAP [Aprista Party of Peru] Secretary General Armando Villanueva del Campo hinted at the possibility of creating a "popular front" between APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] and the leftist parties. Observers believe that Frejolito could well be the candidate of this alliance.
