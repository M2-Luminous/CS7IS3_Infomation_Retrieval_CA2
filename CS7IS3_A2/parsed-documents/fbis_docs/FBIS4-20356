This has brought about rapid development of the Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative and wholly foreign-funded enterprises, and instilled vitality into its economy. However, a considerably amount of funds from foreign investors have not arrived on time. Some foreign businessmen have not contributed all their investments and repeatedly delayed their payments, while others have refused to pay. This has left some of the joint ventures with signboards of joint ventures only. In late 1992, a department concerned in a certain city conducted a survey on how much foreign investors were paying toward their share of their registered capital. Among the 52 enterprises surveyed, their foreign investors owed a total of US$9.2 million, accounting for 70.9 percent of the total investment. Five of the wholly foreign-funded enterprises owed as much as 83.9 percent of their registered capital. One enterprise with foreign investment has gone into operation for more than two years, but the foreign investor has not paid anything yet. Right now, only 14 of the 52 enterprises have subscribed their capital, accounting for 26.9 percent of the total number of enterprises surveyed. In addition, there are a dozen or more enterprises with foreign investors with problems. Some of them have already stopped production (closed) and made preparations to nullify their registration, while others have ceased to exist except in name. There are many reasons for the issuance of "white IOU slips" from foreign investors. In order to fulfill the targets in the development of Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative and wholly foreign-funded enterprises and score "political achievements" in attracting foreign investments, some districts, departments and enterprises have vied with one another in making joint investments with foreign investors. They are eager to attract foreign funds. They are so hungry that they are not choosy about their food. They blindly start operation without carefully checking the credentials of their foreign partners. At times, the Chinese side of some joint ventures only outwardly signed the agreement of joint operation with foreign businessmen in order to put on the joint venture "red cap" and enjoy the preferential treatment given by the state policy to any enterprise with foreign investment, while some foreign businessmen are making use of the eagerness of the Chinese side to develop joint ventures and availing themselves the loopholes in the management to run "fake joint ventures." As a result, this has made the Chinese side of the joint venture suffer and lose money. In order to put an end or reduce the number of "white IOU slips" from foreign businessmen, it is necessary to further improve the investment climate. In addition, I believe that the following measures should be adopted: 1. In screening and approving any application from any enterprise with foreign investment, the department concerned must strictly check and verify the reputation of the foreign businessman. 2. In the course of forming the joint venture, the Chinese side should, first of all, ascertain the foreign investor's ability in fulfilling the contract and his reputation in doing business first; and stipulate clearly in the contract the time limit for him to subscribe the capital and his responsibility for delaying payments or breaching the contract. 3. In dealing with those enterprises which have not been paying for their investment contributions on time, it is necessary to send a "notice of overdue payment for registered capital" to foreign investors via mail, FAX or telephone to urge them to make payments before the deadline. 4. It is necessary to strictly implement the "Regulations on Capital Subscription for Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures," strengthen check-ups on how foreign investors are making financial contributions to their joint ventures, and place them under strict control. It is essential to nullify, according to law, the registration of those enterprises with foreign investments which have not subscribed their capital for a long time, although they have been repeatedly reminded of their overdue payments. The establishment of the Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative and wholly foreign-funded enterprises is something inevitable in history. We should strive to become more matured and smarter in the course of dealing with foreign businessmen, and help enterprises with foreign investments further develop themselves in a healthy way.
