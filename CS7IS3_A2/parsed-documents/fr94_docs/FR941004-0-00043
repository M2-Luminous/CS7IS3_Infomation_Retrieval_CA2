FR941004-0-00043 FR941004-0-00018 4. In the Fifth Report and Order in this proceeding, we documented the serious funding problems faced by women and minorities. Indeed, we noted that Congress had recognized that these problems were even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses than for small businesses. 2 We also referred to a number of studies that supported the congressional findings regarding the difficulties minorities and women have accessing capital. 3 2 Fifth Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;178 at ¶98 (released July 15, 1994), 59 FR 37566 (July 22, 1994). 3 Id. at ¶¶98&hyph;103. We incorporate by reference here the discussion of these issues in the Fifth Report and Order. 5. In its petition for reconsideration in this proceeding, Cook Inlet Region, Inc. asked us to reconsider the scope of the installment payment option for designated entities. It contended that failure to extend the availability of installment payments to all women and minority-owned companies, instead of just small businesses, will exclude a substantial number of designated entities from meaningful participation in spectrum-based services. Cook Inlet argued that this result is contrary to the intent of Congress. 4 In response to this, we stated with respect to our generic auction rules that, while installment payments would not generally be available to all designated entities irrespective of their economic status, we retained the flexibility to expand or modify the installment payment option on a service-specific basis where the spectrum costs, capital infrastructure requirements and other economic barriers necessitate their application to other entities. 5 ``[T]his additional flexibility will allow us to take account of differences in capital requirements across services and license blocks, and to provide access to capital in ways that will give various groups of designated entities a realistic chance to participate in offering service.'' 6 4 Petition for Reconsideration of Cook Inlet Region, Inc., PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, May 20, 1994, at 3&hyph;6.

In addition, in a recent ex parte filing, Essence Communications, Inc. further elaborates on the various broad congressional initiatives that have been aimed at helping minorities overcome obstacles to financing. 7 For example, Essence notes that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) Amendments 8 impose a federal ban on race-based denials of extension of credit. The legislative history to the ECOA Amendments highlights the challenges faced by entrepreneurs seeking credit to fund their businesses. 9 In addition, Essence states that Congress recently amended the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 10 to bolster the evaluations of financial institutions that subsidize minority banks in predominately minority areas. 11 According to Essence, this aspect of the CRA is entirely race-conscious and contains no financial thresholds. 7 Comments and Recommendations of Essence Communications, Inc. in Response to the Commission's Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, September 14, 1994, at 8&hyph;10. 8 Pub.
