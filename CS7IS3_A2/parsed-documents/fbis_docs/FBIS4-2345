Finland has its own features in many areas and its economic cooperation with China should be expanded, Jiang told visiting Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho here this afternoon. China and Finland enjoy ties of friendship and mutual respect, and in recent years the bilateral exchanges and cooperation in fields of economy and trade, science and technology and culture have been further developed, he said. "We are satisfied with this," Jiang told the Finnish prime minister. "Your current visit will further promote Sino-Finnish relations in all fields," he added. Aho noted that the long geographical distance does not constitute a hindrance to the high-level contacts between the two countries. On the contrary, extensive political and economic relations of cooperation have been established between the two countries, Aho said. He described his current visit here as "an important milestone" in the history of Finnish-Chinese friendship. Finland supports China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Aho said, adding that the re-entry will make a significant impact on Finnish-Chinese economic relations and the global economy. Aho also told Jiang that the visit had impressed him deeply. During the meeting, Jiang asked Aho to convey his best regards to Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and to pass on his invitation to the president to visit China.
