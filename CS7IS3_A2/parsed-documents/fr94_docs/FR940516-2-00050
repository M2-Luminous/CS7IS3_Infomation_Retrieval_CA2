FR940516-2-00050 FR940516-2-00042 2. Research Approach As a background for further work, the organization should investigate and document how comprehensive community change initiatives have been assessed in the past, how they are now being assessed, and the problems and successes encountered in assessing these initiatives. Many problems in assessing comprehensive initiatives are not new and are not confined to any one set of social reform efforts. Such an investigation would identify similarities and differences in the types of assessments underway, the processes being described, and the outcomes being measured, cataloging topics requiring attention for the next generation of initiatives and for assessment of the current generation and creating a research agenda for the field. Possible topics and research activities of interest may include the following: •Articulating the assumptions and hypotheses underlying existing comprehensive community change initiatives. This work would clarify the causal connections that assessments of initiatives should explore. Such work might include collaborating with a specific initiative to map the assumptions and expected causal relationships. The creation of an outline of assumptions, hypotheses, and causal connections should involve many different perspectives, including the funders, developers, technical assistance providers, and community participants of initiatives. •Generating, based on the improved articulation of assumptions and hypotheses, a set of interim progress indicators with clear links to the ultimate goals of the initiative. •Identifying gaps in measurement that hold back assessment and working to improve measurement tools. This work could involve participating with an initiative to test methods. Results would then be summarized for the field. •Developing suggestions for improved assessment practice. For example, developing methods appropriate for initiatives that saturate a community, making it impossible to randomly select individuals in treatment and control groups. •Other topics as defined by the work group. 3. Awardee and Government Responsibilities A. Awardee Responsibilities 1. Establish a work group of experts and knowledgeable practitioners to assist the project. The work group should include people with the following backgrounds: •direct experience in developing and conceptualizing comprehensive community change initiatives •direct experience in assessing comprehensive community change initiatives •direct experience in managing or overseeing comprehensive community change initiatives •direct experience in assessment and measurement of social programs. 2. Plan and conduct a series of meetings in which the work group develops key issues to be addressed. 3. Submit a final work plan that updates the work plan submitted in the original application. This work plan should include a plan for dissemination of research findings.
