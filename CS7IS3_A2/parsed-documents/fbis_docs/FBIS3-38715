[passage omitted] On the subject of the massacre the Serbs perpetrated on Sarajevo yesterday, Karayalcin severely condemned the approach of the United States and European countries on the issue. Explaining that the above countries were silently watching the massacre of 68 people in Sarajevo, Karayalcin recalled that these same countries sent troops when faced with the slightest disagreement in the Middle East. Karayalcin said: [Begin Karayalcin recording] We are against Islamic radicalism. We refuse to recognize Islamic radicalism and regimes that are not secular. As Turkish republicans, we are against all attacks against laicism; but while we, on the one hand, reject Muslim initiatives that are not secular, we cannot, on the other hand, accept or stomach Christian radicalism. I would like to ask you dear citizens of Corum, if the world would be as silent as it is now if the inhabitants of Sarajevo were not Muslims or if they were Jews instead of Muslims. [end recording] Karayalcin further stated that the countries that are not intervening in Sarajevo should at least extend military aid to the Muslims living there. [passage omitted]
