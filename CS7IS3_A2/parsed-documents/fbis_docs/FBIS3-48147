Senase] [Excerpt] Cotabato City -- Suspected communist rebels torched a passenger bus in Maasim, Sarangani, on Monday after the bus firm refused to pay "revolutionary tax," police said yesterday. Senior Superintendent Jovito Sales, police director for Central Mindanao, said the bus of the Yellow Bus Line (YBL) was travelling from Kiamba, Sarangani, to General Santos City when it was blocked by about a dozen suspected New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas. Thirty of their comrades served as lookouts near the highway, police said. The armed men ordered all passengers to alight and bring with them their belongings, witnesses told police. They then poured gasoline all over the vehicle before setting it on fire. No one was hurt or molested, police said. Yellow Bus Line plies routes in South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato, Bukidnon and Davao. Sales said the YBL management, prior to the incident, had received notes and letters demanding that the company pay "revolutionary tax" to the communist rebels.
