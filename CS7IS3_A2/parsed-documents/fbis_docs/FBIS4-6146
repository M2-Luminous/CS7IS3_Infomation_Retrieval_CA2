This trend shows a change in the business strategies of Japanese enterprises. Japanese enterprises have concluded that they should look to the Asian market for their exports which voices relatively little discontent with Japan and is expected to grow in the future rather than increase their exports to the United States that may trigger fresh bilateral trade friction. Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations accounted for only 30 percent of its trade surplus with the United States by the mid-1980's. Its surplus in trade with Asian nations, however, has jumped about 30 percent every year since 1990 when Japanese enterprises, beset by the appreciated yen, began to move their production operations to Asian nations and as a result, Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations has grown faster than that with the United States which has grown less than 10 percent every year. There is a view that once Japanese enterprises slow down the movement of their production operations to Asian nations, exports from Asian nations to Japan will increase and Japan's trade surplus with those nations will decrease. Yet this view is held only by a small number of Japanese businessmen. They believe that "most of the goods produced by locally incorporated companies of Japanese firms in Asian nations are geared for exports to the United States." The goods produced by those locally affiliated companies are likely to become a factor in increasing Asia's trade surplus with the United States, not in decreasing Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations. With Japan expected to boost its exports to Asian nations in anticipation that their per capita incomes and economies will grow rapidly, Japan's trade surplus with Asian countries is highly likely to continue to grow. If these trends continue, Asian nations will certainly ask Japan to boost its imports from them. There is a possibility that the United States will intensify its criticism of Japan, claiming "Japanese enterprises are moving their production operations of goods exported to the United Sates to Asian countries to avoid trade friction with the United States."
