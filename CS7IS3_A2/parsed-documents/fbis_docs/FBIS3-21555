A meeting of the country's defence council attended by President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, other top ministers and senior officers was set to approve the white paper later Wednesday [16 February]. Since German reunification, France has carried out partial nuclear disarmament, reorganised its command structure and reduced its troop numbers. The purpose of the white paper was to define post-Cold War strategy for the next 20 years, the officials said. Up until the collapse of the Soviet Union, French strategy was founded on a single scenario -- a massive French conventional engagement alongside NATO allies in Central Europe, most likely in former Czechoslovakia. The white paper sets out six scenarios for the commitment of French forces, the officials said, starting with "major conflict," implying use of nuclear weapons. Others range through use of force to protect sovereignty of overseas posessions and the French sphere of influence in Africa and French action in a regional conflict developing from the breakup of the Soviet Union. The white paper also states the need for French forces to be capable of sustaining long-term and distant operations, as in peace- keeping in Yugoslavia and Cambodia, and as in the Gulf war. Mitterrand resisted pressure for change in nuclear strategy, informed sources said, and his views prevailed. Sections of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) lobbied for a resumption of nuclear testing in order to develop small warheads that could be used in limited operations in a "madman" scenario. Instead the strategy remains that of "the weak against the strong," as during the Cold War when the French deterrent was aimed against tens of thousands of Soviet warheads, the sources said. Mitterrand has ordered an acceleration in the development of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, the M5, scheduled to succeed the M45 in the year 2005. The white paper will be presented to parliamentary defence and foreign affairs comissions ahead of debate in the National Assembly next June on financing new weapons over the five years 1995-2000.
