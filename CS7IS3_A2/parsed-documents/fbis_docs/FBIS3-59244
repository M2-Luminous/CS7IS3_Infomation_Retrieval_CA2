No, in his State of the Union Address Bill Clinton could not and did not want that impression to be created. Yet, if one analyzes Clinton's report, then one finds that it contains ample proof that American society today is not healthy, and cannot be healthy, because of the omissions of Clinton's predecessor. Clinton had to try to strike this peculiar rhetorical balance to make clear the urgent nature of the issues that most concern him. There are 58 million Americans who lack sufficient protection against illness -- this figure that Clinton gave must also come as a surprise to statisticians, because until now it was said that only 37 million citizens lack insurance. State expenditure on welfare has been badly structured and it imposes an exceptional burden on the public purse. Clinton's actual words were: "If we allow our health care system to operate in the same way as before, Americans will receive less assistance, have fewer opportunities to choose their doctors, and have to pay higher bills." The president sees this as being the point of departure for his next reforms. His plans for 1994 are even more ambitious than those for his first year in office. Clinton himself said what had only been said by his critics so far: "We must tackle both things at the same time" -- that is, institute health care and welfare reforms at the same time. In 1993 too, he addressed many issues at the same time. Bill Clinton is taking advantage of a favorable situation. In his first two years in office, he succeeded in settling two extremely difficult trade policy problems at the same time -- NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and the GATT negotiations -- because despite opposition from within his own political camp, he practically decided on reducing the budget and increasing taxes at the same time and believes that he can overcome the institutional weaknesses of the presidency vis-a-vis Congress in the future too. He is burdening his government and congressmen with a mammoth program and has praised them for their work in the previous year, when he could have laws passed without using the presidential veto. If there were presidential elections now and not until 1996, Clinton would have a good opportunity to win once again. Despite the reports of affairs that have surfaced recently, the respect that he enjoys among people is at its highest point since he took office a year ago. Acting in a politically wise way, the president has attributed positive economic trends to himself: the lowest interest rates for 20 years as well as the lowest inflation rate for two decades (that is wrong, they were lower under Reagan in 1986) and an opportunity for Americans to get rid of high mortgage burdens of the past by means of debt rescheduling and lower interest rates. The president is proceeding in the right direction in one respect: his free market orientation. Despite the social democratic direction of his economic policies, he is placing an astonishing amount of store on market forces -- even by the health reform, which the market is to complete with its own laws once it has been prompted by the government.
