Tong Zhiguang, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said Asia-Pacific countries should have a long-term strategic perspective and look ahead in the 21st century. Tong is here to attend the second general meeting of the Asia- Pacific parliamentary forum, which opened this morning. There are tremendous potentials in economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific region as their economies are highly compatible and complementary with each other, Tong said. While stressing the importance of regional cooperation, Tong said that only with a development strategy compatible with its own conditions, can a country attain economic prosperity. "After all, there can be no regional prosperity without the development of the component countries," Tong said. He also told more than the 100 delegates from 18 countries that China has achieved phenomenal accomplishments in economic development during the past 15 years thanks mainly to the economic reform and opening-up policies. One of the China's basic policies, Tong said, is open to the entire world, primarily to the Asia-Pacific region. "It is our firm policy to expand economic cooperation and trade with other Asia-Pacific countries," he added. Tong also appreciated the result of Seattle meeting of Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation in last November, saying it would have a positive bearing on facilitating the regional economic cooperation.
