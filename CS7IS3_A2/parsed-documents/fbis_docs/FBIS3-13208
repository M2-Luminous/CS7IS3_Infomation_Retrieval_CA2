Indubitable sources said a story that the radiation resulted from a defect in the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor was leaked by U.S. circles to counter suspicions about the Saratoga by blaming the radiation on the Dimona reactor. AL-BILAD obtained the following story on how this radiation occurred: The cruise missiles the Saratoga fired at Iraq from the Red Sea previously carried nuclear warheads designed to strike at the Warsaw Pact states. When the Gulf crisis erupted, the nuclear warheads were removed and replaced with conventional warheads, but the missiles were still charged with nuclear radiation, which has been registered more than once.
