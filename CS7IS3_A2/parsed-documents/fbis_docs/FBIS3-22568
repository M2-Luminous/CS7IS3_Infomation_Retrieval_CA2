According to the survey, during 1992 AIDS killed 524 women in this age group throughout the state. The number represents 11.87 percent of the total deaths (4,412) recorded among the female population that year. The second cause of death after AIDS was tumors (468 fatalities). It was followed by vehicle accidents (370 cases), homicides (275), and pneumonia (194). The problem is serious among men as well. According to the survey, during 1992 AIDS was the second cause of death among the male population aged between 20 and 35 years (2,289 fatalities). Homicides ranked first (4,314 deaths). The 1993 figures are still being tabulated by the foundation's researchers. However, based on the records analyzed to date, AIDS continues to lead in the causes of death among women. Demographer Antonio Marangone Camargo claimed: "There is a rising trend in the number of deaths due to AIDS among this population." The progression in the numbers of deaths caused by AIDS has been observed by the Seade technicians for at least three years. In 1990, the deaths due to the disease among women aged between 20 and 24 years accounted for 7.58 percent of the deaths recorded in the state. During 1991, the proportion rose to 10.61 percent; and, in 1992, it reached 12.50 percent. Despite the alarming indexes, the specialists are not frightened. For example, Caio Rosenthal, a physician specializing in the study of infections at the Emilio Ribas Institute of Infection Studies, claimed that the rising trend in the number of deaths caused by AIDS among young women had already been anticipated. Rosenthal explained: "They comprise a sexually active population with less sexual stability, using drugs, and with behavior considered to be risky. It was predictable that this would ocurr, because we are in a country where there is no care for health, or family planning, and where the condom is one of the most expensive in the world." ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Among Males, Violence Kills More | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Five Principal Causes of Death Among Women Aged 20-35 Years | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cause |Number of Deaths | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AIDS |524 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tumors |468 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vehicle accidents |370 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Homicides |275 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pneumonia |194 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Five Principal Causes of Death Among Men Aged 20-35 Years | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cause |Number of Deaths | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Homicides |4,314 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AIDS |2,289 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vehicle accidents |1,992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pneumonia |498 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tumors |414 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 figures | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Seade | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
