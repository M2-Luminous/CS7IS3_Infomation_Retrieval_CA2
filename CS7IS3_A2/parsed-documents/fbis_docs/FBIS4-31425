"This is a mere ceasefire. We have had many many ceasefires that did not work," Karadzic said about the latest proposal submitted at talks in the Swiss city to end fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina between a Moslem-Croat alliance and the Serbs. "We are here to sign a cessation of hostilities agreement. Ceasefires can be signed at the Sarajevo Airport," he said. He said he had "not too many hopes" because the international community was "very permissive towards the Moslems." UN envoy Yasushi Akashi said he would offer Bosnia's warring parties a scaled-down ceasefire proposal Wednesday in a concession to Bosnia's Moslem government. Akashi confirmed that the length of the truce remained the main obstacle in negotiations between Bosnia's Moslem-Croat alliance and Serb forces. Aides said his offer involved a two-month truce, compared to the initial proposal of four months which the Bosnian Government has rejected. The head of the Bosnian delegation, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, said before talks resumed Wednesday that Akashi had proposed a four-week renewable truce -- the length sought by the country's Moslem-Croat Federation. Ganic said Akashi was proposing that at the end of the four-week ceasefire a further extension could be decided if there was progress in separate political and territorial discussions among the warring parties. He called the offer "very constructive" and a "very promising" proposal.
