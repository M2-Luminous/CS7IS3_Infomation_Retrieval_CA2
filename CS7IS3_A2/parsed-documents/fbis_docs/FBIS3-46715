Seven generals and 35 field grade officers discussed more than 30 topics at a seven-day debate hosted by the Defense Ministry from Dec. 23-29 last year. They covered consciousness, personnel, promotion, morale, welfare, exercise, ways to secure high-quality manpower and manage reserved war potential, command, control, telecommunications, computers and information. Most attendants, selected by the ministry, lived together during the debate, which concluded that societies like "Hanahoe" and "Aljahoe" create disharmony within the military and tarnish the honor of the military. Society members were accused of monopolizing major posts, which they exchange among themselves, and of being exclusive to officers from rival societies. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae instructed Army headquarters and the three armies Dec. 22, a day after he was appointed, to organize seven-day debates to discuss military reform and report back directly to him. There were some who said the ministry should punish club members more severely than at present and give them disadvantages in personnel management and promotion. Some worried that former society members, insisting they have led the military so far, will strengthen their unity against the disadvantages they have suffered since the government was inaugurated in February last year. Minister Yi is an ex-member of Hanahoe, along with former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.
