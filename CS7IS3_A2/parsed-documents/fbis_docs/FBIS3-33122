He added that efforts are being made to negotiate Nicaragua's debt with that European country. In the meeting held this morning between FRG Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer and President Violeta de Chamorro, both officials discussed the country's current situation. The German deputy foreign minister said that the objective of his visit is to corroborate that the friendship between the two countries continues and that Germany is making efforts to maintain its political presence here. [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "I have known the president for many years. We maintain a friendship and I have been positively impressed by this meeting. We discussed bilateral relations between Germany and Nicaragua. She delivered to me a message for the German president and we have discussed ways to solve the foreign debt problem. We have talked about German aid to Nicaragua and internal politics in Nicaragua." Schaefer said that despite the financial difficulties facing Germany, efforts are being made to resolve the problem of Nicaragua's debt with that country, which totals $600 million. [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "In general, I am optimistic we can reach a satisfactory agreement in the negotiations." He confirmed that German aid totalling about $25 million will be maintained. [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "The German cooperation will be maintained. However, the German Economic Cooperation Ministry must make cutbacks in its budget. These cuts are fundamental in view of the economic situation in Europe and also in Germany. Unemployment in Germany has reached rates unheard of following World War II. "However, cooperation and funds for cooperation will continue to flow, although no increase can be made. There will not be cutbacks or reductions. This is our objective and we will continue to work in this direction." Since his arrival last night, the German deputy foreign minister announced he will meet with different Nicaraguan sectors. [Sergio Mario Blandon, Nicaraguan deputy foreign cooperation minister] "It is a good opportunity to have the deputy foreign minister here. As you may recall, last December we received the visit of deputy minister (?Resvick). The constant visits of German ministers and deputy ministers signifies their interest in assisting our country." At the Foreign Ministry, the renegotiation of the debt was also discussed. [Jose Pallais, Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister] "We have insisted that the negotiation of this debt must be different. Special treatment should be given to the military debt in contrast with commercial aid or aid to support the balance of payments." This is the fifth time Mr. Schaefer has visited Nicaragua, and today he was scheduled to meet with other government officials and members of political parties.
