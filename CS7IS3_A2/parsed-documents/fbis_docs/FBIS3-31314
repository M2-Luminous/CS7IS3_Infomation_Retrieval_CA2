Moreover, the process of its ratification has been initiated in the European Parliament and the parliaments of the member countries. The transformation of the original association agreement with the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic to the separate association agreements with the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic has been considered more a technical than a political issue. The talks required two official meetings of experts in Brussels on 15 April and 26 May 1993. The last round of talks took place as the agreement was ratified on 23 June 1993. Because of some technical problems concerning the translation of the English working draft into the other nine languages of the Union, the agreement was not signed until 4 October 1993, during the EU Council session in Luxembourg. Thanks to the effectively focused diplomatic preparations, the association agreement was approved by the European Parliament on 27 October, when 297 of the present 302 deputies voted in favor of the agreement, three opposed, and two abstained. The Danish Folketing approved the signing of the association agreement on 9 December 1993. The original goal of having the association agreement ratified by the end of 1993 could not be achieved because of the current situation--the EU has been preoccupied with its own problems, like the open question of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and also as a result of the technical obstacles connected with the translation of the association agreement into the EU official languages. It is expected that the ratification process will be completed by the end of November 1994 so that the agreement could go into effect on 1 January 1995. Concurrently with the signing of the association agreement, the formal side of the succession of the Slovak Republic to the Provisional Agreement on Trade between the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the EC has been guaranteed (temporarily valid already since 1 January 1993 on the basis of the declaration of the Government of the Slovak Republic dated 7 December 1992), whereby the framework has been established for the mutual trade relations with the EU until the association agreement is ratified. The support for development of the political dialogue on various levels between the EU and the Visegrad Four [V-4] countries attracted great attention in 1993. One of the results of this dialogue was the approval of the document "Toward a Closer Association With the Countries of Central and East Europe" at the Copenhagen EU Summit on 21-22 June 1993. The European Council accepted the appeal by the V-4 countries for an expansion of their access to the EU markets. The Slovak Republic managed to reflect the concessions obtained by the decision of the Copenhagen Summit into the provisional agreement and also into the association agreement. A joint committee of the EU Slovak Republic (Czech Republic) convened in Bratislava on 21-22 October 1993. The Provisional Agreement on Trade was used as a framework for the assessment of the level of the trade and economic relations, but the response by the joint committee to the conclusions of the Copenhagen Summit also acts as a great stimulation for the reinforcement of our position as an associate member of the EU. Some of the highlights of the contacts between the Slovak Republic and the EU in 1993 were the reception of Slovak President Michal Kovac by EU Commission chairman J. Delors, the reception of Slovak Prime Minister V. Meciar by EU Commission chairman J. Delors, the association agreement signing by the Slovak prime minister in Luxembourg, and the participation of Minister J. Moravcik in the political dialogue of the EU troika with the associated countries in Brussels. Sir L. Brittan, deputy chairman of the EU Commission, and EU Commissioner H. van den Broek visited the Slovak Republic in 1993. The European Free Trade Association The main tasks of Slovak foreign policy regarding the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) were completed in 1993 in agreement with the overall integration objectives of the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Republic became a successor to the Agreement on Free Trade between the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the EFTA countries by signing the succession protocol in Geneva on 19 April 1993. The Slovak Republic paid a lot of attention to the expansion of cooperation with EFTA by means of active contacts (visit to the Slovak Republic by EFTA Secretary General G. Reisch) and the utilization of the EFTA offer of expert discussions related to the adjustment of the economic environment in the Slovak Republic to the standards of EFTA and the European economic area. The joint Slovak Republic-EFTA committee also met in St. Gallen on 23-24 April 1993. The Council of Europe [CE] One of the most significant achievements of Slovak foreign policy in the field of multilateral cooperation was full membership in the CE. By the adoption of resolution No. 33/93 of the CE Committee of Ministers and the signing of the Protocol on the Acceptance of the CE Statutes, the Slovak Republic on 30 June 1993 became a full member of this international government organization. The Slovak Republic confirmed all of its obligations to the CE, and it supports the process of the formation of an integrated Europe by its participation in CE activities. CE membership brought with it certain commitments in the sense of the fulfillment of the Recommendation by the CE Parliamentary Assembly No. 1201/1993 concerning the Supplementary Protocol to the European Treaty on Human Rights and Rights of Ethnic Minorities. The Slovak Republic promised to honor the principles expressed in the Parliamentary Assembly recommendations during the process of admission to the CE. By its resolution, the Slovak Government entrusted the members of the government with ensuring the implementation of the accepted commitments specified by the CE recommendations. At the initiative of the chairman of the Foreign Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, an ad hoc working group was formed for the evaluation of the current fulfillment of Slovak obligations toward the CE. Following its acceptance as a CE member, the Slovak Republic accepted many agreements adopted by the CE. This applies to the acceptance by the Slovak Republic of the Agreement Against the Use of Anabolic Steroids, for instance, the European Agreement on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage, or the European Agreement on Cinematographic Coproduction (the last two were signed by the Slovak Ministry of Culture). Under the auspices of the Slovak Ministry of Justice, work is in progress on the ratification of the European Agreement on Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and on the acceptance by the Slovak Republic of Protocols Nos. 1 and 2 to this agreement. The Commission for the Ratification of the European Social Charter operates under the auspices of the Slovak Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Public Works. Thanks to the CE Support, a CE Information and Documentation Center (IDS) has been established in Bratislava in cooperation with the Slovak Foreign Ministry and interested sectors, which collects all CE documents and provides services to the members of parliament, the government, and the public at large. The IDS was ceremoniously opened on 11 October 1993. Despite the diplomatic efforts by the Slovak Republic for the purpose of supporting the establishment of the CE Second European Center for Youth (ECM) in Bratislava, it has been decided that the Second ECM will be set up in Budapest. The Slovak Ministry of Culture secured through the CE Cultural Heritage Committee a "Technical Assistance for Banska Stiavnica" project, in the framework of which the CE experts prepared a blueprint for the revitalization and reconstruction of the city. Regional Cooperation The Slovak Republic has been accepted as a full member of the Central European Initiative [CEI] as of 1 January 1993 without interruption, following the demise of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. This was confirmed, in accordance with the agreed mechanism, by the spring meeting of CEI foreign ministers in Budapest. The CEI priorities in 1993 were to focus, above all, on the development of the economic and cultural cooperation in the framework of specific joint projects. In the course of the year, however, because of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the trend strengthened toward the reinforcement of political consultations and questions of ethnic minority rights compared with the original pragmatic intentions of the cooperation. On the basis of the talks of the ad hoc working group for ethnic minorities, the Italian side prepared a draft document on the protection of ethnic minority rights, which was originally supposed to be adopted as a legally binding document at a special CEI conference. At their summit in Budapest in July 1993, the prime ministers of the CEI countries authorized this group to continue their endeavors to draft a document on the protection of minority rights, but in an open form from the vantage point of the legal obligation. Because of the ongoing work on the document, the Slovak Republic is adversely inclined to the implementation of the concept of collective minority rights, a stand that corresponds to the development of opinion within the CE, as confirmed at the Vienna CE summit. Despite our support for the CEI orientation in the direction of the development of the economic infrastructure by means of regional projects, the intended goals have not yet been achieved in those areas of cooperation that have been selected as priority ones by the EU and the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] (power generation, telecommunications, transport, environment). The Slovak Republic has pointed out the unsatisfactory situation in financing the infrastructure projects at the sessions of the CEI Administration Board at the EBRD. The Slovak Republic has supported the idea of the reorganization of the administration system within the bank in the interest of an improvement in relations between the bank and its customers. At the fall meeting of the foreign ministers of the CEI countries in Debrecen, the Slovak Republic favorably responded to the Italian initiative of a pilot project of establishing industrial zones, which would begin by a study and coordination of the legislative conditions for their implementation, first in Slovakia and subsequently in other CEI countries. The focal point of the activity of the CEI working group for culture, education, and youth exchange, chaired by the Slovak Republic, was the realization of the project "The Year of European Baroque." This successful project, in the framework of which seven exhibitions were organized in various CEI countries, is to continue with three more exhibitions in 1994. The regional association known as the "Working Commonwealth of Danubian Countries (PSPK)" associates 22 entities (federal countries, independent countries, provinces, regions) located in the Danube River valley. The Slovak Republic has been a full-fledged member of the commonwealth since 1991. The Slovak Republic takes part in the cooperation in almost all working groups and subgroups through the representatives of individual sectors. The Slovak Republic chairs and coordinates the work in two subgroups--the "Territorial Arrangement" and the "Land Protection." In 1993, the Slovak Republic was host to the fourth conference of the government heads of the PSPK member countries, at which the work of the PSPK was evaluated, and the orientation of cooperation was specified for the next year in the form of a recommendation. Within the framework of the conference, chaired by the Slovak prime minister, bilateral talks also took place with the heads of the delegations from Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Croatia, and Hungary. 1.3 Relations Between the Slovak Republic and the United Nations One of the key areas of the activities of Slovak foreign policy in the multilateral sphere is the activity within the framework of the United Nations, to which the Slovak Republic was admitted on 19 January 1993. The principal precondition for working effectively in the United Nations was the complex succession to multilateral contractual documents held by the UN secretary general. The Slovak Republic was substantially involved in 1993 in the area of maintaining international peace and security, above all, by its presence in various UN peace operations: UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]--former Yugoslavia, a logistics battalion of the Slovak Army, 419 men strong, is operating in the Daruvar region and should be expanded by 40 more Army members by 30 December 1993 and another 141 on 28 February 1994, so that the Slovak Republic will have a total of 600 soldiers in this mission. UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission]--Angola--six military observers from the Slovak Army. UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia]--Liberia--ten military observers from the Slovak Army. UNOMUR [UN Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda] -- Uganda-Rwanda--five military observers from the Slovak Army. UNGCI [expansion unknown]--Iraq--four members of the Slovak Police Corps. The Slovak Foreign Ministry and the Slovak Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York rapidly assess the applications by Slovak businesses for permits issued by the appropriate sanctions committee of the UN Security Council so Slovak economic interests are harmed as little as possible by the sanctions introduced by the United Nations against the countries that threatened or violated international peace and security. The Slovak Foreign Ministry OMEO [expansion unknown] prepared, in cooperation with the Slovak Danubian Navigation Lines, a list of Slovak monitors who will accompany ship convoys through Yugoslav territory. This list was approved by SAMCOMM [Sanctions Assistance Missions Communication] in Brussels and passed on for approval by the UN Sanction Committee No. 724 (1991). Because of the economic losses caused by the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia, on the basis of Article 50 of the UN Charter, the Slovak Republic has asked the UN Security Council for consultations regarding compensation for the losses it has sustained. The Slovak Foreign Ministry, through the Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, has asked for the dispatching of an expert hired by the UNDP [UN Development Program] to assess the losses. The losses have been calculated in cooperation with the individual sectors and submitted to the UN Committee. On 26 October 1993, the Slovak permanent representative at the United Nations submitted a note to the Security Council chairman enumerating all Slovak losses caused by the sanctions against Yugoslavia, which was published in the form of Security Council document No. S/26648. Within the framework of efforts to solve the problems of sanctions, several diplomatic actions have been taken in the UN system. The Slovak foreign minister emphasized in his address to the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly the need for a solution to the economic impact of the sanctions on the most affected countries. Similarly, following an initiative by the Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, the problem of economic losses resulting from the sanctions against Yugoslavia was added to the agenda of the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly. The motion was discussed and approved by the plenum. The countries affected by the sanctions pointed out the long process of the approval for export and transit permits for Yugoslavia. Since the Slovak Danubian Navigation Lines is actually the body most affected by the problems resulting from the sanctions, operative consultations are taking place with its representative concerning a solution to the most acute problems. Since Security Council Resolution No. 820 came into effect, the Slovak Foreign Ministry carries out the entire process of the issue to Slovak businesses of UN export or transit permits for Yugoslavia. It also keeps in contact with the enterprises and provides them with all important information for the purpose of alleviating the damage. Because of the situation in the Disarmament Conference, the Slovak Foreign Ministry continues to claim its right of succession to the CSFR in the Disarmament Conference. The Disarmament Conference membership is still frozen because of the unresolved questions regarding the expected expansion of the Disarmament Conference membership (the question of Iraq). The disapproval of the "parcel" method of admitting new members so far prevented a solution to the situation in favor of the Slovak Republic. In the sphere of armament and disarmament control in 1993, the Slovak Foreign Ministry focused on promoting the interests of the Slovak Republic at the UN, where, by its work at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly, it joined all of the significant activities, supporting peace solutions to problems and reducing tension in individual regions of the world, and implementing UN resolutions for a truce during the Olympic games and the year of Olympism. The foreign policy of the Slovak Republic also became involved within the framework of the UN system in solving the problems of openness in armament. In the context of solving the problems of openness in armament, the Slovak Republic submitted to the secretary general complete information for the so-called Register of Conventional Arms for 1992. In 1993 the Slovak Republic began the full implementation of the regulations of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Arrangements were made for the participation of representatives at the Preparatory Committee at The Hague and, on the basis of its recommendations in accordance with the Slovak Action Plan, an interdepartmental Slovak preparatory commission was established for the implementation of the treaty. At this time, the introductory initiatives of this body are taking place, aimed at the final ratification of the treaty in the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the specific conditions in the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Foreign Ministry enlists expert participation at the talks of the Government Expert Group regarding the possible control measures of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Biological Weapons, where a representative of the Slovak Republic acts as a member of the expert process. The Slovak Republic joined the appeal to call an assessment conference for the aforementioned Treaty already in the first stages of this initiative and during the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly. In the interest of getting involved in the work of the institutions dealing with the issue of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and rocket technology and the regulation of exports and imports of material, technology, and equipment with dual purpose, Slovak Foreign Ministry representatives took part in the session of the Core Group (against arms proliferation) in Oslo. The Slovak Foreign Ministry, in cooperation with the Slovak Defense Ministry and the Atomic Energy Commission, organized participation in the session of the Preparatory Committee of the Assessment Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in Southampton. In the context of this activity, the ministry gave its support to the endeavors by some countries to implement the validity of the treaty without any time limit. The Slovak Foreign Ministry prepared its concept of the issue and presented it at the session of the appropriate committee during the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly. An important activity was the preparation of the participation of a government delegation, led by the foreign minister, in the session of the UN General Assembly on 2-6 October 1993, appearances of the delegation members in the UN committees, and the arrangements for various multi and bilateral talks, above all, with the secretary general and other leading UN officials and heads of state delegations, participants in the General Assembly. The orientation of the work on the preparation of the trip and appearance by the Slovak Foreign Ministry state secretary in the UN General Assembly committees and talks with the UN secretary general deputies was similar. The Foreign Ministry submitted at the UN General Assembly an application of the Slovak Republic for a reduction of its membership contribution to the UN budget. A reduction and adjustment from 0.18 to 0.13 percent is expected. The question of the membership of the Slovak Republic in the UN Statistical Commission was also dealt with at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly, and alternative possibilities were discussed for securing the UN presence in the Slovak Republic (the establishment of a UN information component in the Slovak Republic). An important element of the work was the preparations for the establishment of a Slovak Permanent Mission at the international organizations in Vienna. Many activities were oriented toward the sphere of specialized UN programs, particularly the following: UNITAR [Institute for Training and Research]--in cooperation with the Slovak Permanent Mission in Geneva, the supply of information on the organization of courses on multilateral diplomacy in Geneva. UN Graduate Studies Program. UNU -- UN University. Commission on Transnational Corporations. Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting. EUREKA--the production of information on Eureka programs with the objective of activating Slovak researchers to participate in the top research programs. After the publication, specific information was provided to the interested parties. Departement des Affaires Humanitaires--Geneva. International Center for Family Studies. Government Committee for the Physically Disabled. Public Administration--the collection of information oriented towards the territorial arrangement and modernization of public administration, and arrangements for the participation in international actions by competent institutions, the dispatch of experts, the circulation of information on vacant positions within the framework of the UN structure to the concerned institutions and reporting job candidates from Slovakia. Characteristic of the last third of the year, as well as for 1994 and 1995, is the intensification of the work on the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women. For the Slovak Foreign Ministry it translates into a need for the coordination of its activities abroad, the methodical modification of and help in the preparation of the national reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women. It implies for the Slovak Foreign Ministry the need to coordinate its work abroad, methodical guidance and help in the preparation of the national reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the preparation of the documentation on behalf of the Slovak Foreign Ministry sector. UNDCP [UN Drug Control Program]--Among the important activities in this field was the signing of the regional laboratory Balkans Route [Balkanska cesta] project. The project is intended for use in the implementation of narcotics control, for the establishment and equipment of laboratories, for increasing their capacity, and for the training and education of their staff.
