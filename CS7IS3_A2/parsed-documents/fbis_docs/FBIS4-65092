Conde made the denial in reply to a report given by Luis Roldan, former director general of the Civil Guard, to the daily EL MUNDO. According to that report, Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra ordered Roldan, who has been a fugitive of justice for the last two weeks and against whom there are serious accusations of corruption, to spy on Mario Conde and his alleged plans to engage in politics and to try to use Banesto as a "springboard" for reaching power. The central bank intervened in Banesto on 28 December after it detected that some $4 billion was missing. It also dismissed Mario Conde, the top bank official. EL MUNDO went on to say that Roldan entrusted the espionage tasks to Kroll Associates, a U.S. company, which determined that Conde had established a personal association with the Union of Swiss Banks (USB) for the joint collection of Banesto operations. In this manner, the newspaper added, the Swiss corporation shared with the former president of the Spanish bank group some 2.9 billion pesetas (nearly $21 million) from the sale of Petromed [expansion unknown] to British Petroleum and 1.6 billion pesetas ($11.5 million) from the sale of La Union and El Fenix, of the Banesto group, to the French AGF. In a press release, Mario Conde denies all of this information and charges that representatives from the Kroll company met last year with officials from the U.S. company J.P. Morgan to give them false information about him. Concerning the alleged surveillance carried out by Kroll against him, Conde showed "consternation in view of the fact that our private lives and our family's intimacies have been under investigation by a foreign company at the request of the Spanish Government." Likewise, he warns that if the existence of this report is confirmed, he will undertake proper action. The daily EL MUNDO explained that the "original" report that contains all of this information was shown by the former director general of the Civil Guard and that the contents of the document were only known by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Deputy Prime Minister Serra, and Carlos Sochaga, who was minister of economics and finance at that time.
