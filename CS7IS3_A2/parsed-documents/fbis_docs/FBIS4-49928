The main culprits were given the death sentence. These criminals caused serious harm to the country and the people, and committed heinous crimes not to be tolerated by the law. Railways, oil fields, electric power supply, and telecommunications are important, basic undertakings of the country, and are also the lifeblood and support of the national economy. The development and safety of these undertakings have an important bearing on the national economy, the people's lives, reform, and opening up. In the last few years, however, the crimes of stealing and destroying railway, oil field, and electric power equipment, and telecommunications facilities have been quite rampant. Apart from this, stealing and destroying farmland irrigation facilities and urban public facilities also are apparent, and these crimes are committed in larger groups, more openly, and with violence. Some lawbreakers have developed from small-scale theft and trouble to daylight armed robbery, defying laws both human and divine. We must pay close attention to, and curb these criminal offenses, which seriously trample on state property, damage economic construction, and endanger social stability; we must not tolerate them. Violations of criminal law must be subject to imprisonment, and no fines can replace imprisonments. When severe sentencing is necessary, it must be carried out; no softheartedness is allowed. On the one hand, the people are carrying out construction enthusiastically, but on the other, a small number of criminals are wantonly engaged in theft and destruction. This situation must be changed as soon as possible. This year is an important one for establishing the socialist market economy structure and for maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding the scope of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the main aspects of the work of the entire party and country. Party and government leading comrades in all localities and departments must have a good idea of the relations between reform, development, and stability; must "carry out two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both"; and must take effective measures to curb all crimes in the course of concentrating on economic construction, reform, and opening up; so as to ensure smooth economic construction, reform, and opening up. From now on, we must never relax our efforts to severely punish the crimes of theft and destruction. Special combat must be conducted in regions where such crimes are rampant, so as to concentrate our crackdowns on them. In this combat, we must rely on the government; on public security departments, procuratorates, and courts; as well as on the people. The masses must be mobilized and organized in such a manner that they regard themselves as masters of their own affairs in cherishing and protecting state property. Every civilian must be made to understand that state property is inviolable and that state property is the property of all the people and is also their own property. There is a need to conduct education on the legal system so that everyone understands what violations of law are and what criminal offenses are, so as to reduce and halt the occurrence of criminal offenses and to make everyone fight bravely against lawbreakers. The masses serve as a deterrent force against criminals. When the masses are mobilized, they will constitute a dragnet so that criminals have nowhere to hide.
