The decision was made by the Ministries of Finance, Planning, and Mines and Energy, which approved the Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc. report on the need to finish the construction work. Furnas President Marcelo Siqueira on 24 March confirmed the news to this newspaper. The construction cost is calculated at $1.5 billion. The Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. and Furnas will have to contribute the rest of the money. "This resumption is not inflationary; we will not receive any money from the Treasury," Siqueira said. According to him, Furnas will begin to publish the public bid documents for completion of Angra-2's construction in the next 15 days. He said the plant's civil work is practically finished and only the equipment still has to be assembled. This equipment -- most of it purchased from Germany and some of it manufactured in Brazil -- has been stored in warehouses at the Angra nuclear complex. Ayrton Caiuby, director of the CNEN [National Nuclear Energy Commission], said that in the next few days, CNEN members will meet to decide the date when Angra-1 will be put into operation.
