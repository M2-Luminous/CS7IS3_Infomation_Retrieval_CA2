The charter was comprehensively revised and perfected through the collection of signatures and a wide spectrum of ideas, and clearly reveals that pluralistic democratic government reforms are an unstoppable historical necessity. It requests that the communist party in power act in good faith and initiate a peaceful transformation of the political system from top to bottom and reduce to a minimum the negative effects which would disrupt the life of the masses. "The Charter," on the principle that it is "operable," requests the communists eliminate "counter-revolutionary crimes", open up restrictions on political parties, respect the resolutions of the United Nations regarding human rights questions, redress the wrongs of the "4 June" incident, release all political prisoners, and establish a strategy for attaining a pluralistic democracy. It also requests both sides of the Straits initiate co-equal negotiations, call a roundtable discussion, and promote peaceful unification. These suggestions and procedures are the accumulated crystallization of the thinking and struggling of the members of the people's movement on the mainland over the past ten years and have the great boldness of vision for driving history, a vision which transcends the limitations of time and space. It is truly a rare democratic document. Over the past decade or more, tremendous changes have taken place in the economic system on the mainland: We greatly admire this fact. However, as the facts of contemporary world history amply testify, the rapid expansion of the market economy of necessity requires the implementation of a pluralistic democratic government. In view of the fact that tremendous changes have occurred in the present world order with the end of the cold war, we move toward a new order. In view of the fact that all Chinese are concerned for the future peaceful development of China, towards this end we specifically put forward this charter. The many and varied examples of transformations in political systems which have taken place in the past and in the present, at home and abroad, compel us to worry deeply. If pluralistic democratic government is an unstoppable historical necessity, then we must ask ourselves: in China, will this process be carried out peacefully or not? We are convinced that within the ruling circles on the Chinese mainland there are men of historical insight who also have come to recognize the above stated problem and its urgency. For this reason, the teachings of historical experience, especially the example of the pros and cons of the former Soviet Union and of Eastern Europe, are sufficient enough to cause both the government officials and common people on the mainland who still harbor antagonistic feelings to arrive at a sort of common understanding. Only when the government powerholders are sincere and it is carried out in a systematic and peaceful manner from top to bottom, can the negative effects of the historical transformation of mainland China from a centralized to a pluralistic to a democratic government, that is, the disruption of the social and economic lives of the masses, be kept to a minimum. It should be pointed out that the turbulent tides of world history and the unprecedentedly strong international forces of democracy have not only caused the peaceful transformation of China to become a popular cause, but have also provided various necessary conditions for this transformation. The present situation at home and abroad, considered from every angle, absolutely will not allow a repetition of an incident like the "4 June" massacre. At the same time, justice and reason do not desire that a situation similar to that prior to 4 June, when all social controls were lost, should ever happen again. The key to the current question is this: This transformation will be a blow to the upper classes of China's society and certain persons who derive benefits therefrom and thus harbor a negative, rejecting attitude toward such a change. At the same time, the classes which are victims of the present system and some individuals hold unavoidably extreme feelings. These two conditions, both to a certain degree, have a negative effect upon a peaceful and systematic political transformation. As for the question about the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, the key problem is not what form unification will take or at what time it will happen, but rather upon what basis and upon what type of mutual recognition will unification be based. In accord with the above historical background, we, the citizens of China, with a deep sense of the great mission facing us, boldly step forward and call upon the government and the governed of our whole nation. Basing our actions upon the principle that "the interests of the entire nation override all else" renouncing all past enmities, with mutual respect and mutual accommodation, renouncing aggression and seeking compromise, let us discuss the state of the nation and realize the great reconciliation of the Chinese people. Let us seek in a peaceful and safe manner to come together to accomplish the great mission of the transformation of the political system of the Chinese mainland and the peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. We especially call to the attention of the members of all levels of governing and governed, the fact that in order to avoid the intensification of contradictions, which could lead to loss of control of the process of political change which must be forthcoming and which could cause the nation to slide into anarchy, the present regime should from this moment onwards begin to take all precautions necessary to avoid these troubles. This applies especially to the present government on the Chinese mainland, which most particularly has the responsibility to take positive action at the earliest possible opportunity to gradually ameliorate the political situation and to grasp the present favorable opportunity and self-consciously conform to the laws of historical development. Otherwise, they must bear the greatest historical responsibility for the various situations which might develop as mentioned above. To avoid having the next chapter in China's political history again tread the vicious circle of the last hundred or so years, with the premise of taking into full consideration the common interests of the government and the public on both sides of the Strait and in particular their individual special interests, we solemnly recommend, specifically to the governments on the two sides of the Strait, naturally first to the government on the mainland, to the whole body of the Chinese people including those on both sides of the Strait, in Hong Kong and Macao and the minorities, and to our compatriots overseas, and to all organizations at home and abroad who work for social progress, the following workable procedure for the peaceful reconciliation of the whole people. 1. We believe that the government of Mainland China does represent China, and as a standing member nation of the Security Council of the United Nations, has the duty to comply with all resolutions of the United Nations regarding human rights and should begin guaranteeing the human rights of the Chinese people beginning with contemporary international standards and immediately establish laws comparable with those of contemporary democratic nations regarding person, speech, communication, publication, assembly, organization (including lifting party restrictions), travel and holding demonstrations, as well as the free travel of citizens in and out of the nation's borders. It should immediately eliminate "counter-revolutionary crimes" and strictly carry this out under international supervision and under the supervision of the people both within and outside the country. As a reciprocal gesture of good will, we appeal to the masses of the people to restrict their own inalienable rights to assemble, travel and demonstrate, in normal times to the levels of the present laws of the authorities, and reduce the social unrest instigated by a politically motivated peaceful transition. 2. We appeal to the authorities in the mainland government to exhibit the great spirit of being controllers of a historical transformation, and as soon as possible legislate and enforce strategic measures for passing from centralized to pluralistic forms, and then establish and make complete a democratic system of government, creating the conditions under which the processes of the transformation of the mainland government can be carried out from beginning to end in a context which the central government can control and adjust. [17 Nov 93 p 18] 3. Under the premise that the mainland government recognizes the previous two articles, we then appeal to the whole body politic and all advanced forces at home and abroad to respect the government of the mainland as the one force which is capable of leading the peaceful transformation of the mainland, to actively and voluntarily cooperate with them, to provide various types of workable and constructive suggestions, to lay aside the terrible disputes which are not related to the main issues, and strive to form with the present authorities a beneficial relationship of mutual aid in which both sides push for progress in reconciliation. 4. We earnestly urge the mainland government to make the first initial necessary gesture of reconciliation, that is to immediately redress the wrongs of the "4 June" incident, set free all political prisoners incarcerated because of "4 June" and other such reasons, making no differentiation regarding political beliefs and factions, and give an appropriate amount of recompense to all those who suffered in the "4 June" incident and others or their families who suffered political harm. When the mainland government truly exhibits sincerity towards reconciliation, we call upon those who have suffered and their families, and members of society at all levels to adopt a forward-looking attitude and no longer seek to ascertain the general responsibility for "4 June" and various later political incidents. 5. We call upon the Chinese Communist Party and its government to remove the legal prohibitions placed upon all political exiles, and allow all students, labor movement personnel, and other such persons in exile abroad to return to China. We believe that China's problems can only be solved by the Chinese people themselves, in China. For this reason, we call upon all who truly aspire to dedicate themselves to the motherland to immediately return to China and join in China's economic modernization and political democratization. 6. On the day when, according to modern international standards, laws regarding forming associations are legislated and implemented and restrictions on political parties are lifted; that is, when all non-violent political parties at home and abroad may legally register their existence; at that time, all societies and organizations and political parties should proceed promptly to the concerned department to register and be recorded. At the present time we thus call upon all concerned sides to initiate, under the principles of openness, legality and non-violence, with planning and with skill, an ideological movement which will not disturb the order of society, and use this as the means of exerting pressure to attain human rights and the minimum limits which a democratic movement should possess. After it is possible to legally register, then of course these should continue to be the principles employed. 7. We call upon the governments on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to immediately start direct negotiations regarding these problems. We believe that the cohesiveness of the Chinese people is great enough to peacefully unify Taiwan and the mainland. For this reason, we call upon the authorities on the mainland to formally put away the proposition of use of force to settle problems, and treat the Kuomintang Party, the Peoples Progressive Party and other political parties of Taiwan as equals; when conditions are ripe, welcome the expansion of the Taiwanese political parties onto the mainland. We also call upon all levels of government and the public in Taiwan at such a time to also, in a like manner, welcome the expansion of the mainland political parties, including the Communist Party, onto Taiwan, and thus finally accomplish the social and political conformity of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. We also call upon the Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan to discard their proposal of an "Independent Taiwan" and to actively work for the cause of democratic progress of all of China, including the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. 8. We call upon the mainland government to completely respect the self-governing rights of the peoples of Hong Kong and Macao, and handle problems occurring after their reunion with the mainland under the principles of sovereignty belonging to the center and administrative rights belonging to the localities, fully respecting the freedom of choice of the local peoples regarding their social, political and economic systems and their style of life. [18 Nov 93 p 18] 9. We call upon the various nationalities throughout the nation to protect the great unity of the Chinese people, and at the same time call upon the government to handle the problems of each of the nationalities in accordance with modern international standards, fully respecting the right of self- determination of the minorities, and laying aside the worn-out concept of preserving a unified domain through violent means. 10. On the basis that the preceding articles are accepted by all sides, and this naturally means that first they are basically accepted by the mainland government, we suggest that in a speedy manner a roundtable discussion be called, with government and public personnel of various callings from the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and the nationalities and others from home and abroad participating, to discuss and resolve in common the next stage of the peaceful transformation and the peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Naturally, in accordance with the needs of the objective situation, a great many bilateral and multilateral preparatory meetings could take place beforehand, and the peaceful transformation and peaceful reunification talks could be carried out at separate roundtable discussions according topics or differences. We believe that the above articles not only are in accordance with the basic interests of the Chinese people, but also are the rational requirements of the next chapter in Chinese history. We especially beg the mainland government to understand our good intentions and accept our proposal for the peaceful reconciliation of the entire people. We call upon all Chinese and all the descendants of the emperors living abroad to join their signatures and voices with ours to convey our common desire for a peaceful political transformation of the mainland and the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The "Peace Charter" is a free and public informal organization composed of all Chinese people at home and abroad, without differentiation as to political affiliation, who accept and agree with this charter and who as individuals and organizations strive to achieve a peaceful transition to a unified and democratic China wherein pluralistic political forces coexist and carry out all sorts of public, lawful activities. The "Peace Charter" welcomes all persons who agree with its viewpoint both at home and abroad and who will effectively support and participate in its work -- initiating collection of signatures, widespread propaganda, and carrying out other activities within the limits permitted and guaranteed by the present day constitution and laws. The "Peace Charter" emphasizes most emphatically and deeply respects the Chinese Communists and their government as the only social force which is capable of leading the mainland in peacefully completing the change from centralized to pluralistic democracy. This is a fact that we sincerely hope will facilitate the Chinese Communists to shoulder this immense historical mission, and we most strongly urge them to not miss this last opportunity. The measures which the "Peace Charter" proposes are only those measures which we deem workable under the present conditions, and are offered mostly to elicit better suggestions. There is no need to be restricted by its wording. However, we firmly believe that the spirit of this charter's proposal to realize the systematic and peaceful transformation under the leadership of the present governments not only conforms to the greatest interests of the Chinese people and the mainland government, but also is the only rational choice for contemporary China. The signatories to the Peace Charter include persons from all walks of life; together they are the sponsors of this charter and bear the responsibility for the charter. At the same time, they have selected three spokespersons who have full authority to represent the "Peace Charter" in any talks with the governments on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and in any public meeting held at home or abroad. The distributed copies of this charter, due to their extreme importance, become effective upon being signed by one of the signatories or by a spokesperson. Every signatory to this document has a mission to accept the signatures of persons from all walks of life and to initiate all types of activities, and to carry out special assignments with persons of all levels who are committed to this charter, all bearing together as one the responsibility. Let us work together with all Chinese people everywhere for the peaceful transformation of the mainland and the peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
