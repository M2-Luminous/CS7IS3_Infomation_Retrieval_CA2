The blackout will continue until the state TV and radio companies pay all the debts they owe TV and radio transmission enterprises for 1993 and January 1994. The threat was contained in a statement issued today by the coordinating committee of workers employed at TV and radio transmitters in the Russian Federation. The statement has been sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian government, to the Ostankino management, and to Russia's Communications Ministry. The statement says this ultimatum is justified because the extremely acute financial crisis at transmission stations relaying state radio and TV programs has still not been resolved. The Finance Ministry has not settled debts owed to communications enterprises. Radio stations in Kamchatka, Kaliningrad, and other towns have already been silenced because transmitter stations cannot pay for electricity and other supplies. The majority of communications enterprises in Russia are on the brink of grinding to a halt. The statement says, however, that the coordinating committee "considers it essential to maintain the intercity telephone network and to ensure that public information can still be broadcast, especially in emergencies."
