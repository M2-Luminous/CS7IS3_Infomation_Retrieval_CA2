It is indeed a historical event of breakthrough nature. Not long after establishment of New China, the CPC had pronounced its move in the direction of common prosperity and abundance for all, and for this purpose had instituted its thoroughgoing reforms. However, due to the restraints of the traditional economic system and the influences of the absolute egalitarianism engendered by manual labor, also the additional vigilance against the social dichotomy of the Old China, it was never possible, in this question of how to achieve common prosperity and abundance for all, to at least arrive at a policy of allowing one part of the population gain prosperity ahead of others. To allow pluralistic economic components outside of the public ownership system and distribution patterns other than the one of distribution according to work had been absolutely taboo. The practice was that of the so-called "egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfer of resources" and "chopping off the tails of capitalism." Under these circumstances, it was impossible to allow one part of the population attain prosperity ahead of others, and it was even more out of the question to speak of common prosperity and abundance for all. Only after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee did it happen that Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the first time put forward: "As regards our economic policy, it is my opinion that we should allow some districts, some enterprises, and some people to gain larger incomes and enjoy better lives ahead of others, because of their achievements attained in hard work and with great exertions... to make it possible for the Chinese people of all nationalities throughout the entire country to gain prosperity and abundance in a comparatively short time." We can therefore conclude that the emergency of the stratum of wealthy people, and the process that allows them to develop and grow in strength, is also part of the process of that would allow first a limited portion of the population to attain prosperity before others, and to delay to later days prosperity and abundance for the majority of the people, as this process is also the successful practice and vivid demonstration of the party's policy of achieving nationwide prosperity in due course. We can also assert that by their emergency the stratum of wealthy people is setting an example for those that have not yet attained prosperity, and that they thereby are exerting a widely spreading stimulating influence. For the majority of China's citizens, coming from the traditional economic system, the decision to involve themselves in the treacherous ocean of the market economy requires not only an extreme measure of courage, but also that they undergo a process of a rather arduous apprenticeship. In this respect, those wealthy ones, who have courageously opened up new paths and who have swiftly raced ahead toward prosperity, are thus playing an exemplary role by their actually achieving wealth. They are setting an example to emulate and are thereby motivating and helping a growing number of others to advance too toward prosperity and abundance. Looking at the negative aspects, there is first, that among the stratum of the wealthy people some got rich in unreasonable and unlawful ways. They either took advantage of loopholes of policy or acquired wealth illegally, which then directly stirred up confusion in the social distribution order and gave rise to serious injustices in distribution. Most conspicuous examples of such are: One, some specially gifted and naturally talented people, such as star singers, star athletes, etc., although capable of providing people with spiritual products and spiritual enjoyment, or winning honors for their motherland, acquire huge wealth once they become famous. It makes people really wonder whether that is reasonable or legitimate. Then there are also loopholes in the country's taxation policy, all that has people inevitably consider such cases as incidents of inequitable distribution. Two, with the development of private economy, a group of people came into being who primarily operated illegally and conspired to reap huge profits; these people were indeed successful in acquiring great wealth in this way in a short time. Three, by the method of trading power against money, some appropriated to themselves large amounts of public property and caused many public assets to become lost. This is at the present time the most serious instance of injustice in social distribution. Their customary methods of misappropriations are mainly: "Profiteering by means of undue official approvals to certain documents." Some people specialize in the resale of import and export licenses, and once a sale is successful, cash is diverted from the enterprises into their own pockets. "Illegal profiteering by means of the price differentials" has some lawless elements take advantage of the dual-track pricing system during the period of change-over in systems. They exploit personal relationships, go by the backdoor, accept kickbacks, fraudulently sell parity-priced means of production, and shift most of the financial encumbrances on to the enterprises. "Illegal speculating in real estate" has some people, relying on power or with the help of corrupt officials, buying up land at cheap prices, then drive up land price before they sell it again, deriving huge profits from such speculation. "Speculating in shares" has some people take advantage of the fact that the management of the new stock markets is not yet up to standards, as they misuse public funds to speculate in personal stocks, transfer corporate stocks to individual persons, and there are also cases that before original issue stocks come into the market, they are privately shared out among related parties or placed in red gift envelopes and presented to certain people as gifts. Second, some nouveaux riches, who had easily amassed great wealth within a short time, do not use it for investment in productive fields, but squander it wantonly and wastefully, creating an antisocial consumption that by far exceeds the present level of productive forces and seriously pollutes the general social atmosphere. In actual life, there are now many cases of rich men competing with each other in wealth, ostentatiously displaying their wealth, engaging in reckless gambling, visiting prostitutes, and using narcotic drugs. Even though these are not widely prevailing consumption habits among the stratum of the wealthy, these abnormal consumption phenomena--throwing money around like dirt and letting money flow like water--have already created an extremely bad impression among the general public. Third, it is precisely these illegal acquisitions of wealth that have led to serious injustices in the distribution field, have fomented discontent among a considerable portion of the population, and have caused psychological instability of a societal character to appear. Although people's incomes and living standards have generally improved in the 10-odd years of reform and opening to the outside world, and people have a greater psychological tolerance than before, there is also this problem that must be faced squarely: The injustices in the social distribution that have occurred in the course of reform and opening up are felt as a daily increasing psychological pressure by many members of society. Due to these injustices in distribution, majority of personnel on wages and salaries, and the workers in agriculture feel that the disparity in incomes and the gap between rich and poor is much too large. They have the strong impression that they are being deprived. There is presently also the factor of the large-scale currency inflation, which is an additional direct threat to the consumption level and developmental demands of one portion of the population, making them feel that there is no moral justice as things are at the present time. This will inevitably lead to even greater discontent in an even wider circle of people, and will affect stability throughout the entire society. Fourth, the process of irrational and unlawful enrichment of some of the nouveaux riches has emboldened more and more people to try to also get rich quickly by means that would violate law and discipline or would even constitute criminal acts. In the face of the new situation, with its rapidly growing economy and continuously rising social consumption, the huge wealth of some of those "moneybags," and their immense consumption, has already bestirred some people, irresistibly, not to take things lying down, but to rather think of ways and means to avail themselves of loopholes in the policy, working out all kinds of schemes to embezzle public property, and also some private property, or trying, overtly or covertly, to get high incomes to which they are not rightly entitled. What is particular cause for anxiety is that some people, to get rich quickly, will not shrink from boldly taking great risks and from even stooping to commit crimes.
