Gerashchenko said at the World Economic Forum here that foreign banks represent 12 percent of the one trillion rubles (646 million dollars) in capital held by the Russian banking community. "We think that for a certain period of time, we will keep this limitation," he told AFP. "We need to promote our commercial banks." Moscow has already moved to curb the activities of foreign commercial banks operating under license in Russia, with only three of the 12 allowed to handle transactions with Russian residents. Gerashchenko also said that $20 billion placed by Russian banks abroad was not being properly used. He said of the country's 2,090 commercial banks, only 100 or so were serious institutions. Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, which is a showcase for Russian reforms, criticised the fact that the 20 billion dollars was being placed overseas at all. "Our first job it to direct Russian money to our economy," he said. Gerashchenko said Russia was also looking at tax breaks and other special arrangements to attract selected foreign firms to invest in Russia. "We need companies with some type of pioneering experience," he said. The central bank chief echoed the determination of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin not to rely exclusively on monetary policy to fight rampant inflation in Russia. He said the monetary component of Russia's inflation was "insignificant" and most of it was due to the state firms factoring all their costs into their prices while not using all their capacity. The key, Gerashchenko said, was to selectively encourage production. "If we don't have a government-supported investment policy we will be unable through monetarist means to fight inflation." Gerashchenko said that government expenditures for 1993 totaled 33.2 trillion rubles ($21 billion) and income was about 24 trillion ($15.5 billion). He said out of the 24 trillion rubles in income, 17 trillion was normal tax revenues and 6.8 trillion was from sales of assets to the central bank. Gerashchenko swore here that he was committed to free-market reforms in Russia, but came under renewed attack by critics who accused him of incompetence. Jeffrey Sachs, former advisor to President Boris Yeltsin, said that for the last two years, Gerashchenko and other conservatives undermined economic reform in Russia by "demonstrating devastating disdain" for sound money management. "Gerashchenko is showing no understanding that money is not a political toy," said Sachs.
