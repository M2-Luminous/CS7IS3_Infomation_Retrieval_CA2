Heavy shooting took place inside the Central University of Venezuela [UCV] on Thursday following almost five hours of student disturbances in the street near the university that leads to Venezuela Plaza. There was machine-gun and light automatic weapon fire at approximately 1845 on Thursday evening. Two fragmentation grenades were thrown at the numerous members of the Special Metropolitan Police Brigade posted around the university premises. The demonstrators fired on water trucks and riot vehicles, hitting them over 30 times during the heavy shooting that came from inside the UCV. According to Emilio Delgado, who was in command of the Special Metropolitan Police Brigade, the individuals--who might be termed subversives--used light automatic rifles, machine guns with tripods, and fragmentation grenades. Judge Ramon Moreno Natera may conduct an on-scene inspection of the metropolitan police vehicles hit and of buildings surrounding the UCV, such as the bridge over the Francisco Fajardo freeway. It was also learned that Carlos Luis Hernandez, 21, who has a criminal record for homicide, was arrested following the heavy shooting. He will be turned over to the Judicial Technical Police and will later be remanded to the orders of the 2d Permanent Military Court of Caracas, because the weapons used in the shooting presumably belonged to the national Armed Forces.
