FR941207-1-00007 FR941207-1-00003 Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD08&hyph;94&hyph;033] RIN 2115&hyph;AE47 Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, LA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulation governing the operation of the vertical lift span drawbridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, the draw of the bridge would remain closed to navigation for passage of vehicular traffic during peak traffic periods. At all other times the draw would open on signal for passage of vessels. Presently, the draw is required to open on signal at all times. This action would relieve traffic congestion on the bridge during these periods, and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (ob), Eighth Coast Guard District, 501 Magazine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130&hyph;3396, or may be delivered to Room 1313 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (504) 589&hyph;2965. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Wachter, Bridge Administration Branch, at the address given above, telephone (504) 589&hyph;2965.
