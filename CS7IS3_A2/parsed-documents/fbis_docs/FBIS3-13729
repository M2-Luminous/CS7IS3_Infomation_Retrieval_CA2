Lebanon, he added, has proved its ability to overcome its crisis and is able to extend the state's authority to every inch of its territory. President al-Hirawi added that Lebanon, which seeks UN help to safeguard its inalienable rights, rejects violence as a way of resolving crises just as it rejects infringement of its national dignity and legitimate rights. He added: Resolution 425 did not give us a right we were not entitled to. Rather, it reaffirmed our sacred right to have our sovereignty respected. The president added: Let Israel withdraw from our land and the state will take it upon itself to maintain stability there. He stressed the need for alertness and solidarity with our brothers and cooperation with our friends to secure the implementation of the international resolutions, chiefly Resolution 425.
