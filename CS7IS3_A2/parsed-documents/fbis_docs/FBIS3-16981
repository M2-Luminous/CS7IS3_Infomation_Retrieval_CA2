The plane had to fly through the Armenian airspace bound for Tehran, but deviated 100 kilometres from the route for unknown reasons and hit the ground several miles of [as received] Stepanakert, the adminstrative centre of the break-away Nagorno-Karabakh province of Azerbaijan. The group of Iranian experts is accompanied by a civil aviation official of the Commonwealth of Independent States. According to the vice-president, experts are expected to complete the investigation and be back in yerevan later in the day. The vice president stated that there had been no radio communication betwen traffic controllers of the Yerevan airport and the crew of the Iranian plane. Both the traffic controllers and the crew communicated with a Russian passenger aircraft which was on its regular flight in the Armenia's airspace at the moment. Records of these conversations are now being studied by experts. Meanwhile, Russian military experts do not exclude a possibility that the Iranian C-130 plane was on a reconnaissance mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. The experts believe that it is most unlikely that the crash had been caused by the depressurization of the cockpit. Colonel Aleksey Grekhov, navigator-inspector of the safety department of the military transport aviation of the Russian air forces, told ITAR-TASS that "there had not been a single case when an airplane hit the ground because of depressurization". According to the colonel, almost all air trafic in the Afghan war had been carried out by depressurized aircraft "but all flights were a success unless the planes had been attacked". The experts are cautious about any resolute conclusions until they get answers to some questions. Why did the crew of the plane have an unusually big number of members (13 instead of a regular crew of four)? Why did not the plane ask for landing in Gyandzha or Shamkhor in Azerbaijan where runways of former Soviet military airfields were big enough for all types of heavy planes? Why did the plane maintain radio exchange only with a Russian aircraft and not with any of the ground services?
