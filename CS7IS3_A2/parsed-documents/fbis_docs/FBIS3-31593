Weiss said that on the basis of the 17 February debate on the endorsement of privatization projects, Deputy Juraj Plesnik, as the vice chairman of the parliamentary committee for privatization, had examined certain procedures adopted by the government when endorsing privatization projects during the past days. He had come to a conclusion that a suspicion existed that the law had been violated. Weiss went on to say that, in view of the seriousness of the content of the speech Deputy Plesnik had planned to make to the National Council, he had deemed it appropriate to inform parliamentary speaker Ivan Gasparovic. The latter had visited Vladimir Meciar and had given him the first version of the draft resolution. According to Weiss, that version had been different than the one Deputy Plesnik had delivered to the National Council. Weiss regards the move made by Meciar as being a pretext to prevent an agreement on holding an early election and a referendum.
