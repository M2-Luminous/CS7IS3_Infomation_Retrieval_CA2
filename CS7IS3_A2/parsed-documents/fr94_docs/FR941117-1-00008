ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend our regulations to establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities as a new category of Medicaid facility, and establish standards that these facilities would have to meet; and specify that psychiatric units of general hospitals may be used for acute psychiatric care for individuals under age 21. It also would improve the regulatory implementation of the statutory requirements for State development of a comprehensive mental health program and coordination of various State authorities concerned with provision of mental health and related services. In addition, this proposed rule would ensure that representatives from agencies providing services to an individual develop and manage a coordinated plan of care whenever feasible. This rule would implement section 4755(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;508).
