FBIS4-68440 "jpusr048___94038" FBIS-USR-94-048 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 15 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Duma Media Law Draft Considered Duma Media Law Draft Considered 944F0604A Moscow NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA in Russian 15 Apr 94 pp 1-2 944F0604A Moscow NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Yuriy Sorokin under the rubric "Chronicles of the Absurd": "Mikhail Poltoranin Likes To Have Journalists Eating Out Of His Hand"] [Text] Two days ago the State Duma passed in the first reading a federal law, the text of which has accidentally ended up in my hands. It makes sense to examine the law in more detail because this is one of the first laws passed by our new parliament (it seems that only the law on the status of deputies and the amnesty decree, which has the force of law, came before it). The law on deputy status did have a precursor--a similar law of the previous, now dispersed, Supreme Soviet, and the amnesty decree was initially submitted by the president altogether, whereas this draft is, so to say, a product of the Duma's own creativity and is without parallel in our legislation. Unfortunately it seems to be without parallel in another respect--in terms of its absurdity and inferiority. The law describes "procedures for coverage of organs of state power in the state mass media" and was submitted by the relevant committee (chairman Mikhail Poltoranin). I do not know what behind-the-scenes struggle preceded the emergence of this draft and who schemed against whom, but I can confidently maintain that there was an intrigue. First, the draft law invades, and invades very substantially, a quite specific professional sphere--journalism as a whole and TV journalism in particular. However, as far as I can judge from the silence of the press, not one major professional journalist was familiarized with the text in advance. For example, can a person who has never sat behind a steering wheel in his life single-handedly establish the rules of the road? Perhaps he can, but it is clear what is going to happen at intersections. Either they, naive as babes in the woods, counted on the law making it through before the press "gets wind of it" (even if it does make it through, who is going to comply?), or some of the editors knew but were as silent as guerrillas.... In principle I can even compile a list of the names of these guerrillas; it is easy to guess. The traces of intrigue remain in the text of the draft law. Actually, we are looking at two or even three completely different laws which are crudely fitted inside one another without even being polished in any way. The first law, let us call it the original one, corresponds to the general headline: "On Procedures for Coverage of Activities of Organs of State Power by STATE Mass Media" (emphasis mine--Yuriy Sorokin). The very first article (the subject regulated by the law) explains that at issue are precisely the state mass media, i.e. those that are founded by organs of power and, consequently, it does apply to other mass media (which are independent of the state). A norm follows thereafter which is new in our legislation and which I as a journalist who has not yet lost his taste for freedom cannot but welcome: It says in black and white that state organs of all kinds CANNOT BE founders of the mass media (with the exception of those publishing official communications only). That is to say, the state retains for itself utterly official publications such as SBORNIK UKAZOV...and PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK, whereas the rest are free.... In the immemorial time of perestroyka, when the current adviser to the president Yuriy Baturin together with Mikhail Fedotov and Vladimir Entin wrote their first draft law on the FREEDOM of the press, which became the base for all subsequent laws--even they did not proceed to insert such a norm in the draft law, their entire ceremonious but unyielding democratism of the time notwithstanding. This quite obviously was not "passable" material.... At present, this norm is already perceived as commonplace. Most mass media have long ceased to be owned by the state de jure. Technically, neither KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, nor TRUD, to say nothing of the new, recently started newspapers and magazines have to report to the state concerning anything: Some have, to the noise of three revolutions in a row, reregistered as publications founded by collectives of journalists or public or private organizations independent of the authorities; others have been established by private individuals or independent structures from the very beginning. Until recently there were exceptions--some central and local publications which fell victim to the last skirmish of the two branches of power in October, for example, in the case of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which the president in essence took away from the routed parliament. However, under this new law, which I call the original one, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will also be set free. A knowledgeable legislator without a hidden agenda up his sleeve would perhaps leave off here. It does not make sense to describe the entire procedure for the publication of official communications by the state informational organs in detail at the legal level--first, because very few such publications remain; second, a law cannot be written to cover absolutely all occasions anyway. It would be much simpler and more feasible to appoint obedient and diligent state officials (editors) to state publications with whom all issues would be resolved "on a routine footing." It is just that, taking into account the sad Russian tradition of self-devouring authorities, it would have made sense to restrict in the law the very list of official publications, striking a balance and clearly indicating to which of the branches of power each publication should belong. There is even more reason to do so because the official organs should obviously be financed directly from the budget, and it is the direct responsibility of the parliament elected by the people to count the taxpayer's money. This is it. I repeat that this is where a legislator should leave off if he seeks to ensure precisely the thing he talks about publicly. However, our legislator is not like that. A text from a quite different quarter has been inserted into the original text of the law devoted solely to STATE mass media. Specifically, Article 4, which in essence regulates the relationship between the state and the entire INDEPENDENT press altogether, and then on the most essential score--financial. From the point of view of canons, this is like an excerpt from a manual on steel pouring being printed in a cookbook. First, the relationship between the state and the independent press is regulated by a separate law, and if something needs to be changed, amendments to the already existing law should be passed or yet another, new law should be passed. In any event, this issue should be voted on separately rather than attached to a law devoted to another, unimportant problem. Second, this is about money and, as we will see, a lot of it; therefore, a separate consideration is even more necessary because this substantially increases the expenditure side of the budget. Third, although this is poetry, actually such legislative changes in the financial relationship between the state and the independent press, as we will see, call into question the independence of the press in general, and this already amounts to an incursion into the sphere of constitutional liberties.... However, it is clear that those who inserted Article 4 into the original text did not act out of glaring incompetence; quite the opposite. It is precisely a separate vote on this issue that they were trying to avoid, aware that in that case the alignment of votes would be uncertain, to put it mildly. This is why I have the right to talk about a scheme. However, just as paleontologists restore the image of a dinosaur based on the imprint of its hind leg preserved in hard coal, I can restore the image of the giant who walked through here from the text of Article 4.... It reads: "Printed periodicals shall publish materials or communications of the state organs of the Russian Federation and its components under contracts and at a fee out of the funds allocated from the relevant budget to ensure the operation of these state organs." It is precisely the independent press that is meant here by "printed periodicals" because the dependent press is named the "state mass media," and this is specifically mentioned in the text. A numerical calculation, which judging from the signature was prepared by one I.Ye. Vybornova, chairman of the subcommittee for economic support of the mass media, is enclosed with the text. I am not going to give the details of these numbers. I ask that you trust me as a professional newspaperman--the numbers are stupid and pulled out of a hat. However, two circumstances are important to us in this instance: First, it is suggested that the state will pay the newspapers for the latter to communicate the fact of the existence of the state on a daily basis AT ADVERTISING RATES, and that the total amount will exceed 40 billion rubles [R], apparently in the few months to come (incidentally, no precise time period is indicated). So, if we perceive all that has been written here literally, it is plain gobbledygook. As is known, the independent press does not publish the texts of laws, official acts, and so on. At best it offers information on them and as a rule such information is prejudiced. It is somehow absurd to pay state money for this. Besides, it does not make sense--this is money going the drain because, whether or not the state pays, the independent press will offer information about all state events and decrees of any consequence in any event--after all, nobody would read a large proportion of the newspapers otherwise, and they would go bankrupt. Paying at advertising rates is impossible; advertisement is goods by the piece, and the cost of newspaper space for advertising is measured in centimeters. For example, how are you going to calculate how many centimeters in the discourse of a particular commentator may be appraised as advertising for a state organ? Incidentally, which organ? The president? But what if the commentator praises the Duma and, as of today, dislikes the president? However, it is not worthwhile to sort through all this delirium because this is not what it was meant for. Actually, this is about so-called state subsidies for the press, except that this time the issue is hidden within new and not very fortunate packaging. It is hidden because in the open it would run into quite legitimate resistance. The issue of subsidies for the press arose most acutely after the price explosion in January 1992. Since the funds for subscriptions were collected for one year in advance, still at old prices, it was clear that newspapers would not survive given soaring prices for newsprint, transportation, energy, services of the Ministry of Communications, and so on. The situation was piquant because by then most central newspapers had either registered their independence from the state or had claimed such. However, all of them demanded money from the state in unison at that point. Ultimately, the state proceeded to do this, despite Gaydar's categorical objections. Most newspapers got subsidies (tremendous amounts for the budget), although a few with the largest circulation, in particular KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and TRUD, got the lion's share of subsidies. This measure may have been justified at that point in order to prevent a cataclysmic collapse of the press at the initial stage of reforms (at the time most of the press supported them). Besides, having allocated the money, the government could not help getting certain things in return. This function of collecting ideological tribute from the newspapers was assumed by Mikhail Poltoranin, minister of the press at the time. Mikhail Nikiforovich liked to have journalists eating out of his hand. For him this was a huge and interesting area of work: to compile lists of publications, to weigh thoroughly and for a long time whom to give or not to give subsidies, to discuss this with editors, naturally giving advice in the process as to what tone they should write in and about which branch of power.... However, in the public eye Mikhail Nikiforovich, on the contrary, appeared as the only savior of the free press: Look, I have pushed through the subsidies, and I push them through every day.... The microscopic sum he allocated to the newspapers PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA at the time gave him the pretext to regularly refer to himself on TV screens as the model of a Genuine Democrat: Look, I have given money to the opposition, too. (At the time few people pondered the fact that this particular opposition suited the government.) In the few years since, the situation in the newspaper market has changed qualitatively. The circulation of all newspapers has dropped substantially, not right away but rather gradually, and nothing horrible has happened. The sky has not fallen. Quite the contrary, the combined circulation of publications has not changed all that much; the readership was redistributed. It came out that a tremendous number of "central" newspapers (which was natural in a huge, strictly centralized state) was apparently just not needed in a much smaller country which, in addition, is structured on the federal rather than totalitarian principle. It has been precisely local and regional publications that have developed. New nonpoliticized publications have come along which, it transpires, can survive on their own. Banks have appeared which have already matured enough to finance newspapers, thus relieving the state of this burden. However, the payment of subsidies has continued, though understandably not to all. As a result the situation in the newspaper market has begun to assume slightly absurd features: Prices for newsprint and everything else are growing; the still centralized Rospechat [Main Directorate for Press Distribution of the Ministry of Communications] is unable to handle the distribution of newspapers and is also demanding greater funds, likewise the postal service; the number of subscribers is falling steadily, but the number of newspapers is increasing anyway! There is a shortage of journalists already! The subsidies are one of the principal reasons. Tens of thousands of tonnes of wasted paper are returned as scrap because dozens of publications exist in the old, preserved form due to subsidies. The impossibility of accomplishing oneself while working in a press that is independent de jure but not de facto, which is becoming increasingly obvious to journalists, is another reason. The reluctance of the regions to have a press dependent solely on an uncle from Moscow is yet another reason, and so on, and so forth, all the way to the readers' desire to have a choice.... I am not maintaining that state assistance to the press is completely unnecessary: The newspaper business is very risky, and regulatory intervention of the state in one form or another is necessary. The forms of such intervention which are accepted in civilized countries have long been known: Primarily tax relief (newspapers are still fleeced at the rate of commercial enterprises); second, subsidization of the relevant mail and communication services (which in essence would amount to moving the money from one of the state's pockets to another), and finally, leasing of premises to publications at preferential rates (meanwhile, in our country, even in the notorious House of the Press on Pushkin Street in Moscow, "merchants" were ensconced upon "merchants" who naturally had the resources to give bribes). Finally, the state must of course maintain a comparatively small proportion of publications (in terms of funding)--specialized children's, medical, scientific, etc. publications. Incidentally, even they can be financed out of other relevant items of expenditure, and no political allusions will arise in this matter. All of this has been known for a long time and published 100 times. Why does the issue of subsidies surface, as we can see, yet again and in this sophisticated form? As the saying goes, look for the one who benefits.... In very simple terms, subsidies are necessary for a few dozen small publications, of whose existence, I am convinced, an overwhelming majority of the population is not even aware; these publications will immediately die off in the absence of subsidies. Besides, the two supermonopoly giants of the domestic press, TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, apparently insist on subsidies. It is precisely subsidies that help them maintain their circulation at the quite high level of a few million copies. However, neither newspaper will collapse if it is deprived of subsidies: It is just that their circulations will drop (the circulation of the already mentioned KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has dropped in recent years from 22 million to 3 million, but the people were not left without information nonetheless--nature abhors a vacuum). Why does KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA need a circulation that is still huge by current standards, even at the price of losing real independence from state structures and a continuous shortage of funds to pay for newsprint? Perhaps KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA does not need this, but the Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company does. The size of profits from advertisements depends on circulation, and these profits of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA are not measured in tens of millions. Naturally they are not returned to any budget but are rather put to use again through commercial structures of the Komsomolskaya Pravda Joint-Stock Company. It seems to me that we know what to call the allocation of sums going into billions from the state budget to a private commercial company which extracts profits from them and distributes the profits among its people. It is just that the legal practice of the world appears to lack a term for instances in which the parliament is involved in this. A companion memorandum enclosed with the draft law is signed by the chairman of the Committee for Information Policy--indeed, the same Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoranin. I do not intend to suspect the former minister, who still cultivates a warm relationship with the leaders of a number of publications, of being commercially interested--this will never be proven! However, Mikhail Poltoranin's political interest is obvious: After all, tax relief, which can truly improve the situation of the entire press, does not call for creating some kind of structure which would once again carve up the pie and, therefore, keep the hungry on a leash. Meanwhile subsidies--even in the form of "payments for advertising the state," ridiculous as it might be--do call for creating some kind of commission or committee that will decide how much to give to whom, and who ran the better or worse advertisement. Understandably, whoever heads this committee will have informal influence on the two largest newspapers in the country, and therefore carry an altogether different political weight of his own.... However, this does not exhaust the list of incongruences (or congruences--depending on the angle you take) in the text of the draft law. Further on, after this small extraneous insert which will cost the taxpayer R45 billion, an altogether wild text follows that is devoted to the problems of our poor television, virtually all of which, with the exception of Independent Television, is unfortunately state-owned. At first the issue is what television is obliged to show in newscasts. In the opinion of the legislator, newscasts should consist of a demonstration of what the various organs of power from the very top to the very bottom, along both the executive and representative vertical chains of command, are doing. I quote: "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in question, in all informational programs reports on: "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping with Articles 88, 93, Part 2, Article 87, Part 2, Article 92, Part 2, Article 108, Parts 2 and 3, Article 111, Points a), c), and e), Article 83, Points a), b), c), and f), Part 1, Article 84, Points a), b), c), d), and e), Part 1, Article 102, Points a), b), f) and g), Part 1, Article 103 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance shall include, on the day of occurrence of the event in question, in all informational programs reports on: "decisions and actions falling within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation president or the Russian Federation Constitutional Court, or constituting the responsibility of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in keeping with Parts 1, 4, and 5, Article 102, Points c), d) and e), Article 103 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation; "statements of the Russian Federation president, chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation Government; "presentations by the chairman of the Russian Federation Government, deputy chairmen of the Russian Federation Government, and federal ministers at the proceedings of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly; "press conferences of the Russian Federation president, the chairman of the Russian Federation Government, the chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, the chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, as well as press conferences held by decisions of the committees, commissions, factions, or deputy groups of the chambers of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly; "other publicly significant facts of activities of the federal organs of state power. "The state audiovisual mass media of federal significance must ensure prompt information for TV viewers and radio listeners concerning official visits by the heads of foreign states and governments to the Russian Federation, as well as about official visits abroad of the Russian Federation president and delegations of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly or the Russian Federation Government...." Alas, this is just the beginning. These are merely newscasts, and everything else follows on several pages. Everything is regimented--the time of broadcasting (prior to 2400), an opportunity to cut advertisement into the stream of official reports (impossible), the length and frequency of other programs, coordination procedures, and so on. Even the "preferential right" of the speaker on the principal issue to appear on the air is envisioned, as well as that of a deputy who has spoken at a meeting if his point of view has won a certain number of votes. It is envisioned that all these programs should not overlap in time if they are broadcast on different channels. The order in which video episodes should be placed is envisioned: first, about the parliament, then about then president, then about the governments, and so on, up to mandatory participation by journalists in "informational and educational programs" about the operation of the state organs and criminal liability for violating the present law. It is instructive that all this legislative gibberish is subsequently extended from the federal, central level to all others in descending order. According to the beautifully consistent bureaucratic thought, the same should be happening to local radio and television! That is to say, the local authorities do not have the right to sort things out even with their own television--here is the federation for you.... In general I am recounting all this with amazement rather than outrage: Unlike the issue of subsidies, this part of the "law" is absolutely harmless because it cannot be carried out in principle. It would be easier to close television down. Besides, sooner or later the state will be compelled to set television free just as it did newspapers: It is impossible to maintain television out of the budget. However, another point is the most essential in this instance--that this, if we may say so, draft law has been passed by the Duma in the first reading. While I have loved the parliament for a long time and with devotion regardless of who is in it, just as a symbol of hope that one day we will be all right, too, I cannot but note that the continuous struggle of the democrats against parliamentarism has borne fruit. Obviously the current Duma does not have legal personnel with any degree of skill (all of them have long been in the presidential structures, banks, or overseas; besides, who is going to come to a place where shots are fired, and not blank ones!). Meanwhile, a parliament is first of all a research establishment, and only then a voting machine. The parliament should have at its disposal the best personnel, time, and material potential in order to not vote on such gibberish. As the first attempt indicates, our parliament lacks all these. A few more "tries" of this nature and the Duma will indeed have to be disbanded: After all, control of a spaceship cannot be entrusted to the intellect of an ape.
