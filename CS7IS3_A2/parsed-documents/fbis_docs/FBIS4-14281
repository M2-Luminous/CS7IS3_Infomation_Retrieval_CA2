[passage omitted] The days proceedings of the information and study workshop was also characterized by the intervention of Mr. Mokdad Sifi, the head of government, with an address during the opening meeting in which he touched, in particular, on the consequences of the agreement our country had recently concluded with the IMF, which aims to insure the highest possible level of stability in the national economy and create the objective conditions to resume a continuous growth that will insure the alleviation and gradual elimination of all forms of imbalances and serious pressures at times that burden our society at the present. The head of government pointed out in his intervention that resorting to rescheduling the debts of our country has come at a time when Algeria has become unable to face the maturity dates of its debts on the one hand, and to respond to the basic needs of its citizens and economy, on the other. This reflects the inevitable nature of the debt rescheduling effort. Here the head of government said: [Begin Safi recording] This effort was impossible to avoid, especially when Algeria had to import the high-cost staple foodstuffs, which cannot be reduced, with hard currency that constitute a heavy burden on the foreign currency accounts of the country. I would like to point out in this instance, so that we comprehend the dimensions of the country's financial difficulties, that we are obliged to face up to annual expenditures estimated at least to be three billion dollars in respect of the widely-consumed stuff only. And if we talk about the details, in respect of cereals, including hard wheat, soft wheat, and semolina and flour, Algeria consumes more than 3 million tonnes annually, namely to the value of 780 million dollars. Thus, Algeria alone consumes about 40 percent of the world exports. Regarding milk, Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes worth 560 million dollars. Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes of oils worth 200 million dollars. Algeria also consumes 950,000 tonnes of sugar worth 320 million dollars, and 120,000 tonnes of coffee worth 160 million dollars. Regarding medicines, it consumes a quantity worth 500 million dollars. Of the total value of only these commodities I have mentioned, Algeria is committed to spend an amount estimated at 2.5 billion dollars annually. In addition to that, the costs of imports of this type of commodity in the current circumstances is very high. [end recording]
