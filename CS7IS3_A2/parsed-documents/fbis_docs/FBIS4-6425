Hunger strikes under way on two of the squares in the capital, and people are getting up on soap boxes, one group demanding the government should resign, and the other defending it. Opposition forces accuse the cabinet of ministers of conducting an ineffective economic policy, and also accuse the premier of corruption. The hunger strikers among the opposition forces include Former Vice-President R. Gonchigdorj, leader of the Mongolian Socialist Democratic Party. He deemed it impossible to continue taking part in the work of the People's Great Hural session, believing that parliament is delaying a decision on a no-confidence vote in the government. Ts. Elbegdorj, leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party, also gave up his deputy mandate and left the parliament session for the same reason. Supporters of the present government, however, think it has made important strides to stabilize the economy and implement the transition to market relations, and that it should be given the opportunity of working its full term according to the Constitution. They have announced a mass rally for today in support of the government. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray and President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat are expected to address the parliamentary session today.
