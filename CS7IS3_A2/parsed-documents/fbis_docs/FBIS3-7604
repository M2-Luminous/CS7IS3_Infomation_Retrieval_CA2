This was when he was told by Mr. Lam Chuan Leong, permanent secretary of the Trade and Industry Ministry, that the report may have breached the Official Secrets Act [OSA]. It was only then that he looked up the act and came to his conclusion that BT had not committed an offence, said the attorney general [AG]. Mr. Chan Sek Keong said he saw no evidence which showed that the editor had thought about this before publishing the data. Nor did Daniel know where BT journalist Kenneth James had obtained the data from at the time it was sent to him over the BT's electronic message system, he added. Daniel, one of five men charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act, had said that he considered the possibility that publishing data obtained from the private sector was an offence, but dismissed it. This was because the data would already be in the public domain and could no longer be considered secret. He is charged with receiving the official flash estimate of Singapore's economic growth in the second quarter of 1992 and communicating it to BT readers on June 29, 1992. Submitting the prosecution's case against Daniel, Mr. Chan noted that ISD [Internal Security Department] officers had found a copy of the OSA in the BT offices with sections of the Act highlighted. This showed that Daniel had been studying the Act between the time the article was published and his first interview with the ISD. It also explained how Daniel was able to query the ISD officer recording his statement for more than an hour on aspects of the Act, he said. Earlier, Mr. Chan had told the court that Daniel had admitted to the ISD that he knew that publishing the flash estimate "could possibly be a breach of the OSA," but had done so to give BT readers an accurate picture of the economy. The AG urged the court not to believe Daniel's testimony clarifying this point, saying it was "merely an attempt to qualify his admissions to the ISD." Taking up the defence's argument that Daniel did not know that the 4.6 percent figure was the actual flash estimate, he said that whatever the editor thought about the figure, the fact was that he had published it. Besides, he had referred to the figure as the official flash estimate in his statements to the ISD and in the June 29 report, he noted. During the AG's two-hour long submissions, he was interrupted several times by Mr. K. Shanmugam, lawyer for Daniel. The lawyer wanted to state his client's position and seek clarifications. He said that Daniel did not know the figure was the flash estimate when he received it. It was only after it had been bounced off chief statistician Paul Cheung that he thought the figure might be close to the flash estimate. On Daniel's belief that it was not an offence to publish official data if it came from a private sector source, he said that his client had operated with a"mental map," which included this belief, he said. Besides, he argued the prosecution's submission was inconsistent with its earlier arguments. "If Mr. Daniel did not even consider the OSA either at the time of receipt or at the time of publication, it seems to me logically inconsistent to argue that he knew that it could possibly be a breach of the Act," he said, asking the AG to clarify his position. Mr. Chan replied that he would consider this point and respond today when the prosecution is expected to wrap up its submissions.
