FR940119-2-00082 FR940119-2-00059 9. The management fees for the Funds will not exceed the maximum fees currently paid by the limited partners in each corresponding Partnership. It is expected that other Fund expenses generally will be higher as a percentage of net asset value than the expenses of a corresponding Partnership. This is primarily because of the increased operating costs of a registered investment company and compliance with additional regulatory requirements. Through the end of calendar 1994, however, the Adviser will limit annual Fund expenses with the intention of capping Fund expense ratios at levels which would have been incurred during 1994 by the Partnerships. 10. The Funds' board of directors and TAMCO have considered the desirability of the Exchange from the respective points of view of the Company and the Partnerships. All of the members of the board, including all of the independent directors, and TAMCO have approved the Exchanges and concluded that: (a) The Exchanges are desirable as a business matter from the respective points of view of the Company and the Partnerships; (b) the Exchanges are in the best interests of the Company and the Partnerships; (c) the Exchanges are reasonable and fair, do not involve overreaching, and are consistent with the policies of the Act; (d) the Exchanges are consistent with the policies of the Company and the Partnerships; and (e) the interests of existing shareholders in the Company and existing partners will not be diluted as a result of the Exchanges. 11. The Exchanges will not be effected until each of the following conditions is satisfied: the Company's registration statement has been declared effective; the SEC has issued an order relating to the application; and the Company has received a favorable opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the Exchanges. 12. The Exchanges will establish the Funds as the successor investment vehicles to the Partnerships. The Exchanges will permit partners to pursue the same investment objectives and policies they were expecting from the Partnerships as shareholders of the Funds without sacrificing the pass-through tax features of the Partnerships. In addition, shareholders of the Funds will be able to purchase and redeem shares on each business day, as opposed to only once per month as in currently provided under the partnership agreements. The Funds expect that operating as registered investment companies will help encourage net asset growth. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a) prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of such persons, from selling to or purchasing from such company any security or other property. Each Partnership may be an affiliated person of the Company because TAMCO, the general partner of the Partnerships, and the Adviser, the investment adviser of the Company, are under common control. Thus, the proposed Exchanges may be prohibited by section 17(a) if they are viewed as principal transactions between the Company and the partners of the Partnerships, or between the Company and the Partnerships. 2. Section 17(b) provides for SEC approval of a proposed affiliated transaction that would be otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 3. Applicants believe that the proposed Exchanges meet the terms of section 17(b). They represent, among other things, that the investment objectives and policies of each Fund are substantially similar to the corresponding Partnerships. In addition, after the Exchanges, limited partners will hold substantially the same assets as Fund shareholders as they previously had held as limited partners. In this sense, the Exchanges can be viewed as a change in the form in which the assets are held, rather than a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns.
