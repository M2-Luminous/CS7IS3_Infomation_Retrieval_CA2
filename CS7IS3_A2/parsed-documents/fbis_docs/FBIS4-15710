The IAEA director general has proposed (and Leonid Kravchuk has agreed) calling an international conference on Chernobyl AES in the second half of April because the station's safety level does not meet international standards. Malfunctions have also been discovered in its operating units. There are many reasons -- a shortage of skilled personnel and modern equipment, arduous working conditions. It is dangerous to operate the Chernobyl AES. But as we know, under a decision by the Ukrainian parliament, which was facing an energy crisis, the station resumed work last October.
