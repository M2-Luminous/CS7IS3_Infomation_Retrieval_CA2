At 2100 GMT on Tuesday evening, after having "tied up" the Swedish and Finnish dossiers, the Twelve managed to conclude the talks with Austria, which balked for a long time on the question of the transit of EU trucks across its high mountain pastures. Thus, on Tuesday the EU entered a new era, that of the community of 15 member states, or even 16 if the negotiations with Norway, which are still stymied over the obstacle represented by fishing, are brought to an end within the next few days. "I have rarely felt as happy as I did after going 100 hours without sleep," said Hans Van Den Broek, the European Commissioner responsible for external political relations, at a press conference. The success of the negotiations with these three countries "demonstrates that the EU is not a closed space," emphasized Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose country has the presidency of the Council of the Twelve for six months. "We have laid the foundations of a greater Europe which now needs to be consolidated and strengthened at its structural level, as is due to happen at the intergovernmental conference planned for 1996," he added. The slight delay in the negotiations, compared with the planned schedule, should not prevent the EP from receiving the treaties of accession and ratifying them on 7 May, indicated Hans van den Broek. According to Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the financial concessions made by the Twelve, especially with a view to "sweetening the pill" of the brutal opening of the borders of the candidate member states to the Community's agricultural products, which are much cheaper than their domestic produce, and in order to satisfy their desire to see the Arctic regions, with their low density populations, sustained, will merely limit the profits that the EU will obtain when they join. "From the very first year, the new member states will be net contributors to the Community budget," assured Mr. Claes. For example, Sweden will be granted a transitional period, allowing it not to contribute 100 percent to the EU budget. Moreover, Stockholm has secured financial aid for its farmers worth ECU435 million (17.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] -- BELGA editor's note) over a four-year period. Meanwhile, Finland will see 85 percent of its farmland deemed eligible for European agricultural subsidies, with the remaining 15 percent being able to benefit from national subsidies. Between 1995 (the planned date of accession -- BELGA editor's note) and 1999, Helsinki will also receive ECU340 million (BFr13.6 billion -- BELGA editor's note) per annum in regional aid, in order to boost the development of the poorest, least populated regions of the country. On Tuesday evening, the negotiators for the EU and Austria succeeded in eliminating the last bone of contention which was preventing Vienna from following in the footsteps of its Scandinavian fellow candidates. The prickly question of road transit was finally settled. The solution allows for the possibility of maintaining the current agreement until 1 January 1998, then extending it until 1 January 2001, barring a unanimous decision to the contrary by the Council, which is virtually impossible, since Austria will then belong to it. The final stage, also lasting three years, will be linked to a preliminary study by the European Commission. If this study concludes that the Austrian requirement that polluting emissions be reduced by 60 percent has been fulfilled, then the agreement will be abolished. Should this not be the case, the transit agreement would be relaunched for three years, unless a qualified majority in the Council decided on an alternative system enabling the same objective to be reached. However, the Norwegian case remains to be solved. The negotiators managed to clear an appreciable amount of ground, reaching agreement on the dossiers on taxation and agriculture, indicated Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos. On the other hand, the question of access for Community boats to the extremely fish-rich Norwegian waters remains in abeyance, but Mr. Pangalos let it be known that he hoped to conclude a global political agreement as early as next Tuesday, or at any rate by the end of the month. The Twelve will still also have to agree on the adaptation of the institutions, and especially the apportionment of the votes within the Council of Ministers, as well as on the question of the inclusion of the new member states in the convergence criteria planned within the context of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). "However, that will not prevent the enlargement process from being concluded. Moreover, work on drafting the treaties of accession already started one month ago," concluded Mr. Pangalos.
