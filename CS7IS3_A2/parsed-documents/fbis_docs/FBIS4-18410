We Republikaner advocate a pluralistic rule-of-law state. The freedom of the individual is limited where it endangers the freedom of others. In order to strengthen and develop our democracy in the sense of more direct participation by the citizens, we Republikaner demand: - Direct election of the German president by the people; - Submission of constitutional amendments that are adopted by the Bundestag to the people for decision (referendum); - Introduction of petitions for a referendum and referendums at federal level, on the example of the constitution of the Free State of Bavaria; - Adherence to the principle of division of powers. Holders of a political mandate of the Bundestag and the landtage may neither hold another paid office nor be a member of the management or board of directors of a profit-oriented company. This excludes management functions in one's own company; - Prevention of the abuse of state institutions by political parties and groups, and a struggle against party-book mismanagement in connection with filling posts in public administrations; - Legal obligation of the responsible authority to apply within three months to the Federal Constitutional Court to ban any party that orders observation of another party by means of the intelligence service, and the right of a party itself to apply for a ruling on itself being banned as soon as it is mentioned in a report by the offices for the protection of the constitution; - In addition to the approval of two-thirds of the members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, an amendment to the Basic Law requires majority approval within the framework of a referendum.
