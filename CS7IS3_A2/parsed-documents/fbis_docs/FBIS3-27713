South Korea has offered to sell Thailand F-5s jet-fighters reportedly for one million to 1.5 million dollars each, but the RTAF has yet to enter into discussions on the proposed deal, the RTAF secretary said. South Korea has also offered to provide spare parts for their combat aircraft, he said, but Assistant Air Force Commander-in-Chief ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Samat Sotsathit and Air Force Chief-of-Staff ACM Kriangkrai Sinthawanon are yet to respond to the offer. RTAF Secretary VM Nan dismissed a report by South Korea's CHOSON ILBO newspaper that the F-5 deal between Thailand and South Korea was being negotiated with US approval. The South Korean newspaper quoted a South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman as saying that both sides were in the process of finalizing the deal and were discussing how many aircraft to sell, the price and other details. Thailand will buy about 10 F-5A Tiger jet-fighters and F-5B Phantom jet-fighters, the newspaper said. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek earlier in the week expressed support for the reported sale of the F-5s, saying they would be reliable, maintainable and cost-effective. The Royal Thai Air Force has repair and maintenance crews for the F-5 which Thailand also has in commission, he said. In other developments VM Nan disclosed that 36 Czech-made L-39 trainer/combat aircraft will be deployed well before schedule at Air Wing 1 in Nakhon Ratchasima and Air Wing 4 in Nakhon Sawan, beginning this month. The first batch of four two-seat L-39s were delivered to Air Wing 1 in October last year, roughly three months before schedule. The Royal Thai Air Force secretary said Air Wing 1 would deploy 22 of the Czech combat aircraft and Air Wing 4 would deploy 14. The Royal Thai Air Force and Cathay Pacific, meanwhile, are discussing damage compensation that the Hong Kong-based airline will pay for unlawfully making a short-cut flight over Thai airspace earlier this month, VM Nan said. The short-cut route prompted F-16 Fighting Falcon jet-fighters from Air Wing 1 to intercept the commercial airliner on January 8. The normal route for commercial airliners is Surat Thani--U- Taphao--Bangkok--Nakhon Ratchasima--Laos. But the Cathay Pacific plane made a short cut by not passing over Bangkok and flying straight from U-Taphao to Nakhon Ratchasima to save fuel. This kind of breach in airspace regulations has not taken place very often in Thailand, he said.
