I wouldn't like to talk of sharp confrontation with North Korea, Soskovets told a RIA correspondent. Russian firms and enterprises display noticeable interest in North Korea. The former USSR built their many enterprises and production capacities. This is our potential machine -- the metallurgic and energy market -- and it is not expedient to lose it for political reasons. At the same time the deputy prime minister pointed out that North Korea should unconditionally comply with the UN demands on nuclear power engineering.
