The United Nations appeal for up to 3,000 more troops will be high on the agenda when the Cabinet meets tomorrow. And a ministerial announcement could be made as early as tomorrow afternoon in the House of Commons. The Government has been deeply reluctant to be sucked in even more into the bloody Bosnian civil war. It has emphasised Britain's already heavy commitment with 2,400 troops on the ground together with major contributions to the air and naval operations. And it has been urging other UN countries to provide forces and share the load. But there was reluctant recognition in Whitehall tonight that Britain cannot be seen to fail when success appears so close, particularly as the man behind the six-day Sarajevo ceasefire -- Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose -- is British. "We would be lepers in the world community if we failed to reinforce what is a tremendous success," said one official. "Here is a man creating some success for the first time in two years and he is a Brit to boot. It would be very difficult to hold up our heads if we did not send more forces." It is understood the Government is seriously considering the deployment of an infantry battalion equipped with Saxon wheeled armoured personnel carriers and mortar locating radar specialists. Sources said troops from the Coldstream Guards based at Vitez in central Bosnia could be moved initially to Sarajevo to help the peacekeeping operation until new forces arrive. The most likely infantry unit to be deployed is the Green Howards, based at Catterick in North Yorkshire and the old regiment of the current Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Inge. The regiment, whose origins date back to 1689, is equipped with Saxon, a lightly armoured, manoeuvrable vehicle that is best described as a battlefield taxi. But the Army must decide whether the lightly armoured vehicles would be suitable for operations in Sarajevo. The Royal Artillery's 94 Locating Radar based at Larkhill, Wiltshire, is also likely to be deployed along with some other artillery units. It is equipped with the Cymbeline mortar locating radar, which detects the flight of a mortar bomb at two points in the trajectory as it passes through radar beams. Rapid computing produces a grid reference to identify the firing point. However, it is 1970's technology and uses a large radar dish, that is very vulnerable to sniper and other attacks. It is also heavily manpower intensive because, as there is no automatic alert system, it must be manned continuously 24 hours a day. However, there are grave doubts among a number of Tory MPs about Britain becoming even more embroiled in the Balkans bloodbath. Party officials believe they will have a lot of work to do to win all-round support for further deployments. But Labour's shadow defence Secretary, Dr David Clark, strongly urged the Government to make extra troops available. "Labour believes that UN military commanders on the ground in Bosnia should be provided with very rapid reinforcements of ground troops if they believe these are required," he said. UN officials said the extra troops were needed to buttress the truce, to try to demilitarise Sarajevo and even extend the process elsewhere in Bosnia. Meanwhile, NATO and UN forces are continuing to prepare for possible airstrikes once the deadline for the Serbs to pull back or hand over their heavy weapons expires at midnight Sunday [20 February]. UN officials formally confirmed for the first time that allied forward air controllers were in Sarajevo. They will use a variety of sophisticated equipment, including laser-designators to pinpoint targets for allied warplanes. NATO ambassadors in Brussels said they would not extend the weapons deadline on the Bosnian Serbs who have been besieging Sarajevo for 22 months. There was still optimism among UN officials that the early stages of demilitarisation of the battered city was progressing well. But the calm was briefly broken when a Serb sniper shot dead a Muslim civilian in the most serious violation of the ceasefire.
