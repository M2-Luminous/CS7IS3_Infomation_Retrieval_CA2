[Zenkov] There is no Russian initiative, but moves within the framework of cooperation among UN Security Council members. For two years now, the country-members of the Security Council have decided to coordinate their moves for common action and greater involvement of the Security Council in the efforts to solve the Cyprus issue. These deliberations take place in order to exchange views and evaluations so that the Security Council can have a more correct picture of what happens. [Koulermou-Larkou] Does this mean that we should not expect a dynamic intervention by Russia as in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Lamb's visit to Moscow gave the impression that something new is being done, that there is more movement. [Zenkov] Lamb's visit is part of routine deliberations. See it through this lens: We both see this glass on the table, it is the same glass. But due to your position, you see it from a different angle than I see it. Therefore, we as a member of the Security Council we have our own contacts with the two sides in Cyprus, not necessarily with the same people that the Americans, French and British meet. That is why it is necessary to brief each other. Nelson Ledsky [former U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus] went to Moscow too, just as we went to Washington for the same purpose. The Security Council aims at creating movement so that the UN secretary general's efforts bring results. [Koulermou-Larkou] Are you optimistic that the efforts will bring results? [Zenkov] In diplomacy, there is no room for someone who does not believe in justice and good. There are always hopes, otherwise why try? [Koulermou-Larkou] The fact that you try became evident a few days ago during a television interview. I would like you to tell me how you respond to criticism against you for the metaphor you used. You said, the Cyprus issue is like a patient suffering from gangrene and that the advised therapy is to cut off the infected leg. [United Democratic Union of Cyprus Chairman Vasos] Lissaridhis said that if this is the treatment you propose, then you are not a good doctor. [Lissaridhis is a doctor by profession] [Zenkov] Mr. Lissaridhis is a friend and I respect him. We always speak honestly and amiably in our meetings. But I should tell you that I do not aspire to get a doctor's diploma in Cyprus. The evaluation I made was not one of a doctor, but one of a diplomat. As I said at the beginning, I speak as a person who has lived in Cyprus for many years, loves this place and hopes that peace and stability will come. I did not analyze or write a doctoral thesis during that interview. I simply said what I feel and continue to believe that today we are living the last effort to keep what is called the Cyprus issue alive. Twenty years have passed without progress. The generations who remember cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are disappearing. The friendly feelings that existed at some point are being forgotten. Unfortunately, and this is a 20th century phenomenon, an explosion of chauvinism is coming to the surface. Pseudo-feelings and hates are created and the new generations perhaps will not have the desire to live in a unified Cyprus. This was the reason for my interview, and if some politicians or people did not like it, that does not mean I was unfair. As I say, I am not a ten-pound note that should be desirable to all. [Koulermou-Larkou] Do you think that there is a possibility of results in this last effort on the Cyprus issue, of which you are a part? [Zenkov] There is a possibility, but very little. What is left is the last one. Two or three more years and there will be no possibilities. At least, that is the way I see it. [Koulermou-Larkou] You said before that there is always hope. However, we are only at the beginning of this effort for the confidence-building measures and there are already such problems, which give the impression that we are close to an impasse. [Zenkov] No, we can not accept that there is no way out. If we find difficulties on the left, we will turn to the right. Again, if we find difficulties in our way, we will turn elsewhere. Of course there are problems. If they did not exist, there would not have been a need for us to be here and try to solve them. However, it is very early to expect something right now. Do not forget that the process of the confidence-building measures has just begun. [Koulermou-Larkou] Is it perhaps the waiting that causes anxiety? [Zenkov] We are also anxious. The Russians especially are very sensitive to someone else's pain. And me, personally. However, this anxiety reminds me of a Russian anecdote. In Russia's northern regions, where there is winter for 11 months and spring for one month, a farmer plants potatoes as soon as spring comes. The next day, he digs out the potatoes he planted and begins eating them. A friend asks him: What are you doing? The farmer says: I can not wait for them to grow. I am hungry now.... So in Cyprus too, some people are anxious to reach conclusions or expect results before anything begins.
