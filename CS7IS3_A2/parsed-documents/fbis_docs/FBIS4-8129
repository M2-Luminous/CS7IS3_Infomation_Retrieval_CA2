We protest resolutely against such an impertinent action that undermines the root of all efforts to resolve the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in a peaceful way, the statement emphasizes and then stresses: The attack of NATO forces against the republic of Serbian Krajina [as heard] further diminished the trust of the Serbian people in the international community, which has been minimal even so far due to its partisan and biased attitude in the past. With such an act of aggression, the international community has declared war on the Serbian people, and is, with the threat of the NATO war machinery, trying to force it, in this way, to embrace immediately the solutions that are in the interest of the other two warring sides and to its detriment. At the end of the statement issued in light of the NATO attack on Serbian positions in the vicinity of Gorazde, RSK President Milan Martic points out: The people and the RSK leadership once again give their unreserved support to our brothers in the Srpska republic in their efforts to defend their country and their freedom, won with blood. The responsibility for all possible consequences that can, due to the bombing of the Srpska republic, further (?undermine) the course of the peace process on the territories of the former Yugoslavia will be borne by the perpetrators of this hasty act. At the same time, we warn the responsible international factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to resolve its future political status through pressures, regardless of where they might come from. This is all from Knin for the time being -- a statement by RSK President Milan Martic in light of the NATO attack.
