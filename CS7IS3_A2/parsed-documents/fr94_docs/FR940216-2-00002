The Standing and Special Reef Fish Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 10 a.m to 12:30 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review proposed Draft Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment 9 includes management measures to collect historical landings data from fishermen, to extend the reef fish permit moratorium and the red snapper endorsement system, and to provide partial red snapper endorsements in 1995 to historical captains if the red snapper endorsement system is extended. The historical landings data will be used to establish the eligibility of fishermen if a system to limit access to the red snapper fishery is implemented based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs) or license limitations. Individuals would be notified of their potential allocation. The Standing and Special Shrimp Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. The purpose of that meeting is to review Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico which proposes to: (1) Define overfishing for white shrimp; (2) Provide for a framework adjustment for the overfishing definitions for brown, white, and pink shrimp; (3) Revise the overfishing definition for royal red shrimp; and (4) Eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing to allow the domestic fleet to harvest the entire optimum yield. The Standing Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 3 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. for consideration of operation procedures. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: (Shrimp) Terrance R.
