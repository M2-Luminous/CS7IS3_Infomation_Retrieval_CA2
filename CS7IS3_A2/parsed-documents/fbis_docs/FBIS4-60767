The two days of talks were to focus on the priorities in legislative activity and outlining the 1995 state budget. Work goes on in a number of fields, such as farming and social security, governmental spokesman Ain Saarna said. Also discussed will be the implementation of the law on aliens and extending the deadline for submitting the residence and working permit applications for non-citizens. "Neither political problems nor the government reform will be officially discussed. There is also no reason to think that these issues would be taken for discussion at the Lohusalu meeting," the spokesman said. The meeting's atmosphere this time is much more serious and business-like than it was at a similar meeting last year, said MP Andrus Villem. "One can feel that people know what they want and what they are doing," he said. "There are no major differences in opinions within the government coalition at present," Villem said, adding that all disputes concerned only details of minor importance. All political parties in the Estonian government coalition take part in the two-day meeting. Also most of the Cabinet members are present. Thursday's meeting was presided by Prime Minister Mart Laar.
