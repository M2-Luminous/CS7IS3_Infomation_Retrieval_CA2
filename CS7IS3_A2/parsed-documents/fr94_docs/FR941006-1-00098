FR941006-1-00098 FR941006-1-00015 ยง9034.4 Use of contributions and matching payments. (a) Qualified campaign expenses _ (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an individual from the date he or she becomes a candidate and all matching payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray qualified campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds (other than contributions which were received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses. (2) Testing the waters. Even though incurred prior to the date an individual becomes a candidate, payments made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1) for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall count against that candidate's limits under 2 U.S.C. 441a(b). (3) Winding down costs. (i) Costs associated with the termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. A candidate may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or she has notified the Commission in writing of his or her withdrawal from the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating convention, if he or she has not withdrawn before the convention. (ii) If the candidate has become ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b),he or she may only receive matching funds to defray costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility, for goods and services to be received before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's date of ineligibility, until the candidate is eligible to receive winding down costs under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. (iii) For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign. (4) Taxes. Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, however, count against the state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 9035.1(a). (5) Gifts and monetary bonuses. Gifts and monetary bonuses for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition for campaign-related activities or services shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that the gifts do not exceed $150 total per individual, and provided that the total for all gifts and monetary bonuses (except bonus arrangements provided for in advance in an employment or consulting contract) does not exceed $20,000. (b) Non-qualified campaign expenses _ (1) General. The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses. * * * * * (3) Post-ineligibility expenditures. Any expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified campaign expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). Any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility are not qualified campaign expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that capital assets delivered within 60 days of the first day of the candidate's party's national nominating convention are general election assets; and that a local campaign office that remains open more than 30 days after a state's primary election or the close of any other nomination process in that state is operating in support of the general election campaign. * * * * * (8) Negligent Handling of Public Funds. The cost of items that are lost or misplaced due to negligence shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. Factors in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned by the committee. * * * * *
