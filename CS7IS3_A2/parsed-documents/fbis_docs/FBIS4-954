Good evening, Mr. Luitingh. [Luitingh] Good evening, Mr. du Preez. [Du Preez] Dogs of War [preceding words in English] -- why do you romanticize war? [Luitingh] I think that was a name given to us by the press, and that is how we arrived at Dogs of War. [Du Preez] But what is it? What I am trying to determine what makes people like you move from one war to another? Does it have to do with a type of personality? Is that what you do? Are you addicted to war? [Luitingh] I was trained in the South African Defense Force [SADF], and I served in some or other state department, until the closure of the CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau], after which I found myself jobless. With my qualifications, relating to war techniques, I tried to find work, but it was difficult until an opportunity presented itself. We were first trained by the South African Defense Force, then Executive Outcomes, Military Intelligence [MI], and thereafter the Angolan army trained us. [Du Preez] Tell us about Executive Outcomes. Who heads this organization? Who belongs to it? [Luitingh] Executive Outcomes was established in 1989 by Eben Barlow to train the SADF. This training, as I have said, was for MI and several courses were offered to those people. [Du Preez] Eben Barlow is himself a South African and a former member of the Force? [Luitingh] Eben Barlow is a former member of 32 Reconnaissance Wing, and he is also a former member of the Force. Last year at Soyo, Executive Outcomes was offered a contract to secure oil installations inside Soyo, and I was one of the members hired by Executive Outcomes to do this work. Thereafter, I became part of Executive Outcomes, and along with Mr. (Nico Palim) of Executive Outcomes we made a proposal to the Angolan Government to train their soldiers and restructure their army. [Du Preez] Who are the men who were recruited. Are these men former CCB, Koevoet [former Namibian police counterinsurgency unit], 32 Battalion forces? [Luitingh] Yes, we recruited former CCB members, former special force members, Koevoet members, 32 Battalion members, paratroopers, and several other Defense Force division members to assist us in training operations in certain areas. [Du Preez] Excuse me, but I find it strange -- former soldiers, people like you who have a proud record, as I have heard, in the reconnaissance commando, people who have fought against communism and who have a long history of this -- how did it come about that when you became unemployed in the new army, that you turned to this side? Wouldn't it have been more predictable for you to align yourselves with the right-wing, because I understand that there are people who have joined the right-wing? [Luitingh] That is possible. I don't know about this. The reason we are in Angola....[pauses] As you will remember, UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] is comprised of freedom fighters who fought for democracy within Angola, and at that stage when we helped them we fought against communism and for democracy in Angola. An election took place in Angola, won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and lost by UNITA. They are the democratically elected government inside Angola, and they are recognized by, among others, our government and the Americans. The UN declared this election free and fair. We are now working with the Angolans, still for the freedom of Angola. [Du Preez] Don't you find it strange to first fight alongside a unit and then against it? [Luitingh] For me, not at all. I did not enjoy working with UNITA. I regarded them as a lot of crooks and liars. So I do not feel strange. I can't say how others feel. [Du Preez] Why do you say crooks and liars? [Luitingh] Because I think Colonel Breytenbach summed it up very well approximately two years ago, when he said they were poor soldiers, that they were smuggling ivory and diamonds. Jonas Savimbi murdered more of his own people -- more Angolans that anyone else -- those who rebelled against him. He also, among other things, during the time he lived in Luanda during the elections, shot policemen and buried them in his garden. I saw this happening. UNITA is a terrorist organization at this stage and their leader is a criminal. [Du Preez] Mr. Breytenbach says you are fighting for communists against an old ally. [Luitingh] Yes, I do not know what the reasons are for Mr. Jan Breytenbach's statements. I don't think there are emotional connections with UNITA. I think he probably has a double agenda in this case. [Du Preez] What motivates you to put your lives in danger in Angola? Is it money? [Luitingh] As I told you, we have to work to stay alive. Angola is one of the places inside Africa where there is work for people like us. In South Africa, at this stage, there are 10,000 soldiers deployed in kwaZulu. I believe this is a way of life in Africa, and it is something we are good at. [Du Preez] What is your relationship with the ANC? I understand Col. Breytenbach also alleged that you are training Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] hit squads [preceding two words in English]. [Luitingh] I think this is romanticizing by Col. Breytenbach. We are not training anyone within the ANC. I do not have a problem with that though. Personally, if the ANC or General Constand Viljoen....[pauses] To work under any new government....[pauses] If I should be asked to train anyone, I will give that training as long as it is within the law. [Du Preez] Excuse me, I want to try again: I did try hard to telephone Col. Breytenbach and he was unreachable today, but he also says the plan, this fighting strategy or whatever plan you have there -- I know little of what you are doing in Angola -- is a stupid plan and a life-threatening plan, and he is trying to persuade families of South Africans who have joined you, to bring their people back. What do you say about this? [Luitingh] I question Col. Breytenbach's motive behind this. I also questions his methods -- trying to intimidate women and children. It reminds me of the beginning of the century. If he had any reason to be concerned about the people in Angola, then he -- and I know him personally -- would have come to me to tell me that our plan is stupid, that we will lose people, that we shouldn't do it. He did not do this. I know that the plan he is talking about is not one of our plans. The information he is getting, I think, is being fed to him for certain objectives. [Du Preez] What are you doing in Angola? [Luitingh] At this stage we are busy with training. We are involved in humanitarian work. We are also busy with community projects, and we are acting as advisers to the MPLA. [Du Preez] Did you ever come into direct conflict with UNITA? [Luitingh] There were several incidents in which UNITA attacked our people. Yes, there were incidents of direct conflict with UNITA. [Du Preez] And the result? [Luitingh] I don't believe that this is of interest right now. [Du Preez] Did you come off second best? [Luitingh] No, definitely not. I think we are making a huge difference inside Angola. If you can remember, approximately a year back UNITA occupied approximately 80 percent of Angola, and if we look at the map of Angola now, I think it I closer to 50-50. The Angolans are achieving tremendous victories. I don't want to say this is as a result of us, but I want to believe that we are playing an important role in helping the MPLA to drive out the terrorist UNITA organization from Angola. [Du Preez] Today we tried to invite the Defense Force to come here, but they would not. Why is it that MI, as I understand it, and other elements of the Defense Force, and also apparently Foreign Affairs, is unhappy about the work done by Executive Outcomes in Angola? [Luitingh] I think there are individuals inside the Defense Force who are possibly jealous. I know there are certain elements within the Defense Force who tried to get this contract. There could also be an emotional connection between members of the Defense Force and members of UNITA. [Du Preez] People have been killed in Angola and there are people missing. [Luitingh] Yes. [Du Preez] Why is it being kept secret? [Luitingh] I just want to say that we are very sorry about the people who have been killed or who are missing. That was definitely not our plan when we went in. However, our contract does say that people could possibly be killed. We try to protect the families. We also try to protect individuals who are possibly still alive. Concerning those missing -- we try to protect them. We would like UNITA to declare publicly who these people are, and then they could fall under the Geneva Convention. If we announce places and names of people, then it makes it easier for UNITA and certain people to use propaganda against us. [Du Preez] The fact that you are fighting as old South African soldiers in Angola -- is this not in contravention of the defense act? [Luitingh] The defense act says that hired soldiers....[pauses] Although they do not describe mercenaries within the defense act.... [Du Preez, interrupting] Aren't you mercenaries? [Luitingh] I would like to read from the Afrikaans language dictionary the definition of the term mercenary, and then we can discuss the issue, because I think there is a lot of romanticizing about mercenaries: a soldier who is hired, fighting only for the money and not for an ideal. If we look at it this way, then I want to say that our work inside Angola concerns the ideal of a free Angola, so I do not believe we can be classified as mercenaries. It is true that we are being paid. [Du Preez] And a good salary at that, I understand. [Luitingh] Yes, that its correct. I want to add that I do not believe the SADF has an ideal for which they are fighting. I think most of them are doing it for the money or because they have no other choice. Maybe we should regard more than half of the SADF as mercenaries. [Du Preez] Are you trying to say there are no professional soldiers in South Africa who believe in the democratization process in the new South Africa? [Luitingh] I'm sure there are professional soldiers who believe that. I just doubt if all of them do. [Du Preez] You are in a position where you still have close contact with the security forces, especially the Defense Force. What is your opinion of the morale in the Defense Force in South Africa? [Luitingh] I don't understand what you are saying. [Du Preez] ?o you think there is still that old spirit of being a team with a task to perform? [Luitingh] For sure there is. The Defense Force is a very strong organization where the morale still runs high. In the years I have been in the Defense Force I experienced this, qspecially in mid-level management. [Du Preez] What about the quest for adventure? I'm now referring to your promotion; again that is romanticizing. Is there something like that spirit of adventure that also attracts you? If I asked you to do office work for the same amount of money you earn fighting in Angola, what would you choose? [Luitingh] I think the answer is obvious. I would surely not be able to sit in an office and do paperwork. It is not in my nature and my character. I also believe none of the people working for us would be able to do that type of work. [Du Preez] When you see a corpse -- you must have seen many corpses in your lifetime? [Luitingh] I don't think that is repulsive enough to make me prefer sitting in an office. I thin? my people experience more of life than people who sit in an office all day. I think we get the chance to experience and appreciate life. [Du Preez] In which parts of Angola are you involved? Around diamond and oil fields mostly? [Luitingh] I don't think it's tactically very good to tell you where we are involved. It might just make us more open to attacks by.... [Du Preez, interrupting] We have also seen in the media.... [Luitingh, interrupting] But that is not all correct, and I'm also not going to tell you what is correct and what is not. I'm sorry I can't answer that question. [Du Preez] You have recently been in Angola, and I understand you are once again on your way back there? [Luitingh] Yes. [Du Preez] Could you give us an idea of what the situation in Angola is like on the ground -- the people, the government, the civil administration, UNITA's strength? [Luitingh] The problem in Angola was that the Russans withdrew from Angola and left a big vacuum in all facets of society. The Angolan Government is presently trying very hard to reconstruct Angola. The society there is normal, just like in some of our townships in South Africa. The people suffer from hunger in Angola, especially in those areas under UNITA control, because food distributed by the United Nations is used by UNITA for its military ends. In Luanda itself, and in areas where the government is in control, the local population is relatively happy because the government is working hard to create job opportunities and at least to feed every Angolan. There are many foreign companies involved in development inside Angola, and the free market system is flourishing, at least in those areas I visited. The problem, of course, is that there is a civil war going on, that UNITA wants to take Angola over through a military victory, and that Savimbi wants to be a dictator. [Du Preez] Are there indications in your experience that UNITA is still being supported by elements from South Africa? [Luitingh] Yes, there are elements in South Africa that support UNITA, but I cannot tell you who they are. I have already tried to communicate this information to the relevant people in South Africa, but my plan is -- as soon as the elections are over -- to furnish this information to the new government -- regardless of who that government is -- and to see if it can tackle it effectively, because there are several South Africans who are smuggling weapons to South Africa. [Du Preez] From Angola to South Africa? [Luitingh] From Angola -- from UNITA -- to South Africa. The weapons are being smuggled for Inkatha, for right-wing elements. The company involved is Trans-Namib Trading, being run by Mr. Ben van Heerden, and I believe after this program we can see if there is someone serious enough to stop that. [Du Preez] It's a very dangerous allegation that you are making. Have you approached the person concerned about this? Is there anything else you have done regarding this information, because arms smuggling to South Africa is one of our biggest problems. [Luitingh] I have evidence -- I will testify that he has done it. [Du Preez] Will you be prepared to testify before the Goldstone Commission? [Luitingh] To tell you the truth, last year I approached the Goldstone Commission and told them that they were very welcome to look at any information I had. They were welcome to subject us to investigations. They were welcome to investigate our planes, our people. It is our company's policy not to allow any criminal acts, and I have no problem with an investigation. [Du Preez] How big is your force? [Luitingh] Again I cannot tell you that, but the media says in the region of 500 people. [Du Preez] And that estimate is not very far off? [Luitingh] They are close. [Du Preez] Now these people -- as we have already said -- are made up of former members of Koevoet, 32 Battalion, and reconnaissance commandos. We ordinary South Africans know those people as being hard soldiers and tenacious fighters. What is to become of them? What is their future -- and that of those who are still in the force -- in the new South Africa? [Luitingh] Many of those people were lucky to get retirement packages from the Police and the Defense Force. Unfortunately such packages do not last a lifetime, and these people have to look for work. The problem is that these people are not trained for any other job, and that is a pity for the government not to have taken the initiative to train these people in other directions. MK members also receive packages, but they are also being sent to the streets. Thy are also not being trained, and I think there is going to be a real problem in South Africa if those people do not get jobs. Unfortunately these people are susceptible to criminal acts and are open to all radical elements. [Du Preez] So you are saying that an unemployed, trained soldier spells trouble? [Luitingh] I wouldn't say all of them, but I am saying that they are indeed susceptible to radical groups. [Du Preez] How do your people there in Angola feel about South Africa's future and the coming election? What are they going to do when they return? [Luitingh] Most of them -- at least those that I spoke to -- are very positive about the new South Africa. We feel that if the people can steer away from a civil war, then we can attain many things in South Africa. I believe that within the new South Africa a place can be made for these former soldiers, and if there is place for them, I am convinced we can flourish, especially in community projects. [Du Preez] Tell me in conclusion, what are you and your men going to when your mission in Angola has been completed? Where are you going to? Look for another war? [Luitingh] I hope our time in Angola will not end; we are looking at the total development of Angola after the civil war. Perhaps we can bring about economic progress there, not only for Angola but also for South Africa, which would create many job opportunities. South Africa and Angola could play a significant role in the development of the subcontinent.
