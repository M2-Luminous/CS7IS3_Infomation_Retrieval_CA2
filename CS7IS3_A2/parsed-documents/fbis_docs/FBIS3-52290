The Consultative Council, under the chairmanship of Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, today met to discuss the report by the committee formed to respond to the president's statement. Dr. al-Janzuri spoke to the Consultative Council in today's session. He said that the government was not surprised by these challenges and has known where it was heading ever since it set the 20-year plan and reached the stage of economic and financial reform control, and embarked on trying to confront all the challenges mentioned by the president in his statement. Dr. al-Janzuri clarified that by introducing production we will manage to confront the problems of unemployment, slum areas, and bureaucracy. He noted that without culture and education, we cannot begin to confront these challenges. He pointed out that in the 1993/1994 plan, an investment of 1.6 billion Egyptian pounds will be allocated to education, because we cannot launch any reform projects without good education. Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri affirmed that security and stability cannot be realized while slum areas continue to exist in 11 governorates, specifically in 434 locations. He noted that the initial estimates for improving these areas amount to around 4 billion pounds. He said that some projects for the infrastructure have been set for southern Egypt, most important of which is the dual railway line to Aswan. He said that the infrastructure projects have a social dimension too. He said that the 1994/95 plan will include a new vision of production performance to avert the dangers coming from the GATT agreement. He noted that Egypt imports foodstuffs amounting to $3 billion a year and that after removing subsidies and without the duty on food exports, this number will double. He added that 1.6 million feddans of land cannot be allocated for fruits and vegetables at a time when half this land can be allocated for planting oil seeds or sugar products. He noted that Egypt imports edible oils amounting to around $0.5 billion in addition to $700 million for the importation of sugar from abroad. Dr. al-Janzuri noted the regional challenges involved in the Middle-Eastern market, saying that the achievement we aspire to must pass through an inter-Arab dialogue before initiating an Arab-Israeli one. The deputy prime minister noted that inter-Arab trade does not exceed five percent, while Arab trade with the West is 95 percent. He noted also that Arab investments in Arab territories do not go beyond five percent, while they reach 85 percent in non-Arab territories. He pointed out that facing up to these challenges requires Arab cohesion. The Arab common market started simultaneously with the EC, but we Arabs did not achieve what we hoped to achieve, he said. Dr. al-Janzuri added that the Egyptian people will witness a breakthrough in production, less reliance on imports, and more employment of their labor force in the upcoming three years of [words indistinct]. This will further consolidate security and stability, he said.
