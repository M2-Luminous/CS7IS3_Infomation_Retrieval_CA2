But No Money Left"] [Text] Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the Independent Trade Union of Servicemen Central Committee, and Sergey Obrezanov, vice president of the State Security Veterans Club, held a press conference yesterday. "The social tension in military units and aboard naval vessels is increasing all the time," Mikhail Kolchev said. "The Northern Fleet command, for instance, have not received their pay for three months. Around 140,000 officers have been forced to rent corners of other people's apartments. "The president and the government," the Independent Trade Union of Servicemen leader noted, "have issued dozens of edicts and decrees aimed at ensuring social protection for servicemen. But these documents are not working. Local authorities are impeding in every possible way the implementation of the state program to build housing for officers discharged to the reserve." Last year sufficient funds were allocated for these purposes. But the regions have only received half of the money. As a result, not a single [square] meter of housing has been commissioned in Murmansk. The housing program has been just 3 percent fulfilled. The suits filed by the trade union with judicial organs alleging a failure to use state funds properly have not led to anything. Russian justice could find no legal grounds for initiating proceedings against those responsible.
