In an interview published Monday 14 February by LES ECHOS, Phillippe Rouvillois, administrator general of the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission] and head of CEA Industrie--which as owner of a 36 percent interest in Framatome is the the nuclear boiler maker's biggest public-sector shareholder--described in broad outline the purpose of negotiations now under way with Alcatel Alsthom. In accordance with the wishes expressed by the state (LE MONDE of 23-24 January), "it is envisaged that public-sector participation will be reduced to that of a blocking minority," or 34 percent of the stock, Mr. Rouvillois confirmed. EDF [French Power Company] will keep its current 10 percent share, he said. On the other hand, according to Mr. Rouvillois, CEA-I is expected to transfer "a little more than 10 percent of Framatome's stock," reducing its own interest to less than 25 percent, while Credit Lyonnais surrenders its 5 percent holding. The state, which now controls Framatome indirectly with its 51 percent share, will give up 17 percent and offer it to Alcatel-Alsthom, Mr. Rouvillois said. In the past, Alcatel-Alsthom, owner of a 44 percent interest in Framatome, had been keen to acquire the additional 7 percent of stock needed to constitute a 51 percent controlling interest. Could it be that Mr. Suard's group is being backed into a corner?
