According to the Inter/View company, the Christian Democrats would get 34 seats if parliamentary elections were to be held now. The CDA now has 54 seats and would therefore lose 20 seats. The PvdA [Labor Party] would lose a few less seats. The Social Democrats would drop from 49 to 30 seats, a loss of 19. This means that for the first time the CDA's losses would be bigger than those of the PvdA. Last week the CDA experienced a slight recovery; the party climbed in the opinion polls from 35 to 36 seats. The CDA reacted "with disappointment" to the opinion poll, because the party has partly modified its much-criticized pension plans. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] would become the second biggest party with 31 seats. At present the liberals have 22 seats. In previous opinion polls the VVD had 28 seats. The increase was seen in particular as an effect of the comments by VVD leader Bolkestein that the flow of asylum-seekers should be limited. The VVD seems to be the main winner from the CDA's decline. D66 [Democrats 66] dropped in the poll from 30 to 27 seats. At present the Democrats have 12 seats. A week ago Van Mierlo's party was still the second biggest party, but with 27 seats it would once again be fourth biggest. The party has lost three seats in less than a week. The fall is explained by the low profile of the Democrats when it comes to serious discussions. The small Christian parties, SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union] and RPF [Reformational political Federation], together would have eight seats: the GPV can count on two seats, and the RPF and SGP can count on three each. Janmaat's Center-Democrats remain at around six seats, a gain of five seats. The Socialist Party, which did strikingly well during the local elections, could still enter Parliament with three seats.
