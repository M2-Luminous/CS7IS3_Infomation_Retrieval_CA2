Reorganization among army-level generals is still going on now. Involving seven military regions, the Navy, the Air Force, and academies under the Central Military Commission, the current reorganization covers the widest scope and the largest number of high-ranking military officers in the past decade. The theoretical basis for the current major changes is to make the ranks of military cadres younger in average age and more professional competent. Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping Office), first deputy director of the General Political Department, have taken charge of the operation at Deng Xiaoping's suggestion. As envisaged by the current military leaders, with all leaders of the Central Military Commission having been or soon to be overage, the leading bodies of the new military commission and three general departments will be composed of principal officers of the Navy, the Air Force, and the military regions in 1996, with generals newly promoted to the deputy posts in military regions and principal officers of group armies serving as principal officers of the military regions and armed services. Moreover, a number of younger division-level military officers will be selected in preparation for the gradual takeover. This is precisely the "echelon takeover" arrangement which Deng Xiaoping earlier assigned to Zhang Zhen, who is responsible for personnel matters in the military, and it is being officially implemented.
