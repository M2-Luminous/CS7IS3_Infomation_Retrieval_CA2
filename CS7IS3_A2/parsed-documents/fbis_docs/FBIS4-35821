FBIS4-35821 "drnes108dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs DFLP's Rejection of Self-Rule Deal Reported DFLP's Rejection of Self-Rule Deal Reported JN0506140694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1115 GMT 5 Jun 94 JN0506140694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said the fall of some 40 Palestinians injured in Hebron by Israeli occupation troops' gunfire within view of foreign observers confirms once again that the foreign presence in its current form does not provide effective international protection of the Palestinian people. In a statement issued today, the DFLP says the implementation of Resolution 904 was just a deal between the Oslo team and Israel to expedite the implementation of the self-rule administration in Gaza and Jericho, at the expense of the Palestinian people, their interests, and their national rights. The DFLP urges the international community and peace-loving forces to work seriously to provide effective international protection of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories as a first step on the path to implementing the resolutions of international legitimacy. DFLP Secretary General Nayif Hawatimah reiterated his rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the applications agreement in Cairo. He considered it a deal of individual submission that will only lead to more frivolous play and self-deception. In statements, Hawatimah said these separate deals were struck behind the back of the Palestinian people and against their national will. He said preparations are under way now to hold a broad-based popular conference that will reaffirm rejection of what is going on and seek to establish the national terms of reference. He said the agreement will not fall by a magic blow, but will need struggle and ceaseless work within the ranks of the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied homeland. He called for improving the alliance of the Palestinian forces, as well as all other forces that reject the agreement. Hawatimah also reaffirmed the DFLP's refusal to participate in any way in the self-rule authority because the question, he said, has never been that of quotas, but a national issue in the first place.
