First of all Guntis Ulmanis once more emphasized the prerogatives of his action as state president: [Ulmanis] "This evening I will speak about our country's foreign policy. A person thinks little about it every day, and still less tries to associate himself directly with the settlement of foreign policy issues. Right after being elected to the post of president, I said that the priorities of my work in foreign policy are linked with Baltic unity and relations with Russia, although even at that time, half a year ago, I understood that they would not be easy priorities, especially where Russia is concerned. Yet today we have come to confront problems from which we cannot retreat, but forward movement demands certain sacrifices." [Announcer] Continuing his address, the president stated his attitude to the agreements initialled on 15 March by Russia and Latvia. [Ulmanis] "I would like to express my stance on the issues all the more because, as our philosopher Vilnis Zarins said in his letter to me, when a decision is taken, one must stick to it strictly and unflichingly, knowing that one will be cursed anyway. At this moment I defend the creation of active and energetic relations with Russia. I mean here to their full extent, in both political and economic relations, because obviously, as a result of a passive foreign policy, we will be the losers, just as this would also create economic impoverishment for our nation. In relations between countries, especially if their border is long and their forces unequal, the only way is to draw closer, to understand, to be farsighted, to seek compromise, at length, patiently, both gaining and losing." [Announcer] Speaking about the possible meeting of the two countries' leaders, which may take place on 21 April, Guntis Ulmanis said: [Ulmanis] "I call on the Russian president to seek ways to make it possible for the Latvian and Russian presidents to meet. This morning I invited Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Russia to Latvia, for a conversation, and I put to him a proposal to meet the Russian president. I also received the same kind of proposal from Yeltsin's side. Perhaps a coincidence? I think not. It is necessary to openly state one's views, about the possible signing or non-signing of the initialled agreements; to achieve clarity about the announced creation of a military base in Latvia, at Skrunda; and to try to draw a line over the heavy injustices of history relating to the occupation of independent Latvia in 1940 and communist genocide in 1941 and later years. I will call on President Yeltsin to seek opportunities to settle our mutual relations as equal sovereign neighbors, and to cease putting forward pretexts for not talking to us, or for talking on from positions of power." [Announcer] The president also expressed his prognosis on how the possible meeting of the two presidents will go. [Ulmanis] "I will speak in favor of signing three agreements, at the same time creating a group of experts to specify the basis of the fourth agreement, on the social guarantees for the remaining military personnel and their families. In the form that this agreement currently takes, in my opinion it is not acceptable to the majority of the people, not acceptable to me personally either. In my opinion Latvia and Russia must continue to seek the way of mutual understanding, so as to achieve at government level agreement on the future destiny of retired military personnel, in the next 10 days." [Announcer] Concluding his speech, the Latvian president once more commented on his recent visit to three western European countries in the context of the initialled interstate agreements: [Ulmanis] "I will not be able to understand my people if I do not regularly meet people in towns and in the country in Latvia. But in turn the world will not recognise Latvia, its people, if we do not talk about it in other countries, if we are unable to show Europe the force of the spirit of the Latvian people, its love of work, and its enterprise. Within the Latvian constitution, this is first the president's duty, and I will fulfill it too. "The important issues we spoke about with politicians in three foreign countries: The guarantees that Europe can give Latvia, and to what extent Latvia for its part is able to fulfil the demands put by Europe; the creation of a repatriation fund, to promote the departure of retired military personnel from Latvia; the status of the Skrunda radar station, and the negative effects of its operation on people and nature in Kurzeme; and the last thing we talked about: What are really the opportunities for the Latvian people and prospects for strengthening Latvian statehood. "On all these issues, in my opinion, a certain understanding was reached. Security is to the greatest extent dependent on how we strengthen the unity of the three Baltic countries and create relations with Russia. By signing agreements with Russia, an opportunity will open up to put Latvian-Russian relations in order, in the first place making them subject to international controls. I am fully aware of my responsibility for what happens to the Latvian nation tomorrow. I said that when meeting in Europe, seeking the support and understanding of Denmark, France, and Britain. And everywhere I received an unequivocal response: Europe will not abandon the Baltic lands any more. 1939 must not be repeated." [Announcer] As Latvian radio has already reported, on Tuesday when the president met with leaders of factions in the Saeima, Guntis Ulamnis received support for talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. However, a final decision on the status of this meeting -- whether it will only be talks or whether there will be a signing of agreement -- will be taken by deputies at the extraordinary plenary sitting of the Saeima on Wednesday.
