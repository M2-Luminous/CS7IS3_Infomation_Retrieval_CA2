What are your conditions? [Vyachirev] Our talks were concluded with the signing of a protocol that affirms the two sides' interest in advantageous bilateral cooperation. [passage omitted] The Russian Federation is interested in increasing natural gas deliveries to the countries of Western Europe via the Slovak Republic's transit gas pipeline system. Your side, on the other hand, is asking for more gas from Russia. We have agreed that experts of both countries meet in Bratislava or Moscow by the end of the first quarter of this year to specify the amount by which [Slovak] natural gas imports will be increased. According to preliminary agreements, the increase should be in the range of 4-5 billion cubic meters, which is approximately twice the amount the Slovak Republic has been importing thus far. [Duduc] Have you also come to an agreement on prices? [Vyachirev] No, we did not discuss prices. Even if we did, I would not reply to your question because it is a commercial secret. I would not tell anyone. [Duduc] Did you also discuss the modernization of existing gas pipelines or the construction of new ones? [Vyachirev] We have agreed on a fraternal division of labor. Everyone will do his job on his own territory--Russia on Russian territory and Slovakia on Slovak territory.
