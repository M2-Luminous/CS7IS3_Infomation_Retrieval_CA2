Like it or not, the country will remain on the list of `terrorist nations' included in the UN Secretary General's report to the 49th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) later this year unless the Thai Ministry of Defence, responsible for national arms procurement, adopts a new attitude towards military transparency. Indonesia, possessor of Asean's largest military arsenal, has submitted its military data to the UN registry. Last year Thailand and Indonesia were listed along with Syria, Saudi Arabia and Jordan as arm buyers failing to respond to UNGA resolution 46/36 L, which calls for all members to give new arms data to the UN. The resulting situation is especially absurd in light of the fact that Thailand is supposedly at the forefront of regional and international efforts to implement the UN's Agenda for Peace, which calls for the building of trust and confidence across the region in order to prevent or minimize conflict. The military is adhering to the old myth that the details of arms procurement is a national secret. It continues to bury its head in the sand, ensuring the worsening of an already blemished international image, particularly damaged by the army's alleged support of the Khmer Rouge. The UN Register of Conventional Arms is a simple but effective step towards building trust among the nations of the world, calling upon member countries to voluntarily provide data on the importing and exporting of seven types of offensive weapons, as well as general background information on national procurement and holdings policy. In 1991, Thailand was one of 150 UN member nations to vote in support of UNGA resolution 46/36 L on transparency in armaments, which resulted in further resolutions to set up the register over the next two years. The resolutions were approved by 150 members with no objections. Iraq and Cuba abstained. Last year 80 countries, including Asean members Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei, submitted their arms data for UN registration. But there is little point in having the Asean Regional Forum discuss the noble goal of trust-building in accordance with the UN agenda for peace when a host country like Thailand fails to contribute to even this very basic and essentially harmless attempt at boosting trust. Military spending in Southeast Asia is generally considered extraordinarily large for peace time, which makes the exchange of arms purchase information especially important to the nations of this region. As acting regional leader, the country must show its sincerity in this respect instead of playing for time with the excuse that neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma have not done so. These countries will be attending the Asean meeting in Bangkok in July. Despite being the host country, Thailand will have absolutely no authority to initiate discussions of military transparency, which will be a crucial topic at the meeting. Thailand is no longer justified in claiming regional instability as an excuse for delaying arms data. With Indonesia's disclosure, all other Asean nations have fulfilled their commitment to the UN. In the age of proliferation, countries the world over face an equal threat. At any rate, despite the army's confidence, the size of Thailand's military arsenal, or that of any Asean nation, is no secret. International arms dealers have been more than willing to publish sales figures as it promotes their products. In the UN's 1992 report on arms procurement, circulated at the General Assembly's 48th session last year, it was revealed that Thailand had bought arms from Australia, China and United States without registering this with the international organization. The UNGA resolution, unlike Security Council resolutions, is nonbinding, and is aimed in part at testing the cooperativeness of UN members. While the resolution's April 30 deadline has passed, the UN's annual report on arms procurement does not come out until August, and there is a provision for late filers in the report's appendix. Better for Thailand to be a latecomer than the black sheep of the world community.
