Our Bratislava correspondent Ildiko Nagy outlines the document. [Nagy] With respect to the activity of the governing party's petition committee, which was formed at the weekend, aimed at collecting 350,000 signatures to demand a referendum, today the Hungarian Civic Party published an appeal. It calls on Slovakia's citizens, especially the Hungarian electors, not to join the call for a referendum, which [Prime Minister] Meciar has been urging. It also calls on the leaders of the Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement to start talks without delay in preparation for a Hungarian three-party coalition, with regard to the situation that has evolved and the possibility of early elections. The need for this coalition is also proved by what [Coexistence leader] Miklos Duray said at today's news briefing of the Coexistence, namely that prior to last week's parliament session the Slovak opposition had not held talks with the Hungarian parliamentary coalition on cooperation.
