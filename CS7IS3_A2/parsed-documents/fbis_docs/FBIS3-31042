This was stated at a news conference in Prague today by Zoran Thaler, the chairman of the Slovenian Parliament's Foreign Committee, who is heading a delegation of this committee on a two-day visit to the Czech Republic. Too much has been achieved in Bosnia by military means so now it will be difficult to approach the solution merely in a political way, he stressed.
