Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, along with relatives, friends and comrades-in-arms, headed the procession, and funeral. Alfonso Guillen Zelaya's rich past was recalled today by his comrade, Gabriel Gil Alfonso. Guillen Zelaya was the youngest member of the Granma expedition. He was arrested after his active participation in the Alegria de Pio affair. To the prosecutor who tried him, Guillen said: One need not be Cuban to fight for liberty, for all men of justice fight for liberty wherever it may be offended. Because of his firmness, in 1957 he was deported to Mexico where, directed by the 26 July movement, which was in exile, he carried out important missions. With the triumph of the Revolution, Guillen returned to Cuba, where he held different administrative positions. He was vice president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples for 10 years. As an education ministry official, he attended the Latin American and Caribbean Congress of Teachers in Mexico, where he was surprised by death at the age of 57. Guillen received numerous decorations and distinctions, among them the award for being one of the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba.
