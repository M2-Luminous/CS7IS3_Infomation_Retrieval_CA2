The purpose of the establishment of the "International Economic Cooperation Fund" (called the "Fund" hereafter), sanctioned by the central government, is as follows: To support the development of China's cooperation with foreign countries in the fields of economics and technology and to provide part of the working funds (Chinese or foreign currency) for the International Economic Cooperation and Technological Company (called the "Company" hereafter) and relevant units that contract projects abroad, operate wholly-owned enterprises or joint ventures, or work in coordination with bilateral or multilateral technical aid projects given gratis to China. Article 2. The main resource of the Fund is the sum returned to China from countries that received loans from China during the period from 1984 to 1988. Article 3. The Fund is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT]. The actual work is conducted by the Bank of China (foreign currency) and the Bank of Construction (renminbi). Financial administration is guided and supervised by the Ministry of Finance and the banks concerned. Chapter 2 Loan Procedures Article 4. All companies and other relevant units, which are sanctioned by the State Council or MOFERT, are entitled to loans from the Fund for contracted projects abroad, wholly-owned enterprises or joint ventures, and bilateral or multilateral technical aid projects given to China. The conditions for receiving loans are as follows: 1. The contracted projects abroad, the wholly-owned enterprises, and the joint ventures should have sound economic returns; 2. The borrowing unit should have the capacity to repayment and should be able to guarantee repayment of loans and payment of service charges on schedule; 3. The borrowing unit should be able to provide a letter of guarantee from the financial department of the ministry or state commission in charge, or from the planning commission or financial department of a province, autonomous region, or municipality; 4. The borrowing unit may apply for the loan only after it has fully utilized its own funds and bank loans and its financial means are still insufficient. Projects encouraged by the state are given priority for loans. Article 5. The principles for use of a loan are: The borrowing and repaying units must be the same entity and must pay back both the loan and all charges. The interim annual interest rate for renminbi is 3.0 percent, and for foreign currency 4.0 percent, both of which include a 0.2 percent bank service charge. If the loan is in foreign currency, the service fee is calculated according to provisions of the Bank of China, and collected once every six months. If the loan is in renminbi, the service fee is calculated according to regulations of the Bank of Construction. Article 6. In case a borrowing unit is unable to repay a loan in time, it generally must apply for postponement of the payment to MOFERT and the bank concerned. If the reason is justified, the postponement will be approved. If the reason is not regarded as justified, the postponement will be denied and the service charge will be raised by 50 to 100 percent of the original charge rate after it becomes overdue. If necessary, the bank can act upon the agreement by directly deducting the sum from the borrowing unit's bank account. Or MOFERT can order the guaranteeing unit to pay back both the loan and charges. Article 7. The borrowing unit must abide by the principle that the loan must be used for the approved purpose; it should not be used for any other purpose. Otherwise, the loan will be taken back within a limited period of time, and the service charge will be doubled. If necessary, the borrowing unit will be deprived of the right to future loans. Chapter 3 Loan Procedures Article 8. In applying for a loan from MOFERT, a borrowing unit must first submit a written application (see the form attached to these Provisions) and a letter of guarantee from the guaranteeing unit. Duplicate copies of the application and the letter should be sent to the bank concerned. In the application, the reason for the loan, its purpose, amount, time limit, and repayment schedule should be stated. Then it should be signed and sealed before submission. The guaranteeing unit should state in its letter of guarantee that it shall be responsible for repayment in case the borrowing unit fails to clear the debt. If the loan is used for a joint project abroad, a certificate of approval issued by the State Council or MOFERT should be submitted. In case of a labor service or contracted project abroad, a duplicate copy of the contract signed with a foreign company should be produced. Article 9. Upon receiving the written application and guaranteeing unit's letter, MOFERT must immediately examine them (if necessary, the Ministry can examine them together with the Ministry of Finance and a bank, or entrust the bank to do the examination) and determine the amount of the loan. Once the application is examined and the amount fixed, the Ministry should notify the applicant to go to the bank to go through the necessary paperwork. Article 10. Before the loan is approved, the bank and the borrowing unit should sign a contract in duplicate--one for the bank, the other for the borrowing unit. Copies of the contract should also be sent to MOFERT, the Ministry of Finance, and departments concerned. Article 11. MOFERT, the Ministry of Finance, and the bank have the right to supervise and examine the use of the loan, for which the borrowing unit should provide the necessary information and materials. Chapter 4 Supplementary Provisions Article 12. MOFERT should draw up an annual plan covering the revenue and expenditures of the Fund and final accounts, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance. Operational expenses for necessary activities, such as investigation, research, and printing of certificates, conducted by MOFERT should be covered by the service fees. Article 13. These interim provisions shall go into effect on January 1, 1985. MOFERT Ministry of Finance October 24, 1984
