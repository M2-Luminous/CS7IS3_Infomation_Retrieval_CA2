A survey taken at Sessvollmoen six months ago showed that as many as four percent of the soldiers were healthy carriers of the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia. This does not affect their ability to fight, but they could infect others, and there is a danger of complications later. This is why the military is trying to find an inexpensive and painless test that can identify those who are infected with the disease. Chlamydia is simple to treat. "Those being inducted into the military are men who only seldom visit a doctor. For them the military offers excellent health service. In view of the results of the survey at Sessvollmoen, we feel that the soldiers should be examined for chlamydia. Such an examination could be included in the overall health care program for the soldiers. We expect the test to be included in an ordinary urinalysis. It is probably not necessary to use a painful test involving the urethra. At present various tests are being examined both as to practicality and price," explains Bjorn Petter Bardal, a doctor at the Military Laboratory of Microbiology. The military paper FORUM discusses the chlamydia problem in its March issue. Captain Reidar Mundal of the Military Medical Service informs us that tests done on recruits indicate that one out of 25 might have chlamydia without being aware of it. If the disease is not treated, they might infect others and they might also become sterile. "During the last few years the number of cases of sexually transmitted disease in Norway has gone down considerably. There is no reason to believe that there has been a different development among the soldiers, who represent the average of the male population of their age group. Gonorrhea and syphilis have been practically eradicated in Norway, while chlamydia and herpes are still a problem," Mundal says to the Military's FORUM.
