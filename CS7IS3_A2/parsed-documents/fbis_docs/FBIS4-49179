The new relationship established between Russia and China was defined as a "constructive partnership relationship." This meant that stress was laid on bilateral exchanges and regional cooperation. Director General Solovyev held that two major factors threatened peace in Asia-Pacific at present, the first being the Korean Peninsula and the second the South China Sea. He thus indirectly rejected the possibility of a conflict between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the new future. Solovyev also said that he thought "alliance" relationships between countries did not tally with the norms of international relations today, because "alliances" eventually led to unilateral dependence between countries. [as published] On the question of Sino-Russian military cooperation, Russia has international commitments and would never carry out secret weapons deals with China. Regarding the export of Su-27 fighter planes, the mainland has decided to buy a second batch of 26 Su-27's. According to sources in the Russian Ministry of National Defense, talks on the export of 26 Su-27K's have basically been concluded, and the planes will be delivered in batches beginning this year. Compared with the 26 Su-27UB's, which the mainland has already obtained, the Su-27K can be used by both the Air Force and the Navy and are equipped with the AL35F turbojet and a digital autopilot control system, its fire control radar is of the same grade as the Su-35, which has an effective range of 400 km, and they can attack 15 targets simultaneously.
