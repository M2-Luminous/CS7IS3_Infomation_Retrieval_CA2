The airlift between Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate Westerners -- among them the 200 or 300 French nationals still living in the Yemeni capital -- is continuing. [Begin recording] [Gandouli] Operation Diapason 2 was launched today. Its aim is to evacuate those nationals based in Sanaa wishing to leave Sanaa. We set up an airlift between Djibouti and Sanaa to evacuate these nationals. We have two Transall [Air Force cargo planes] currently shuttling between Djibouti and Sanaa. Two Italian aircraft should join them tomorrow to reinforce this airlift. [Correspondent Isabelle Dorre] Are there many French nationals wishing to leave Sanaa? [Gandouli] I believe between 200 and 250 have asked to leave. [Dorre] Will they stay in Djibouti or will they return to France? [Gandouli] As far as I know they will return to France. Some 80 percent of all the nationals we welcomed yesterday left for France on an Air France flight or for other destinations on Lufthansa, Aeroflot, or Italian aircraft. If more European Union nationals or other nationals were to ask to be evacuated to Djibouti, we would naturally evacuate them within the limits of our capacities. There are not only French aircraft, but also two German planes flying back and forth between Djibouti and Sanaa. [Dorre] You have met people who came back from Sanaa. What did they say about the situation on the ground? [Gandouli] The situation was tense at one point, but the situation in Sanaa itself is not dangerous now. [Dorre] Are there other evacuation operations under way? [Gandouli] The evacuation operation is called Diapason. There is a Diapason 1 operation under way, it is mainly using naval means, including helicopters, to evacuate nationals from Yemen's southern coast. The Diapason 2 operation is mainly a Djibouti-Sanaa airlift to evacuate nationals from Sanaa. [end recording]
