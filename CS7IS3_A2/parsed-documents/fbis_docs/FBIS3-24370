Kaliningrad old-timer. Cruised the Baltic and the Atlantic as a navigator and later captain of large ships, was chairman of a fishing kolkhoz. After receiving his doctorate became president of one of Kaliningrad's institutes. Appointed chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration in August 1991. Says that he will not leave his position until he creates a normative and legal basis for the development of the Yantar [Amber] Free Economic Zone. [Govorushko] Yuriy Semyonovich, is it easy for the oblast to be a Russian enclave? [Matochkin] A component of the Russian Federation. But unfortunately, not everyone in the government understands what it means to live two countries away from Moscow. The problems that arise during transit through Lithuania are known and, on the whole, understood. But suddenly we learned that, the same as last year, our own Ministry of Railways introduced international freight rates for us... And we had thought, naively, that the question had been settled once and for all. In general, we can only hope that it will be recognized at all governmental levels: there is a foreign territory of the Russian Federation. Any document signed with the Baltic states, Belarus or other of the oblast's neighbors--even for intra-Russian use--must take our geopolitical situation and interests into account. But sometimes Russia forgets about us. [Govorushko] So it seems that most of the problems for the oblast are created not by Lithuania or other adjoining states, but by the Russian government itself? [Matochkin] No, I wouldn't say that. Lithuania creates problems, but it would be easier to resolve them if Russia helped actively. Because Lithuania, as a sovereign state, quite justifiably is interested in negotiating at the national level, regarding dialog with us as merely preparing the ground. [Govorushko] Why not give the oblast greater authority in negotiating with its neighbors? [Matochkin] We count on this happening after passage of the law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast, which the Russian Duma is to consider soon. But there had never been any enclaves in Russian history, so we can only guess what the deputies will think of the bill. A new statute for the oblast is only a first step. In future I do not preclude formation of a Baltic Russian Republic, in the framework of a single state. I think the administration chief or governor--the name doesn't matter--should be appointed by the president so as to stress that the region is inseparable from Russia. The president's vicegerent should be authorized to negotiate with neighboring countries on all the territory's problems. Incidentally, the government has given me such authority with regard to the northeastern provinces of Poland. We would like to use the future status law to become, for example, an associate member of the community of Baltic and northern states, representing Russian interests there. This process has already begun in some measure. I came to this conclusion after a meeting of officials of the Baltic region in Helsinki, in which I took part as a member of the Russian delegation. But so far our relations with Poland are developing more dynamically. Yet we would gladly accede to an understanding on, say, a non-visa regime for inhabitants of the three Baltic states. Besides, restoration of a new type of Hanseatic Union would be impossible without Kaliningrad Oblast, its ports and transit routes as a connecting link between East and West. [Govorushko] What is the socio-economic situation in the oblast? Did it gain anything from the free economic zone status? [Matochkin] Actually, benefits for the free economic zone began to accrue only since the first quarter of last year. At the same time, due to high transportation costs per unit of output produced in the oblast, it is not competitive. That is why the rate of decline of production in industry and agriculture is higher than the average for Russia. At the same time, customs benefits for the free economic zone stimulated external economic ties and led to increased investment in construction, which is higher here than the all-Russia average. Trade and commodity reserves have increase substantially. The rate of price increases is lower than in the country: at present Kaliningrad is among the cities where goods and services are cheaper. The difference between the living minimum and average income has changed for the better. Small and medium businesses and tourism are developing actively, and many small private enterprises are being set up. The oblast now holds third place in Russia for foreign investment, after Moscow and St. Petersburg. This year, however, began with difficulty, as in the entire country. It can't be helped: we get 90 percent of our supplementaries from the Russian Federation. The oblast remains subsidized, and will continue to be for a long time. We depend in many ways on the federal budget, which owes us 18 billion rubles for last year, while in the first quarter we didn't get a kopeck of 14 billion. What saves us, once again, is the free zone regime and the additional regional quota for exports of our own oil. This has helped build up small hard-currency reserves, on which we live, and we also invest in development of the infrastructure. [Govorushko] The forced militarization of the oblast, as far as I know, not only complicates relations with Baltic countries but is also, probably, a deadweight on the economy? [Matochkin] Our relations with Lithuania and Poland are not affected by this, though inter-governmental relations certainly are. But the population of the oblast supports the army and feels safer in its presence. From the economic, social and ecological aspects the armed forces are indeed a heavy burden on the oblast, something which ranking bureaucrats also sometimes fail to understand. In addition, relations between the army and local governments are another blank spot in our legislation. I can say that cuts in the armed forces of the region are already taking place, but the strategic interests of the state will not suffer. [Govorushko] Does the name of the erstwhile all-union headman trouble the oblast? [Matochkin] Of course. We don't know how to get rid of it yet, or how to call this now Russian city. Besides, we have many more important problems: energy resources, food, transportation, in short, at present there is no time for renamings and removing communist monuments. On the other hand, we are seriously considering reconstructing the historical image of the oblast center and other cities and towns. For this we are planning to build plants based on Italian technology in the near future to manufacture high-quality bricks and durable roof tile. [Govorushko] I can't help asking about the "secrets and mysteries" of Kaliningrad Oblast: flooded German plants, attempts to locate the Amber Room... [Matochkin] No one has either confirmed or refuted the legends about flooded aircraft plants in the Mamonovo area, because so far it has been impossible to discover where the flooded area connects with the bay. The mistake was that no serious investigation of the territory in connection with secrets of the Reich was ever undertaken and things were left to drift. Now interest in all this has subsided. Interest in the Amber Room is periodically rekindled, in particular in 1991, when a major operation was undertaken with the participation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Not long ago the Germans, together with the Japanese, proposed undertaking a search with the help of state-of-the-art equipment, but so far we have not yet defined the legal basis of such a search or the fate of future finds.
