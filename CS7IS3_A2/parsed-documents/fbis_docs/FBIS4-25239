However, viewed from the macroeconomic situation at present, we still cannot increase the overall money supply but should maintain the present strength of macroeconomic regulation and control. During a special interview with a MING PAO reporter, the authoritative person pointed out: Recently, inflation in China has the growth of the average national retail commodity price index, which reflects inflation, remains at about 20 percent and the momentum of sustained growth has been curbed. Inflation is expected to gradually fall in the second half of this year. However, he pointed out that although the momentum of growth in inflation has been curbed, the trend is not yet completely clear. To promote falling inflation, three conditions are required: first, a continued increase in agricultural output this year or at least for output not to decrease; second, a stable political situation; third, macroeconomic policies remain stable. The personality said that, on the whole, the goal of macroregulation and control this year should still be set at the original credit scale of 470 billion yuan and the total volume of credit should be controlled within 500 billion. Therefore, the existing strength of regulation and control should not be reduced in an overall manner and only partial readjustments with clear targets should be made. It has been disclosed that because of relatively tight money supply, state enterprises are having universal difficulties in their operations. To ease the difficulties of state enterprises in terms of the shortage of funds, China granted 60 billion yuan of bank loans to state enterprises from March to April this year. Recently, some localities have again asked for loans to a large number of state enterprises which are on the brink of closing down. The authoritative personality pointed out: The loans granted to enterprises in March and April were only a partial structural readjustment and did not mean an increase in the money supply on the whole. If loans for state enterprises are increased in an overall manner irrespective of economic results, this will mean a major readjustment of financial policy. Judging from present conditions, a policy readjustment of this kind is not likely. Another noted economist pointed out: The macroeconomic situation in China at present still depends on investment in fixed assets. Last year, China invested as much as 1,000 billion yuan in fixed assets, nearly 400 billion yuan more than the previous year. This caused the rapid growth of inflation in China. He pointed out: Investment in fixed assets should have a certain balance, that is, on the one hand, it should not cause excessive inflation, and, on the other, it should be able to maintain economic growth.
