Alisanoglou: "Drilling in Oil Deposit Larger Than Prinos"] [Text] The NAPC [expansion unknown] Consortium decided suddenly to start two new drilling operations beginning yesterday in an oil deposit it regarded until now as "uneconomic." The deposit is located west of Thasos Island and according to data the NAPC has (exclusively) the new deposit is larger than that of Prinos. The decision of the foreign Consortium was reached in Toronto, Canada, in the presence of all the big stockholders and confirms TA NEA information, which claimed in 1979-1980 that "NAPC has found oil west of Prinos but closed the well for unexplainable reasons." The justification offered at the time by NAPC that presumably the deposit west of Thasos was small and that the return on drilling was to be marginal, was not valid. This is borne out now, because the NAPC managers would have never spent $15,000 to $20,000 -- if not more -- to conduct exploratory-productive drilling operations in a "small" deposit. They knew in advance the potential and the daily yield of the new oil deposit and they were waiting for the proper time to revise their contract while the New Democracy was in office to open the "well" of western Thasos with its assured oil deposits which for them constituted a safe "reservoir." The Ministry The Ministry of Industry said this in an official statement: "After a long period of inactivity during the previous government, the drilling in `northern Prinos' is now under way in the second section of the Prinos oil exploration region. The Public Petroleum Corporation and Hydro-Carbonate Exploitation [DEP-EKY] is a participant in this region with a 15-percent share in the consortium which will undertake the drilling according to the revised contract of 9 December 1987 which was ratified by Law 1769/1988. "The significance of this drilling is that the potential discovery of an oil deposit will extend the life of the existing deposit in Prinos while it will require a minimum investment since the exploitation will utilize the existing installations of Prinos." The Contract DEP-EKY data indicate that the objective of the drilling is "to find out any serious indication for an oil deposit." Nevertheless, trade union circles note among other things that, with the drilling taking place without previously setting in motion the process for the vision of the law that was enacted by the New Democracy shortly before the election, the charges and revelations of those being then in the opposition are totally wasted. It is noted in this regard that the DEP-EKY management should have informed the political leadership of the Ministry of Industry. With this drilling, an investment of some $15 million is being made in effect which according to the law (recommended by the then-president of DEP-EKY Goulas) will be paid off through the cost of the oil. In other words, in addition to all the other concessions we have made, we allow the consortium to do this, thereby reducing even further the Greek share. The contractor evidently will inflate these costs (as it did in Prinos) to keep a greater amount. Moreover, this cost will be borrowed and therefore subject to interest payments. Regarding this contract which will result in tens of millions of dollars in losses for the Greek State, the Association of DEP-EKY Personnel (its chairman is a member of the company's board of directors) had presented the following charges on June 22, 1993. a. The consortium tax rate is reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent. b. The depreciation rate of the consortium is increased while the percentage share of the Greek State is decreased. Based on the annual extraction of oil, the depreciation rate for the consortium ranges from 58 to 90 percent (it was 40 percent) and the participation share of the Greek State from 20 percent to 5 percent (it was 30 percent). c. The Greek state will receive its share from the sale of oil once a year and not on a monthly basis as was the case until now, thereby losing several millions [of dollars] from lost interest.
