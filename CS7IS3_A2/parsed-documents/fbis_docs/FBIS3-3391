Last year, China's total investment accounted for nearly 50 percent of the country's national income, and the investment structure was irrational. Then, just how big an investment scale is appropriate? The deputies said we should follow the principle proposed by experts in this field -- that is, the proportion of a nation's investment should be decided based on the nation's economic development stage, the level of its economic development, and its current economic development conditions. If the investment scale is too small, it is difficult for its economy to develop rapidly. If the investment scale is too large, its industrial production will inevitably grow at a high speed, directly resulting in excessive currency issuance and acute shortage of funds, consequently prompting sharp increases in the prices of capital goods and retail prices. The scale of investment has a direct effect on whether a basic balance can be maintained between the total supply and the total demand -- we must never underestimate its effect. In investing, another problem warrants our attention -- that is, we should properly handle the amounts of investments. The deputies were of the opinion that good steel should be used for making the knife's edge -- we should use more funds for developing the "bottleneck" industries, such as the transportation, communications, energy, and raw and processed materials industries, which have impeded the country's economic development; and should not invest a lot of money in building luxury houses and recreational facilities and in real estate development. In other words, we should refrain from doing things that are not in line with the country's current economic development level and the people's living standards. The deputies said: We should do things according to economic law and set our eyes on the overall situation and long-term objectives. We must invest more where we need to and resolutely curtail investment where we need not to invest large amounts -- we must not put the cart before the horse.
