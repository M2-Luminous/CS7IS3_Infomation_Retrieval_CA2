ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of four new animal drug applications (NADA's) held by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Pharmachem Corp., Sanofi Animal Health, Inc., and Squire Laboratories, Inc. The sponsors notified the agency in writing that the animal drug products are no longer marketed and requested that approval of the applications be withdrawn.

EFFECTIVE DATE: February 18, 1994 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mohammad I. Sharar, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The sponsors of the NADA's listed in the table in this document have informed FDA that these animal drug products are no longer marketed or distributed and have requested that FDA withdraw approval of the applications. 1NADA No. 1Drug 1Sponsor 10&hyph;783 Promazine hydrochloride tablets Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories P.O.

In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , FDA is removing the text of and reserving 21 CFR 520.1962(b) and amending 21 CFR 524.1580d(b) to reflect the withdrawal of approval of NADA's 10&hyph;783 and 138&hyph;455, respectively. It is unnecessary to amend the regulations to reflect withdrawal of approval of the other two NADA's because NADA 11&hyph;871 was never codified and the sponsor of NADA 132&hyph;137 (Sanofi) has been previously removed from the regulation. Dated: January 31, 1994. Richard H. Teske, Acting Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2755 Filed 2&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
