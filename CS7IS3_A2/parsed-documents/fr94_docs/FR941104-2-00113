FR941104-2-00113 FR941104-2-00066 CSW Energy and the Partnership might incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development Expenses''), the total amount of which will not exceed $20 million. CSW and CSW Energy propose to fund the Development Expenses by capital contributions, loans, or open account advances from CSW to CSW Energy, from CSW Energy to Energy GP and Energy LP, and from Energy GP, directly or through Sweeny GP, and Energy LP, directly or through Sweeny LP, to the Partnership. All loans to the Partnership would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess either of the weighted cost of capital for CSW while CSW Energy indirectly holds all of the interests in the Partnership or the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time to time at Mellon Bank plus 4%. The prime rate plus 4% approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate third-party lenders for loans of this type. CSW and CSW Energy state that to make loans or open account advances through Energy GP, Energy LP, Sweeny GP and Sweeny LP to the Partnership in the manner and on the terms described herein, they will avoid granting the nonassociate third party partners to the Partnership the windfall that would otherwise accompany an interest rate to such third parties set artificially low instead of an interest rate tied to the market. Central and South West Corporation, et al. (70&hyph;8483) Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary, CSW Energy, Inc. (``Energy''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202 (``Applicants''), have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 32 of the Act and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder. CSW and Energy propose to invest in, develop, construct, own and operate, jointly with KVA Resources, Inc., a nonassociate company engaged in the business of independent power development (``KVA''), a facility that will qualify as an eligible facility under Section 32(a) of the Act and be known as the Northwest Regional Power Facility (``Project'') and to form various Project entities. The Project will consist of an approximately 838 megawatt (net) generation facility to be located in or near Creston, Washington. It will be certified as an exempt wholesale generator (``EWG''), as defined in Section 32(e) of the Act by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC''). The Applicants propose that Energy, indirectly, make investments in and develop the Project through a special purpose limited partnership anticipated to be known as Northwest Regional Power Limited Partnership (``Partnership''). To acquire and hold a general and limited partnership interest in the Partnership, respectively, Energy will organize and invest in: (1) a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest GP, Inc. (``Energy Sub GP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest GP II, Inc. (``Northwest GP''); and (2) a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest LP, Inc. (``Energy Sub LP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest LP II, Inc. (``Northwest LP''). Energy Sub GP and Energy Sub LP, and Northwest GP and Northwest LP, if formed, each will have authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock, without par value. Energy will subscribe to all of the common stock of Energy Sub GP and Energy Sub LP, and, if formed, Energy Sub GP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Northwest GP and Energy Sub LP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Northwest LP at a subscription price of $1.00 per share. Energy Sub GP will hold, either directly or through Northwest GP, a 1% general partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy Sub GP or Northwest GP and KVA will be initially the sole general partners of the Partnership. Energy Sub LP will initially hold, either directly or through Northwest LP, a 74% limited partnership interest in the Partnership and KVA will initially hold a 1% general partnership interest and a 24% limited partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy Sub LP, or Northwest LP, and KVA will be initially the sole limited partners of the Partnership.
