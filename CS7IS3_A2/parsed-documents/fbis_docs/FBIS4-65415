Addressing the True Path Party (DYP) parliamentary group meeting, she said that the PKK wants to spread new scenarios to the world public opinion, and for this reason defenseless people in the southeastern Anatolian region such as women, children and senior citizens were forced to migrate to northern Iraq forcibly by armed groups. `These people had wanted to move to other regions under the security of the state,' she said. `All the world knows the pkk is a group of terrorists burning and destroying all the means provided by the state to develop that region.' Ciller said she is once again calling on young people and their families not to fall into the trap of the terrorists, adding the state will continue to fight against the PKK until the terror ends. She said the government is also closely following the developments in the region. Concerning the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline, she said that Turkey is willing to solve the problem with a decision by the United Nations. On the Turkish military units to be sent to Bosnia she said preparations are in the last stage.
