FR940106-2-00125 FR940106-2-00071 The Stockton Metropolitan Airport study contains a proposed Noise Compatibility Program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to, or beyond, the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a Noise Compatibility Program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on May 26, 1993 and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program. The submitted program contained thirty (30) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports effective November 22, 1993. Outright approval was granted for twenty-eight (28) of the specific program elements. Two (2) elements were disapproved. The approved elements included existing preferential runway usage, existing flight procedures, existing aircraft category procedures, existing pattern procedures, practice circling maneuvers, education of airport users, amend county development title, residential/nonresidential noise sensitive land use exclusion area, sound attenuation in new construction, acoustical studies, real estate disclosure, residential soundproofing program, noise abatement departures, informational signs, noise abatement advisories, noise abatement hotlines, interagency coordination procedures, review committee, amend airport land use plan, and Weston Ranch easement area. These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports on November 22, 1993. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the Santa Clara County. Issued in Hawthorne, California, on December 15, 1993. Herman C. Bliss, Manager, Airports Division, Western-Pacific Region.
