They said his act was a mitzvah meant to save the people of Israel, the Land of Israel, and Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. The massacre in Hebron was not for the sake of Eretz Yisrael or the settlers. But it was against them, against all that is sacred and precious to us, that 118 bullets were fired by Barukh Goldstein. This Purim "gift" -- our vocabulary does not have a more sarcastic term to apply to the massacre -- was delivered not just to the dead, the wounded, and their families. Goldstein sent his gift to the Jewish residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, as well as Israel proper. Here are some of the components: -- This "mitzvah" will bring a bloodbath in its wake, whose main victims will likely be pure and innocent civilians like those on the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday, and those of Qiryat Arba' and other settlements and in the rest of Eretz Yisrael who will be murdered in revenge. And in the current atmosphere of incitement and breastbeating at the massacre, the general public has been conditioned to show understanding for future murderers. As a result, the settlers, not the killers, will be held responsible for the casualties. -- The government, forced to redouble its efforts "to save" the collapsing Oslo agreement, will make further concessions. These could eventually lead to the attainment of a long-held goal of Yasir 'Arafat and Meretz adherents: the dismantling of the settlements in stages, with Jewish Hebron, over which so much blood was spilled, likely to be the first victim. -- The release of some 1,000 Palestinian terrorists, which is like handing them and potential murderers a license to continue slaying Jews. -- The Oslo process, in all its gravity, succeeded in easing pressure from foreign countries, especially the U.S. Now, to accelerate the peace process, the Americans have summoned the Arabs and Israel to Washington and will present their longstanding plan: retreat to the 1949 borders, including Jerusalem. -- Resentment is felt toward Qiryat Arba' and the other settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza by a not insignificant portion of Israeli society, including many whose basic instinct is national but whose Jewish soul absolutely cannot acquiesce in such massacres. This public tells itself that if this is the price we must pay occasionally for maintaining settlements (and the memory of the Jewish underground also comes to mind) then the inescpable conclusion is that the two peoples must be separated. That includes the evacuation of Qiryat Arba' and Hebron of their Jews, which enjoys the support of a majority in the government. -- Before Israel's establishment, when the disturbances ran riots in the land, Jews were forced to travel in convoys; now, 60 years later, we are being forced to return to the travel procedures of a besieged society -- and to do so in Qiryat Arba', which bears the flag of Israeli pride and fought faithfully through the years for Israel's honor. For years, those hating the settlements, including champions of law and justice, sought to impose emergency regulations on the Jewish residents of these strongholds, thus equating their standing with that of the Arabs. Now, in addition to all the moral, security, settlement, and political "achievements" of the massacre, emergency regulations have been imposed. For it is not difficult to mobilize support from a conformist attorney-general, the self-righteous media, and academia's legalists. That backing is provided with relish. And those are just some of the political, security, psychological, and existential results to be visited on us because of this ghastly massacre. "He was a righteous man," assert those who knew him well; perhaps, but the moment he trained his gun at the backs of the men kneeling in prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, he ceased being righteous and became a mass murderer. There should be no mourning for him. Several people, including some halakhic authorities, saw the killing as a mitzvah. If that's the case, I have no part of such mitzvot. To the best of my understanding and knowledge, the thrust of Judaism and the great majority of the observant settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza reject this interpretation. In a deed which aroused passions almost 26 years ago, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of pioneers laid the foundation for the renewal of Jewish settlement in Hebron and subsequently in the rest of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. In the same period, a child was growing up in New York named Baruch Goldstein who probably didn't know about the historic act of Rabbi Levinger. He later chose to become a lethal agent in demolishing the foundations of the Jewish community in Hebron and elsewhere in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. And the founding father of the settlement movement does not see that his handiwork is sinking in the sea. In a trance of self-destruction, and in the name of Israel's honor, he refuses to draw the necessary conclusions from the terrible act and continues to preach his message.
