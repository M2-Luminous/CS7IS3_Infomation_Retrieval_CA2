The three will be there to receive a special UNESCO award. During the meeting, political discussions will be held on, among other things, the coming stages of the political process. Our correspondent notes that several days later, another meeting of the donor countries will be held in Paris, and 'Arafat is expected to attend this meeting as well. Hence, it is assumed that 'Arafat will not arrive in Jericho and Gaza before mid-July. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is also expected in the region at that time.
