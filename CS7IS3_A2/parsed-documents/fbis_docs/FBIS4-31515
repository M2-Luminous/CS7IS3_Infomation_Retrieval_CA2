Both presidents discussed extensively the development of democratic reforms in Albania, problems related to the Albanian question, and the situation in the region. They considered important both for Albania and the region the last efforts of the Albanian Government to develop and strengthen regional cooperation and friendship with regional countries, such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the European Union countries, other European countries, and so forth. Presidents Berisha and Rugova assessed as successful and important the visits and meetings of President Rugova in the North Atlantic Assembly, where the grave situation in Kosova and the possibilities of resolving this problem were addressed. The assembly meeting provided extensive support to the policy of Albanians in Kosova and their civil resistance against the Serbian occupation. They also assessed as very important the visits and recent meetings of President Rugova with high-level government members and other officials in Denmark, Norway, France, and Germany. All these meetings revealed a great concern on the part of these countries regarding the violation of freedoms and national rights of the Albanians in Kosova and their determination to seriously contribute to resolving the Kosova question. Both presidents assessed positively the serious efforts of the international community to establish a dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a third party on the reestablishment and functioning of democratic institutions and the solution of Kosova's political status. They welcomed the efforts and indications that encourage the start of a dialogue. Both presidents considered that the cooperation between Albania and Macedonia is important for peace and stability in the south of the Balkans. They were also of the opinion that Macedonia's membership in the CSCE as a member with full rights not only serves this state but provides a real impetus to a further respect for freedoms and human and national rights of the Albanians in Macedonia, which is a condition for the stability of this republic. They considered as a very important step the implementation of the census, which is in conformity with the standards and criteria of the law recommended by the group of experts and approved by the Macedonian Parliament. Both presidents think that Albania's relations with Greece are important both for the two countries and the region and that there exist real possibilities to resolve the disagreements through dialogue. Albania respects and is committed to respecting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the Greek minority. These rights, alongside those of the Albanians, have been subject to deeply spectacular positive changes and they will be further expanded in the future. Both presidents also stressed that the freeing of aid for the balance of payments and the continuation of aid for Albania by the European Union is of extraordinary importance for the progress of the reforms in Albania and its active role in preserving peace and stability in the region.
