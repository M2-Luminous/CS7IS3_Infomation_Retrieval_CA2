A Defense Ministry spokesman said the troops, who were killed Thursday, had been assigned to guard Rwanda's prime minister, who was assassinated by Rwandan security forces in the upheaval. Their commander, interviewed from Kigali by Belgian radio, said the Belgian soldiers were "mistreated" by Rwandan troops before they were killed. "These soldiers were in charge of security for Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, whose home was surrounded by Rwandan soldiers. She tried to flee. Our soldiers were apprehended while they tried to help clear the way for her," the Defense Ministry statement said. "The Belgian soldiers were disarmed, then taken to a military camp in Kigali where they were executed," it said. Their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, told the radio their bodies were now in Kigali hospital and that they would be transferred Friday to the UN mission hospital there before being repatriated. They all belonged to the 2d Commando Battalion from Flawinne in southeast Belgium. Marchal also said there had been violent fighting Thursday between different groups in the Rwandan military. He said part of a battalion of the former rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front in Kigali "made an incursion in the camp of the presidential guard who was guilty of these crimes, and seriously cleaned up the presidential guard unit." According to Marchal, "they gave them a lesson and I presume the presidential guard or any other unit will not start up this sort of thing again." The Rwandan Patriot Front, largely made up of the Tutsi minority, had opposed Habyarimana, who comes from the Hutu majority that has long dominated Rwandan politics. They were to be brought into a transitional government under a peace pact signed last August to end three years of civil war. [passage omitted]
