Stanislav Devaty, acting director of the secret service, said at the meeting with the members of the Defense and Security Committee of the Chamber yesterday that, although he is not completely satisfied with BIS personnel, the office continues to use the expert knowledge of some agents of the communist secret police. "I employ them because they are experts particularly on intelligence technology and are therefore qualified to provide training for new employees," Devaty explained and added that not a single one of them worked at the StB in the Department for Combating the Internal Enemy. Devaty illustrated this by the example of one of the top men in the BIS Economic Department who accompanied him yesterday to the parliament. Devaty also informed the deputies that BIS spent 489 million korunas [Kc] from the State Treasury last year.
