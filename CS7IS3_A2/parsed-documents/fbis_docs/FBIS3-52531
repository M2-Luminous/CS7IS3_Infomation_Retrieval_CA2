[passage omitted] Khaddam addressed the heads and members of the Arab News Agencies delegations participating in this conference. He said: It gives me pleasure to meet with some of the elite who work in the Arab information field. I wish you an enjoyable stay in Syria and I wish your conference success in attaining the objectives for which it is meeting. [passage omitted] Khaddam said: You know that the Arab nation faces serious challenges against its present and past, not to mention its future. These challenges revolve around the control of the land and the will. The foremost of these challenges is the Zionist challenge and the foreign designs against our countries. We face these challenges under complicated international circumstances as the world now lacks balance, objectivity, and law, not to mention the state of division and fragmentation the Arabs are suffering, and the stagnant Arab unity movement and the activities it should have inspired that would have been employed in tackling these challenges. If the Zionist challenge now is the same as it was years ago, it remains the most serious challenge in the future because the Zionist movement has an ideology and a strategy based on the establishment of a major power in this region. The political borders of this state, as we know, will not be within the boundaries of its present aggression. Its economic borders will target Arab resources while its strategic borders will extend to Iran, Pakistan, and others. The domestic challenge, as I have mentioned, is the Arab state of affairs in itself. All joint pan-Arab values have vanished, replaced by concepts that have nothing to do with pan-Arab interests. Arab relations became unbalanced and the use of force or the threat of using it within the framework of these relations has become a manifestation that has contributed to the uncomfortable state of affairs we are now experiencing. Some of those who have been overpowered by their countries' interests believe that the conflicts they wage serve their people. They do not realize that these conflicts have taken place at the expense of their people and not in their interest, and that these conflicts have taken place in the service of foreign powers and not in their service. Thus, we found pan-Arab unity threatened and we experienced a harsh campaign waged from outside and assisted from within the Arab homeland threatening the national unity of several Arab countries. [passage omitted] The vice president said: If we review the current circumstances, we realize the role the foreign media has played in the service of Israel. Before the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, there was no one in the West, or among those on its bandwagon, ready to offer any assistance or to seriously work to stop the Israeli pressure against the Palestinian intifadah. Suddenly, after its conclusion, we all saw the media theatrics with which some of the Palestinian leaders have been welcomed in some countries that used to ban their entrance. The media portrayed the incident as if was a historical transformation, and encouraged some to have illusions. This, undoubtedly, has greatly served Israel. [passage omitted] The vice president said: We always talk about the Arab situation, which pains and embitters every Arab citizen. There is no doubt that unless matters are restored to their natural situation and unless everybody understands that his fate is linked with that of the nation, the Arab situation will remain complicated and painful for every one. Due to our status as a confrontation state and to our historical circumstances, we in Syria fully understand that the restoration of the Arab spirit to Arab relations has become necessary and fateful. There is no doubt that searching for solutions and creating suitable joint Arab action to serve the nation's interests and its progress should be the responsibility of every one at this current stage. When waging the battle of peace, which is like a battle in a real war, the fighter will be in a stronger position if his nation is unified and enjoys solidarity. Similarly, the worker in a time of peace will enjoy a stronger position in defending the nation's rights if that nation is unified and enjoys solidarity. We have been calling for a just and comprehensive peace since the beginning of the seventies, and that the issue of peace has been a principal part of our strategy. We mean by peace a peace that will enable us to regain all our territories and the Palestinian Arab people's national rights. Then came the U.S. initiative, which we accepted after lengthy discussions that led to basic amendments to that initiative, foremost of which are the need for a comprehensive solution on all fronts and insistence on implementing UN resolutions. We went to Madrid, eager to see coordinated Arab action among the Arab parties involved in the process and also to see other parties that are not directly involved in constant touch because the conflict has a pan-Arab, rather than, regional nature. All the Arab summits' resolutions have asserted that all solutions should be Arab ones. In light of this concept, we worked and went to the Washington talks, and many attempts were made to reach a solution with Syria on the occupied Syrian territories. We rejected these because we believed in the pan-Arabism of the conflict, and consequently, in the need for a comprehensive solution, because unilateral solutions cannot produce peace and stability in the region. [passage omitted] Then contacts were held, and it was agreed to hold a meeting between President al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Geneva this month. The vice president added: Our position will remain clear. Peace should lead to the implementation of the Security Council's resolutions and to a total withdrawal from the occupied territories. We hope that the meeting will produce positive results. He said: We tried to maintain a unified Arab effort during the peace process, but regrettably, multilateral meetings were held. We believe that such meetings should not discuss issues pertaining to peace before discussing the issue of peace and withdrawal. He said: You notice brothers that after the signing of the agreement between the PLO and the Israelis, the Israelis tried to make it look as if peace had been realized in the region. They started to demand the lifting of the Arab boycott, and the establishment of relations between Israel and the Arab states. Regrettably, some Western circles adopted this position without taking into consideration that the reason for the Arab boycott was Israel's aggression against the Arabs, its occupation of their lands, and the displacement of millions of Palestinians. The reasons for the boycott still stand. Undoubtedly, the position on this issue has been good, and all attempts to draw the Arab countries into canceling the boycott failed. [passage omitted] Khaddam addressed the conference and said: I sincerely say to you that had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone to the peace negotiations. It is true that there is a vast military imbalance, but there is also a great imbalance in other issues that are in the Arab favor and are no less important than military power. Had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone to Madrid or Washington because negotiations with the weak or the one who is viewed as weak are sure to be at his expense and at the expense of his land. He said: We feel that our capabilities and those of the Arabs are not small. These capabilities enable us to feel strong. He pointed out that the time when the Israelis used to carry out operations that made the people feel defeat is no longer. [passage omitted] He emphasized: There will never be a peace that is not honorable and that does not guarantee our full rights. The peace we want is the one with which we and our future generations will be proud, no matter how bad or complicated the circumstances become. For us, an inch of land represents the dignity, honor, and future of the country. Nevertheless, had the Arab situation been normal, our capabilities to realize gains would have been much better, and this would have been in the interest of all parties. Khaddam then answered questions of the conference members.
