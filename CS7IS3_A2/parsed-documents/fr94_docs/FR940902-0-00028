FR940902-0-00028 FR940902-0-00010 Family Several comments were received on the definition of the term ``family'' at ยง626.5 of the interim final regulations. In general, the nature of these comments was that: (1) The definition is too restrictive and limits the Governor's flexibility in defining the term; (2) the definition does not recognize alternative living arrangements that do not fit neatly into the ``traditional'' concept of a family; and (3) the regulations do not address how to handle other family members, including dependent adults, living in the same residence. A few of the commenters noted that an apparent conflict exists in how ``family'' is defined in the interim final regulations and how it is treated in the Standardized Program Information Report (SPIR) instructions. The term ``family'' was statutorily defined in the 1992 Amendments for the purposes of income eligibility determination for receipt of JTPA services. The interim final regulations provide the Governor with flexibility to interpret the term ``family'' concerning how ``dependent children'' are defined for JTPA programs. The interim final rule also defines the phrase ``living in a single residence''. The statute established a standard definition to apply consistently for JTPA programs, which, within the three categories, covers the vast majority of family configurations and living relationships in the country. The definition is not intended to address every possible permutation of alternative living arrangements. Although the Department believes that the regulations provide the Governor with some latitude in defining the term ``family'', the comments raised an issue regarding the adverse effect of excluding ``dependent adults'' from the definition, which warrants further consideration. While the Department recognizes that excluding dependent adults may impact on the eligibility of some family members, the Department does not believe that this circumstance is included in the statutory definition. The Department does not believe that it has the authority to expand upon the definition of ``family'' beyond the categories specifically found at section 4 of the Act. No change is made in the final regulations. Other individuals living in the same residence, who are not dependent children, would be viewed as individuals in applying for and being determined eligible to receive JTPA services. A few of the commenters accurately noted the difference between the definition of ``family'' in the interim final regulations and the SPIR instructions regarding the treatment of an individual with a disability for the purposes of eligibility determinations. The SPIR reflects the definition of ``family'' in the regulations in effect prior to the publication of the December 29, 1992, interim final rule. The definition contained in the interim final regulations indicate that an individual with a disability ``may'', for the purpose of income eligibility, be considered to be an unrelated individual who is a family unit of one. This change was an administrative error and should not have been included in the interim final rule. Accordingly, the definition of ``family'' is amended to revise the word ``may'' to ``shall'' in the final regulations. This amendment is consistent with the provisions at section 4(8) of the Act defining the term ``economically disadvantaged''. Family Income A few comments were received on the change in the definition of ``family income'' and the method for calculating such income for the purposes of determining eligibility for JTPA services. In general, the nature of the comments were that: (1) The use of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) poverty guidelines appears to conflict with the definition of ``economically disadvantaged'' at section 4(8) of the Act; (2) the definition does not include certain payments that have previously been excluded from family income; and (3) the old definition of ``family income'' should be retained, with the Governor defining the term for the purposes of income eligibility determinations, as has been the case since the inception of JTPA. A few commenters accurately noted that certain payments that have always been considered to be ``public assistance'' were omitted from the interim final rule. This was an inadvertent oversight in developing the regulations. The definition of ``family income'' is amended in the final rule to reflect that ``public assistance'' still includes Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income, Emergency Assistance money payments, and non-Federal funded General Assistance or General Relief money payments, which are exclusions from income for the purposes of income eligibility determinations. In addition, certain other Federal statutes exclude additional types of payments from JTPA income eligibility determinations. For example, Pell grants are specifically excluded by title IV of the Higher Education Act, as is income earned while on active military duty and certain other veterans' benefits, identified at 38 U.S.C. 4213. These exclusions are incorporated into the final rule. There also has been concern expressed regarding the inclusion of Social Security benefit payments as income in determining eligibility for older individuals. It has been noted that many older individuals fall just above the income threshold for JTPA because of the inclusion of Social Security benefits and, therefore, are being denied needed JTPA services. The Department recognizes that older individuals have special needs which warrant consideration for their participation and inclusion in programs under JTPA. In the interest of responding to such needs, the Department is amending the regulations in the final rule to permit the Governor to exclude 25 percent of regular Social Security benefits from family income. The Department believes that this change will address the concerns of the commenters.
