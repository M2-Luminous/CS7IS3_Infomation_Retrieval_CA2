Reports received by Bakhtar Information Agency say the clashes have mainly occurred between the militias of Golboddin and Dostam for the looted goods of Kabul residents. As many as three Dostam's militia have been taken prisoner by Golboddin's militia, and the prisoners were later killed. According to another report, in the course of clashes between Haji Zarif's men--who are associated with Golboddin's militia--and Dostam's militia, 19 Dostam militiamen were killed and three Golboddin militiamen were badly injured. Another report says that some days ago a cousin of Zardad, a commander of Golboddin's militia, was captured by Dostam's militia, and in retaliation, Golboddin's militia killed Sofi Karim, a Dostam militia ringleader, in Karta-e Naw area. Reports say the motive of the clashes between the militias of Golboddin and Dostam have been the dividing up of looted goods and the sale of weapons; this has increased their previous differences.
