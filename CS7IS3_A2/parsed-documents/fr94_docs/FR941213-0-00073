FR941213-0-00073 FR941213-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 501 [Docket No. 94&hyph;95; Notice 1] Organization and Delegation of Powers and Duties AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This notice amends the organization and delegation of powers and duties within NHTSA to delegate to the Associate Administrator for Rulemaking the authority to grant or deny inconsequentiality petitions submitted pursuant to 49 CFR part 556, reserving to the Administrator the authority to grant or deny appeals from the determinations made by the Associate Administrator under such authority. DATES: The final rule is effective December 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Taylor Vinson, Office of Chief Counsel, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5263). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 provide the Secretary of Transportation with authority to exempt a manufacturer from any responsibility to notify or to remedy any defect or failure to comply upon a determination that such defect or failure to comply is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This authority has been delegated to the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as part of the Secretary's general delegation to administer the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 CFR 1.50). Regulations implementing 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 (at that time 15 U.S.C. 1417) were issued in 1977: 49 CFR part 556 Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance . NHTSA Order 800&hyph;2 (November 20, 1978) established the agency's `` Procedures for Processing Petitions for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance '', and assigned the Office of Rulemaking the primary responsibility for processing inconsequentiality petitions. Part 566 is silent as to signatory authority for inconsequential notices. Under Order 800&hyph;2, ``the Decision Package is submitted to the Administrator for approval and signature.'' In practice, determinations of grant or denial have been signed by the Associate Administrator for Rulemaking after approval by the Administrator. Thus, notwithstanding any formal delegation of power, the Administrator has made a de facto delegation of such power. The agency is now amending Part 501 to make a de jure delegation of this power. Forty-nine U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 are silent on whether a determination may be appealed. However, 49 CFR 556.7 expressly permits any interested person to do so, and, under 49 CFR 556.8, ``the Administrator'' may grant or deny such appeals. In practice, the same procedure has been followed with respect to the infrequent appeals from inconsequentiality determinations. Because appeals are generally made to a higher authority than the decision maker, the Administrator has decided to reserve this power, and Part 501 is amended to reflect this decision. Finally, NHTSA has noted that the titles of two Associate Administrators as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations lack the underlining accorded the other Associate Administrators in 49 CFR 501.8. NHTSA is amending these sections to add the underlining for consistency of treatment. Effective Date Because the final rule relates to internal administrative procedures, clarifies existing agency practice, and imposes no additional burden upon any person, prior notice and comment upon are unnecessary and it may be made effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This rulemaking has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rule is to clarify existing agency policy and procedures. Since the rule does not have any significant cost or other impacts, preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has analyzed this rule for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The rule will not have a significant effect upon the environment simply because of the clarifications made to existing requirements. Regulatory Flexibility Act The agency has also considered the impacts of this rule in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based on the discussion above, I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. No person is affected by an amendment regarding the internal procedures of the agency. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) This rule has also been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and NHTSA has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Civil Justice Reform This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30161 of Title 49 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.
