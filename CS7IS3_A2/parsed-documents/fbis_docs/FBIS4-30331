Hata, who announced the resignation of his entire cabinet Saturday morning, telephoned Kim and expressed his hope to visit South Korea and meet with Kim some day, the official said. During the 15-minute conversation, the premier expressed confidence his departure would not hurt relations between Japan and South Korea, the official said. Hata disbanded his two-month-old minority government to avoid certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, as well as a snap general election and political vacuum that would follow. Kim, thanking Hata for his telephone call, was quoted as saying he is willing to meet with Hata any time to compare notes on a wide range of issues. The South Korean president also reportedly voiced his desire to further strengthen bilateral ties with Japan. To defuse the standoff over North Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms, Hata and Kim agreed on the need to realize a summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea and resume the third round of talks between North Korea and the United States on Pyongyang's nuclear program, the official said.
