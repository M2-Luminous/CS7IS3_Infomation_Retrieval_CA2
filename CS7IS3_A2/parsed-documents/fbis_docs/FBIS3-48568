Ilagan] [Text] Members of the government panel negotiating peace talks with ultra-rightist groups appealed yesterday to the leaders of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] (RAM) to return to the bargaining table for the resumption of the peace negotiations. Professor Alfredo Tadiar, head of the government peace panel, said the resumption of talks with representatives of the RAM led by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina cannot be suspended indefinitely because the country's stability is at stake. "We call on RAM leaders to go back to the negotiating table. We hope that the substantive part of the talks would start soon," he said. Tadiar explained that talks with RAM leaders were suspended last 2 December because of differences on procedures. He said the technical working committee with representatives of both panels was about to discuss recommendations on 10 talking points submitted by the RAM, such as electoral reforms and good government. Former army lieutenant colonel Gregorio Honasan, also a RAM leader, reportedly complained about the government's failure to provide the right wing leaders with security, citing the numerous armed escorts of Nur Misuari, leader of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), during his stay in Mindanao in talks with government representatives. Tadiar, however, ruled out any discrimination against the RAM, adding that it even failed to avail itself of the 30 permits to carry firearms issued to it by the government for personal security. RAM leaders, he added, only got 12 permits to carry firearms. The government panel also said that they remain optimistic that sincerity on both sides will still prevail despite the initial problems now affecting the talks.
