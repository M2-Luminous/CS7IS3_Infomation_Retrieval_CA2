In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghassan al-Khatib, former member of the Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks, expressed apprehension that these arrangements "might reinforce and consolidate the existing situation, which includes an unacceptable settlement presence even in the short-term." Al-Khatib, who is a leading member of the Palestinian People's Party, believes that the task of the joint police force "will not only be to protect the security of Palestinians but also that of the settlers." He pointed out that this "will mean recognizing the reality of their presence and their right to security. This is recognition and reinforcement of a reality which everyone has admitted is the real cause for the present grave situation in Hebron." The Palestinian negotiator said that "solving the problem on the basis of a joint Palestinian-Israeli-international police force reflects the Israeli concept of the problem. Namely, that it is a conflict between Arab residents and Jewish settlers and that the Israeli authority is a neutral party in this conflict." He said that the arrangements which are being talked about "are not a step toward ending settlement activity, but a step toward its consolidation. They do not constitute a guarantee for the security of Palestinians, but will complicate the security situation." The former Palestinian negotiator called on the Palestinian leadership to reassess its position with regard to this issue. He said that "one must not accept any arrangement that does not include the removal of settlements, especially in Hebron." He added that the Palestinian side "must not rely on undeclared or unofficial promises because these promises seek to persuade, after which the Israeli position will return to its customary intransigence."
