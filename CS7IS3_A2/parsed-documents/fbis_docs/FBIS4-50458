The official said that China's input in posts and telecommunications construction for the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991- 1995) will reach 160 billion yuan, while in the newly drafted Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the total budget is a huge 360 billion yuan. To provide sufficient posts and telecommunications capacity for the fast development of the economy, China has been increasing investment in the construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures year by year. In 1993 an investment of 40.4 billion yuan was finished, while this year's budget hit 53.6 billion yuan. The official said that in addition to a small amount of money from the central government, a major part of the funds will come from investment by local governments, domestic loans and overseas investors. The official said that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986- 1990) the MPT used 1.1 billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds, and thereafter, foreign funds going to this sector have been increasing by a big margin each year. Foreign funds have been used mainly for buying advanced technologies and equipment, such as optical fiber cables, switchboards, mobile telecommunications equipment and mobile telephone production lines. At present the MPT and the Ministry of Electronics Industry are joining hands to tackle some high-tech projects in the field of telecommunications, and are actively preparing for construction of China's telecommunications superhighway. In addition, the MPT also plans to buy 15 planes in the coming few years to open special postal air routes. All these projects need support from foreign funds and technologies, the official said. In fact, the world's large telecommunications enterprises, such as Motorola, Siemens and NEC, have already taken a share in China's huge investment market for posts and telecommunications construction. Meanwhile, many other foreign companies would not spare a single chance to enter the Chinese market. Every time China publishes a new telecommunications project, a dozen foreign companies come at once to compete for contracts. Wu Jichuan, minister of MPT, made a speech to a national posts and telecommunications conference this week, stressing again to expand international cooperation and promote the use of foreign funds. Wu said that in addition to overseas loans and other traditional patterns for using funds, the MPT will, with ratification from the central government, choose some qualified industrial enterprises to issue shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; the MPT will also buy equipment from Hong Kong with foreign currencies borrowed right there. At the same time the minister reiterated that foreign businessmen are not allowed to manage or participate in the managing of public telecommunications networks and special telecommunications networks within Chinese territories.
