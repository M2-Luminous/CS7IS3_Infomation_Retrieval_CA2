We must look into the future with calm. Up to now, it was possible to talk about intrigues, falsifications, and ill-willed predictions. However, from now, we can only talk about facts; that the majority politics of recent times have failed. The power that gained the majority in 1990 has lost the people's confidence. It can search for excuses in the international situation, in world economic recession, in the country's desperate situation, and we could carry on listing the many negative circumstances. All these do not excuse them the same way as these did not excuse the stupid actions of the previous regime. History does not grant acquittals for failures, even in situations a thousand times more difficult than what we have had. Especially that the social lifting power of the change of the regime offered exceptional opportunities after the change. Lessons can always be learned. For the power that, in all probability, will have to say goodbye after the [second round of] elections in three weeks' time, the main lesson will obviously be that dialogue with society cannot be neglected by any political force. Those who have been leading the country up to now believed that that they infallibly knew the wishes of the "people" and the "nation." In the meantime, they humiliated the object and subject of their governing every day. They deliberately confused the Rakosi and the Kadar regimes and the various phases of the latter. This carried the message that the people were like a flock of sheep that was waiting for a good shepherd to appear from nowhere. If someone believes and even keeps repeating that this people is waiting for "bread for 3.60" [price in forints for kilo of bread in Kadar's time], he is wrong and even deceives himself. Contrary to all belittling assumptions, Hungarian people can count very well. Rather than bread for 3.60, milk for 3, or sausage for 2, people first, second, and third want dignity. They wish for their abilities and performance to be recognized, and for their leaders to give free scope to their creative abilities. The country has mainly been disappointed in this wish in the past four years. We are probably right in assuming that this is the reason it voted the way it did. Naturally, all this also has lessons for the future. Those newly coming to power will have to deal with the same people desiring dignity. Sober-minded politicians cannot believe that it is good to produce radical government changes every four years. To put it differently, it is not at all wise or bearable to provide the grounds for such a deep disappointment. Those coming to power as a result of this year's elections will have to assess, thoroughly, the current successes, and even more carefully, the reasons for the failure of the current losers. As a result, they will have to conclude the following. First: They have to come to an understanding with the people. Second: They have to come to an understanding with the opposition. And third: They have to prepare for both keeping and handing over power. Assessing all this calmly, those who are coming to power will have to be clear that "their coming into position" means that they respect the nation's dignity and they interpret popular sovereignty to be supreme, above themselves.
