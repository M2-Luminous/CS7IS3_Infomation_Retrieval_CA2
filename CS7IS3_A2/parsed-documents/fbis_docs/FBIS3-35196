In an identical resolution passed in both the houses, it said attempts from any quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely. The resolution declared that India has the will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of India, the resolution said attempts to separate the state from the rest of the country will be resisted by India with all necessary means. The resolution demanded Pakistan to vacate the occupied areas of Jammu and Kashmir. Noting with deep concern Pakistan's role in training terrorists and supply of weapons and funds to them, it said Islamabad's sole purpose is to create disorder, disharmony, and subversion in the valley. It called upon Pakistan to stop forthwith its support to terrorism which is in violation of the Simla Agreement. It said this is the root cause of tension between the two countries. Describing Pakistan's anti-India campaign as unacceptable calumny and falsehood, the resolution expressed deep concern over the highly provocative statement from Pakistan and said it will only vitiate the atmosphere. The resolution was moved by the speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, in the Lok Sabha, and the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, in the Rajya Sabha.
