Next week the parliament will deal with governmental bills designed to satisfy the basic demands of the ethnic minorities. In Slovakia there are 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (10 percent of the population). "Deputies have a great opportunity to show their willingness to be tolerant and their ability to think democratically," Csaky commented on the amendments to the laws on registration offices, official language and administrative set-up. The laws will make it possible for the ethnic minorities to use their first and family names in their original form. Moreover, towns and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic minority members will have the right to a place-name in the minority's language. The opposition and Matica Slovenska [Slovak Heritage Foundation] have protested against the proposals approved by the government. Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational organisation which strives to preserve Slovak legacy and national feelings. Its leadership stated that the prepared bilingual names of 560 towns and villages were reminiscent of the "Horthyite occupation" (by Hungary between 1938 and 1945) of south Slovakia and that it feared a threat to integrity of the young state. "The issue can be abused for an all-out struggle between the current and past coalitions," Csaky said. "Matica is playing a negative role in shaping modern society. It is not able to get rid of prejudice and people with political ambitions," he stated, adding that Matica, being a cultural institution, should not meddle in politics. Csaky described as "pure nonsense" the statement by Roman Hofbauer, former transport minister in Vladimir Meciar's government, that the bilingual names would require modifying of all official documents, while people would have to master, use and respect all the variants of the names. "The laws will not, of course, harass anybody," Csaky stated. On the decision of the Slovak National Party (SNS, 9 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak parliament) to allow only native Slovaks to join the party Csaky noted: "I regret this, but it is no surprise in a party with views from the 18th or the 19th centuries." Csaky pleaded for the formation of a coalition of three ethnic Hungarian groupings, Egyutteles (9 deputies), the MKDH (5 deputies) and the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS, extra-parliamentary) for the forthcoming elections (September 30-October 1). He dismissed the proposal by Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray for creation of a union. "The election law mentions only parties and coalitions, not unions," Csaky stated, adding that the MOS had its electoral base so that neither the MKDH nor the Egyutteles would be damaged by the three-member coalition.
