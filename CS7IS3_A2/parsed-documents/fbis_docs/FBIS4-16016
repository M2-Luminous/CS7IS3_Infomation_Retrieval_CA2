He is set to challenge Yeltsin, Zhirinovskiy, and all other candidates in the forthcoming presidential elections. His slogan is: "Make Russia Great Again," which is the purported aim of the book he is currently writing, "The Collapse of a Power." In fact, this was the starting point of the interview with LA REPUBBLICA and CORRIERE DELLA SERA: The book will explain, he said, "how we ended up in this shameful situation, and how Russia's power can be restored." [Franceschini] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, that "power" began to collapse when you were still vice president. Could you do nothing to prevent the collapse then? [Rutskoy] Unfortunately not. There was a plan to push me aside, to discredit me and gradually deprive me of all power. [Franceschini] But why did you decide to break with Yeltsin and swim against the tide? [Rutskoy] Because they wanted a subservient vice president, one who would have no opinions, make no proposals, not ask the president any tricky questions, not criticize any of the do-nothings and irresponsible elements in his team. The first crack in our relationship appeared over Gaydar's economic reforms. I was against them. The second crack developed over my disgreement with the devious way in which it was decided to found the Commonwealth of Independent States and thus destroy the Soviet Union. Then came the rest: corruption, bribery at every level of power, the cynical plundering of natural resources, begging the West for aid in a most humiliating fashion, and a subordinate foreign policy, as if Russia were a doormat for the West to wipe the mud off its shoes. [Franceschini] Zhirinovskiy also says all those things. [Rutskoy] True, and I feel close to anyone who loves the fatherland, who says that Russia deserves to fulfil the role of a superpower. This country covers one sixth of the planet's land: Fill it with a mixture of civil war, deprivation, epidemics, nuclear power stations, and chemical plants, and the result of all this will inevitably undermine stability in Europe and Asia. Beggars do not wield a sword but at most a stick. However, if Russia wields a stick instead of a sword, it will be crushed. De Gaulle used to say: The sword is the axis of peace. But when the sword is held by only one country, then the latter becomes the world's watchdog. That is why at least two superpowers are needed. As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned, although our positions may differ in some respects, I believe we can reach an agreement, as long as it is understood that I reject radicalism and demagoguery. [Franceschini] What concerns you most at present? [Rutskoy] Our nation's debasement. Cynicism, immorality, lying, theft, have become everyday events. Patriotism, on the other hand, is considered a form of extremism, akin to fascism or nazism. I am also alarmed by something else, namely the resigned attitude of many people. Economic reforms that have plunged us into poverty, an armed attack on parliament, a Constitution worthy of a monarch -- what else must the so-called "democrats" do for people to understand that we can no longer live like this, that this is the beginning of the end? Where else do people work without being paid for months on end, where elso do pensions condemn people to starvation, children have nothing to eat, mortality outweigh births, and the dead get buried in plastic bags? In Russia, which was once a great and powerful nation. I would like to ask the miners, the workers, the peasants who today voice their protest: Where were you in September-October 1993? How could you betray those who wanted to defend you? Can you not see that the person responsible for all this is your president? [Franceschini] What did you expect the people to do then? [Rutskoy] I expected them to suppoprt us. Not by rising up in arms, but through a civil protest, a general strike. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort happened. First everyone was calling for the president's resignation. Then, when Yeltsin dissolved parliament, they all fell back again on a hand-to-mouth policy based on compromise. The result: The executioners and ravagers of the country have been confirmed in power. [Franceschini] If you could go back, would you act differently? [Rutskoy] May I reverse the question: Would the people today, knowing how things ended, still support the president? [Franceschini] You claim that 500 people died at the White House rather than the 149 mentioned in the official report... [Rutskoy] The world watched a live TV broadcast of the massacre, but an attempt is being made to hide the truth. Everybody is silent, including the new parliament, but that is only natural. Why say anything when they too are eating out of the same plate? Only the press raises its voice, but only to slander those who upheld the Constitution, and it blames us for everything. [Franceschini] If you had resigned from your post as vice president, perhaps today you would be a deputy in the Duma. [Rutskoy] All I ever got from being vice president were insults and injuries, but stepping down would have been like betraying my ideals, as well as all the people who voted for me. Most of the new deputies elected to the Duma have applied this theory: Betraying at the right moment means knowing how things will end. This applies to all parties, including Gaydar's, Yavlinkiy's, Shakhray's, and Zhirinovskiy's. I would not like to be in the company of men who are prepared to serve any regime as long as it feeds them. [Franceschini] Is there a Rutskoy party? [Rutskoy] The Free Russia People's Party, whose chairman I am. We will be holding a congress in May in order to adopt our new platform, win the next elections, and embark on reforms in the interest of the people. [Franceschini] Will you therefore be standing in the presidential elections in 1996, or perhaps sooner if early elections are called? [Rutskoy] Yes, if the party nominates me. [Franceschini] Boris Yeltsin was one of your political "mentors," later he became a boss with whom you had some differences, still later an enemy, and finally the man who gave the order to shoot. What is your opinion of the president today? [Rutskoy] I sincerely trusted this man. Unfortunately, I was much mistaken. I have learned one thing from him: how not to govern a country. [Franceschini] Yeltsin now proposes a "social peace" agreement to all forces in the country... [Rutskoy] Are there any assurances that the people signing it will not then be silenced? Does it make sense to invoke social peace and at the same time spy on one's opponents, tap their telephones? If I lean out of the window, I can see someone watching my home this very minute. All we have to do is go for a stroll downtown and someone would be on my tail immediately. I will vote with both hands for social peace, but such an agreement is not feasible with the present leaders. [Franceschini] While you were in prison, a new Constitution was passed. Do you accept its legitimacy? [Rutskoy] How can you accept a Constitution which was voted after the shooting on Parliament, and was passed by a only minority of voters? No, I do not accept it. But I am obliged to comply with it just like any other law-abiding citizen. This Constitution has the same value as power founded on bayonets. Furthermore, even its author (Yeltsin) is probably not happy with it, since it prevents him from doing everything he wants. [Franceschini] What dou you think of the fight against crime and corruption? [Rutskoy] Have you ever seen a thief punishing theft? Can someone who is corrupt combat corruption? [Franceschini] It is feared in the West that if you become president, nationalism will resurface... [Rutskoy] Why worry about the West? What Russia thinks is more important. But you can rest assured. With me as president, it is the Russian nation, not nationalism, that would be reborn. I am against the idea that one country should overpower others to prove its superiority. But I believe Russia will once again become a great nation. I will fight side by side with my people to bring about the day when Russia will again be a superpower.
