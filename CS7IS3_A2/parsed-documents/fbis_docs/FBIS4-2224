"A contingent of UN forces should soon be on its way to Gorazde," President Bill Clinton's National Security Advisor Anthony Lake said in a policy speech at the John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the presence of UN peacekeepers in the Muslim enclave, under increasing Serb attacks in recent days, "could be a basis for possible air strikes." Christopher told the Public Broadcasting Service that NATO could threaten air strikes if the UN forces, expected to be from Ukraine, Britain and France, were attacked. Lake stressed that "neither the president nor any of his senior advisers rules out the use of NATO power to help stop attacks such as those against Gorazde." "We must make clear to the Serbs and to the Serbs of Bosnia that the costs of continued intransigence are high," he added. At the Pentagon, Spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski said the U.S. was ready to help transport the Ukrainian soldiers to Gorazde. There were 15 peacekeepers in Gorazde, reports said.
