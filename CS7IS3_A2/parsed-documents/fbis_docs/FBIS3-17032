Brodyanskiy, authorized electoral representative of Russian Republican Party Maritime Kray organization and authorized representative of candidates to kray duma V.I. Cherepkov and T.G. Romanenko, under the "An Eyewitness Account" rubric: "Lebedinets and Tolstoshein Took the Mayoralty by Storm"] [Text] A roundtable at the UTRO ROSSII editorial offices was interrupted by an agitated female voice: The mayoralty is under attack. But.... the mayoralty was not stormed for another.... 15-20 minutes. They began at 1814: An OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachment] detachment poured out from a couple of dozen cars and, having easily pushed aside the women at the entrance, stomped to the 10th floor. The door to the mayor's office was broken down (this is the way they probably "seize" apartments?). Women were dragged out of the building by the arm. I personally saw V.A. Gilgenberg, for the third day the acting mayor (the mayor himself is ill) being thrown out of the building; in the process the metal door was thrown open by Gilgenberg's head squeezed under the arm of a powerfully built OMON soldier. The whole operation was directed personally by Lebedinets, who had announced the dismissal of the mayor on the grounds of criminal proceedings initiated against him and the appointment of a new mayor--Tolstoshein, and his deputy Terekhov. Attorney Ulitskiy was not permitted to visit Cherepkov. At 0100 the pickets and journalists who gathered at the mayoralty became witnesses and participants in the concluding part of the operation: An OMON group, pushing their way through the crowd, carried out V.I. Cherepkov; his face was a strange green color and lifeless. The mayor was placed into an ambulance surrounded by militiamen, which then took him and his wife home. The small apartment quickly filled with people (it had not occurred to our mayor to get for himself a larger apartment while he was in power). The ambulance physician apologized--she was only carrying out orders. She recalled what a good doctor Gartman used to be. Now this participant in the operation approved the "transfer" of the patient that night. Which means that Gartman used to be a doctor; who he is now is not for us to judge. Among those watching the proceedings from the mayoralty's steps was a militia officer and some imposing figure in a "macho" black coat. I asked him to introduce himself but got no answer. I was told this actually was Tolstoshein. At the same time, in a classic Bolshevik manner, they went after rayons where new heads of administration were installed. Head of Pervorechenskiy Rayon A.V. Kuchinskiy had his official car--some "land-cruiser" that before then had served Tolstoshein--confiscated while he was riding in it. The coup was now complete. People we called in the State Duma assured us that this was all illegal. That opening a door with a man's head is illegal is obvious even without the Duma. That a sick man is "treated" by OMON is inhuman. That on the eve of elections all this is done to candidates is a mockery of the recently adopted Constitution. All together it is a slap in the face of the city, all of us. People may have different feelings about the mayor and his supporters, but when the law is trampled so brazenly, openly, it means that no one is safe-- tomorrow they can use the head of any of us as a battering ram. Kray Procurator V.V. Vasilenko postponed a telephone conversation regarding candidates' rights until tomorrow, and denied his part in the operation--it is the investigator, he said. Someone among the "bearers" told Gilgenberg that the "kray court had concurred" on the action. The militia--dozens of cars and about 100 participants--have demonstrated its might and drive. Would it not be nice if they used all this might against racketeers, apartment burglars, and pickpockets--Vladivostok would be safer than Lillehamer. Office windows lit up one after another at the mayoralty's floors; S.P. Goryacheva probably will now have more material for new denunciations of the trashed mayoralty. There was no concern for observing due process--it is not necessary to comply with its norms during a coup. What to do, everybody will now decide for himself. But we do have to turn out for elections. And vote in such a way that would deprive the party of the nomenklatura coup from getting the votes--at least in our city.
