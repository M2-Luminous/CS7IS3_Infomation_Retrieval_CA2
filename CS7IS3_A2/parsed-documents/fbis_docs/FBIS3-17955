But, in the present conditions it would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the minister himself. [Mamedov] At present the situation on our borders is favorable. We have strengthened our positions. We want to create an army. It must be created whether or not there is a war. A strong country and state should have a strong and proper army. The entire people and society should be involved in the war. We should have evicted the Armenians a long time ago. I would like to ask: Who is to defend the Azerbaijani soil? We ourselves, the Azerbaijani people. Where are they [deserters] trying to flee? Why and from whom they are escaping?. From ourselves, our own country, mothers, sisters, or brothers? Therefore, availing myself of this opportunity I am informing all the deserters, both soldiers and officers, that in 15 days we will start changing the military certificates and personal documents. All military personnel must carry their document with them. Those who do not will be regarded as deserters, be they soldiers or officers. Therefore, I am informing them that they still have time, until 15 April. They must return to their military units by 15 April. After that, we will issue no military documents to anyone. The state will take a very stern approach to them. [Sherifov] The military laws must be obeyed unconditionally? [Mamedov] Of course. I would very much like for you to put them on television so that their fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, and relatives could see these deserters. There are cases when the son escapes and his father comes and takes his place at the front. Beloved son, where is the morality in this? Who will defend this country? The war will end sooner or later. I now ask the deserters: How will they dare to look in the faces of their friends and acquaintances serving in the same unit? [Sherifov] Finally, many are trying to forecast the duration of the war--that is, when and how it will end. As defense minister, what is your forecast, and do you believe such a prognosis can be made? [Mamedov] I cannot say that the war will end in a month or within six months. It is not possible to make such a forecast, because the enemy cannot be regarded as weak. We cannot say: The enemy is weak so let's launch an attack. We must gather information on the strength of the enemy and then launch an attack. I do not approve of sending our beloved sons to martyrdom for no reason at all. Therefore, it is not possible to state definitely that the war will end in one or two months. It would be inappropriate to say such a thing. Whether the war ends in one month, half a year, or eight months depends on our deserters, the entire nation, and society. Some think that the war is something apart from the people. No. The war is a question of the honor of the people. [Sherifov] One should rely on one's own people? [Mamedov] A country relies on its people during wartime. If the people hide their sons, then who is going to take part in the war? We cannot expect people to come from other countries, from Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan, and participate in it and defend Azerbaijani soil. This cannot be. That is the answer to your question.
