FR940118-0-00014 FR940118-0-00004 VA does not concur. Under diagnostic code 7522, two distinct elements are required for a 20 percent evaluation: (1) Penile deformity and (2) loss of erectile power. If either element is absent following insertion of a penile implant or for any other reason the criteria for a 20 percent evaluation under this code are not met, and the instruction which the commenter requests is therefore not warranted. VA regulations are binding upon all agencies within the Department of Veterans Affairs, and neither BVA nor any other VA agency is free to adopt an official policy which is contrary to established regulations. The same commenter also requested that we add a NOTE to diagnostic code 7522 indicating entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). Although loss of erectile power establishes entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k), we do not believe that a NOTE to such effect in the rating schedule is warranted. The criteria regarding entitlement to special monthly compensation are extensive, very complicated, and seldom correspond exactly to evaluation criteria in the rating schedule. For that reason, it is important that raters refer to the regulations governing special monthly compensation rather than relying on cross-references in the rating schedule. One commenter objected to the proposed elimination of a compensable evaluation for loss of a single testicle under diagnostic code 7524, alleging that such loss disrupts normal endocrine function and interferes with the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. VA does not concur. In fact, any retrogressive changes in secondary sex characteristics even following removal of both testes after sexual maturity would occur slowly, if at all (Oswald S. Lowsley and T.J. Kirwin, ``Clinical Urology'' 230 (Williams and Wilkins 1956)). A solitary testis is in most cases adequate to sustain normal endocrine function without hormone replacement therapy. No significant employment handicap would likely result from this condition and a compensable evaluation, in our judgment, is not warranted. The same commenter objected to the proposed elimination of the minimum rating of 20 percent for removal of the prostate gland (diagnostic code 7526). VA does not concur. Because of the development of improved surgical techniques for extraction of the prostate through the perineum, bladder, surrounding capsule, or urethra, a minimum disability evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted. Often the only residual of this surgery is sterility, which is compensated not under the rating schedule but by means of special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). Should any other disability result, it would be rated under the diagnostic code for injuries, infections, hypertrophy, and postoperative residuals of the prostate gland (7527), with evaluations based on the criteria for voiding dysfunction or urinary tract infections. In our judgment, this provision allows for a broad enough range of evaluations to rate residual disability as established by medical examination. Three commenters urged that the previous convalescent period of one year following cancer treatment (diagnostic code 7528) be retained, stating that the complexity of certain medical procedures, the wide variety of possible side-effects, and the time required to recover from treatment precludes any realistic reduction of these recuperative periods. The commenters appear to have misinterpreted the proposed rule to mean that a convalescent evaluation will terminate after six months. The rule actually requires an examination, not a reduction, six months after the assignment of total benefits. If the claimant remains totally disabled, the 100 percent evaluation will continue without interruption. If a reduction in evaluation is warranted, it will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). This application of total convalescence evaluations will take into account the wide array of possible side-effects and complications of treatment by ensuring that any changes in evaluation are supported by the specific findings of a current medical examination. A total evaluation will extend indefinitely after treatment is discontinued, with a required VA examination six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant a reduction in evaluation, the reduction will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). There can be no reduction at the end of six months since any proposed reduction would be based on the examination and the notification process can begin only after the examination is reviewed. This method also has the advantage of offering the veteran more contemporary notice of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), expanding the opportunity to present evidence showing that the proposed action should not be taken. We have revised the wording of the NOTE based upon the concerns of the commenters, however, to ensure that it cannot be misinterpreted as requiring a reduction six months after treatment is terminated.
