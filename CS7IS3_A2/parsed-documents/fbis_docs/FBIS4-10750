Most of these disbursements will be covered by financial reserves that total more than 2.3 billion new soles. Some 840 million new soles of the national financial reserves have been allocated to fund the salary policy. Some 215 million new soles were allocated for school expenses, Christmas bonuses, and other labor obligations. He reported that more than 1 billion soles have been set aside for salaries. With regard to the date when the salary increase will be granted to Armed Forces and police personnel, Blanco said the executive branch must decide. He said the Budget Law originally contemplated the increase on two different dates: The first 70 new soles in February and the remaining 30 new soles in August. Regarding the first three-month balance of the National General Budget, Blanco said the committee must wait for an Economy Ministry report before commenting.
