Nevertheless, since the independence, this state has functioned as a national state of the Macedonian people, says a letter of the (Macedonian) People's Democratic Party [PDP] addressed to the CSCE Council of Ministers recently. The Macedonian Constitution and many other laws have thus discriminated against the Albanian people especially in the fields of education, culture, and citizenship, the letter stresses. The Law on Nationality in Macedonia has declared some 100,000 Albanians as persons without nationality. The government in Macedonia is in general centralized while local governments do not exist. The central government is made up almost wholly of ethnic Macedonians with the occasional symbolic Albanian, although there are some 300 Albanian jurists looking for work in Macedonia. Non-representation of the Albanians in the structures of the present government is justified by the government as being inherited from the past, the letter says, but this is not convincing because new institutions, such as diplomacy, are being set up on the basis of nationalities.
