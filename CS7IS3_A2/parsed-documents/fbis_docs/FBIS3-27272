Premier Lien noted that President Li's unofficial visit is of positive significance to prosperity and progress in Southeast Asia. The premier also instructed ministries to compile the results and cooperation plans achieved during the tour and assign them to ministries for implementation. Yuan Tung has filed the following report: [Begin Yuan recording] Foreign Minister Chien Fu; Hsiao Wan-chang, Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning Development [CEPD], and (?Tai Yue-ming), deputy secretary general and spokesman of the Presidential Office, made reports or offered explanations of President Li's unofficial visit at the 17 February regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. Premier Lien Chan said: The President's visit is indeed very fruitful. (?Wu Chung-li), deputy director of the Government Information Office [GIO], relayed Premier Lien Chan's comments: [Begin (?Wu) recording] Taiwan does not have official diplomatic ties with the three countries. The visit is, therefore, historic. This is particularly so in view of the deteriorating diplomatic situation our nation has faced in the past decade or more. The tour represents a rare feat. [end (?Wu) recording] Premier Lien also pointed out: The themes of President Li's tour were peace, progress, and prosperity and its principal goal is to promote the common welfare in the region. It will have a positive impact on development in the Asian-Pacific region as a whole. GIO deputy director (?Wu) relayed Premier Lien Chan's instructions: [Begin (?Wu) recording] Our main goals are to promote the common interest and welfare of the region. Every country or individual that genuinely cares about that region should support such an idea. For this reason, Premier Lien commented, it is hard to understand why the Chinese Communists voiced objections. The premier said regional cooperation and ties of this kind are conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. Under the themes of peace, progress, and prosperity, the countries concerned in Southeast Asia can help one another and obtain many cooperation projects through bilateral or multilateral cooperation. Once the foreign ministry and CEPD compile the list of cooperation projects and sort out the opportunities and plans, the work can be divided up among the ministries and commissions concerned for implementation. [end (?Wu) recording] Premier Lien also thanked the countries and heads of state that accorded hearty hospitality to President Li. He also thanked the personnel of the foreign ministry and CEPD for their hard work in connection with the trip. [end Yuan recording]
