Over the past few days, Iraq's Kurdistan has witnessed bloody clashes and conflicts sparked by heavy attacks launched by Jalal Talabani's group against the Muslim Kurdish Movement. Through these hostilities are commonplace in Northern Iraq, the bloodshed in the past several days has been too violent and horrendous even by Iraqi standards. Despite all these atrocities in northern Iraq, the Western mass media have been suspiciously silent. In fact, taking advantage of the post-Persian Gulf War conditions, the West strives to promote "ethnic nationalism" aimed at paving the way for the dismemberment of the regional countries. To reach this goal, the West is manipulating the weakest link in the area's security chain, namely the Kurds. In the first phase, the West set forth the issue of "the Kurdish Parliament," and in the second stage it put forward the concept of "the Kurdish government." To this end, the West made utmost use of Iraq's current confused political climate. In view of the West's hatred of Saddam Husayn, their next move will be to promote the recognition of this self-proclaimed "Kurdish government". A plot of profound depth and breadth is thus in the offing, namely, the creation of a new Israel in the region possessing the Karkuk oil resources which can seriously jeopardize the territorial integrity of all the regional countries. With time racing ahead, the massacre of the Muslim Kurds by Talabani's group should serve as a serious warning to all concerned parties. Actually, this signifies that Talabani and his group have been designated to be in charge of enforcing this plot, and recent massacres prove that they are ready to go to any length and to commit any crime in order to bring this sinister plot to fruition. Consequently, co-operation between Iran and Turkey, as the pivotal core of a coalition, is called for to thwart this Western ploy. Alongside this collaboration, the two should also consult with Iraq and Syria. In recent years Saddam's regime has meted out a great deal of oppression to the Iraqi Kurds. It should, however, be borne in mind that all Iraqis have been subjected to oppression. But this does not necessarily mean that the Iraqi Shiites, for example, will opt for dismemberment of Iraq. Today, the conspiracy to dismember Iraq's Kurdistan stands out as a serious peril, therefore, providing moral, political, or material support to these groups by Turkey and Syria cannot be justified, and in this regard convening of an extraordinary meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Syria is called for at this time.
