It has been known in advance that the second round of voting will in no way shift the balance of forces established after the first round of voting held on December 19, because only 0.5 percent of the voters were asked to cast their ballots for the second time. In the 250-seat parliament, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) headed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic retained its 123 seats (49.2 percent). The Democratic Movement of Serbia (Depos), a coalition of five opposition parties headed by Leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement Vuk Draskovic, is second with 45 seats (18 percent), and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Seselj third with 39 seats (15.6 percent). They are followed by the Democratic Party (DS) which won 29 seats (11.6 percent) and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) with seven seats (2.8 percent). The Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the party of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina, won five seats. A coalition of the Party for Democratic Activity and the Democratic Party of Albanians won two seats in Leskovac in southern Serbia. The ethnic Albanian minority boycotted the election in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, where they are the majority population. The republican polling board said that 4,300,440 of Serbia's 7,010,389 registered voters had turned at the polls, and that 1,576,287 of them supported the Socialists and 2,168,467 the opposition. President of the republican polling board Caslav Ignjatovic said that the new parliament should be constituted within the next 20 days, or by January 28 at the latest. [Word indistinct] Vice-President Goran Percevic said on Saturday that the results of the early parliamentary election in which the socialists had scored a convincing victory would enable the forming of a stable government in the republic of Serbia. Seaking for the local radio in Jagodina, he said, however, that the SPS had not yet discussed the possible variants of one-party (Socialist) and multi-party governments. It goes without saying that the Socialists would like to see a government capable of dealing with the issues of vital importance for the citizens of Serbia while the U.N. economic embargo is in force and of coming out with a programme of social and economic reconstruction after the international blockade has been lifted, said Percevic.
