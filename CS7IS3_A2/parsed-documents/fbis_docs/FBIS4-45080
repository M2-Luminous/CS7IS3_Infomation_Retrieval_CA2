The official asserted that no one was more aware than India of its own regional security concerns and claimed that India had never agreed to discuss them in any multilateral talks. This clear enunciation of the Indian position came on the eve of the Prime Minister's arrival in the U.S. capital. The Clinton administration, however, believes that both India and Pakistan have in principle agreed to multilateral talks on non-proliferation, arms control and regional security and has said so in its latest report to the U.S. Congress. However, it admitted that some important differences remain on the issue. The Indian official suggested that it was jumping the gun to talk of details such as the number of countries that should participate in the multilateral talks or about whether the direction of the talks was global or regional. He claimed that India had not even agreed to the concept of the multilateral talks. The official was asked whether India had not created the impressions in the three bilateral rounds of talks with the United States that it was agreeable to multilateral talks on non-proliferation. He replied that if such an impression had been created, and he was not sure whether this need had been the case, then it was erroneous. He suggested that it was not India's position to opt for a regional non-proliferation solution. The official admitted that the issues of non-proliferation, arms control and regional security that the United States was raising came together in the case of Jammu and Kashmir. However, he dismissed out of hand the U.S. assessment that Kashmir could be a flashpoint for nuclear war between India and Pakistan. The official said that it was not entirely correct to suggest that India had problems with the United States only vis-a-vis the political relationship between the two countries. On the economic side too there were some critical issues to be discussed, he said. If the United States wanted access to the India market, so did India want access to U.S. market and there were problems of access involved in that. Issues relating to intellectual property rights, the use of Special 301 provision of the U.S. trade law, the question of high technology exports and the movement of Indian software personnel remained some thorny issues that needed to be sorted out, he said. The official was mapping the broad range of political and economic issues that would come up in discussions between Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The State Department spokesman in his regular briefing on Monday reiterated the U.S. expectation that the non-proliferation issue would certainly be discussed by the two leaders. "The President certainly expects to have a discussion that would cover a full range of subjects with the Prime Minister and those which include our shared concerns of a global nature, it would include issues about non-proliferation and regional security issues that we raise and discuss with the government of India and others on a regular basis." Meetings preparatory to the one between Rao and Clinton have been going on between Indian and U.S. officials. Last Friday, Indian Ambassador Siddartha Shankar Ray met Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in what was described as "an organisational, technical meeting." Asked about the significance of the meeting with Lynn Davis, an Indian official said that she had sought the meeting with the Foreign Secretary but that nothing special was expected to be discussed with her. The meeting it was suggested would be more in the nature of her getting to know the Indian Foreign Secretary whom she has not met as yet.
