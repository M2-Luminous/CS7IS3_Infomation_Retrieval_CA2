FR940822-1-00038 FR940822-1-00006 Public Participation in the Decommissioning Process The Commission believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions at a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed rule will provide for public participation in the decommissioning process through three mechanisms in addition to the relevant NRC requirements regarding hearing opportunities for a particular site. Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release of a site pursuant to §20.1405, or whenever the Commission deems such notice to be in the public interest, the Commission shall: (1) Notify and solicit comments from local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning; (2) Publish a notice in the Federal Register as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of the site; and (3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action. These provisions are designed to provide affected individuals and organizations with both information about the proposed decommissioning and an opportunity to provide comments on the licensee's proposal. The Commission believes it is particularly important to provide notice in a forum that is accessible to local individuals. This forum may vary from site to site but would usually include providing notice to local media for publication. For decommissioning where the licensee does not propose to meet the conditions for unrestricted release, the proposed rule would require that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) as described in §20.1407 for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The purpose of the SSAB would be to provide recommendations to the licensee on: (1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to a level necessary to comply with the provisions of §20.1404 which are technically achievable, would not be prohibitively expensive, and would not result in net public or environmental harm; (2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will: (a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year; (b) Be enforceable; and (c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties. (3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. The areas in which the SSAB would be expected to provide recommendations parallel the areas that a licensee must address as part of its proposal for a restricted termination of license. The intent of the provision is to provide a mechanism for early public involvement in the development of the decommissioning plan for the site. To the extent that local public involvement may be vital to the successful implementation of land use restrictions, involvement of representatives of local government, affected citizens, Native Americans, and other interested parties in the Site-Specific Advisory Board is important to the long-term effectiveness of the decommissioning action. In order for the participation to be most effective, it should come during the development of the plan, rather than as comment after the licensee has spent significant resources to develop its proposal. Hence, the recommendations of the SSAB are to be included in the decommissioning plan along with the licensee's disposition of those recommendations. It is important to note that the opportunity for comment provisions would still be applicable even when a SSAB had been used in the development of the decommissioning plan. Site-Specific Advisory Board The SSAB has been patterned after the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Dialog Committee (FFERDC) entitled ``Recommendations For Improving the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Decision-Making and Priority Setting Processes, February 1993,'' which is a consensus document developed by over 40 members of a committee chartered by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The diverse members of the FFERDC represented Federal, Tribal, State, environmental, labor, and citizen interests. It is designed to respond to the desire expressed by many workshop commenters that local affected parties have early and substantive input into the decommissioning process on a site-specific basis. The SSAB would supplement and not supplant existing NRC procedures that provide for public input into the regulatory process. The Commission believes that increasing the opportunity for early public involvement in the decommissioning process is an effective way to provide an information exchange and to ensure credible and defensible licensing decisions, especially when the long-term effectiveness of the land use restrictions may depend on community knowledge and involvement in their development and application. The Commission would emphasize that the operation of the SSAB is not intended to usurp the traditional land use authority of the local or State government. In fact, many of the institutional controls that may be recommended by an SSAB to ensure the restricted use of a site will depend on the exercise of this traditional authority by the local or State government. Licensee notification to the Commission of intent to decommission in accordance with §§30.36(b), 40.42(b), 50.82(a), 70.38(b) or 72.54 would have to specify whether the licensee intends to reduce residual radioactivity at the site to levels which would allow the site to be released for unrestricted use. If not, the licensee would be required to submit a plan for establishing and supporting an SSAB with the notification. The licensee would be responsible for establishing the SSAB and developing appropriate ground rules and operating procedures for the SSAB with the advice of the SSAB. The SSAB would consist of about 10 members plus an ex officio representative from the Commission. This number of members is expected to allow for adequate representation of affected parties without allowing the group to become so large that it cannot perform its function effectively. The licensee would be required to provide adequate administrative support for SSAB activities and provide the SSAB access to studies and analyses pertinent to the proposed decommissioning. Membership of the SSAB, to the extent that representatives are willing to participate, would have to: (1) Reflect the fullest practical range of interests in the affected community and region and be composed primarily of individuals who could be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site, and (2) Include representatives from the licensee; local and State governments; workers; persons residing in the vicinity of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and public interest groups; and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty of statutory rights that could be affected. Meetings of the SSAB would be open to the public. The licensee would be required to provide adequate public notice of the location, time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least 2 weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB would become part of the decommissioning docket, and would be available for public inspection. In most cases it is expected that the work of the SSAB would be completed after it had formally submitted its advice to the licensee. However, there may be some cases (e.g., where the licensee's plan is substantially altered following NRC review) in which the SSAB may have a continuing role in providing advice to the licensee. In any case, it is anticipated that the SSAB would be dissolved after the license has been terminated. The Commission is seeking comment on whether there are situations where it might be inappropriate or infeasible to establish an SSAB under conditions set forth in §20.1406(b). For example, are there situations where establishment of an SSAB would be inconsistent with other governmental regulations and statutes, or are there circumstances in which local government officials may not be allowed to participate in privately funded advisory groups. If so, what alternatives would be available to satisfy the objectives of public participation and input? Should criteria be incorporated in the regulation for granting exemptions to the requirements of §20.1406(b) for good cause. If so, what criteria might be appropriate? The Commission is also seeking comment on what the content of descriptive information on membership, size, operating procedures, administrative support, and distribution of agendas should include, and whether this information should be included in the rule or in a regulatory guide or other document.
