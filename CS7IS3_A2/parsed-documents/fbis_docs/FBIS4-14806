Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has begun in the Kremlin. Greeting his guest, Yeltsin said that the world situation had changed during the past two years. Blocs ceased to exist, and for this reason "the role of the United Nations organisations became absolutely different." The president explained that "the U.N. has become more active of late, and its role in settling some controversial problems has been enhanced." Yeltsin intends to discuss with Butrus Butrus-Ghali the key problems dealing with the functioning of the U.N. and with the work of the Security Council. They may touch upon other problems, including a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis.
