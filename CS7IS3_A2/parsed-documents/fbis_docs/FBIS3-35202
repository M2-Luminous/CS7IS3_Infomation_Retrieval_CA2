As my first question, I would like to ask why various efforts to solve the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina have failed to achieve a satisfactory result in the last 23 months, while all involved parties claim to want to solve the problem in a fair way? [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Greetings to dear viewers. I would like to mention that this is not the case. Not all sides involved in the resolution of the Bosnian issue are well-intentioned in the search to find an honorable solution to that complicated and painful problem. Therefore, we witness stagnation, deadlock, slowness, seeking excuses and obstructionism in the process of the work related to the establishment of peace and stability in Bosnia. Specifically the influential members of the Security Council, in various forms and degrees of strength, oppose the establishment of an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. And that is an issue which can be clearly said today. In the past, it was assumed, on the basis of the available analysis, that some influential members of the United Nations, and specifically in the Security Council, would stop, in various forms and degrees of strength, the formation of that Islamic country in the heart of Europe in any way they can. That is the reality of the case. What you can see, which can be described in general as obstructionism toward the establishment of an honorable and fair peace, is caused by that ideology which dominates the Security Council and particularly its permanent members. [Correspondent] In the same connection we witness that the Security Council -- to which you specifically referred -- prevents the efforts of the effective members of the ICO. What is the reason for that? [Velayati] As I said the reasoning for that is the same as the reply to the first question. Islamic countries, according to a state of sympathy that exists in the world of Islam toward the fate of Muslims, adopted very clear and forthright stances in support of Bosnia. Today if an Islamic government exists which seeks to act differently to that it will face the pressure of its public opinion. Therefore, you see a solidarity among all the ICO members -- which number 52. That is 52 ICO member states are unanimous in the belief that the Bosnian problem must be resolved in an honorable and just manner; the aggressions and brutalities of the Serbs and Croats against the Muslims must be terminated; and human rights -- in its true sense -- must be observed in Bosnia. But we know, and we have experienced for many years, that some Western countries use the words human rights as a political weapon to advance their objectives. If they wish to put pressure on a country, they do it by using the human rights lever. But they themselves determine the criteria for human rights. Even if we seek to raise another issue within the framework of human rights by using those very criteria that they have determined themselves, they will oppose that method if it does not suit their political interests. In other words, they use differing standards when judging and making decisions on a single issue in the world. That is, double standards in international forums -- resulting from the influence exerted by influential states -- is quite obvious. You know that, for instance, the U.S. Government has been asked repeatedly to send its troops to Bosnia under the UN flag to prevent the Serbs' aggression -- and even the UN secretary general has made such a request recently -- but the Americans have so far abstained from such a thing. Whereas you see that in Kuwait and Somalia they themselves were the axis for implementing UN decisions. But in the case of Bosnia they have said bluntly that their national interests do not warrant such a thing. [Correspondent] Yes. Just today there were reports saying that the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia has requested 3,000 reinforcements which in practice would be from America but America has failed to agree. [Velayati] Yes. Some American officials had already said they would do no such a thing since their national interests do not warrant it. Thus you see that they interpret human rights according to their national interests, or to be more clear, their personal interests. That is, if you see the Americans intervene somewhere -- under the pretext of supporting human rights, supporting humanitarian aspirations and peace -- it will be nothing but a deception because they do not intervene in similar scenarios where that detracts from their political interests. And they even may prevent intervention by those whose really intend to establish justice. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You have pointed to the Nonaligned Movement, the ICO, and the latter's liaison group. Now why is it that the UN Security Council has called on NATO to act despite the fact that countries such as Iran have repeatedly announced their readiness to send troops? Is this a European and a Christian decision in connection with the formation of an Islamic government in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Velayati] In reality the Security Council which is under the rule of the permanent members of the Council, and more specifically under the rule of the western permanent members of the Council, seriously prevents the international scene from slipping away from the supervision and decisionmaking domain of these limited and influential members of the Security Council. It is in fact a form of coercion. On the surface the United Nations and the Security Council were formed after World War II to defend justice and keep security and peace. The UN Charter is in fact to guard and strengthen peace in an honorable and just fashion across the world and to propagate peaceful ideals. However the foundations are such that the international scene is under the yoke of several influential and powerful countries of the Security Council. They think that if they respond positively to requests by Islamic or third world countries and allow them to defend justice under the UN flag and according to UN charter, a part of the international situation may slip from their hands and the Bosnian situation could develop in a way that might not be in their interests. To conclude my answer to your question I repeat and emphasize the answer given to the earlier questions. The pretext of action by some western countries within the UN context is to seek peace and justice. However the content of their actions is in fact an effort toward maintaining the interests of the countries on whose behalf they are active in the United Nations. As you pointed out, despite the declaration of Islamic countries in the Pakistan summit and the repeated emphasis in the recent Geneva summit as well as repeated emphasis in the liaison group of the Islamic Conference in Jakarta -- which was held during the nonaligned meeting -- stating the preparation of the Islamic countries, at least the several countries that had announced readiness, to send 20,000 fully equipped troops to Bosnia under the full supervision of the UN, so as to leave no doubt, we have not yet received a positive response form the UN secretary general. This is despite the fact that the secretary general and the Security Council repeatedly emphasize that there is a need for more peacekeeping troops to guard peace and the security of the besieged people of Bosnia. But they only ask some particular countries. You have pointed this out. They have asked the Americans to send 3,000 troops. Americans have not sent them. France and Holland said they will be not sending more. Well if they are short of troops and some UN members are prepared to send troops to the region to serve under the control of the UN commander, why are they not responding positively to this proposal by Islamic countries? We can then conclude that the UN Security Council is under the influence of several particular countries. And since these countries only see and wish to keep their own interests in the world, even to the cost of other countries, they try to keep the international situation under their own control. Thus they oppose other countries which even might wish to send troops with all sincerity. [Correspondent] The NATO deadline to the Serbs ends Sunday night. NATO's intended deadline and action are not very reliable and permanent because they are limited to areas surrounding Sarajevo and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to a particular distance, but is it possible to predict the NATO action? [Velayati] Their ultimatum is not very strong and no firm decision has been made. They have asked the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons 20 kilometers from where they are. We do not really know what this would solve in Bosnia's complex situation. That they have been told to withdraw their heavy weapons means light weapons are alright. And the formation of the Serb military forces around Sarajevo is such that they can aim with light weapons at the innocent people of Sarajevo with ease. Furthermore there are no plans for other Bosnian towns besieged by Serbs and Croats. There are also differences between NATO members over the implementation of the ultimatum. Even if we imagine that they resolve their differences and take action after the 10 days, it would be less an effective practical action and more a propaganda measure for some western countries which want to say that they are seeking peace and justice in Bosnia. Even if they take action, for example by bombing Serb positions, it would not be determining in the Bosnian situation. It would only be a propaganda measure in favor of countries making the decisions in NATO and a tool to silence the protest of people who of are fed up with this injustice. [Correspondent] Dr. Velayati, this may seem a general question, but what is the solution to the Bosnian problem? [Velayati] It seems to be very simple, but they do not want to see the implementation of a clear solution. Bosnia is an accepted UN member. According to the UN Charter, if the territorial integrity of a UN member country is threatened, it is the responsibility of the United Nations to defend that country's territorial integrity. That is to help the people of that country to safeguard their territorial integrity. Second if an act of aggression takes place against a country and genocide takes place, it is the duty of the United Nations to stop the genocide. Thirdly a number of resolutions were finally issued in support of Bosnia due to the public pressure. It is the duty of the United Nations to implement those resolutions. Therefore the solution to the problem of Bosnia is that the UN Security Council, which is responsible for safeguarding peace and security in the world, should act, within the UN framework, and seriously take the necessary measures to end the aggression and bestial acts of the Serbs and Croats against Bosnia which is an independent country and a UN member. It should also stop the continuation of the genocide. It should also implement the UN approvals. I mentioned earlier that the United Nations is dominated by double standards and you can see that in the way the Iraqi people were treated. Look at the situation that Iraq finds itself in today. A country with massive resources and a long history. An important Islamic and Arab country. We have left the Iraqi Government alone; but what sin have the Iraqi people committed? Those people have really been devastated under the the pretext of carrying out the decisions of the UN Security Council. The same disaster was wreaked on the Somali people. But regarding Bosnia they procrastinate somewhat. Today, Bosnia's main problem is the indecision and incompetence of the United Nations. That is, even if just one of the influential members of the Security Council does not wish one serious action to be undertaken in the international arena it is able to carry out that wish. That is the United Nations's shortcoming. That is, it is sufficient for an influential Security Council member to veto a decision. It ties the UN hands, even if under that veto the worst crimes occur in a spot in the world. Just like it has in the Bosnian case! More than 200,000 of the Bosnians, most of whom, almost all of whom were ordinary people and civilians -- women, children, young and old. They became martyrs through the continuation of the Serbs' crimes there. And hundreds of thousands became refugees. They are living a harsh life, in the heart of Europe and under the eyes of the UN observers. You see that the Serbs have deployed their mortars, their artillery, and any time they wish they kill the ordinary people who are passing through the street for shopping. Human rights are being violated and trampled on so blatantly over there and no serious objection is forthcoming among the European communities. We return to the first part of our discussion. If you wish to know my understanding, it can be summarized in one word [as heard]. Those people are Muslims and wish to have a country where they can live in peace and tranquillity, just like the rest of the world nations. This reactionary idea continues to dominate in some Western communities that in practice they oppose some of the European people -- who have another religion -- having an independent state. [Correspondent] Dr. Velayati, once again I thank you for your trouble in taking part in this program. [Velayati] I thank you as well.
