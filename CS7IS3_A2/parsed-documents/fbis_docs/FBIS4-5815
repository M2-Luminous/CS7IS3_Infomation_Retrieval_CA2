FBIS4-5815 "dreas072_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea ROK Denounced for Rejecting Liaison Proposal ROK Denounced for Rejecting Liaison Proposal SK1404061594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1223 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1404061594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1223 GMT 13 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Unreasonable Act That Revealed the True Antidialogue and Antireunification Nature"] [Text] As was already reported, a joint conference of the republic's government, political parties, and social organizations was held in Pyongyang on 11 April to reunify the fatherland through unity of the whole nation by highly upholding the banner of great national unity. The issue of promoting the country's independent and peaceful reunification by thoroughly fulfilling the 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for the fatherland's reunification put forth by Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our people, was discussed at the joint conference. It was initiated at the joint conference that by putting the nation's interest in the forefront, all the people of the North, South, and overseas must most of all convene a historical national conference in either Pyongyang or Seoul to provide a measure for great national unity at around 15 August which is one year before the 50th anniversary of the fatherland's liberation, to open the doors for the country's independent and peaceful reunification by uniting as one. We decided to send a letter courteously putting forth such a proposal to the South Korean authorities, as well as to political parties, organizations, individual figures, and fellow countrymen overseas. However, since the South side said that it could not receive such a letter, giving unreasonable excuses, it was necessary for us to broadcast the letter. Such a measure by the South Korean authorities is indeed an act of betrayal, throwing a wet blanket over the will and demand of all the Korean people's consistent desire for the country's reunification. There is no greater responsibility and important matter of concern than realizing the country's reunification in the nineties for its 70 million people. Whether in the North, South, or overseas, our people today are saying that we can no longer live separated. They thus cry out for the country's reunification. Amid this kind of trend of the times, conscientious politicians and figures from all walks of life in South Korea have recently begun openly expressing their will to visit Pyongyang for the nation's reconciliation and reunification. If the letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations, individual figures, and overseas fellow countrymen is delivered to such parties and the joint conference of the republic's government, political parties, and social organizations, and the representatives meet at one place, it is clear that this itself will be a historical opportunity to provide a great turning point in the nation's reconciliation and unity. However, the South Korean authorities object even to receiving our letter, which is filled with the patriotic will for reunification. Where can a greater antinational and antireunification act as this be found? The South Korean authorities' unreasonable act leaves much room to prove that traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise that priority must be given to the nation and that he will whole-heartedly concentrate on the nation's reconciliation and reunification, is filled with falsehood and hypocrisy. The new operation 5027, a plan to attack our republic, which has been kept a secret by the South Korean puppets, has now been made public, and they are showing moves to drag in much murderous equipment, such as Patriot missiles from the United States, and resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. This means that our nation must achieve great unity at this time more than at any other time to prevent the danger of a nuclear war. In this kind of situation, our people must solve problems facing the nation under the banner of great national unity and from the principle of national independence. If this is to be achieved, the will and demands of the 70 million people must all focus on the great cause for the fatherland's reunification, and private-level dialogue must be activated so that it can spread to a pannational level. Nevertheless, like the examples of preceding dictators, the South Korean Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is insisting on a single channel of dialogue as usual, is monopolizing reunification dialogue, and is preventing the broad masses from participating in the reunification dialogue from various aspects. Such antidialogue and antireunification maneuvers by the South Korean puppets will by no means be tolerated. The South Korean puppets once again rejected our just proposal. This once again clearly shows that they are in reality the ones who have no interest in dialogue and reunification and that they are splittists pursuing only confrontation and war. Such an act betraying the nation by the South Korean authorities can no longer be tolerated. If the South Korean authorities continue to move toward the road of antidialogue and antireunification while rejecting all the Korean people's desire and will consistently demanding the country's reunification, they will receive the people's severe judgment without fail.
