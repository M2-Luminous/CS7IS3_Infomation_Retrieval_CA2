For the first time the income of the countryfolk has increased that of the city residents which is due to the privatization of cattle carried out in the countryside. The standard level is higher in the countryside but the structure of the foodstuffs does not meet to physiological normatives. For example the consumption of meat, rice, porridges, sweets, vegetables and butter and vegetable oil per one rural person is lower the required standards by from 30 per cent to 2 fold. But the consumption of flour and bakeries is higher and as for milk and dairy produce is quite near the standards.
