FBIS4-10893 "drlat075_j_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Panama Endara Justifies Release of Video Montage Endara Justifies Release of Video Montage PA1904034094 PA1904034094 BFN [Editorial report] Panama City TVN Television Network in Spanish at 0109 GMT on 19 April, during its "Dialogue" program, broadcasts a live or recorded interview with Panamanian President Guillermo Endara by host Luz Maria Noli from its studio in Panama City. Endara begins by responding to why he released a video montage of footage taken during the Noriega regime. He says: "Past government actions are one of the first things open for discussion in every political campaign." At 0114 GMT, when asked whether more videos will be presented, Endara says: "At this time, I see no reason for airing any more videos. I would gladly air more, however, if it is regarded as advisable." At 0120 GMT Endara, commenting on the controversy following the airing of his video montage, says: "I was unaware this announcement would create such repercussions. I confess that I am often spontaneous in my actions." He goes on to say: "I did not want to create an expectation. I think these videos have a great historical importance, at least that is how I felt when I received the videotapes on 5 April, only a few days ago." He adds: "I am convinced I made the right decision, and I believe the people should know about this. I could not hide this from the people. I believe it was my patriotic duty to do it; it was a president's duty. I did not do it for political reasons but, rather, because I wanted the truth to be known just as I saw it on 5 April." At 0128 GMT Noli asks Endara if the videos are the property of the state or were received from a friendly government. Endara replies: "No. These have nothing to with the famous boxes in the hands of the U.S. Army." He goes on to say: "No, they have nothing to do with those 15,000 boxes. These video cassettes were in the Presidential Palace the day I assumed office; they were there. I knew about them, but did not pay much attention to them. I completely forgot they were there. Truly, it was not until recently that I realized they were there. I just recently became aware I had known they were there for a long time, but I never took them into consideration." At 0134 GMT Endara remarks on from where those videos came, saying: "A few months ago, three or four months ago--I really cannot remember how long ago--a Presidency official asked me for permission to review the videos. I told him: You have much work to do. Just stick to your work and forget those video cassettes. The official addressed me again a few days later, saying: Mr. President, I have a group of very serious people who would like to review the cassettes. We will review them in our spare time. Will you allow us to do so? I really wanted to tell him no, as I had done previously, but I said to myself: Well, let them see the videos if they are going to do so in their off-duty hours. Thus, I authorized them to do so. They reviewed the videos. They reviewed some of the videos, because I do not think they could have reviewed them all. As a result, on 5 April, they brought me an edited cassette containing most of the scenes seen by everybody today. This was when, for the first time in all my administration, I realized the importance of those video cassettes. I thought it was truly inconsequential to review those cassettes, but I was very wrong." At 0138 GMT Noli asks Endara what the objective of his airing the video montage was. Endara responds: "My fundamental goal, and which I hope to have fulfilled, was to report to the people facts I could not keep concealed. I could not be an accomplice or an accessory to those facts. I had to make them known, because I think the theory that the past is not a subject of political debate is completely wrong." At 0146 GMT Endara says: "I did not do this to benefit one candidate or to harm another. I did it because I had to. The political effect has nothing to do with my decision. I did consider it because I knew it would have a political effect. I considered it but did not do so due to the political effect it would have. I did it because I had to and for the reasons I just explained. If it benefits young candidate Ruben Blades, well, so be it. What can we do? I did not do it for that reason. It does not bother me to know it might have benefited someone. It does bother me to know it hurt someone, but then, someone had to get hurt." At 0153 GMT the network breaks away from the interview to a live last-minute report on the Justice and Peace commission issuing a statement on the video montage. The network then returns to the Endara interview at 0159 GMT. At 0208 GMT Endara comments on his partiality toward the presidential candidates, saying: "I never pledged to be impartial. I have with me a copy of the speech I delivered at the time, and nowhere does it say I must be impartial. Allow me to read just a few lines: I must point out and accept that all, or at least the majority of those of us who are here--and they were the government-- are politicians, belong to political parties, have our preferences and sympathies, and profess political creeds and doctrines." At 0212 GMT, when asked if he would give up power if the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, wins the 8 May elections, Endara says: "If on 8 May--I state it now clearly and emphatically, as I have told all the members of my cabinet and friends and, in particular, the Public Force--Perez Balladares and the PRD win the elections, I will not only rightfully turn over power to him on 1 September but will even try to do something that has never occurred in Panama: I will establish a transition period. I pledge that the day after the elections, I will invite the winning candidate, either male or female, to the Presidency to begin a transition period. I want the incoming president who assumes office on 1 September to enjoy what I did not have. I did not have a transition period." At 0218 GMT Endara concludes his remarks, at which time the network concludes its broadcast.
