"Japan would, as a matter of course, do what it can in response to (UN) sanctions if there is anything it cannot do because of lack of legislation," Hata said in answering questions before the House of Representatives Budget Committee. The remarks referred to the possibility of emergency legislation to enable Japan to participate in possible sanctions against Pyongyang, which are likely to include blocking of sea routes. Hata ruled out the possibility that Tokyo may resort to force, saying Japan will act within the framework of its war-renouncing constitution in a case of collective security under the UN banner. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same Diet committee session that it is impossible to give a wholesale answer on how Japan would deal with a collective security case, saying a variety of situations could arise, such as calls for Japan to join UN peacekeeping operations or future UN forces.
