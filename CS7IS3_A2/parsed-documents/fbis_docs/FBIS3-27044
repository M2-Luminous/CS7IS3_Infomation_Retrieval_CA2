In 1993, people throughout Tibet, under the regional party committee's correct leadership and guided by the goal of building a new socialist market economic system, made every effort to carry out reform and promote development. We focused on attention on the following five projects: 1. We strove to emancipate our minds and heighten our sense of urgency to develop the economy. Following the Fourth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Regional Party Committee, we launched all kinds of sizable discussions throughout Tibet about the need to emancipate our minds and change our mindset. We also sent groups of different sizes to other parts of the country to study their experiences. As a result of studying the instructions and guidelines as well as the discussions and visits, our cadres and masses have explored new ways of thinking, broaden their visions, and realized the big gap between our economic development and that in other parts of the country. Our awareness of the need to speed up reform, opening up, and economic development has heightened noticeably. At the same time, we have discovered Tibet's potential and strengths for economic development. Consequently our confidence and courage of developing our productive forces and revitalizing Tibet's economy heightened noticeably, and our enthusiasm of making plans for launching development projects, building markets, and setting up businesses soared with each passing day. An environment highly favorable for economic construction began to take shape in Tibet. 2. Guided by the goal of building a socialist market economic system, we made constant efforts to intensify reform. First, we firmly gave our enterprises their operating autonomy and strove to improve the environment for their production and operations by fully implementing the State Council's Regulations for Changing the Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises and the regional government's procedures for implementing those regulations. Second, we restructured the systems governing planning, registration of enterprises, and setting prices. That was a major step we took on our way to establish a socialist market economic system. Third, we adopted various ways to establish and improve our market system. Through borrowing money from banks, raising capital ourselves, and forming partnership, all our prefectures and cities established many markets for trading agricultural products, livestocks, and industrial goods. This has enlivened the economy and provided the needed services for city and rural dwellers to improve their livelihood. Fourth, we drew up the necessary policies needed to encourage and support the development of independent and private business. 3. We broadened the scope for opening wider to the outside world as well as all channels for bringing in resources from other parts of the country and establishing ties with the outside world. First of all, we put an end to the situation where foreign trade enterprises could monopolize the business, encouraged and supported all types of enterprises to take part in ocean-going trade [yuan yang mao yi] and border trade. By launching these programs, our enterprises have diversified their business, and more people have come to know how to conduct foreign trade. Secondly, we set our minds in motion, broadened our vision, and broadly promoted Tibet's economic partnerships with other provinces and foreign countries. Taking advantage of the various channels, all prefectures, cities, and enterprises in Tibet succeeded in bringing in resources from the outside world and establishing partnership projects with counterparts elsewhere in the country. In 1993, Tibet officially approved more than 40 projects of bringing in outside resources and establishing partnerships with other parts of the country. These projects amounted to negotiated investments of 67.11 million yuan and $9.63 million. Third, by encouraging enterprises to invest in other parts of the country, we merged Tibet's rich resources with the markets and technological strengths in other parts of the country. A pattern for Tibet to open itself to all directions began to take shape. 4. Tibet succeeded in building its infrastructure -- especially those projects relevant to the development of energy resources and communications and telecommunications services. In 1993, the region invested 1.59 billion yuan in fixed assets, topping that of the preceding year by 15 percent. Compared with those projects accomplished in the past, the quality and progress of all priority projects were better and faster. 5. We ensured a healthy economic development by intensifying and improving macroscopic regulation and control. Last year, basing on the guidelines in the No. 6 Document issued by the Central Committee and in view of Tibet's reform and development problems, we adoped a series of effective measures to intensify and improve Tibet's macroscopic regulation and control. First of all, to put banking affairs in order, we corrected various lawless interbanking lending businesses and unruly money raising conduct. By the end of last year, banking departments in Tibet had recovered more than 200 million yuan of day-to-day loans, or more than 60 percent of the extended loans; and rejected more than 2.5 million yuan previously approved to be extended to borrowers as their collectively raised funds. Second, we banned all unwarranted levies and fines, and abolished more than 80 of the 1,320 paid services that had been screened. By doing this we have lessened the burdens of enterprises and the masses. Third, we launched a widespread taxation, fiscal, and price inspection and discovered illegal transactions involving 17.8 million yuan. Of this amount, over 2.6 million yuan has already been delivered to the treasury. Because of these measures, we have effectively stopped the massive outflow of capital, ensured the needs of priority projects, tightened financial and economic discipline, protected the interests of enterprises and people in cities and countryside, and brought about a healthy national economic development. The successes achieved in launching these five projects have powerfully expedited Tibet's economic construction. It is estimated that Tibet's GNP will reach 3.65 billion yuan in 1993, or 8.1 percent higher than that of the preceding year when calculated in terms of comparable items. In 1993, Tibet's total agricultural output reached 2.228 billion yuan, or 5.3 percent higher than that of the preceding year; its total industrial output reached 470 million yuan, topping that of the preceding year by 7.8 percent; the region's revenues reached 149 million yuan, topping that of the preceding year by 37 percent; and the average per capita income of peasants and herdsmen reached 515 yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over that of a year before. This shows that Tibet's economic development as a whole has been fast and healthy. The year 1994 is a year crucial for accelerating the pace of building a socialist market economic system. It also is an important year in which Tibet will greet its 30th founding anniversary with outstanding successes of national economic development. To achieve a breakthrough in reforming Tibet's economic system and even better results in developing Tibet's social productive forces during the New Year, the regional people's government recently called a regional economic conference to study the guidelines, general policy, and specific programs for reforming Tibet's economic system -- which will be promulgated one after another for implementation after they have been revised. On the basis of analyzing Tibet's economic development in 1993, the conference also studied and came up with certain major economic development projects for 1994. These projects include: Focusing on increasing the incomes of peasants and herdsmen, Tibet will energetically develop the economy in its agricultural and pastoral areas, strive to explore new areas for economic development, and do what is essential for expanding Tibet's capacity for future economic development. To ensure a smooth reform and economic development, we will continue to stabilize Tibet's political and social situation, promote administrative ethics, provide stronger leadership, improve our style of work, and do a good job in educating the masses. As long as people of all nationalities in Tibet understand the need of reform, support reform, throw themselves in reform, and concentrate their efforts on studying how to develop Tibet's economy -- as they have always been doing -- we certainly can make even greater strides in building a socialist market economic system during the New Year, and we certainly will be able to bring about significant changes when Tibet marks its 30th founding anniversary.
