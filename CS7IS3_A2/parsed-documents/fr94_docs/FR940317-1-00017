SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Temporary Regulations and 26 U.S.C. 7805(e)(1) In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register , the IRS is issuing temporary regulations (Treasury Decision 8533) to implement certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) by section 13251 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). Section 7805(e)(1) of the Code (26 U.S.C. 7805(e)(1)) requires the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever the Secretary issues temporary regulations to allow an opportunity for public comment. The substance of T.D. 8533 is reflected in the proposed amendments to sections 1.6662&hyph;1 through 1.6662&hyph;4. The Internal Revenue Service presently intends to revise §§1.6662&hyph;1 through 1.6662&hyph;4 in response to taxpayers' comments on the proposed regulations and does not presently intend to finalize §1.6662&hyph;7T. Background These proposed regulations set forth certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the Code by section 13251 of OBRA 1993. These changes eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and raised the disclosure standard for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or regulations (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and a substantial understatement of income tax (section 6662(b)(2) of the Code) from ``not frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' See section 13251 of OBRA 1993 and H. Rep. No. 213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 669 (1993) (the Conference Report). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 indicates that this ``reasonable basis'' standard is a relatively high standard of tax reporting that is significantly higher than the ``not frivolous'' disclosure standard previously applicable to taxpayers under section 6662 of the Code and currently applicable to preparers under section 6694 of the Code. See Conference Report, at p. 669. A position is not frivolous if it is not ``patently improper.'' See §1.6694&hyph;2(c)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations and current §1.6662&hyph;3(b)(3). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 also provides that the reasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a position that is merely arguable or merely a colorable claim. See Conference Report, at p.669. In addition to adopting the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy to avoid the disregard and substantial understatement penalties, Congress adopted the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a return position must satisfy to avoid the negligence penalty. See Conference Report at p.669. Treasury requests comments on how the new reasonable basis standard should be defined for purposes of the negligence, disregard, and substantial understatement penalties.
