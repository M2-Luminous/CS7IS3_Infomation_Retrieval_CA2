But it turns out that our own special services do not always allow wrongdoers to cross the state border freely. As transpired just the other day, back in March. Showing exceptional vigilance, staffers from the Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] St. Petersburg Directorate's Antiterrorist Service arrested a group of people intending to sell more than three kilograms of highly enriched uranium dioxide (Yevgeniy Lukin, chief of the St. Petersburg FCS Public Relations Directorate, reported that the mole fraction of the uranium-235 in the mixture of isotopes was 90 percent). The FCS believes that this time too the stolen uranium-235 was destined for foreign buyers. In February St. Petersburg's counterintelligence officers received their first information on the planned deal. In order to locate all uranium storage sites and not miss a single gram of this strategic raw material, the FCS operatives "played along" with the dealers and rounded up all those involved in March. They confiscated 3.05 kg of uranium powder, which had been stored in a half-liter glass jar and metal flask -- the dealers were clearly not too worried about their own health. But that is not the most important point. The fact is that until recently most of the "unorganized" traders in radioactive material (one of the people arrested turned out to be a butcher, another was a plumber) had been trying to sell as strategic raw materials radioactive waste, or even real uranium, but minimally enriched -- turning it into dangerous bomb material would require huge amounts of money and a highly complex production process. But this time, if the St. Petersburg FCS directorate's information is to be fully believed, we are dealing with real weapons-grade raw material. It was stolen "from an enterprise near Moscow" (presumably the cities of Bolshevo, Elektrostal, or Noginsk -- Ed.). This was where the butcher, the plumber, and co. removed three whole kilograms of highly enriched uranium (in gloves, they claim) without being stopped. All the arrested men are now in St. Petersburg, where they are being interrogated. A case under Article 223 Note 3 (theft of radioactive materials) is being brought in the place where the crime was committed -- the Moscow area. The president has been notified of the incident in a special report. Instead of Commentary We would recall that last fall our newspaper published the results of an investigation which resulted in our journalists, posing as buyers of fissionable materials, acquiring weapons-grade (highly enriched) plutonium and uranium from illegal traders. We had also come across an SS-20 warhead in private hands. People tried to refute the results of our investigation until the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial Office received a document from Ministry of Security experts fully confirming that our correspondents had indeed obtained weapons-grade plutonium. When the RTV program "Eks" broadcast some of the results of our work, V. Mikhaylov, minister of atomic energy, issued an angry letter through ITAR-TASS categorically denying that it was possible to steal uranium and plutonium from the enterprises under his jurisdiction. But now there is today's case.... We are not gloating, it is simply that in our reports of last year we cited Elektrostal as a city where uranium was being filched from a plant in milk cans. The NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service and science department will henceforth be conducting joint investigations into the ways in which strategic materials and nuclear weapons are being lost. We would recall that there are two days to go until subscription closes.
