After a five-hour meeting, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said that due to the difficult economic situation in Croatia, and in order to give the state an appropriate period of time to look after those returning, the repatriation to "pacified regions" in Croatia would be extended. This means that refugees from areas occupied and destroyed by the Serbs can stay in Germany up to 30 June 1995. The repatriation of childless married couples, or single, childless adults, will begin on 1 May, and will be finished by 31 October. The interior ministers pointed out, however, that the refugees' stay in Germany could only be a temporary one. The Federal Government should be asked to discuss the best possible solution to the repatriation problem with the Croat Government as soon as possible.
