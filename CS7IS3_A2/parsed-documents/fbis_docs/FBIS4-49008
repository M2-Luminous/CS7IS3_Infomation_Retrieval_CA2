It has taken you a while, but let us hope the wait has been worth it. It must be said that first impressions left a lot to be desired. You arrived at Hung Hom KCR station without saying a word, despite the fact that a senior member of your entourage said that the New China News Agency (Xinhua) was organising a press conference for you. Xinhua staff later denied knowing anything about a press conference. This looks really bad. It gives the impression that either you, Xinhua, or perhaps both have very little idea about either the art of public relations, basic organisational skills or perhaps both. We would like to think that matters will improve on this front. The less time you spend inside the luxury Xinhua villa in Stanley the better. Many things have changed since your last visit in 1992, some that you know about, some you do not. So make the most of your visit. Make sure that by the time you leave you know what is going on in Hong Kong. In theory, that should not be difficult. You can start by talking and listening to as many different people as possible, not just the fawning flunkies who will be crawling at your feet every step you take. Relying on information from a bevy of pro-Beijing sycophants is both silly and dangerous. Silly because the majority of these people have not got the guts to tell you anything that you do not want to hear. Dangerous because it leaves you in the dark about what is really going on in Hong Kong and what most people here are thinking. When you talk to people, speak in plain terms, not in diplo-babble. Let them know what is happening about the new airport, Container Terminal 9, and all the other big issues that need to be sorted out as soon as possible for the good of the territory. The average person in Hong Kong wants reassuring that life will go on as normal for them and their children after 1997. They want to know what China is doing to guarantee the much-touted "stability and prosperity" of Hong Kong. They want to believe that China understands both how Hong Kong works and the people who live here. There are many things people do not want to hear. They do not want to hear you attempt to score a series of political points against Governor Chris Patten or the British government. They certainly do not want to hear yet another round of bickering between you and the Governor. They do not want to know. They are bored with it. They have heard it all before. They have already told you through an opinion poll conducted by this newspaper that your decision not to meet Patten was a bad one. Seven out of 10 people interviewed thought you should talk to him. The exchange of unpleasantries that accompanied the snub was also unnecessary. You said you were too busy to meet him. He said: "I've got a busy programme...so I don't feel particularly neglected." What nonsense. How silly. When you are listening, listen hard. Again, do not just listen to people who are going to tell you what you already know. Listen to people who may tell you things you do not want to hear (there are plenty of them). One thing many people in Hong Kong have to say is: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." In other words, the less interference, the less meddling, the better. How times have changed since your last visit in 1992. Then, it was all sweetness and light -- well, almost. There were occasional spats about the airport (at least some things do not change) and changes to the committee structure of the Legislative Council, a subject that seemed controversial at the time. That, of course, was before the arrival of that "Man of Guilt" Patten and his strange ideas about electoral reform. In 1992, Lord Wilson (then just humble Sir David) said his regular meetings with you were a good idea as they gave both sides a chance to discuss matters of concern. It is just the sort of jolly sensible thing that a reserved and scholarly diplomat would say. And he was right, of course. But Lord Wilson is history, as are many of the policies and attitudes associated with his governorship. Gone are the days when almost every legislative councillor accepted almost everything they were told by government. Gone too is a government that snaps to attention every time Beijing barks an order. Instead, we have political parties that bicker and rant just like political parties do in other countries. We have legislators who make a nuisance of themselves by calling for inquiries and asking difficult questions. All this may appear rather odd to you, even disturbing. It was always going to be easier to inherit a docile population accustomed to doing what it was told. Please take careful note that this is not the case. Beijing should know this. Times have changed. Please change with them. We hope you enjoy your stay and look forward to your next trip. Let us hope it is not another two years before you visit again. You cannot afford to wait that long. Nor can Hong Kong.
