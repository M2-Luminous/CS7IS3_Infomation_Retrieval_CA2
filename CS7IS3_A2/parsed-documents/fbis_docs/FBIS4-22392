In a nationwide sample, 1,148 persons representing the entire adult population of the republic were polled. Six parameters were controlled in conducting the survey: gender, age, education, distribution of workers by economic sector, residence (rural or urban), and distribution of the population by oblast. The maximum statistical error of the sample is 5 percent. The survey results show first and foremost that the population of Belarus, to put it mildly, is not entirely knowledgeable about some socioeconomic notions, sometimes selecting something that would be resolutely denied in the reply to the next question. The very first question: "Which would you choose: a market or a planned economy?" brought rather typical replies (by the way, almost identical to those in 1992). A market economy was supported by 54 percent, a planned one--by 43 percent. But replies to another question: "What system is most suitable for Belarus?" present a completely different picture. "Capitalism"--31.6 percent, "socialism"--40.9 percent, "other"--13.7 percent, and 13.8 percent did not answer. Of course, the role of propaganda in such reactions is great. While even communists advocate a "moderate market," capitalism for many remains tantamount to cannibalism. This contradiction becomes even more obvious when we look at the answers to the question: "In your opinion, which form of ownership is more effective in the economic sense?" "Private"--52.8 percent, "state"--28 percent, a sensible combination of "state" and "private"--11.7 percent. It is a paradox, but among those who chose socialism, to the question "Do you consider private ownership in land acceptable in Belarus" 72.4 percent answered "yes", and 26.6 percent--"no." However, 78.2 percent--and 64.2 percent in 1992--consider it impermissible for foreigners to own land, although the number of those who find it permissible also increased from 12.9 percent in 1992 to 20.3 percent in 1993. The no opinion share was 1.5 percent, in 1992--23 percent. Those who defined their financial situation as average comprised 39.7 percent, below average--37.7 percent, poverty--17.7 percent, above average--3.8 percent, and high-income--0.4 percent. For 67.6 percent the financial situation has worsened over the past two years, for 22.8 percent it has not changed, and for 9.4 percent it has improved. Therefore it is probably not surprising that the number of persons who prefer free social services with low quality of service and without choice increased from 28.7 percent in 1992 to 39 percent in 1993. At the same time, the number of those who prefer to have the ability and find it necessary to choose for their money social services of a suitable quality decreased from 68.8 percent to 59.6 percent. As to employment, the degree of insecurity is even greater. Low wages at a guaranteed job are preferred by 56.7 percent (49.1 percent in 1992), while 40.6 percent (48.1 percent in 1992) would prefer high pay but with a high degree of risk of losing the job. It is amusing to observe the attitude of Belarus residents to speculation, which, in my opinion, is another paradox. A positive attitude toward speculation was registered by 9 percent; 19 percent were neutral; and the rest were negative to one extent or another. At the same time, 21 percent engage personally in reselling goods, that is, many more than those having a negative [as published] attitude to speculation. By the way, in answer to the question "Have you had a chance to participate in nonstate economic activities?" the figures do not differ dramatically from those in 1992, which probably is graphic evidence of the level of development of market relations in Belarus. For instance, 5.8 percent (3.9 percent in 1992) had bought securities; 2.4 percent (2.2 percent) owned a firm or an enterprise; 13.2 percent (5.5 percent in 1992) were working for hire in the nonstate sector; and 18.6 percent (12.1 percent in 1992) were engaged in individual labor activities. Finally, a cluster of political questions, the answers to which, to put it mildly, surprised many in Belarus. Restoration of the USSR is supported by 55.1 percent (47.9 percent in 1992), with 22.3 percent against (22 percent in 1992) and 22.3 percent with no opinion (29.5 percent in 1992). The creation of the CIS was seen as a stage on the former USSR republics' path to complete independence by 18.4 percent, as the ruin of a great state--by 39.3 percent, as a forced measure that has prevented a bloody form of disintegration--18.3 percent, and 23.8 percent had no opinion. New elections to the republic Supreme Soviet are supported by 68.8 percent. Those in favor of the presidency in Belarus comprise 43.3 percent (in 1992 only 28.2 percent). Hence a special interest in the rating of political parties, which the respondents were asked to indicate in answer to the question "Representatives of which political parties and movements in Belarus enumerated below will you vote for in the elections?" The top-rated party was the Belarusian People's Front (17.9 percent), followed by two communist organizations--the Party of Communists of Belarus (10.5 percent) and the Movement for Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice (15.9 percent). Those are followed by two "right-wing" democratic parties--the Belarusian Peasants Party (10 percent) and the United Democratic Party of Belarus (5.4 percent). All in all, in the calculations of sociologists who organized the poll, 36 percent of potential voters cast their vote for the democratic flank in politics, 26 percent support communists, and 11 percent--centrists, which is probably the greatest paradox of the public mind in Belarus. While voting for democratic parties and private property, Belarus residents are nevertheless nostalgic for the USSR and socialism.
