The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao today announced his Government's intention to set up a National Security Council [NSC] which would take into account all matters that impinge on national security. "It will not just have defence in its ambit but have a much wider scope than that," he said while replying to a discussion on the working of the Defence Ministry in the Rajya Sabha. The Prime Minister said he had got the matter examined and "we have come to the conclusion that it should be set up." "In its new variegated form it will take into account all matters impinging on national security." Mr. I.K. Gujral, JD [Janata Dal], intervened to ask if the NSC was any different from what had been proposed in 1990. He said he did not find any difference in what the Prime Minister had outlined and what had been proposed in 1990. The Prime Minister said in 1990 it was narrow in scope and included only finance, home, defense. However if the member felt there was no difference then he could have the copyright, he said in a lighter vein. The Prime Minister said that the security environment had changed very much since 1990 which necessitated a wider scope for the NSC. Referring to the changed scenario after the end of the cold war, Mr. Rao said if business was as usual even after the end of the cold war, then it had no meaning. "We have to be pragmatic about the changes ushered in by the end of the cold war and it required greater vigilance on the part of all countries particularly India and the role it had play, he said. [sentence as published] "We cannot abandon this role," he said adding we have to work for peace and resolution of problems is going to be much easier than before since the end of the cold war. The Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mr. Sikander Bakht, said the Prime Minister's statement still did not dispel their misgivings at all. He said the Agrii missile programme had been discontinued on several occasions and he suspected this was due to us pressure. [sentence as published] -- PTI
