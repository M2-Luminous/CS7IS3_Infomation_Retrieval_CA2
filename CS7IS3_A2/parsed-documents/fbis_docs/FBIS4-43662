EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert will illustrate the decision -- to be put to EU industry ministers on Wednesday [22 June] -- to Italian Industry Minister Vito Gnutti in Rome tomorrow. EU Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that "cutting 5-6 million tonnes from Italy's private steel producers is the only chance we have to get up to the minimum European target of 19 million tonnes, allowing us to apply the steel plan." "Each of the 68 aid cases will have to be notified by Italy, and will be examined individually," van Miert said, underlining the need to "swiftly act on the Commission's June decision."
