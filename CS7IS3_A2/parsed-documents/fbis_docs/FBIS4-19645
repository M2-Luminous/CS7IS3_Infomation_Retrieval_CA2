The economic report of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), published on Wednesday [20 April], says that in western Germany the economic situation stabilized further at the beginning of 1994. Despite "positive indicators of an end to the recession" there are still only limited chances of a powerful recovery. The signs of improved competitiveness and a strengthening of export demand cannot "distract from the fundamental problems of the continuing weakness in domestic demand." Growth has accelerated in the former East Germany, according to the BDI. Nevertheless, east German industry can only keep pace in certain sectors, in spite of considerable progress in international competition. [passage omitted] Economic Affairs Minister Guenter Rexrodt and Horst Siebert, a member of the Council of Experts for the Assessment of Overall Economic Development, spoke on Wednesday of an economic recovery. At the same time, speaking in Duesseldorf, Rexrodt stressed that this "turn for the better" does not mean, however, that there can be any let-up in striving for more growth and employment. Siebert said on Saarland Radio that he expects the GDP to grow by 1 percent in 1994. However, there is no noticeable revival in private consumption. [passage omitted]
