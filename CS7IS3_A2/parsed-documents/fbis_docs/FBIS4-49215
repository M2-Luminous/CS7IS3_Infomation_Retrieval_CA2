Jiangsu CPC Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou made this remark at the eighth plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection commission yesterday when he set some requirements for Jiangsu's anticorruption work. [passage omitted] Comrade Chen Huanyou's speech was divided into three parts: 1. Conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and have a better understanding of anticorruption work. 2. Deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and more effective way and continue to score new results stage by stage. And, 3. Correctly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability and do a good job in safeguarding social and political stability. Chen Huanyou pointed out: Generally speaking, we have scored marked achievements in the fight against corruption. Since late August last year, party committees and governments throughout the province have conscientiously implemented the party Central Committee and State Council "Decision on Some Tasks That Need To Be Done in Fighting Corruption in the Near Future." [passage omitted] The spread of corruption has been brought under control. It should be noted that as a whole, Jiangsu's anticorruption work has progressed healthily. Basically, we have met the requirements expected by the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee. The general reaction from the public is positive as a whole. Our practice in the earlier period shows that launching the anticorruption struggle has been a popular move, which has played a positive role in promoting ties between the party and the masses, advancing reform and development, and safeguarding social and political stability. However, we should be aware that we have only scored a preliminary success that is far from meeting the people's expectations and Central Committee requirements. Work progress in various localities and departments has been uneven. Some comrades, including leading cadres, do not understand sufficiently the struggle's importance. As a result, they lacked initiative and strength in carrying out the struggle. Discipline was lax in some localities and departments. They failed to adopt forceful measures in handling cases. Therefore, we must remain sober, assume responsibility, resolutely carry out the anticorruption struggle, and strive to score new achievements. Regarding the work of combating corruption and promoting honesty this year, Chen Huanyou said: First, we must continue to focus on the carrying out of three tasks. Resolute measures should be taken to encourage honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres. [passage omitted] Party and government leading cadres at and above the county and department levels should examine and rectify themselves. They should rectify whatever problems occur. They should promptly discover and solve existing problems by examining themselves, accepting supervision by the masses, and holding democratic meetings; and standardize their conduct in line with Central Committee and the provincial party committee provisions. We should continue to concentrate on the handling of major and important cases. Great efforts should be made to thoroughly investigate major cases of corruption that have been exposed. Under no circumstances should we let such cases go unhandled. Cases must be thoroughly investigated and settled no matter who is involved. We should never become soft-hearted and never allow official protection. Anyone who tries to protect law-breakers must be subject to party disciplinary action and punishment by law. [passage omitted] Second, we should strive to solve problems by eliminating their root causes by gradually establishing an effective system or mechanism for preventing corruption. Various departments and units should conduct extensive education to promote party work style, honesty, and professional ethics; vigorously publicize and commend outstanding party members and cadres who are honest in carrying out their official functions and who work hard to serve the people; and encourage healthy trends. [passage omitted] Third, we should strengthen leadership over the fight against corruption. Party and governments at all levels must take the fight against corruption as an important long-term task and always make it an important item on their agenda. [passage omitted] At present, the general situation in the province is good. We have scored new progress in economic development, reform, and opening up to the outside world. We enjoy both political and social stability, but we are still facing many difficulties and contradictions in our advance. He said: We have very arduous tasks to do this year in pushing forward reform and development. As reform has entered a stage of tackling knotty problems, it is unprecedented in terms of its breadth, depth, intensity, and difficulties. In the course of advancing the reform, new problems and contradictions will inevitably emerge. Party committees, governments, and leading cadres at all levels must bear the responsibility, do their work well, and strive to consolidate and develop the good situation. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: In combating corruption, we must heed the overall interest of party work as a whole; eliminate major problems that affect the overall interest; set the task and goal for the anticorruption struggle for each stage; and integrate the fight against corruption with the implementation of the important party Central Committee and State Council policies, as well as with the major plans of the provincial party committee and government. [passage omitted] Through solid and effective work, we should enable the masses to realize that the main stream of our party ranks is good, that our party is determined to take effective action to combat corruption, and that progress in combating corruption has been, and is being, made step by step, thereby enhancing confidence in the fight against corruption and leading to a situation in which the party and the masses are united and the cadres and the masses are united and in which all in the province know they are in the same boat and should work hard together. Thirty-three provincial discipline inspection commission members attended yesterday's meeting. [passage omitted] The meeting concluded yesterday after adopting the "Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission."
