LUSA news agency reported the signing was attended by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who arrived Sunday on a seven-day official visit, and Chinese counterpart Li Peng. The credit line was negotiated between Portugal's Banco Nacional Ultramarino and the Bank of China, the Portuguese news agency said. The aim of the credit line was to increase Portuguese exports to China, LUSA said. Earlier, Cavaco Silva and Li issued a joint declaration on cooperation over the transition of Macau, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. "The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the question of Macau is an historic document and a good example to solve questions left by history," Li was quoted as saying by LUSA. Cavaco Silva was quoted as saying that the application of the joint declaration "has been smooth" and "corresponds to the wishes of the two countries." Cavaco Silva and then prime minister Zhao Ziyang agreed in 1987 on the return of the Portuguese colony by the end of the century, at which time it would become a "special administrative region" of China. Portuguese diplomatic sources told LUSA that the aim of the visit was to "consolidate the excellent political understanding" between the two countries and to "inject new dynamism" in their trade relations. Cavaco Silva has in his entourage 60 businessmen as well as the ministers for foreign affairs, trade, and tourism.
