The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of BP on near (1120) oriented sapphire substrates was conducted by the thermal decomposition of a B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]-PH[.sub]3[/] mixture in hydrogen atmosphere.[.sup]1[/] After the heat treatments of susceptor and the substrate,[.sup]1[/] growth was made at gas flow rates of 20, 500 and 2500cc/min, for B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] (1% in H[.sub]2[/]), PH[.sub]3[/] (5% in H[.sub]2[/]) and H[.sub]2[/], respectively, in the temperature range of 800 to 1050�C at a deposition time of 1.5hr. The films growing at the temperature ranges of 950 to 1050�C, and 800 to 900�C were colored orange-red and black, respectively. They were polycrystals except for the growth temperatures of 1000 and 1050�C. The BP films grown at 1050�C were peeled after several days to remain ultra thin film on substrate showing strike RHEED pattern. X-ray diffraction pattern of the peeled film was to be BP with the lattice constant of a[.sub]0[/]=4.54 Angstrom. The BP film grown on the ultra thin film indicated single crystalline RHEED pattern. Some areas showed similar RHEED pattern as that of BP on Si (111). The Si (111) grows epitaxially on Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] (1120),[.sub]2[/] suggesting that BP (111) would also grow on Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] (1120). But the surface of the films were not smooth. The films grown at 1000�C indicate highly oriented single crystalline pattern. In order to alter the crystal quality, we have adopted crystal growth by buffer BP layer at low temperatures (450-600�C for 40-80 sec). After low temperature growth and annealing process at 1000�C for 5 min under B[.sub]2[/] or PH[.sub]3[/] atmosphere, crystal growth was carried out at the temperature of 1000�C under the above mentioned conditions. BP single crystalline layers were grown by growing buffer layer of BP at 550�C and annealing at 1000�C in hydrogen atmosphere, which is confirmed by X-ray diffraction and RHEED patterns. The orientation relationship was (111) BP/(0001) sapphire; [110] BP//[1120] sapphire, and [112] BP//[1010] sapphire, and (111) BP/-(1120) sapphire. The obtained film exhibited p-type conductor. The Hall measurements by van der Pauw method indicate that the film with buffer layer has highermobility than that without buffer layer. Then the buffer layer would diminish the autodoping from the substrate. This study was performed through Special Coordination Funds of the Science and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government.
