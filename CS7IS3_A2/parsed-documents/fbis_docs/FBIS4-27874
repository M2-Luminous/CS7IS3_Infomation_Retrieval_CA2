Kim will explain the latest developments concerning the North's nuclear ambitions and urge the attendees to make suprapartisan efforts to cope with any contingencies that international sanctions against Pyongyang might entail, informed sources in the ruling camp said Monday. Opposition Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, in the meantime, is expected to stress the need to solve the problem peacefully on the basis of his party's position that war should not break out under any circumstances. The opposition leader is also likely to urge that sanctions, if deemed inevitable, should not be initiated by only three countries -- South Korea, the United States and Japan -- but by the United Nations as a whole.
