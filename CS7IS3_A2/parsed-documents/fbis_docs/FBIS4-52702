Korean Puppets' Development of Chemical Weapons" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today comments on the South Korean puppets' development of chemical weapons. The news analyst cites data on the production of chemical weapons openly promoted in South Korea after the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs took office. He says: Last year the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique made public an official "decision of the government" to possess chemical weapons, stressing the need to build up its own strong biochemical warfare capacity. The decision of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs to overtly possess chemical weapons, mass-destruction weapons which are banned worldwide, shows their war frenzy has gone so far as to ignore international law. They are developing and stockpiling large quantities of chemical weapons such as nerve, corrosive, toxic, choking, disabling and irritant agents. Army corps and divisions of the South Korean puppet army have chemical warfare units, which continuously hold chemical shell firing drills. 15 chemical attack units are deployed along the front. [sentence as received] The production of chemical weapons and preparations for chemical warfare which the South Korean puppets are feverishly hastening, taking advantage of the U.S. imperialists' chemical warfare preparations show the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique is a group of rare warmaniacs in the world. The South Korean puppets are desperately trying to plunge fellow countrymen into the scourge of nuclear weapons and toxic gas. They will inevitably be denounced and spurned by the nation and the world.
