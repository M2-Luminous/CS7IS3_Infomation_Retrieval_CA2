FR941220-0-00030 FR941220-0-00005 We have revised ยง409.45(c)(2) to allow provision of medical social services on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver if it can be demonstrated that the service is necessary to resolve a clear and direct impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. Though this change could increase program expenditures, we believe the additional cost will be negligible because of the low volume of these services and offsetting savings if the beneficiary's rate of recovery is improved. Several changes made to the proposed rule will benefit HHAs' administration and utilization of home health aides. We have revised ยง484.36(b)(2)(iii) to allow a home health aide to receive the required 12 hours of in-service training during a 12-month period instead of each calendar year. This change allows HHAs some flexibility in scheduling training. Many commenters opposed the requirements of proposed ยง484.36(d)(2)(i) and (ii). We agreed and are deleting those sections from the final rule. Therefore, we are not mandating supervisory visits once a month while the home health aide is providing patient care, or mandating supervisory visits while the aide is furnishing services in all instances if the home health aide services are provided by an individual not employed directly by the HHA. These changes allow HHAs additional flexibility. For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. Collection of Information Requirements Sections 409.43, 484.18, 484.36, and 484.48 of this document contain information collection requirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504), we have submitted a copy of this document to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. However, these information collection requirements have been previously approved under the information collection requirements contained in the conditions of participation for home health agencies. These information collection requirements implement patient rights provisions and set forth home health aide criteria; they were approved under the OMB approval number 0938&hyph;0365 on June 24, 1991 through December 31, 1993 by OMB in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We are requesting reapproval of the collection requirements in those sections. Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimated to be six hours per home health agency per year. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this preamble.
