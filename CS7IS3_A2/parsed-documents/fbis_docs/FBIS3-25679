(PANA) -- Nigeria and Ghana have expressed concern over the delay in the implementation of the Liberian peace accord, signed in Cotonou, Benin Republic in July last year, a Nigerian Government statement said Wednesday [23 February]. The statement was issued in Nigeria's federal capital, Abuja, after a Ghanaian envoy, Lt.-Gen. Arnold Quainoo, had delivered a message from President Jerry Rawlings, to Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, on the Liberian crisis and other issues. Nigeria and Ghana have troops in the West African peace keeping force in Liberia (ECOMOG) [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], which has now been expanded and includes battalions from Tanzania and Uganda. Two weeks ago, Ghana served notice of its intention to "review" its participation in ECOMOG unless the warring factions showed commitment to peace within one month. Nigeria has the largest contingent of about 12,000 troops in Liberia and there is growing public impatience among Nigerians at the lack of progress in the efforts to end the four-year-old war. The statement said that Gen. Quainoo briefed the Nigerian leader on the recent tour of Liberia by a Ghanaian military delegation and "restated the country's (Ghana's) concern at the non-implementation of the Cotonou peace accord". It quoted Gen. Abacha as saying that Nigeria shared Ghana's concern at the delay in resolving the Liberian crisis. He expressed his belief that "Liberians must be willing to cooperate among themselves for amicable resolution of the crisis in the war-torn country". Nigeria and Ghana also expressed the need for improved trade cooperation between them as a catalyst for sub-regional economic integration, the statement added.
