Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt defended the government's action program to increase growth and employment, but the SPD [Social Democratic Party] accused the coalition of wanting to break the social consensus within the country. Waigel stressed that the policy of consolidation was to be continued "without restrictions." The consolidation of public budgets would promote economic growth and create new investment opportunities for industry. The action program was a "consistent" continuation of the privatization policy and the instruments for controlling the labor market were being extended. In order to encourage innovation, small- and medium-size businesses would receive particular support. Rexrodt stressed there were "clear indications" that the economic downturn in Germany had been overcome. Export prospects had improved. Optimism was justified, at least with regard to the economy. However, this did not apply to the development of the labor market. Therefore, the action program focused on the creation of additional jobs. Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the deputy chairperson of the SPD parliamentary group, said the government was facing an economic and financial "pile of rubble." For months, the government had turned a blind eye to the rise in unemployment; now political action was supposed to cover up the inability to act. [passage omitted]
