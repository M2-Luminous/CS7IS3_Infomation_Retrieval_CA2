As reports the presidential press service, issuance of this decree was caused by aggravation of the situation in the conflict zone, support of this peacekeeping operation on the part of CIS countries, and the request on the part of Georgian and Abkhazian leaders to urgently deploy peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. Yeltsin commissioned the government to ensure formation of an appropriate military contingent on the basis of the Russian units which have the status of peacekeeping forces by using the infrastructure of the Group of the Russian Forces in Transcaucases. The Russian contingent can be later on strengthened on the decision of the Federation Council of the RF Federal Assembly. The decree is to go into effect since the moment of its signing, however, in accordance with the RF Constitution the Federation Council is to determine the time of the operation. The next sitting of the upper chamber has been scheduled for June 21, however, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the chamber, does not rule out that he would convene an extraordinary sitting to consider this issue. IF Note: The previous week the upper chamber of the Russian parliament declined Boris Yeltsin's request to approve introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict (with a majority of only one vote). Meanwhile, on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reported to Interfax in Yerevan that everything is ready for the introduction of peacekeeping forces into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, "however, decision of politicians is needed to start the operation."
