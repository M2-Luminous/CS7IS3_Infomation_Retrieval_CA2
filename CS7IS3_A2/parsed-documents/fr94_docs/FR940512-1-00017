FR940512-1-00017 FR940512-1-00002 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;42&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On November 29, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8754 (58 FR 67310), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes, to require replacement of the quick release coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. That action was prompted by a fire resistance test of the hydraulic EDP, associated hoses, and couplings installed on the number 2 and number 3 engines, which revealed that the pump case drain line quick release couplings leaked hydraulic fluid. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage from the pump case drain line quick release coupling, which could fuel the flames in the event of an engine fire. Since issuance of that AD, British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin SB.29&hyph;31&hyph;01339A, Revision 1, dated July 8, 1993, which revises the effectivity listing of the original issue of the service bulletin by adding the serial numbers of affected Model BAe 146&hyph;100A and &hyph;200A series airplanes. In addition, one Model BAe 146&hyph;300A series airplane, serial number E3220, is removed from the service bulletin effectivity. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05 to continue to require replacement of the quick release coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic EDP on the number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. The proposed AD would revise the applicability of the existing AD, and would reflect the latest revision of the service bulletin as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,590, or $165 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8754 (58 FR 67310), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: British Aerospace: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;42&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8754.
