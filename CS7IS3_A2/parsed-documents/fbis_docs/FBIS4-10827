GRANMA newspaper reports the increase of tensions due to the Agile Provider-94 joint exercises scheduled for 22 April-11 May, in a region which encompasses seven states in the southeastern United States. The newspaper states that (according to Defense Department spokesmen) the exercise will include the participation of approximately 44,000 U.S. Army, Navy, Marine infantry, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel. The report explains French and Netherlands units will also participate, and the maneuvers will be concentrated in the area of Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. GRANMA reports that "Agile Provider will help lubricate the powerful war machine that the U.S. Atlantic Command represents. It includes the largest number of U.S. land, tactical air, and naval forces; and they will train together for the first time since its reorganization in October 1993." The newspaper specifies that such a concentration of military troops, with high capability and combat readiness under conditions that are very similar to actual combat, represents an unusual buildup of forces in the area. It adds that Agile Provider-94, the command's largest exercise, renews the United States' large-scale military activity just as the Fleetex 2-94 joint maneuvers will conclude, and at a time when the program foreseen for the Trade Wind maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea is scheduled to end. The strange concurrence of the maneuvers and exercises in the Atlantic region once again proves that the "supplier" of dangers is truly "agile" when fulfilling its goals, the report concludes.
