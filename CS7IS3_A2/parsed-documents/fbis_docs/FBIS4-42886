From this, it follows that protectionism, old-fashioned production structures, and social rigidity -- to say nothing of stubbornness -- are to be condemned. In his speech, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party) warned especially against state support which can harm competition -- a pointed message to the host country, among others. And the minister was able to voice particular thanks for the OECD's contribution to the normalization of the competition in the shipyard sector. The meeting of ministers was able to give its backing to the OECD's major analysis of unemployment and job creation. On the subject of Denmark's modest position in the overall job creation picture in the 1980's, Helveg Petersen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE: ``The report clearly shows that there is a need to do more on the labor market side than we have done hitherto in the way of labor market reforms and the cuts in income tax which have been an important Danish structural problem. ``But we have a good tradition in Denmark and it is that it is the two sides of industry which not only have the right to fix, but also the responsibility for the consequences of wage and working conditions. This is something that we will not change. ``We must not start fixing minimum wages or other working conditions in law. A more flexible system would be an advantage.'' [Behrendt] The meeting of ministers has spoken of the "inadequate and apathetic adjustment" of member nations' economies to the rapid changes resulting from technological progress, competition, and "globalization." [Helveg Petersen] The two sides of industry would be very wise to study this material in detail and be inspired by what the wise people here have been sitting discussing. But I remain very firm that this is their -- the two sides of industry -- problem. It is they who have to work to make adjustments and keep up the good tradition in order to create a more flexible system. [Behrendt] Does the high level of social support in Denmark have a role to play? [Helveg Petersen] I do not think we can attack the problem that way and immediately create a more satisfactory level of employment by changing the rules we already have. [Behrendt] What can the Danish Government do in order to avoid the same defeat over proposals for lower wages for those entering the labor market as suffered by the French Government here this spring? [Helveg Petersen] We can only emphasize to the two sides of industry that because of their great influence they have a joint responsibility for the employment situation. They have to accept part of the "blame" for those things which go wrong. [Helveg Petersen ends] Helveg Petersen was unwilling to speculate about which of the many recommendations in the OECD report will determine Denmark's profile when the secretariat comes to report on national profiles in the fall. "But on the training and education side in particular, we have a big job to do."
