"Climatology, remote sensing, environmental analysis, and energy processes are some of the ENEA fields of interest that will benefit from the sharp improvement in quality that will come from the introduction of parallel computing methods," announced Cabibbo. A theoretical physicist of international prestige, who has been distinguished more than once by the Swedish Academy of Sciences for his contributions to the so-called "standard model" of physics, Cabibbo has been president of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) for eight years. It was there that he started the APE (Array Processor Experiment) project for a supercomputer capable of performing billions of operations per second. Cabibbo remembers that: "At the beginning of the eighties our group working on quantistic cromodynamics, the theory that describes the behavior of quarks, was engaged on a numerical simulation project to deduce the values of some physical quantities. Such an expensive high-performance supercomputer was needed that we thought of building it ourselves. We decided not to go along the same path as the big producers like Cray, that push the speed of the single components to a maximum, and preferred to build a machine in which a large number of computing units worked in parallel. In this way it was possible to obtain high performance using standard technologies, and therefore at a more economic cost." Basic Physics That was how, in 1984, the first APE machine capable of performing one billion operations per second, started. Its versatility, also outside the field of basic physics, was immediately recognized for all processes relating to industrial production and in general to forecasting analyses. The project developed and in 1989 a second generation machine was built, the APE 100-Quadrix, characterized by eight computing units capable of performing 100 billion operations per second. In comparison, the best personal computers on our desks that have a single computing unit can carry out between one and 10 million operations per second. At this point the APE project passed from the INFN laboratories to those of Alenia Spazio, which had acquired the license and intended to market the machine in the international field. However the INFN continued to work on the third generation: APE 1000. With Cabibbo as president of the ENEA the potentialities of the supercomputer were immediately acquired by the agency which, in its increased capacity (law of August 1991), is engaged in research and applications in the sectors of new technologies, energy and the environment. "The ENEA has purchased an APE 100 that will be installed in the Casaccia laboratories by next summer and will be used both in traditional and frontier research." Climatic Plan Climatic simulations, aimed at interpreting the possible early signs of global overheating (the greenhouse effect) and forecasting the effects on the environment, presuppose an intense use of the APE, also in view of the unification of all the authorities to form a national climatic plan. Another ENEA initiative that is based on the advantages offered by supercomputing is the Mediterranean Basin Project (PBM) to construct and manage an ecological system made up of telematic computer networks and monitors, databases, and mathematical models of the sea and the atmosphere. The final goal is monitoring the environment, preventive and civil defense services, and the safety of commercial and civilian traffic. In particular, parallel computing will be used within the scope of this program for the elaboration of climatic and weather forecasts and for the elaboration of images obtained both using traditional surveying instruments and the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) technology. ENEA's more mature lines of research will also be relaunched thanks to the supercomputer. "There is still a lot to study about the phenomena of combustion if we want to improve efficiency and limit the production of pollutants. And also in this case we have started a research line to simulate the processes using parallel computing. Without forgetting the possibilities offered by the cycles of nuclear fission that are alternatives to uranium, such as those of thorium proposed by the Bowman group of Los Alamos, with whom the ENEA has already started to cooperate," concludes Cabibbo.
