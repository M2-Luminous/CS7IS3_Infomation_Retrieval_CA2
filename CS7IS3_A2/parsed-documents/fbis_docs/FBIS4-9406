At the same time, he said in his report for CTK that it would be premature to speak about a specific form of cooperation. According to information obtained by RUDE PRAVO from reliable sources, the aforementioned cooperation could concern supplies of Israeli avionics for the light training and combat aircraft L-159 developed by Aero Vodochody Co. This aircraft, in addition to use by the Czech Army, should succeed in the U.S. and Australian markets and the markets of the European NATO member countries. In fact, this cooperation would be just a continuation of the cooperation with the Israeli firm Elbit that is participating by supplying military equipment in the production of L-59 aircraft, a contract on the delivery of 36 pieces of which was signed with Thailand. Aero Vodochody Director Zdenek Chalupnik told RUDE PRAVO on 20 April that the observation regarding the supplies for the L-159 by the firm Elbit is "only a small part of information." "Of the approximately nine offers," he continued, "we have short-listed three, and no further selection has been done so far." He admitted at the same time that Elbit is on this short list of firms that are capable of satisfying the demands from the Army of the Czech Republic and added that the other two firms are from the United States. Moreover, he confirmed that one of them is the Rockwell International Corporation. According to the RUDE PRAVO findings, this corporation showed great interest in the production of the Czech military aircraft, as testified by its letters to Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, in which it appeals to the Czech representatives to seriously consider its initiative, with due attention to the prestige of the firm and the contacts to which it can provide access. It submitted a detailed official offer of cooperation to the management of Aero Vodochody last February. In it, the U.S. corporation provides information on the objectives and conditions of the proposed joint venture that would concern an exclusive partnership in the sale of the L-159 aircraft on the world markets, avionics supplies, teamwork in the modernization of the aircraft for use within the framework of NATO, assistance in providing credits, and cooperation in the development of the Czech fighter aircraft of the next generation. Subcontractors from Great Britain and Italy are taking part in the bid of the U.S. manufacturer. The Aero Vodochody company conducted its own preliminary comparison of the two bids. The results RUDE PRAVO managed to obtain indicate the superiority of the Rockwell bid. The internal material of Aero specifically states that the markets to which Rockwell promises to introduce the Czech military aviation production will not be, as opposed to the limited possibilities of the Israeli company, limited by political concerns and risks. The material describes the worldwide reputation of Rockwell as excellent, and it refers in the same manner to the firm's technical, marketing, and information possibilities and results and the offered financial assistance by means of its own credit company and commercial banks. It emphasizes its possibilities in the training of technicians, providing top-quality avionics, software, and NATO logistics, and especially notes that Elbit does not have such possibilities. The offer of exclusive cooperation in selling L-159 in the world markets is noted (while the possibilities of the Israeli company are limited in this respect to Singapore, India, and Australia) and the firm's own production potential, while Elbit must purchase a large quantity of equipment from other manufacturers. Consultations by RUDE PRAVO with industry and military experts in aviation give rise to certain doubts regarding the orientation toward Israeli supplies also from the vantage point of the future market for Czech military aircraft production, particularly with respect to the desirable compatibility with the NATO standards and the conceivable application in the armies of the North Atlantic Alliance member states. Because of the significance of the matter, Chalupnik refuses to provide official information regarding the scope of individual bids, but he considers them approximately equal. At the same time, he points out the necessity for speedy processing of the concept of restructuring the Army and setting priorities in the development of military production. "We are waiting," he said in a telephone conversation with a RUDE PRAVO correspondent, "for the establishment of that program (L-159 production). We are waiting for the decision. Of course, to the extent of some hundred million korunas, we are working on the preparations so that, when the time comes, we can start at full speed. It will have Western-type avionics, corresponding to NATO standards, and the selection process has not been concluded. Period."
