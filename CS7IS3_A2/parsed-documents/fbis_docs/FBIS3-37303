The text of the decision reads: Concerned about the danger of the internationalization of the conflict, the European Parliament advises the regional countries and governments and all other powerful countries to refrain from providing any military assistance to the conflicting sides. Every country, especially Turkey, that neighbors Armenia and Azerbaijan is called upon to allow free transport of freight destined for both countries. The European Parliament supports the presidency's statement, which calls on the sides to show restraint and not to create new suffering for the population, which has already suffered cruelly because of the war. It reaffirms its adherence to the principle of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and calls on all the involved sides to resolve the conflict peacefully by respecting the UN Security Council resolutions. Commenting on the European Parliament decision, the Armenian Foreign Ministry Press and Public Relations Service expressed concern that the document finds the European Parliament continuing to tell the international public that the years of conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh are a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Identifying the sides directly involved and those dragged into the conflict would help them to understand the real essence of the conflict and the more goal-oriented [word indistinct] of the peace process.
