Ataman told his weekly press conference that Turkey would not accept the linking of the U.S. aid to any precondition. He also recalled that the House Appropriations Committee has not approved the proposal passed by the House of Representatives to suspend 25 percent of the aid to Turkey. `In return the Senate committee decided to include a clause in the text under which U.S. military material sold and transferred to Turkey will not be used by Turkey for domestic security and police purposes,' he said. Ataman said that that decision was to be put before the Senate. `Since there is a difference between the text of the House and the Senate, the committee has to review the issue,' Ataman said. `If the committee agrees on a conciliating text, this will then be voted separately in the general assembly of the Senate and the House and submitted to the approval of the president,' Ataman said. `However, if a conciliation is not reached,' he said, `it was likely that the previous practices on extending aid to Turkey might prevail.'
