FR940721-0-00027 FR940721-0-00010 Ford stated that additional specifications for belt elongation are needed for the seat belt assembly to be used in testing belt-positioning booster seats. Ford said that_ Standard 209 allows use of webbing having any elongation up to 30 percent in Type 2 belts. Using webbing with 30 percent elongation for the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat may result in quite different results than using webbing of 7 percent elongation. It suggested that S6.1.1.3 be amended to include a close tolerance specification for elongation of the standard belt webbing used in the Standard 213 test for all child restraint systems, based on typical polyester belt webbing, such as the draft ECE 44 Annex 13 standard seat belt webbing specification of 8 # 1 percent at 11 kN. NHTSA does not believe there is a need to specify the elongation of the webbing material used for testing belt-positioning seats. Standard 213 does not currently specify the elongation of the webbing used for testing child restraint systems. Further, NHTSA is unaware of information indicating that elongation should be specified. (Under S4.2(c) of Standard 209, the webbing in a Type I seat belt assembly shall not extend to more than 20 percent elongation at 2,500 pounds.) There is no apparent reason why elongation should be specified for the Type 2 assemblies used to test belt-positioning seats, when elongation is not specified for the Type I assemblies used to test all other child restraint systems. Also, not specifying elongation better ensures the dynamic test is representative of real-world crash conditions. NHTSA obtains webbing material from seat belt suppliers for use in Standard 213's dynamic test. These suppliers also furnish vehicle manufacturers with the webbing used in motor vehicles. Under current Standard 213 test procedures, NHTSA tests child restraint systems using webbing that is typical of that installed in vehicles. Any manufacturer that is concerned about the possible effect that elongation might have on the performance of the child restraint can identify and perform a ``worst case.'' A manufacturer may determine that a child restraint meeting Standard 213's performance criteria when tested under worst case conditions will likely meet those criteria when tested under less severe conditions. A manufacturer that tests its restraint for certification purposes could limit its testing by deciding to test only a ``worst case'' scenario, i.e., testing under the most austere or unfavorable conditions and circumstances specified in the standard. 2 2 Relying on worst case testing as a basis for a manufacturer's certification is commonplace among manufacturers. For example, Standard 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' requires injury criteria to be met with the test vehicle traveling forward at any speed ``up to and including 30 mph'' into a fixed barrier ``that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular'' (S5.1). Manufacturers typically test a vehicle at 30 mph into a perpendicular barrier since that is the worst case test. The manufacturers believe that if the vehicle passes that worst case test, it is reasonable to conclude it will pass less severe tests (e.g., at lower speeds into angled barriers). Ford and UM&hyph;CPP pointed out an error in the location of the inboard anchor point. UM stated that the location [D]oes not follow the research results reported in DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808003, TABLE 9, and has an unintended negative effect on test results. Although the lateral (Y) position relative to the outboard anchor has been used, the X and Z dimensions of the old center anchors have been retained. This inappropriately low anchor creates an especially long inboard belt length which, when loaded during the test, makes the booster suddenly shift toward the outboard anchor, sometimes shoving the dummy's neck into the shoulder belt and sometimes leaving the upper torso lagging behind at an angle, depending on the initial geometry. This occurs because the effective center of this very asymmetrical belt, when loaded, is not halfway along the Y axis. UM&hyph;CPP recommended that the higher and more forward inboard anchor location, determined by NHTSA's research, be used. Ford also commented that_ Anchorages for the lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat assembly are highly asymmetric, with the inboard anchorage about 185 mm lower than and rearward of the outboard anchorage. Such highly asymmetric anchorages are atypical. The outboard anchorage also appears to be unusually high. Ford suggested that anchorages be located based on the average dimensions of the vehicles surveyed in the agency's research program. NHTSA agrees with the comments made by Ford and UM. The proposed location for the anchor points was based on the average location of the anchorage points that was determined by the agency's research. However, among the proposed set of coordinates for the inboard anchor point, only the y-coordinate was based on the average location. The x- and z-coordinates of the old anchor were used. NHTSA will define all three coordinates of the inboard anchor point to reflect the location of the ``average'' condition identified by the NHTSA research. In January 1994, tests were conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), to verify that the change in anchorage point does not negatively affect the quality and consistency of the tests. Those tests were directly comparable to the tests in the earlier study, DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808003, using the same booster/dummy configuration, except that the inboard anchorage was at the ``old'' location in the fore-aft and vertical axes. The tests showed that the corrected anchorage locations had a negligible affect on the performance of the child seats used to restrain 3- and 6-year-old dummies. That is, there was no marked difference in the performance of the child seats using the old anchorage locations as compared to the performance of the seats with the corrected locations. The principal difference observed in the kinematics was that the booster seat did not slide toward the outboard anchorage location when tested with the corrected inboard anchorage, as it tended to do using the old anchorage. This sliding is attributed to the asymmetry of the inboard and outboard anchorages when tested with the old anchorage configuration. A report on these VRTC tests is available in the docket for this rulemaking.
