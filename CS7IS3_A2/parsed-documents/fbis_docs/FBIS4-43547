At the first German-Chinese conference for medium-size companies in Bonn, where more than 200 German and Chinese firms discussed possibilities of improved industrial cooperation, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Bonn's offer aims at "making the successful German training system also available to the Chinese partners." Speaking to Beijing Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, Rexrodt expressed his interest in introducing the dual system in fields where it could prove particularly effective in connection with German joint ventures. The combined training in schools and industry is to bring about skilled workers for the joint ventures with Germany. The major part of this program shall be funded by the German Financial Cooperation Program with China. The proposal is expected to be finalized when Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng visits Bonn at the beginning of July. Rexrodt said it is no coincidence that China is of particular importance for Germany in political, cultural, and economic terms. For German industry China is the biggest market for investment goods in East Asia and the biggest trading partner among the developing countries worldwide. Last year, trade between Germany and China amounted to 24 billion German marks. At the same time, Rexrodt warned against further Chinese trade balance surpluses in the billion marks range. This calls for new ways of increasing companies' capital and financial powers. The government in Bonn wants to expand cooperation with China as "a trustworthy, reliable, and economically important partner." Medium-size companies are expected to play a major role in this. Yet Rexrodt demanded that the Chinese Government provides favorable framework conditions. Beijing could give fresh impetus to the German economy via fiscal policy, Rexrodt said. Rexrodt's reference to an upcoming simplification of laws and regulations in Germany in the current legislative term was an unmistakable hint to the Chinese. This would strengthen medium-size companies. Rexrodt voiced satisfaction with the growing globalization of medium-size German companies and pointed out that the opening of markets in order to create new fields of activity is an important task of politics. In this context, Bonn advocates China joining the GATT and the future World Trade Organization, which the Federal Government wants to be based in Bonn. To intensify German-Chinese cooperation among medium-size firms, the Federal Government has raised funds for sending a delegate of German industry to Shanghai. He will be particularly concerned with making contacts with medium-size firms from the growth regions of Shanghai/Pudong and the Yangtze Delta. At the moment, medium-size companies already do nearly half of all business with China. But the number of 400 German projects in China can certainly be increased. A precondition for a stronger capital transfer to China is state guarantees for German foreign investment. That is why the Hermes credit guarantees should be used by medium-size companies in particular, Rexrodt said.
