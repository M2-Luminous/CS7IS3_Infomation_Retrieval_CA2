EL TIEMPO has conducted a poll in Santa Fe de Bogota and Cali, determining "the cost of Colombians' basic basket increased approximately 3 percent during the first 20 days of February. This leads us to believe the increase will reach 3.5 percent by the end of the month and that the accumulated increase for the first two months of the year could reach 6.7 percent. This is a high and alarming rate, because the government expects to lull the cost of living increase at 19 percent by the end of the year." The newspaper survey has also determined "meat, rice, coffee, lentils, and several fruits are mostly responsible for February's inflation." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 Feb 94 pp 1a, 1b) The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) has reported the country's inflation rate amounted to 3.63 percent in February, "the highest February rate in the last 10 years." It has also reported "increased school tuitions and supplies and strong increases in the prices of certain produce prompted this month's increase in the cost of living."
