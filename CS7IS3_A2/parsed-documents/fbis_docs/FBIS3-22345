The minister was commissioned to visit Haag by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers. In Haag, a memorandum on mutual understanding regarding ecological cooperation was signed. Precisely how can the Netherlands help Ukraine? Although it is a small country, it has much experience in resolving ecological problems. The following was said on this topic by Yuriy Kostenko: Kostenko: "During the negotiations, emphasis was put on practical activities that are possible given the current situation in Ukraine. An entire range of concrete topics was proposed. First of all, there is ecological management and planning, protection of air, water resources, and protection of nature. Regarding practical implementation of these issues, we agreed to work out so-called pilot or demonstrative projects in each of these areas, meaning projects that could be financed and implemented in Ukraine. Based on these projects, we will be able to teach our specialists and pressure the appropriate authorities, to expand this experience to other territories. What does it mean? For example, regarding the quality of drinking water, we have requested that they help us work out an appropriate project and establish laboratories to control the quality of drinking water. This can be done with the help of money allocated by the Dutch Government. I expect that concrete results of the signing of this agreement will be visible this year." The second part of the news conference was devoted to Yuriy Kostenko's visit to the United States at the invitation of the Environmental Protection Agency. The minister briefed journalists on meetings with his U.S. colleagues, representatives of the World Bank, the Agency for International Development, and the Energy Department, as well as congressmen. As was emphasized, U.S. state departments expressed their interest in cooperating with Ukraine in the area of ecology, particularly, in establishing modern laboratories, conducting radiological monitoring, controlling the quality of water, reprocessing toxic waste, broadcasting ecological- educational television and radio programs, and developing an information and education center similar to the Kiev-Mohylanska Academy. The U.S. side is planning to allocate $6 million to these modest but, as we expect, fruitful projects.
