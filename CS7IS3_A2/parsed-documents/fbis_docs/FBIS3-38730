This was a decision made easier by the Senate's adoption, during a general foreign policy debate, of a recommendation that this should be done, supported in particular by veterans and former prisoners of war from both parties. The President needed all the help he could get on this sensitive subject: The organizations representing families of soldiers reported "missing in action" (MIA's) during the Vietnam War reject this additional step toward the normalization of relations between the former enemies, with, in particular, the opening of American Government offices in Hanoi. [passage omitted] It is therefore easy to understand that the President should start by expressing his conviction that his decision would make a full search possible: The progress in cooperation with Vietnam is tangible, he said, and the United States itself is devoting more effort to this question than at any other time in its history, the President said, citing the practical results obtained since he came to office. His decision was the result of careful consideration, he added, and was supported by all the experts inside and outside the White House: Vietnam's cooperation would be more effectively guaranteed by a policy of "involvement," but without going as far as "normalization," than by any continuation of the country's isolation. Is this really the end of the famous "Vietnam syndrome?" Many people in the White House, the Capitol, and the country, hope so. It is not completely certain, as demonstrated by the hostility which the President encountered last year when he paid his respects at the "wall," the memorial to the people who died in that war. As the President himself admitted, a whole generation is obsessed by the desire to know what happened to the soldiers who never came back, after the last repatriation of prisoners under the Nixon administration. However, over the years, this feeling has gradually given way to the desire to "be reconciled" with the past. [passage omitted] For American firms, the time to rush into this market, now described as "enormous," has certainly arrived: The big business lobby and oil companies at Westinghouse had been waiting impatiently for months. Forced to go through intermediaries, they saw their competitors, especially European competitors, establishing themselves and cleaning out this new country in which, they note in passing, 60 percent of the population was not born when the conflict was raging. The Democrats' new policy, aside from a less "automatic" link between humanitarian and commercial questions than campaign speeches suggested, is focused on economic recovery, and hence encouraging exports. Although President Clinton's personal position was bound to be extremely uncomfortable in this specific case, his decision is consistent with his priorities: To unite the country, and in particular to heal once and for all the emotional wounds of the Vietnam War, and to ensure economic recovery.
