The General Staff arranged a `war briefing' for President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on Turkey's new concept of threats yesterday. It has been ascertained that President Demirel asked for the surprise briefing, which was held in the General Staff Headquarters. [passage omitted] It was stressed at the briefing that the possibility of a threat from Greece has strengthened, particularly after Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou came to power in that country, and that the question of rearming the islands in the Aegean Sea has confirmed that state of affairs. It was also stressed that two-thirds of the Turkish Armed Forces' fighting personnel have been assigned to combat the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] in southeastern Turkey, and that this state of affairs has created a significant vacuum in the defense of the Aegean and Thrace regions. The officials at the briefing explained that shortages were mostly observed in the ground forces but not in the Air Force units and the Navy. They also explained that the struggle against the PKK has used up some military stocks, and that most of the resources of the Ground Forces Command have been transferred to the General Command of the Gendarmerie Forces to be used in the struggle against the PKK. That, they said, has created several logistical problems.
