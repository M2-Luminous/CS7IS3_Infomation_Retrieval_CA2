Boyev, director of the All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics Institute: "Why Aren't the Reforms Working?"] [Text] The profound crisis which is continuing in the agrarian sector is forcing many to think seriously about why the reforms being carried out in this sphere are not achieving their transforming purpose. What is the opinion on this score of agrarian scientists, first of all those who deal directly with problems of the reformation of economic relations in the village? Our correspondent, G. Vasilyev, has asked Academician of the Russian Agricultural Academy and Director of the All-Russian Scientific Research Agricultural Economics Institute, V. Boyev, to share them. Serious tactical errors in conducting it were committed from the very beginning of the agrarian reform. In particular, this applies to the priorities chosen, including the support of entrepreneurship in the form of trader middlemen ahead of agricultural producers, private and petty forms of farm management ahead of large-scale, premature orientation on world prices to the detriment of the parity of prices for agricultural and industrial products. Disparagement of the role of state regulation has had an especially negative effect on matters in the agro-industrial complex. This has been the consequence of treating it like the forms of administrative influence on production, which is incompatible with market relationships. Of course, the market, by its very nature, is a self-regulating system in many respects. However, it not only doesn't exclude but even presumes the need for state interference in order for it to invariably work for the strengthening and growth of the economy. Such an approach to the agro-industrial complex is determined by a number of objective reasons. Among them is the diversity of natural and climatic conditions in our country, given which it is important to create a system for protecting agricultural commodity producers and for insuring their activity. There is also the instability of prices and revenues in the agro-industrial complex, which depend both on natural factors and on market conditions. Moreover, a low degree of monopolization in agriculture and a high degree in the resource-supplying and service spheres is characteristic for Russia. The advisability of regulating the agro-industrial complex is confirmed also by the experience of countries with a market economy. Thus, in the USA, despite agriculture's high technological level, the state pays price subsidies to the farmers, monitors the maintenance of price parity, and finances the development of agricultural science and the social infrastructure from the federal budget. Programs for the construction of roads and social infrastructure facilties in rural localities are implemented through the budgets of the states and municipalities. The activity of state services in the USA is directed to the creation of favorable conditions for the market management of agriculture and at the same time it permits the maintenance of an economically and socially acceptable level of prices for food and other commodities. Regulation of the agrarian sector in the countries of the EEC and other states is organized in a similar manner. Their experience attests to the fact that, as market relations develop, state regulation of the national economy not only doesn't lose its significance but, on the contrary, becomes more complicated and is perfected. Rejection of it would mean rejection of the state itself. However, the market is to be combined not with any means of external influence. As conversion to it proceeds, fundamentally new methods of regulation must become predominant. Among them one should single out the program method. It means the combination of mechanisms for the self-regulation of the agricultural market with the development and implementation of programs for the functioning of the market and the development of the agro-industrial complex. The "planning-programming-budget development" system introduced in the USA in the '60s can serve as an example of such regulation. Planning was interpreted in this case to mean determination of the long-range goals and of the ways to achieve them. An average period program for its achievement was developed for each of the goals. Budgets (annual plans of activity, determination of revenue sources and the distribution of resources) were calulated on the basis of the programs. Analogous systems operate with well-defined information in Japan, Korea and other countries. This is especially characteristic for the stages of the fundamental structural reorganization of the economy. Objectively, such a process is also inevitable for Russia. At the same time the villagers expect from the state a price, finance and credit, and tax policy which would promote the stabilization and development of agrarian production. Today we observe the reverse image. The liberalization of prices, begun in 1992, has led to the drastic deterioration of the economic situation in the agrarian sector. This has occurred to no small degree because of the monopoly position of the enterprises which procure agricultural products and produce material-technical assets for the village. The gap in the growth rates of prices for industrial and agricultural products in 1993 has increased to more than twice the 1990 level as a result. One of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of price policy is the imperfection of the system being used for monitoring price parity. The result is the lack of an efficient system for restoring it. The entire tracking system comes down to the indexation of prices (more or less reliable and not always timely) and on this basis--to the subsidizing of the production of specific types of products. Forecasting of the price situation is essentially not being done. Hence the persistent miscalculations not only at the lowest but also at the highest level of the regulation of price relationships. In our opinion, it is important for the balanced development of the agro-industrial complex to achieve day-to-day tracking of the movement of prices for industrial goods and the products of agriculture and the processing industry, and of retail prices at the republic, regional, and local levels. As far as the monopolist enterprises of the resource-supplying sectors are concerned, then it is advisable to set maximum (predelnyy) prices for them and to adjust them periodically, taking the increase in the cost of energy resources and the inflationary growth of wages, as well as changes in tax and credit policy, into account. Under conditions of the absence of competition, the measure being proposed appears warranted. Of course, the situation when a price is established on the basis of free competition and neither an enterprise nor the state is able to increase or to reduce a price established on the basis of supply and demand is the best. If a commodity producer and wholesale and retail trade are in a position to arbitrarily increase a price, this is a sign not of market, but what is contrary to it, of the monopoly price-setting that we now observe. As a result the villager is not able to purchase agricultural machinery and to acquire even the necessary minimum of mineral fertilizers and other supplies. Such a situation has resulted in the significant growth in the labor intensity of the production operations being performed and in the prolongatiion of the periods for field work and in a great shortage of products. Serious errors have also been committed in financial policy. The existing system of state support is ineffective so far. It has not resolved the problems of stabilizing production, increasing the interest of commodity producers in augmenting food and raw material production and investment activity, and improving living conditions. The necessary stimuli for structural changes in the agro-industrial complex also have not been created. This is one of the reasons for the proposals recently advanced about the drastic curtailment or even termination of the financing of the agrarian sector, which would result in an even greater fall in agricultural production. As practice demonstrates, it is essential, especially in the period of the transition to the market, to strengthen financial support as one of the forms of state regulation of the agro-industrial complex and to impart to it a systems, goal-directed, and stimulating character. At the present time it should be linked, first of all, with overcoming the deficit of agricultural products and made available chiefly to those who guarantee the maintenance and, in the long run, the growth of production. The tax policy being followed also is not up to the tasks of stabilizing and developing the food market. Many of the taxes in use do not create an interest in expanding agricultural production and strengthening the village's material-technical base. They are very burdensome for the peasants. That is why it is advisable in their interests and those of the consumers of agricultural products to decrease the weight of taxation. With this aim in view it would be proper, at least for the period of the formation of market relationships, to revoke the tax on the profit of agricultural enterprises regardless of the structure of the products and services being sold, and to approach the setting of transfers to the employment fund differentially, by not imposing them on farms experiencing a personnel shortage. Exemption from the tax on the profit of agricultural, agroservice, and processing enterprises which goes for reinvestment (capital investments, reconstruction, technical retooling of production), as well as for the development of the social sphere, will help improve matters in the agro-industrial complex. In order to interest the manufacturer of products for the village in selling their goods at prices no higher than the maximum (fixed), one should set a differentiated percentage of reduction of the rate of the profit tax depending on the physical volumes of production achieved. It is advisable to set a maximum profit rate, and to not impose a tax on the profit received, for new, highly efficient products over a period of two to three years from the moment of their being put into series production. The granting of privileges to enterprises and organizations of other branches of the national economy who direct a portion of profit to the development of the agro-industrial complex would yield a considerable effect. This would help increase the inflow of capital into this sphere. There are also other suggestions with respect to rational taxation. They all are directed to creating favorable conditions for developing the agro-industrial complex and stabilizing the food market. Government regulation on the basis of well thought-out and effective utilization of price, financial, credit, tax, and other economic control levers should be subordinated precisely to this.
