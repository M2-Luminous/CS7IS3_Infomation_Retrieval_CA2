In his speech, as expected, the Lithuanian president devoted a great deal of attention to problems concerning Lithuanian-Russian relations, Baltic News Service reports. At the same time, Brazauskas urged the West to give stronger support to Central and Eastern European states in their aspirations to become members of the European Union. According to the president, the maintaining of good relations with the neighboring countries is a priority task for Lithuania, and so far there are no serious obstacles for Lithuania to have relations of good-neighborliness and cooperation with Russia, Poland, and Belarus. But the Lithuanian president drew attention to, according to him, a feature that has emerged lately in Russia's relations with its neighbors. Further events bear witness to the fact that it is not easy to change the established stereotypes in relations with smaller neighbors, stressed Algirdas Brazauskas. In his opinion, Russia's relations with the neighboring countries should correspond with universally recognized principles of international law. Russia's respect for the sovereignty of the Baltic states, the repudiation of the concept of Near Abroad, and the implementation of international agreements will accelerate a positive decision by the Council of Europe on the membership of that country. He said that it is especially important to Lithuania whether the Kaliningrad region, the former military advanced post of the Soviet Union, is gradually demilitarized and becomes an active business zone. We feel positive efforts by Moscow and Kaliningrad in this direction, but sometimes contrary tendencies can be noticed, too. Speaking of the expansion of the European Union, Algirdas Brazauskas noted that the success of the integration by the Baltic states is very dependent on Latvia's membership in the Council of Europe. A unique ethnic composition of the population created during the Soviet occupation has emerged in Latvia, but problems connected with this should not be cause the postponement of its full membership. Brazauskas said that, in his view, Russia was able to implement democracy and avoid the breakthrough of menacing military forces. Therefore, the procedure for Russia's membership started in the Parliamentary Assembly is a political and moral support for the democratic forces in that country. The withdrawal of the Russian Army from the territories of Latvia and Estonia by 31 August will very favorably reflect Russia's intention to peacefully regulate its relations with its neighbors. In his speech, the Lithuanian president assessed as a great political success the initialled Lithuanian-Polish treaty, which bears witness to the increasing mutual understanding of both nations and puts a juridical full stop to the historical disputes of both countries. He explained Lithuania's stance on the Jewish genocide during the Second World War. I grieve because of the large number of victims and regret that some Lithuanians took part in the punitive actions. Therefore, I firmly state that all criminals whom justice has not reached yet should be exposed and punished. We are doing this consistently and invite all the interested organizations and persons to cooperate. Maybe, not everything has been said about those tragic events, but we are not afraid to talk about this and with open hearts seek mutual understanding both with Israel and with Jewish communities in our and in other states. Speaking at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Brazauskas said that so far, only the irrevocability of the process of reforms has been assured in the country. But it has not yet been achieved that the reforms become a source of well-being and progress of all the citizens, Baltic News Service reports.
