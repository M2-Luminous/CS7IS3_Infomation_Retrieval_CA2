The reason for this is the gradual introduction of market forces into the Russian economy. In 1990 about 550,000 tons of air pollution was emitted--mainly sulphur--from the metal industry at Kola. About half of this came from Pechenganikel at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy in the vicinity of the Norwegian border. How large the emissions will be this year nobody knows, but because of the much reduced industrial production they will be considerably lower. In August of this year the production at Nikel was 45.7 percent lower than in August of last year. "During the last 20 years an incredible 9.6 million tons of sulphur dioxide have been emitted from the smelting works at Kola. The environmental destruction is enormous. Nobody should think that the problem has been solved even though market forces have taken a drastic bite out of this sulfuric hell," says Thomas Nilsen from Bellona. Depression In the mining and smelting cities on the Kola peninsula depression is spreading. Last Monday the labor office in the metal city of Monchegorsk issued the first official announcement from the large metal conglomerate that owns the smelting works: One thousand fifty people will be let go. Journalist Sergei Chukov from the newspaper MURMANSKII VESTIK thinks this is real. The workers will get the boot. In Russian industry such mass layoffs are something new. Locally at Kola the announcement from Monchegorsk is only viewed as a confirmation that the smelting industry is having a difficult time. Cutbacks Prices for raw materials on the world market are low. Authorities in Moscow seem to have tightened up again on how much of their income the conglomerate might dispose of. Severonikel at Monchegorsk is struggling with sky-high debts owed to both the nuclear power plant at Kola and the Murmansk Shipping Company, which is hauling the ore from the Siberian city of Norilsk to the Kola works. There are rumors about layoffs of thousands of people both at Monchegorsk and at the metal companies at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy, which are owned by the sister company Pechenganikel. Local sources describe the mood of the metal-producing cities as very depressed. Both at the metal works and at the nuclear power plant which supplies the industry with power, the workers presumably have not received full pay this fall. Previously the workers had contracts for five years or more. Now only a minority get a contract for more than a few months. Even people with a solid knowledge of Russia have difficulty explaining what is really happening in northwest Russia. On the one hand their industry seems to be marked by depression, heavy debt in rubles, and rapidly falling production. But on the other hand more Russian nickel is being sold abroad than at any other time, and income in dollars is high. Scientist Rune Castberg at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute is unsure whether what is happening at Kola is the result of a real economic crisis or whether the leadership has let the crisis run full course simply as a means of getting rid of superfluous employees. Castberg has for years worked with the Kola problems. He does not think that market forces and the gradual economic freedom in Russia will result in a complete halt in pollution from Kola. "Since the smelting works are there, it will benefit Russian society most to have as much activity there as possible. However, in the future production will to an increasing degree have to be profitable," Castberg says. He thinks it probable that the part of the metal industry that is dependent on ore transported from Siberia will disappear, and that the smelting industry based on the local ore will remain. But even though some slight degree of modernization has taken place during the last decades, the technology and the buildings are mainly from the 1940's and 1950's. Whether the conglomerate can afford to modernize to the degree necessary to keep up production in the future without economic aid from abroad is unclear. Skeptical of Support Castberg is skeptical as to whether Norway should give 300 million kroner in support of modernizing the smelting industry in Nikel in order to reduce emissions further. "I do not think this is the most efficient use of our money. We might rather help Pechenganikel achieve the full effect of the cleanup capabilities the company already has," Castberg says. The point is really that the production at the metal works has been reduced more than the pollution. This means that the companies are unable to clean the waste gas as well as they have previously. One of the reasons is a strong reduction in the production of sulfuric acid.
