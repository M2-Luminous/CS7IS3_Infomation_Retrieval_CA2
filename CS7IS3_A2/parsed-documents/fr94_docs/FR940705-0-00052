FR940705-0-00052 FR940705-0-00005 On January 5, 1994, the Commission approved for publication in the Federal Register an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which requested comment on the text of a two-page generic risk disclosure statement then the subject of multilateral discussions among international regulators. 7 The proposed text was intended to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC and thereby substitute for the statements required by rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10 as well as the special disclosures related to futures-style margining of options permitted on certain foreign exchanges. 8 7 59 FR 1506, 1508 (January 11, 1994). 8 See , e.g. , CFTC Advisory No. 90&hyph;1 [1987&hyph;1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶24,597 (disclosure statement relating to the deferred payment of option premiums, superseding separate disclosure addenda required by orders concerning the London International Financial Futures Exchange (54 FR 37636 (September 12, 1989)), the International Petroleum Exchange (54 FR 50356 (December 6, 1989)), and the London Futures and Options Exchange (renamed as the London Commodity Exchange) (54 FR 50348 (December 6, 1989)); and 55 FR 14238 (April 17, 1990) (Sydney Futures Exchange). The text of the generic risk disclosure statement regarding futures-style margining of the options premium is substantially similar to the language of the addenda referred to above. Comments on Advance Notice and Related Text Modifications The Commission received comments from the National Futures Association (NFA), the Futures Industry Association (FIA), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association (ABA), and Schulte Roth & Zabel (SRZ), a law firm. All commenters generally supported the Commission's proposal for a broader consolidated risk disclosure statement. The commenters particularly supported substituting the generic risk disclosure statement for the current rule 33.7 statement for domestic exchange-traded commodity options. The commenters generally believed that consolidation of risk disclosure statements into one concise document could increase the clarity of generic disclosure to customers and make the disclosure statement a more effective customer protection mechanism by focusing customers' attention on particular risks and upon obtaining adequate information on risks.
