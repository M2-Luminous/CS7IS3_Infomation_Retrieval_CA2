FBIS4-58369 "drnes086_j_94015" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen `Official' Statement Criticizes YSP Practices `Official' Statement Criticizes YSP Practices JN0305120594 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 3 May 94 JN0305120594 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by unidentified "official source" in Sanaa on 2 May] [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Every now and then and all of a sudden, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] political and media lies and deception machine produces false and deluding statements fraught with falsehoods, rancor, and obscenities. These statements are issued in the name of the YSP Political Bureau, its information center, or its illusionary Defense Ministry. The latest of these statements was disseminated yesterday by a Political Bureau spokesman through the official news media, which the YSP has turned into a deceptive stronghold to promote secessionist feelings and justify the use of aggressive means even if it drowns the national, Arab, and world public opinion with daily lies, fabrications, and falsehoods. All these actions denote a grudge against everything in our country; a relinquishment of all national and moral values and constitutional and legal principles; a blatant disavowal of the two accomplishments of unity and democracy; a deliberate vindictiveness with all means against the cause of responsible freedom; a growing hostility to and derision of the people's powers and the state institutions and agencies, particularly the House of Representatives, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and the military and security establishment. This is done for reasons known to the bloody and domineering secessionist elements in the YSP, who are still suffering from (?thirst) for absolute power, the dictatorship of a single party, and a deceitful grudge against all those who are assuming national responsibility in any position, even if they were from within the YSP leadership itself, unless they are the ones in power and unless all strategic joints of power are in their hand and not others whoever they may be and regardless of the people's will and the results of the real elections. This fact was also confirmed by the treacherous acts against themselves throughout the past historical stages of which we remind the people without needing to explain in detail. These acts consecrated their personal interests and their pragmatic political creed because any position occupied by any of them in the party is above all positions of official responsibility within the state. They consider the party to be above all powers and that no voice should rise above that of the party, even if it is the voice of the people through the ballot boxes and the exercise of democracy by all bodies. This is the secret behind the Political Bureau members' strife over government portfolios and over their distribution in a regional spirit which [words indistinct] any of them. They thus ignore the fact that the Yemeni homeland, since the dawn of Yemen's unity on 22 May, 1990, has ascended to a new historic era and new civilisation where power rests only with the people. It is the people who can decide the fate of the homeland, now that they, once and for all, buried the state of division, toppled the one-party dictatorship, banished from their life and land the venomous ideas, and committed themselves to the option of democracy and political party pluralism in a free society and a unitary democratic state whose constitutional institutions are the property of the people. This is because such a society is the result of a free will and responsible human action as it manifested itself in a lofty reality and civilized achievement on 27 April, 1993 when the Yemeni homeland launched a new march to pursue building its modern and developing life under a popular consensus. The new march has shown all the Yemeni people to be able to move with the times and to fulfill the requirements of sustained great struggle for political, economic, and cultural progress on the road and pride, equality, justice, dignity, virtue, and morality. From the beginning, these principles were opposed by the people who harbored hatred for unity, democracy, and the building of the institutions of the unitary state. They used all forms of circuitous and veiled sabotage and job distribution by a diabolical exploitation of freedom, tolerance, dialogue, and openness until their scheming against unity and democracy was exposed. All their plans of disinformation were exposed during the crisis -- a crisis that was fabricated skillfully and that peaked in the rebellion against constitutional legitimacy including an infringement of military [word indistinct] with an eye to attaining two aims: Rebellion against the authorities of the unity state, or secession in order to return to the one-party dictatorship in the six governorates that knew bitterness and torment before 22 May, 1990. Toward that end, the elements that had control over the party blocked the enactment of uniform legislation and the unification of the state institutions. They also impeded the integration of the Armed Forces into one national institution and the disengagement of the officers, noncommissioned officers and ordinary ranks from loyalty to the party. These elements reacted to all national, sincere calls by condemning and disrupting all efforts aimed at unifying the Armed Forces through procrastination and outright rejection. We would ask these: How does your feigned [word indistinct] to an integration of the Armed Forces square with your demolition of these forces, with your party plunging the Armed Forces into bloody fighting and massing forces along old border lines in order to trigger warfare among the sons of the homeland? Where are do the military personnel rightly belong? Should they be part of advancing decent life and sharing in shouldering responsibility or in the graves scattered at the approaches of every village? They thus confirm that the party's rejection of all efforts to integrate the Armed Forces is aimed at affording it the opportunity to retain control over certain units as a means of advancing the aforementioned goals if political action does not succeed or if the rioting, assassinations, and sabotage, and other means fail -- actions that are backed up by a brazenly hostile information policy that peaked toward the end of the provisional period. This policy exacerbated and became more frenzied when those secessionist elements who hold sway over the media and official institutions in the economic and trade capital of Aden took charge last December. These elements allowed official media to become involved in the quagmire of the crisis as an advanced instrument for deception, for casting doubts about all national values and principles, and for fragmenting national unity. One of the ugly aspects of this policy manifested itself through the repeated announcement banning citizens from entering their economic and trade capital of Aden [words indistinct] the good militant Yemeni people in statements issued by the highest echelons in the party [words indistinct] in addition to harming all the national leaders and symbols. The party has become addicted to this condition even when it unabashedly deals with its own leaders. The same applies to fabricating accusations, concocting justifications, and issuing directives to the commands of the units which they control to have them fight their brothers as part of a dark and treacherous chain in the crisis. Unfortunately, such a thing recently took place in 'Imran among the comrades in arms and represented a momentous national loss for the people and the national military establishment. This fact denotes the intentions to continue the heated confrontation the secessionist clique holding sway within the YSP command had wanted, planned for, and is implementing as a means to attain the secessionist objectives and to implement the plan of fragmenting the Yemeni homeland as defined by the hatred of their masters and by their own designs. However, these schemes will utterly fail as did the previous ones thanks to the alertness of the people and all their sons in the Armed Forces and the Public Security and thanks to the wisdom of their political leadership and the confrontation of the unionist forces of what is now endangering the people's lives and harming their eternal unity. All this targets the Yemeni people's free and united state. The people realize that those who harbor rancor against them and against the authorities will not hesitate to carry out any form of treacherous aggression. The Yemeni people strongly believe that when they established a new Yemen through freedom and democracy that enhances the march of the homeland of freedom, dignity, loftiness, and equality, there will be no individual in this homeland who will regret the era of oppression, darkness, repression and blood baths, whether those represented by the repressive Imamate era, [words indistinct] colonialism, or class and regional hatred. It does not befit our lofty Yemeni people to go back to the eras of the bloodbaths which one of the YSP leaders referred to in a joking manner but which made him lose his life. [Words indistinct] clarifies that the YSP Political Bureau is made up of a group of people who destroy one another. If this is the case, what happens when they deal with the oppressed citizens? In spite of this, we strongly believe that no force or person in Yemen can trample democracy and constitutional legitimacy as it is now more sacred and loftier than [word indistinct] henchmen of the party dictatorship, and those who advocate the return to the totalitarian or secessionist rule. We say to those that the accord document is being distorted by false philosophical statements and the entire people began to sympathize with the values and ambitions which the document contained [words indistinct] who each day create objectionable reasons to prevent progress through the state's constitutional bodies and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee toward implementing the accord document. We also say that those who are showing off their intelligence in [word indistinct] national awareness and are inventing analysis at the level of political speeches and words despite their spirit and clarity enjoy lying to all the people who listened to the speech which brother comrade 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, delivered at the 70 Square during the anniversary of democracy day on 27 April when their bad intentions made them imagine that his speech included a declaration of war on everyone in the same way that they understood the slogan of unity or death in the speech which he delivered in front of a large crowd of citizens in Ta'izz Governorate when he visited it last January. As for being subservient to outside forces, events throughout history have confirmed this, whether it was to the despotic regime or those preceding or coming after it. It is as if the YSP cannot exist without being subservient to some master. In conclusion, our people have a firm and unshakable faith that unity and democracy will triumph on the Yemeni soil because the great hopes to start a new life by overcoming all obstacles and challenges is a reality that cannot be canceled or denied. Moreover, understanding the crisis and all its bad aspects permitted a breakthrough so that prospects would open again for the marvels of work and generosity and for championing the will of goodness and construction. Therefore, we caution the good and unionist brothers in the YSP to quickly save the party from this destructive clique. Authority is not something pampered but is the right of the people who approve and develop it with their free democratic will. Unity is not a game that ends as soon as it starts. It is a sacred historical and cultural value and a historical accomplishment that champions the eternal presence of people and their land as a history and immortal fate in the past and present. Moreover, the pillars of the Yemeni homeland are not as soft as those rash secessionists imagine. The innocent members of the YSP have had enough bitterness in their lives and hearts because of the conspiracy, and they should be saved from the humiliation resulting from the stands of the domineering secessionist elements toward the people's greatest and most serious issues, foremost of which is the issue of unity and democracy. Our Yemeni people are well aware of those secessionists and are waiting for them.' [Dated] 2 May 1994
