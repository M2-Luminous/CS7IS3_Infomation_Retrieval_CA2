We will also abandon the Kalmyk citizenship, Russia should have Russian citizenship," Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told a parliament meeting here today. "Russia is single and indivisible. Its revival is impossible without the revival of national provinces and the revival of provinces is impossible without the revival of the whole state," he stressed. Ilyumzhinov suggested to terminate the validity of the Kalmyk Constitution on March 25 and form a delegation to meet Russian President Yeltsin. He wants to ask "the president for an instrument of ratification to give him or another official the power to be named president, governor or head of the republic for five-ten years. The decision is up to the Russian president".
