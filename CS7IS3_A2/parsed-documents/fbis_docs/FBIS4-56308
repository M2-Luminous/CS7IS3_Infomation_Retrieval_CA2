The news conference was convened to announce an increase in long-distance telephone rates in Panama effective 1 May. The director of the telephone company (INTEL), in opening the news conference, outlines the rate increase. At 1525 GMT, the microphone is ceded to Endara who, commenting on several journalists' recent requests for interviews, says: "I told them that I would not agree to interviews, particularly in view of the large number of international journalists interested in seeing me. I told them I am not the star of this election process and that therefore they should not regard me as such in their coverage of it. On election day I will be just another voter. "I intend to make a public statement. In fact, I am making one now, which I have been preparing for a long time. "A very important event will take place on 2 May. For the first time in the history of Panama's popular elections, the Executive will vest its authority in the Electoral Tribunal. This concept was tested, so to speak, during the referendum, and it worked fine. This is provided for in the law and has been so ordered by the Executive. This has been approved by the Assembly and will be enforced. We hope all future governments will do the same. "So I will make statements on 2 May. I will talk to you people on election day wherever I happen to be, and respond to any questions. The 8 May elections will be very special. "Some of you might wonder if we are doing this because the elections will be held in a few days. No, gentlemen. In my speech at the National Theater, where we pledged to hold pure and honest elections, I said that although I would not be the star of the election process, I would continue to work in the government as usual, that I would suspend nothing, that I would continue to work as usual until 1 September. I said that the fact that elections were going to be held did not entail suspending our work and being idle. I will keep working because I have pledged to work for the people until 1 September. So this measure is not the result of a political decision, but the result of a work done by INTEL for over two years." At 1529 GMT, Endara goes on to discuss the decision to sell various government assets in the Colon Free Zone, the need to develop all assets of the Panamanian people to ensure development, and his intention to return to private practice as a lawyer after his presidential term ends. The 29-minute news conference ends at 1546 GMT, at which point the relay ends.
