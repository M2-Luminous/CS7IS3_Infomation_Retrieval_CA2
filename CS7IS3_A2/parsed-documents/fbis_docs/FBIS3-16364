This debt is half of all non-payments in the Russian economy. Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told parliament hearings on non-payments today that the fuel and energy situation is most complicated and fraught with grave consequences for both the complex and the whole economy. A reason for this is insufficient circulating assets of enterprises, imperfection of the legislation and low financial discipline of consumers, said Shafranik. In his opinion, it is necessary to adopt a decree on regulated payments for fuel and energy in order to ensure severe sanctions against the non-payers and their priority payments for the supplies. Off-setting of mutual obligations of the budget and fuel and energy enterprises, as well as the transfer of the 2,500,000,000,000 ruble debt of Commonwealth states to the complex's account will help settle the problem as well. Experts believe 1,500,000,000,000 rubles worth of allocations and off-setting of mutual debts worth 5,000,000,000,000 rubles would be enough to remove financial tension in the fuel and energy complex.
