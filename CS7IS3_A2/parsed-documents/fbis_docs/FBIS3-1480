Lewis] [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples Organisation [Azapo] on Monday blamed the mayhem in Johannesburg earlier in the day on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], saying its members should return to their senses. It added, however, that the African National Congress was also to blame for the general political rivalry as both it and the IFP did not adhere to the democracy they often preached. "The IFP has acted irresponsibly and cowardly by killing innocent black people, especially children and pensioners. The power struggle between the IFP and the ANC is causing many black lives to be lost. What they are doing is not benefiting black people but dividing them," said Azapo Central Wits [Witwatersrand] region Chairman Jeff Seitshiro.
