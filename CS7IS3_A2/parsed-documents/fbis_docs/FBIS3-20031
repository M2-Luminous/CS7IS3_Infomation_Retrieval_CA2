However, Granic does not believe that the Bosnian Serbs would want to join the federation negotiated by the Muslims and Croats on an equal basis. Granic also foresees difficulties in negotiations with the Serbs in Krajina. Antti Halinen reports. [Begin recording] [Halinen] Granic, who was on a short visit to Helsinki, said that he is hopeful about the agreement on a federation signed by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. [Granic, in English] Concerning the future federation between the Muslims and Croats, I am optimist. [Halinen] The situation there is better day by day. According to Granic, arrested people have been released, aid convoys can move again, and the confidence-building has started again. I think that the great majority of the Muslims and Croats supports the agreement, Granic says. [Granic, in English] I think that very strong majority Muslims and Croats support it, the future federation. [Halinen] Granic believes that the Bosnian Serbs will join the negotiations, but there are not many signs that they would join the agreement between the Muslims and Croats on an equal basis. [passage omitted] According to Foreign Minister Granic, the first task is to create a lasting and universal cease-fire. According to Granic, the main problem in the negotiations with the Krajina Serbs is that they do not want autonomy but an independent state, and that is out of the question. [Granic, in English] Definitely no state in the state, I told yesterday and two days ago... [Halinen, interrupting] According to Granic, Croatia is prepared to grant the Krajina Serbs a local autonomy that is internationally monitored in two areas, but Croatia will not negotiate on regional integrity and sovereignty. Behind the unbending attitude of the Krajina Serbs is the support of Serbia and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, according to Granic. Granic says that more than 7,000 men and a lot of military equipment came from Serbia during last year to help the Serbs in Krajina. That is why it is not easy to find a solution in the negotiations without Belgrade's cooperation, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic says. [end recording]
