This reporter learned a few days ago from the Xian Unmanned Aircraft Development Center that the B-7 pilotless plane researched and developed by the center had passed the examination of a ministerial-level design and model inspection authority. The plane is of an advanced small piston-engine type weighing 90 kg, with a maximum speed of 100 m a second and an elevation range of over 5,000 m; the range of remote control exceeds 40 km and the cruising range is 60 minutes. The plane is equipped with computerized electronic systems, integrated circuit wiring, digitized command codes, integrated module-scanning, an "automated return-flight aviation system," a 360- degree directional setting capability, and a car-mounted capability while it is on the ground. The aircraft technology that went in the making of the unmanned plane has reached the advanced standard of other similar international plane products. In 1958, the Xibei University of Industry successfully test-flew No "04" unmanned plane, opening a new era in our country's unmanned aircraft development. The B-1 target drone successfully researched and developed by the university on the basis of its experience in remote-controlled plane models has gone into factory production. A total of more than 6,000 of the B-2 target drones that came out in 1971 have been produced, many of them exported to countries in Southern Asia, Africa, and South America.
