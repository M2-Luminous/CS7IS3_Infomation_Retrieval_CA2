He said its launching pads for environmentally-safe new-generation boosters would provide all necessary orbit inclinations which can now be achieved only at the Baykonur cosmodrome situated in Kazakhstan. During a meeting with military attaches of other countries outside Moscow on Wednesday, Ivanov gave an overview of Russia's military space forces, calling for greater space cooperation with Russia. He said the MSF had 50,000 persons as well as launch pads and equipment designed for testing space-related hardware and launch spacecraft with the help of Russian-built light, medium and heavy class boosters such as Kosmos, Tsiklon, Vostok, Soyuz, Molniya, Zenit, Proton and Energia. On the fate of the Baykonur facility, Ivanov said "we are well aware of the need to resolve the problem and would like to see it functioning in the future."
