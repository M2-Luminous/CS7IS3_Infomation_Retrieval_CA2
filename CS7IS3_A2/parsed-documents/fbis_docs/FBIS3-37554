No details have been reported so far. There are every grounds to think, however, that St. Petersburg television is rapidly being taken over by an international information tycoon, one of the richest Italians -- Silvio Berlusconi, who was one of the first to have launched his commercial television network in Europe. Berlusconi's representatives have spent the past two years working on Petersburg chiefs starting with Mayor Sobchak. They seem to have succeeded by finishing before other rivals who are eager to get the Neva [St. Petersburg] airwaves. Incidentally, the tycoon also owns the "Milan" soccer club. Does this mean they are not going to say anything good about "Spartak" on Channel Five?
