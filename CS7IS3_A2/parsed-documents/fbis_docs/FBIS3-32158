As a result, the economic team is "reviewing the figures" so that the deficit does not surpass 0.5 percent of the GDP, Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas said. In an interview granted to radio station CX 24 Nuevotiempo, the minister confirmed in broad outline the economic measures contemplated for 1994. He made a positive balance of the government's economic policy and, analyzing his recent interpellation by Congress on the national industrial situation, he again criticized Congress for what he called its rejection of the implementation of structural reforms. The minister justified the hard tone he used to reproach opposition congressmen over their "double discourse." He said that the promoters of the interpellation had "political intentions," particularly Senator Hugo Batalla, and added that they had thus been trying to "recover a lost role as protagonists." De Posadas held the Broad Front, the New Sector coalition, Crusade 94, and the Batalleist Forum responsible for increasing the expenses approved by Congress during the debates for the approval of the last national budget. The minister emphasized the "contradictory position" adopted by these parties and said that, while proposing a constitutional reform to allow a more smooth administration, they "prevent the administration from governing the country, and paralyze the Executive Branch." After pointing out that despite the unfavorable international situation the national employment and salary indexes are acceptable, the minister criticized the opposition's "refusal to accept the government achievements, and their drastic attitude in calling for an interpellation." The minister said this attitude is motivated by political reasons. Regarding the industrial area's situation, the minister admitted that several industries are facing hard times, and said that these difficulties are "normal in a process of transformation." He denied the need to protect the industries, and pointed out that Uruguay has the largest list of exceptions in the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] customs fees reduction process, as well as several mechanisms -- such as the minimum export prices, reference prices, and a board to evaluate imported products -- to protect its industry. He said there are some 50 such measures. "No administration can guarantee economic welfare; this does not exist. It is senseless and entirely absurd, in addition to harmful, to ask the government to say which economic sector will survive and which will not," he said. He deemed the Chamber of Industries document analyzing the situation of the industrial sector "slightly inconsistent." He said the Chamber "criticizes the idea of reducing customs fees, and says that this has not been reflected in the economy or forced prices down, because the middlemen keep the difference. If this were true, however, the industries would still have no reason for concern, because any other effective protection is similar to what we had previously." He also refuted the assertion that the government is not stimulating the productive sector. As an example, he said that the tax exemption granted to the companies deemed of national interest represents a $50 million to $60 million drop in government revenue.
