"The State Duma has from the first to show itself as a proponent of a strong Russia," Olesk said. "The Russian president and government would rather avoid a sharp clash with the State Duma. "Obviously, if Russia again begins to lay claim to the Baltic Sea, our independence gets in the way," Olesk noted. The population minister admitted that some of Russia's latest anti-Baltic statements may be "purely propaganda." "This, however, shouldn't mislead us," Olesk said. "It is not in the interests of the Western powers that another hotbed of tension emerge in Europe. "In this case, they may insist that we conduct a consistent policy that doesn't put up the back of Russia or its citizens abroad." Olesk said Russian officials' statement that Russia won't allow a security vacuum in Estonia gives cause for worry. "It gives to understand, among other things, that it is Estonia's independence without the presence of foreign troops that creates a security vacuum," he said. "I don't hesitate to say that Moscow attaches great importance to leaving behind a great number of Russians to be used as a tool for interfering in Estonian domestic affairs and Estonia's fate. "Russia needs a pretext for protecting Russians' interests in Estonia, not for protecting them in Russia," Olesk charged. The minister maintained Russia's ideology is largely based on the principle of dual citizenship. "If we don't know the identity of Russian citizens residing in Estonia, it may easily happen that those anonymous citizens get involved in provocations and Estonian policy acquires the reputation of failing to guarantee the security of Russian citizens," Olesk said. The population minister gave top priority to the continuation of the Estonian-Russian negotiations as a means for ironing out problems between the two countries.
