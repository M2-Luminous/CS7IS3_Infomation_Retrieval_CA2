The Kamogawa Town office in Okayama Prefecture, western Japan, enacted a unique local regulation in April calling on its people to conduct their own rescue operations in countries stricken by disasters and war. This will be the first overseas dispatch of its officials under the regulation. It is very unusual for Japanese local governments to have such a rule, town officials said. The two officials, Noboru Nishida, 45, and Kiyoshi Okada, 41, will fly first from Tokyo to Geneva where they will visit such U.N. bodies as the World Health Organization (WHO). After entering the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the two will have a first-hand look at situations there and study how Japanese nongovernmental organizations and U.N. bodies are helping local people. After their return, the town plans to draw up a concrete program for its own international assistance that will be applied to other countries in the future, the town officials said.
