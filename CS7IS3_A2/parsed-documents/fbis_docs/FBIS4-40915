[passage omitted] Was the latest agreement what the country needed? Was it something you were looking for? [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. Let me remind you that we did not enter Abkhazia for war. The war with the Abkhaz is as meaningless and absurd as was the adventurist war against the Ossetians which was started irresponsibly. The most persuasive argument in favor of what I said is the fact that we signed peace accords at the time when we still held positions on the River Psou. That document was in full agreement with the interests of both Georgia and the Abkhaz people. Our further efforts were also aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict. I said from the outset that a war between the Georgians and Abkhaz was inadmissible. What happened? Why were we punished so cruelly despite the fact that the entire world, including the UN and other international organizations, supported us? Georgia's biggest mistake after the disintegration of the Soviet Union was to pursue a reckless policy toward Russia. This was not state diplomacy, but street diplomacy, if I may put it so. It was impossible to change that policy in a short period of time. It became the main reason for all our troubles. A lot has changed since then. That defect in Georgian state policy was eliminated. We are now building friendly and good- neighborly relations with Russia which are based on mutual trust. Apart from that, Georgia has become a member of the CIS and the Collective Security Council. One of the main tasks of these international regional organizations is to guarantee the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of member states. [passage omitted] It should be taken into account that the Abkhaz side is an active and fairly constructive participant in political dialogue. There have already been several meetings in Geneva, Moscow, Sochi, and elsewhere, and they have produced certain results. War and instability are ruinous not only for Georgia but also for the Abkhazes, and they know this full well. If a Federation Council meeting to be addressed by [Russian Defense Minister] Grachev does take place tomorrow, and if the Federation Council supports President Yeltsin's edict on this issue, then an operation should start in the next few days, perhaps in two or three days. The operation should have started on the 17th or 18th. Orders were issued and everything was ready for that. However, the heated debate and complications in our parliament became, to a certain extent, an obstacle for the timely start of this operation. At least, that is what I think. The whole world will be a witness to this historic operation. I state without exaggerating that it will be a historic operation, carried out primarily by Russia, which will determine the future of Georgia and perhaps other countries as well. Judging by its form, content, and objectives and by the scope of the involvement of international organizations, I think that this operation will be an original and ingenious solution to the problem. Since I briefly mentioned the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in my answer to your question, I would like to speak a little more about it. The Georgian-Ossetian dialogue has resumed. Judging by this dialogue and by what has happened in the region in recent months, it can be said that we took the right decision as regards the introduction of peace-keeping forces to the region, which laid the foundation for a full-scale settlement. We took the right decision when we signed the Dagomys Agreement with President Yeltsin and the Ossetian side [on a tripartite peace-keeping operation in South Osetia]. The agreement reached during the latest meeting attended by members of our office, Vazha Khachapuridze, who is a deputy, Nodar Lomauri, and others is a good start. Agreement was reached on such issues as the need to combine efforts to achieve stabilization in the entire region, to fight crime and drug trafficking, to restore business ties - you know how extensive these ties used to be - and to ensure the safety of travel, which is very important. Agreement was also reached to restore road and rail links with Tskhinvali and villages. This is necessary and very important. Some other issues were also agreed, which I believe is a good start. Russia's mediation and active position is very useful for this dialogue. The Russian unit which is now stationed in Tskhinvali is playing a very active role in this. I would like to say a few warm words about Mr. Pavlov, or, rather, General Pavlov, who treats both sides' interests with much understanding and is doing many other good things. The active position of CSCE representatives is also very useful for this diologue, as is, of course, the role of the leadership of North Ossetia, which supports a fair and objective settlement of the conflict. There have been some positive developments in this area and think this process will become even more dynamic. [Oniani] Georgia is a CIS member state, and we are all interested in how this new organization is going to develop. You have spoken more than once in your interviews about your vision of the future of the CIS. I would like to ask you how promising you think [Kazakh President] Nazarbayev's project is. [Shevardnadze] First of all, I would like to say that I believe that the CIS as an international and interstate organization has ample resources for further development. As for Mr. Nazarbayev's proposals and his project, which he sent to me, I have examined it carefully and in detail. Some deputies who have never set their eyes on this project or its author vilified it in the parliament. Using such illegitimate methods to criticize important documents does their dignity no good. If the author agrees, I would like this document to be published in our country and elsewhere. The Russian president said it was necessary to think about this initiative, which is understandable and right since the document deals with such complex and important issues that it is difficult to pass judgement on it after reading or looking through it only once. Its name does not represent a problem at all. The main thing is the essence. In my opinion, the essence of this document is that it creates more guarantees for the independence of states and calls for more integration among states. This applies to the economic and even military sphere and so on and so forth. It resembles the European Union model. [passage omitted] I think that we should examine in a calm and businesslike manner any sensible idea concerning the future of new relations among states. I believe that Nazarbayev's proposal is one such interesting idea. [Oniani] You had a meeting with bank representatives last week, where you spoke about the necessity for reorganization and reforms in the banking system. You have also mentioned that the Georgian economy is now entering a stage of reforms. Our country should become a country of bold experiments. Is the section of the population that we call businessmen ready for this? Or, how honest can Georgian business be? How much do you think it is involved in political processes? [Shevardnadze] Georgian business is now at a shape-up stage. It requires help and assistance. That is why I spoke about a reform in banking. Although banking is considered a difficult area for launching experiments or entrepreneurship, I believe that banking-- the financial sphere generally and the economy on the whole--needs initiative, entrepreneurship, creative approaches, and experiments, if anything. Georgia should gain a reputation as a country of bold experiments, and I am confident that foreign investors will take a much stronger interest in Georgia, provided we succeed in securing stability in the country and we are moving in this direction. An edict I signed that opens a new stage of privatization in Georgia is also aimed at this reforms, at this task. I should tell you that I had been working on this edict for seven or eight months, back when there were seven or eight ideas on the subject in the Cabinet of Ministers. Businessmen need protection most of all. First steps have been taken, and the country has entered a phase of a sort of stability. Now we are contemplating bringing order to the activities of controlling bodies. This is the most painful issue for Georgian business--bankers and businessmen. I am for the earliest possible creation of proprietors within the population, and I do want more and more people to become proprietors. A proprietor's initiative, creative activity, and--I would say--a proprietor's vigor and persistence should save the country's economy. I am declaring with all responsibility that the state is the first to care about businessmen, about business with all its structures. We are pursuing this aim with consistency and on a large-scale and are considering our own mistakes as well as those of others. In addition, I would like to raise the issue of law drafting. My address to the parliament was not incidental. A movement has already begun and work has also begun. The parliament has started to consider a very important draft law that was drafted and presented by [Justice Minister] Tedo Ninidze, together with others. This is a draft law on entrepreneurship. This will be a foundation for the development of entrepreneurship in Georgia. The meeting with bankers has also revealed that we are in need of many laws, without which we will have no means to clear the obstacles for Georgian business. If passing of laws in the parliament is impeded, I will be forced to issue decrees on some of the topics. [Oniani] Last week you were present at a military exercise in Batumi involving units of Russian troops stationed in the republic. You saw a lot of weapons there--for example, Grad installations and others, which just a few months ago were used to shell you and Georgian fighters in Sukhumi. Your next encounter with Russian weaponry took place in the serene atmosphere of a Batumi training ground. What happened in the meantime? Was it Shevardnadze who changed or, perhaps, the Russian military or, indeed, something else? [Shevardnadze] Let us discuss who changed and who did not at a different time. Now I would like to say a few words about this joint exercise. This was indeed very important, and I returned from it very satisfied. Moreover, I saw that the two Batumi battalions that are to take part in the peace mission were ready to be deployed. With regard to the exercise.... [pauses] We are now creating an army. We need an army today or tomorrow, not in the remote future. Under such circumstances, one should make use of something that is within their reach and something that is realistic. It is within our reach to cooperate with the Russian Armed Forces and, in doing this, to build a new army with their assistance. That is why I went to Batumi. Of course, there were other reasons for my visit as well--talking to Batoni Aslan [Abashidze, Supreme Council chairman and prime minister of Ajaria], sightseeing in Batumi, and so on. I also urge other units to invite our young people who are already in the Army or are about to start service as often as possible. You know that the Russian Army has enormous experience, and--if we want to build an army soon--we should learn from this experience as quickly as possible. I will visit other units in the future. You know that Russian units are in Akhalkalaki and Vardzia. I am planning to visit these units too and to do everything to ensure that their condition of life and service are normal and that our people's attitude to them is normal and dignified. I want them to feel that they are living and serving in a friendly country. At the same time, we should use this foundation to speed up the building of a single, mobile, and efficient army. I believe that this process is now starting to develop on a firm foundation. I must also say that the newly-appointed minister [Defense Minister Varden Nadibaidze]--well, he is not that new any more and his colleagues are now working in a rather active manner to speed up the building of a single army.
