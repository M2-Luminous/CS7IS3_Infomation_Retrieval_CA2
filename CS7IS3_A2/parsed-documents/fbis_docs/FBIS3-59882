An end to the uncertainty of the new recruits. Enough of "the slave market" in the courtyard of the Absorption and Classification Center, to the bargaining between the corps of the army and "the fresh meat" that is unloaded from the buses. Next week, the first class of recruits, of which a portion already knows where it is going in the army even before it sets foot in the Absorption and Classification Center, will be on its way. The other part, which does not yet know, will still go through the old route. In February, so they are hoping in the IDF [israel Defense Forces], everything will change, everything will be new. The IDF worked for years with a method that was not examined, but became a norm. The method was called "the orders method": every candidate for defense service (Mashlab) received sometime in 11th grade "the first order," that white envelope with the army stamp. He opened it, understood that the end of youth had arrived, and ran immediately to his buddies. The Mashlab was called to report to the Mobilization Bureau and to go through the first of the seven circles of Hell, at the end of which he would get a personal number and he would become a soldier in the army of the Jewish people. Afterwards, after a few months, the Mashlab--the high-school pupil who had not yet lost his long hair and the earring--received "the second order," another nail in the coffin of youth, and he again made his way, with some scorn, to the Mobilization Bureau. The goal this time--psychotechnical examinations, medical examinations for evaluation, with a female soldier only a few months older than he but who thinks that she is at least as smart as God. On the basis of these examinations, a profile was determined for the Mashlab (another number, mightily fateful) and the Kaba (quality group), and afterwards he was given a mobilization date. With these statistics, the recruit arrived at the Absorption and Classification Center (generally after a massacre of a haircut), to the meeting with the classification officer. On the way, he went through the chain of becoming a soldier, which included injections, a photograph with a number, fingerprints, and one unavoidable question: "To whom to you wish to bequeath the money if, heaven forbid..." In that discussion with the classification officer, which generally lasted a minute and a half (depending on the patience and the length of the line), the impatient classification officers would present the frightened recruit the possibilities before him. For example: artillery, armor, or combat engineering. The recruit had only to rank these possibilities by preference. That is exactly how it worked, but around this rapid and nervous process they wrapped high-sounding words like "consideration for the desires of the soldier and the requirements of the system." The chief of the Manpower Branch of the general staff, Major General Yoram Ya'ir, was the first one, who during the past year set a target before his people: to change the clumsy, outmoded, and wasteful method of classification and mobilization. Ya'ir brought a new idea, which was intended to make the old method more efficient, to spare the young soldier the tension and the uncertainty, and to spare the IDF system the traffic jam in the Absorption and Classification Center. In the previous method, the recruit was sometimes forced to wait a number of weeks until the completion of the quota required for opening basic training. Meanwhile, the recruits would carry out "interesting" busy work such as painting the trees in the Absorption and Classification Center or repainting the curbs. A pleasure. A deep and fundamental change was made in the new method, which begins to go into operation, as was stated, next week. The basic idea: instead of examining the recruit's preference only in the Absorption and Classification Center, the stage of the questions and the clarifications will be carried out several months before induction. A form, with a summary of his data and the possibilities open to him, will be sent to each recruit at home, just like the registration process for university. Under the heading "The Mobilization Method Mobilizes for You," the recruit is asked to specify the unit to which he prefers to be called, the classification is carried out afterwards, and in the end each recruit receives a notice of where he has been assigned. This happens a few months before induction. Maj. Gen. Ya'ir, the father of the method, presented it to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to Chief of Staff Ehud Barak, and the two approved it. There were those who raised an eyebrow and asked why did they wait with it for so many years. Where were all of the geniuses before that. In the IDF they say that the new method will make it possible for the military to get an overall picture of the recruits and will prevent pressure on the Absorption and Classification Center. The end has come for the era of lobbying by the members of the various service arms to entice the soldiers with worn-out image films, presented by smiling paratroopers, that hid the blood, the sweat, and the tears. The commanders of the units to which they will be mobilized already await the recruits who will arrive next week at the Absorption and Classification Center. The commanders will accompany them throughout the process, and will reduce, so it is hoped, their tension. Those recruits who will seek to challenge their attachment to an armored company and who will prefer to serve in the IDF spokesman's film unit, for example, are promised a hearing. The answer also is promised. (Army, baby, do not deceive yourself. Armor!) The military is saving tens of millions of shekels through the new method. After the run of the test program in the November mobilization, it will continue also in the following mobilizations. And if you, those who have not yet been drafted, receive the questionnaires at home in these days--sit quietly, think for a moment, fill out the questionnaires carefully, and cross your fingers. Hard. You are next in line.
