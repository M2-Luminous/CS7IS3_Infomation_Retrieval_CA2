Despite some very friendly gestures at the meeting, some preannounced agreements were not signed, among them a transborder agreement. [Drzycimski] It is a fact that there was a readiness on our part to sign the two agreements, but the Slovaks were not technically prepared to do so. From what President Kovac told us during the bilateral talks, they have 14 more agreements ready in their initial form, so it could be expected that during both the ministers' and the prime ministers' mutual visits--which, as announced, will take place in the immediate future--these agreements shall be signed. But you know, you really must take a different kind of approach to this. Presidential visits do not necessarily always result in the signing of treaties, agreements, pacts, and so forth. The nature of such visits is completely different. These visits, I would say [hesitating], they open up....[Drzycimski changes thought] They raise the standards, they create opportunities, both for prime ministers and for ministers, but one should perhaps emphasize even more strongly that these visits also create opportunities for people who manage institutions, workplaces, for local governors on both sides of the border--these are the opportunities for them to kind of follow the [high-ranking officials'] lead. It is that aspect which will determine whether or not these meetings made sense. The presidents of both countries--that is to say, Lech Walesa and Michal Kovac--discussed very significant political issues, which are important not only for the countries of the Visegrad Group but also for the countries of Central and East Europe as well. To us, Partnership for Peace, which has been accepted by all the countries of the Visegrad Group, is a path of some kind, that is to say, it may be such a path, but it may also be kind of a concealed attempt to rebuild a sphere of influence--the sphere from which we fled. In that regard, President Kovac, for instance, also focused our attention on the fact that our military cooperation is just excellent--both immediately across the border, and globally, between our two countries. [Swiac] The issue of Partnership for Peace has a direct impact on issues linked with the Polish Army. We will see some changes in the Army. Those who are critical of these planned changes--the Sejm National Defense Commission among others--are charging [hesitating] that the changes will lead to a kind of elimination of the civilian part from the Army. [Drzycimski] That is not possible for a very simple reason: If we intend to join NATO, then one of the preconditions.... [Swiac, interrupting] Exactly. [Drzycimski] One of the preconditions is civilian supervision over the Army. But there is a general trend to retain civilian supervision in a determinant manner. In that area, there is no willingness to eliminate civilian supervision over the Army, neither on the president's part, nor, I think, on the part of the [Defense] Ministry. The reason is that if we were to do that, we would kind of contradict everything we have done so far. This entire change is not just for its own sake; it must at the same time have some safety valves which will guarantee that the Army is efficient and able to conduct a full mobilization if there is such a need. It is not the case that we live in an isolated world. There are different situations occurring around our country, in particular on the Eastern side. It is not the case that we are afraid of war. We do not expect a war to come from the outside, but what we want is that our country's territory is such that we have guarantees of its security and sovereignty.
