In Sweden there are discussions to move the Swedish company in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to Bosnia. This could take place quickly, but there are several problems; among other things, the Swedish UN soldiers must accept to serve in Bosnia. They have been sent on a peacekeeping mission in the FYROM and in Bosnia they will risk ending up in conflicts. [Correspondent Boerje Remdahl] The question on whether to move the Swedish UN unit from FYROM to Bosnia is currently being studied by the government. The military headquarters have not yet received instructions to prepare the transfer of the troops there. Sweden, Norway, and Finland all have their rifle company and service and staff personnel in FYROM, and the redeployment now spoken about concerns the 250 Swedes, among others. The soldiers will be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to serve in Bosnia. The task in FYROM that they signed up for is a peacekeeping contribution, while serving in Bosnia includes the risk of ending up in conflicts, despite the fact that there now is a cease-fire to monitor. [passage omitted] The transfer of the Swedish company, or the whole battalion, can take place quickly provided that Sweden, Norway, and Finland can agree. It might be more difficult for Finland than for Sweden and Norway to send its soldiers from FYROM to Bosnia, because the Finnish Government does not accept participation in any other UN tasks than strictly peacekeeping operations. [passage omitted] Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says that he expects a meeting of Nordic defense ministers to take place in a few days to discuss the UN's wishes to transfer the FYROM battalion to control the cease-fire in Bosnia. The tasks in FYROM can possibly be taken over by U.S. UN units.
