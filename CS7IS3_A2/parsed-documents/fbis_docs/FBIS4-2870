Situated on the Chang Jiang River, Jiujiang was designated an open city by the central government in May 1992. Since then, Jiujiang has been working hard to improve its environment in a bid to draw foreign investment. The transportation situation has been greatly improved as the Chang Jiang River Bridge at Jiujiang and the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway were opened to traffic a year ago. The construction of a highway linking Jiujiang and Jingdezhen, the "capital of porcelain", is about to start. The Port of Jiujiang is also open to all foreign vessels. Routes for container ships from Jiujiang to other parts of the world have also been opened. The city is to open air routes to Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou before long, in addition to the established destinations of Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang. Three railways including the Beijing-Kowloon line under construction now converge at Jiujiang. Communications construction has also been accelerated. By the end of last year, all telephones in the city were automated, linking Jiujiang with 1,600 cities and towns in China and more than 180 countries and regions. The improved environment has attracted a growing number of foreign investors. Jiujiang absorbed 30.64 million U.S. dollars investment in some 30 industries last year.
