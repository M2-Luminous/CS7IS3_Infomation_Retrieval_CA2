FR940418-0-00028 FR940418-0-00009 Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 601, et seq., the Commission's final analysis in this Report and Order is as follows: I. Need and Purpose of This Action This Report and Order adopts policies governing the transmission of the calling party number parameter and its associated privacy indicator on interstate calls. Several commenters to the NPRM in this proceeding have identified a number of potential uses for interstate calling party number based services, including caller ID, and have indicated that it also will improve certain existing communication service offerings. We find that the potential benefits of interstate passage of calling party number far exceed any negative effects. We thus adopt the conclusion reached in the NPRM that interstate caller ID and other calling party number based services are in the public interest and should be available to interstate subscribers nationwide pursuant to the policies and rules set forth in this order. II. Summary of Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis No comments were submitted in direct response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. III. Significant Alternatives Considered The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding requested comments on several proposals as well as the views of commenters on other possibilities. The Commission has considered all comments and has proposed regulations which require the passage of calling party number where SS7 is deployed, facilitate interstate calling party number based services, including caller ID, and implement federal policy on privacy.
