Yesin, chief of Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff Operations Directorate, by Aleksandr Dolinin; place and date not given: "Missiles Are Not Now Targeted at Each Other. But Missilemen's Alert Duty Is Not Being Abolished"] [Text] During the U.S. President's recent visit to Russia documents were signed on the dismantling of Ukrainian missiles, on the respective nontargeting of Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear missiles.... All this directly concerns the Strategic Missile Forces, which constitute the basis of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. To what extent are their tasks being complicated? Is there no longer any point to continuous alert duty? Lieutenant General Viktor Yesin, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff Operations Directorate, answers these and other questions. [Dolinin] Viktor Ivanovich, will anything change in the strategic missilemen's service if the intentions to alter the assigned flight missions [poletnyye zadaniya] are realized? [Yesin] They will continue on alert duty. The mutually acceptable accord reached on the nontargeting of missiles means for us that they will have a "zero" assigned flight mission. Day-to-day control of nuclear systems will proceed from the premise that Russia, as defined in its military doctrine, regards no state as its adversary. We will be threatening no one, but this in no way rules out the possibility, in a certain situation, of feeding targets into the missiles' control system on an order from the supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces -- the president of Russia. This possibility remains, and the meaning and purpose of alert duty are not changing. Missilemen must always be ready to defend the fatherland. [Dolinin] In connection with the fact that, in accordance with the trilateral statement by the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine, the RS-22 (SS-24) missiles on Ukrainian territory will be deactivated over the course of 10 months by removing their warheads, what obligations are imposed on the Strategic Missile Forces? [Yesin] In accordance with the agreements reached between Ukraine and Russia back in 1993, Russia will provide maintenance and ensure the technical safety of the nuclear warheads being removed, as well as dismantling them in its own enterprises. If the Ukrainian side shows an interest, on the conclusion of appropriate mutually advantageous agreements it will be possible to salvage the missiles currently in Ukraine at the already prepared Russian elimination bases. We have everything necessary for this. [Dolinin] What will happen to the missilemen officers in the event of the elimination of nuclear missile weapons in Ukraine? [Yesin] Approximately one-third of the officers of the 43d Missile Army serving in Ukraine evince a desire to be transferred to Russia. There are places for officers who have shown themselves to positive advantage during service. There is a shortage of officers in the Strategic Missile Forces, particularly in primary posts. Things are more complex with senior officers. We could take on many, but we cannot at once provide them with housing. Today there are more than 8,000 members of the Missile Forces without apartments. Not everything is within our power. [Dolinin] In accordance with the START I and START II Treaties, missiles with multiple reentry vehicles are to be removed from the effective combat strength of the Strategic Missile Forces. Only single-warhead missiles will remain. Today these account for only one-third of the missiles on alert duty. What will make up for the rest? [Yesin] First, I deem it necessary to point out that production of missiles with multiple reentry vehicles for the needs of the Missile Forces has been terminated, and within the framework of the international accords signed by Russia they will be taken off alert duty as the warrantied (service) life expires. Second, under the START I and START II Treaties the quantitative makeup of the Strategic Missile Forces grouping will be reduced. In order to maintain the deterrent potential of the Strategic Missile Forces at the necessary level for defense needs, work is under way in the Missile Forces in the context of life-prolonging technology [po resursosberegayushchey tekhnologii] to modernize the missile complex with a single-warhead missile. Colonel General I. Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, is devoting very close attention to this question. On New Year's Eve he chaired a state commission session with the participation of general and chief designers. It was pointed out there that we are ensuring the readiness to begin proving-ground tests of a modernized single-warhead missile, which is to replace those whose service life has expired -- those, so to speak, which have grown old naturally. ...Given all the objective processes and the existing difficulties, the future of the Strategic Missile Forces is predictable, and the life, activity, and combat training of missilemen are proceeding in a planned manner.
