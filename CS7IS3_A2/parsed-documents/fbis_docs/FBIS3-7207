Pak Dong-chun, the North Koreanrepresentative in Paris, told LIBERATION yesterday that his country will view the imposition of "economic or other" sanctions as a "declaration of war by the United States and those aligned with it, including France." His statements were confirmed by the official North Korean radio. "The situation on the Korean peninsula is at a very negative turning point," Pak Dong-chun said. He added that his country is "ready for dialogue, but also for all-out war, and that this is not just a lot of hot air." South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who began a tour of Japan and China yesterday to rally support from the two countries, warned that "there were limits" to South Korea's "patience." The South Korean Armed Forces were put on a state of alert on Wednesday. The annual U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers known as Team Spirit -- the holding of which was announced yesterday by Seoul -- would have "catastrophic" consequences, according to Pak Dong-chun. "Dialogue is still possible," he explained, "but first the maneuvers must be canceled." The imposition of UN sanctions and the actual installation of 160 Patriot antimissile missiles which Washington decided to station in South Korea "could lead to North Korea's definitive withdrawal from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT]." Pyongyang, which ratified the treaty in January 1992, announced its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993, although it suspended the withdrawal in June, just one day before it was to take effect. Yesterday, Russia suggested convening an international conference to find "a comprehensive settlement" to the crisis. According to Moscow, this conference will have to bring together "Russia, China, the United States, Japan, North Korea, and South Korea, as well as representatives of the UN secretary general and the IAEA director general."
