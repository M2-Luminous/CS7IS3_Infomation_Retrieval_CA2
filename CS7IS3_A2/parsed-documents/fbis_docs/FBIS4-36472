The deeper he sank, the more his colleagues deserted him: Shahal denied responsibility, Aloni doubted the merit of his explanation, and the prime minister's bureau was conspicuously silent. The resulting -- and well-founded -- impression was that the publicized letter was not all there was. That there was more. And if that was not enough, a close perusal of the publicized text of the letter -- which was supposed to have been written by experienced diplomats -- made one wonder about its grave inconsistencies. The government's credibility plummeted, and the Jerusalem issue acquired a more critical edge. How valid are the prime minister's pronouncements about "united Jerusalem, Israel's eternal capital," when the foreign minister refers to eastern Jerusalem (not even "East Jerusalem") as a distinct unit? The angry Peres offered no convincing explanations, and certainly no solutions. The grave problems created by his letter, by 'Arafat's interpretation of the letter, and by the circumstances surrounding its nonpublication and publication can be at least partially attenuated by immediate, categorical action, such as a bill banning PLO political activities in Jerusalem and prohibiting the use of PLO emblems in the city. Yet time is the most crucial factor in this matter. They can do it with utmost speed, if they so wish.
