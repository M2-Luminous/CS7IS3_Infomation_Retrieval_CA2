The National-Patriots Shift Their Sympathies to the North Korean Dictator"] [Excerpt] The 29 March INTERFAX report quoting Aleksandr Panov, former Russian ambassador to South Korea and currently Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, saying that Moscow will render assistance to North Korea in the event of unprovoked aggression against it because Russia, as successor to the USSR, is linked with the DPRK by a corresponding treaty of 1961, according to Foreign Ministry officials distorts the essence of the Russian position. In response to a request from SEGODNYA's correspondent to provide the full text of the deputy minister's statement, however, Foreign Ministry employees said that so far they had no verbatim record of the speech themselves. Even so, such statements like those cited by INTERFAX are already being heard from deputies of the Russian State Duma. On 28 March North Korea's main communist paper NODONG SINMUN printed, in the place where odes glorifying the "great leader" Kim Il-song are usually published, an "angry statement" by Viktor Ilyukhin, Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and other Russian parliamentarians about their "profound concern" over the aggravation of the situation in Korea (which is true in itself). They condemned not the North Korean blackmailing, however, but "certain U.S. circles advocating the so-called new world order and setting new unjustified demands on our traditional ally -- the DPRK -- which only exacerbates the situation and arouses surprise and indignation."
