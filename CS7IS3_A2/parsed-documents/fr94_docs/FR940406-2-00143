FR940406-2-00143 FR940406-2-00090 2. Applicant Eligibility Seven commenters were concerned with the requirement that, if the owner has not submitted a Notice of Intent to sell, the applicant must have a binding commitment from the owner to sell to the applicant. Several suggested that a letter of intent to sell should be adequate, others that a letter to work exclusively with the applicant should be sufficient. The wording ``binding agreement to sell'' is statutory; however, the Department agrees that it would be impractical to require a purchase and sale agreement before the applicant has become an eligible purchaser under the preservation program and/or has become a sponsor with the capacity to purchase, own, and manage the property. Therefore, the Department interprets the binding agreement to sell as an exclusive agreement to work with the applicant entity towards a sale unless it subsequently becomes clear that the applicant is not moving towards that goal in a reasonable and timely manner. If the owner seeks to work with another entity without the consent of the applicant, consultation with the intermediary on what constitutes a timely manner would be required. Four commenters requested that HUD clarify what ``seeking to purchase with a majority of resident support'' means. One suggested it should be clear that the intention of the applicant is to become an eligible purchaser in the first six months of the sale period. Several thought applicants should be required to detail the method for securing support and adhere to that method. One thought that to require a majority-supported preferred priority purchase in order to receive later grant funds is not inconsistent with the statute. The application kit will require that each applicant detail its method for securing resident support, and this will be reviewed by the intermediary in deciding whether the plan to achieve a resident-supported purchase is reasonable and achievable. In general, applicants must adhere to their grant plans to receive further funding. Seven commenters said documented resident opposition to a grantee should be sufficient to reject or terminate a grant; four of these commenters also requested that resident withdrawal of support for a grantee stop all funding. Two commented that HUD should be required to address the reasons for withdrawal of funding. One commented that residents should be able to appeal the selection of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) applicant, and that termination should be allowed for nonperformance. The Department reiterates that termination of a grant for nonperformance has always been the Department's practice. The Department has included in the NOFA the provision that a majority of resident opposition to the applicant prior to approval of an application would be sufficient for the intermediary to reject the application. In addition, a majority of resident support for another eligible entity at any time would be sufficient for termination of the grant. One commenter stated that Resident Capacity grants should only be given to groups that will not seek to purchase and recipients should be disqualified as a priority purchaser. Another, however, said that potential purchasers should not be categorically prohibited from receiving Resident Capacity grant funds. One commenter said the NOFA should maintain the Resident Capacity-applicant concept that RCs, Resident Groups and Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers (CBDs) are equally eligible. The Department believes that the statute is clear on eligibility in this case. Nonprofit community-based housing developers may receive Resident Capacity grants in order to educate and organize the residents and resident organizations. However, in the case of competing applications for Resident Capacity grants, the intermediaries will give preference to resident groups and resident organizations. A commenter said that grantees should be required to demonstrate fiscal standards or to use grant funds to establish them. The Department has included this requirement in previous grant programs and will continue to include the requirement. Four commenters suggested that the threshold for resident membership in resident groups should be raised to 10% of the units. One suggested that all recipients should have this support. Another suggested that a committee structure that involves residents by building or floor should be required. Another commenter, however, felt that the proposed NOFA set a realistically low threshold for demonstrating resident support at an early stage and that, instead, the requirement should be for ongoing progress toward gaining greater resident support. The Department has not increased the minimum unit threshold, but will, through its guidance to intermediaries, require direct assistance grantees to show continued effort towards gaining resident support. One commenter stated that resident groups that are not yet Resident Councils should not be able to apply for Resident Capacity grants. Again, the statute is clear on this point_resident groups are eligible for these grants. Two commenters felt that Resident Capacity grant applicants should be required to identify persons carrying out activities and their qualifications. The Department has clarified this in the NOFA. One commenter suggested that joint venture applications should be permitted from any eligible applicants. The Department has clarified this in the NOFA. Five commenters wanted clarification that a Notice of Election to Proceed under the provision of section 604 of LIHPRHA (Form 9610) should count as a Notice of Intent for purposes of eligibility. The Department has made this clarification. Two others suggested that the Form 9610 should make a property eligible regardless of whether or not the owner is currently proceeding under the program. The Department will not allow applications in properties when the owner is not proceeding under the program at this time. A Form 9610 will count as a Notice of Intent under this NOFA only if the owner has checked box B on that form and is proceeding under the program. Not many owners have submitted a Form 9610 electing to proceed through the LIHPRHA appraisal process, but have not subsequently submitted a Notice to the Department indicating their intent to proceed. Three commenters suggested expanding the definition of eligible applicants. One suggested including Community Action Agencies, which have been servicing the low-income community in all areas for more than 25 years, and Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations. One felt Statewide organizations should be eligible for Resident Capacity grants. The third suggested that where there is no existing CBD (in rural or underserved areas), a new CBO should be able to align itself with an existing nonprofit that has two years of experience. Again, the Department believes the statute is clear: these are not eligible applicants. One commenter sought clarification that if the owner is not selling, residents can receive a Resident Capacity grant. Two commenters sought further clarification that resident capacity grants are separate from Predevelopment grants and can be awarded concurrently and to separate organizations. The Department has made both of these clarifications. One commenter felt the word ``community'' was vaguely defined in the NOFA, and that even if an organization has not been active throughout its entire region for some time, the organization should not be precluded from applying for a grant. The Department has repeated the statutory requirement in this case, and believes it is clear.
