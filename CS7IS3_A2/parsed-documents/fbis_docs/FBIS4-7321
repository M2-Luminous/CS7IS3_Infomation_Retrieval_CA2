Then the demonstrators assembled on a city square to give moral support to Mongolian opposition members who have been on a hunger strike for 11 consecutive days. Following the hospitalization of several hunger strikers, 34 of them now remain. The opposition forces intend to use the hunger strike to compel the government to resign. Accusations of official corruption and discontent with government policy in spheres such as social welfare, education, and agriculture have served as the formal pretext for the protests. No serious incidents occurred, with the exception of attempts by government supporters to use smoke bombs and firecrackers to hinder the demonstration. The security forces monitored [kontrolirovali] the situation, observed the demonstrators from afar and did not intervene in the events. The country's President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat had a meeting with the hunger strikers several days ago. However, the hunger strikers, who were joined by former Vice President Radnaasumbereliyn Gonchigdorj, refused to stop their action in spite of attempts at persuasion. They say they will strike until the government agrees to make concessions.
