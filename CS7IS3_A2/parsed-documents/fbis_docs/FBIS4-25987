In co-operation with a Japanese vocational school, Tianjin Medical University started its first optometry course in 1991, and it is still the only one in China. The course covers medical and optical knowledge, and materials science. Other subjects urgently needed as the Chinese economy expands have also entered the ivory tower, such as toy engineering, fashion design, advertising, appraisal and marketing of jewelry, indoor decoration and gardening. Toy engineering is offered by the Tianjin Light Industry Institute. Associate Professor Wang Yuliang said that the evolution of toys is closely linked with human progress and scientific development. Wang noted that the toy industry in China can only match the 1960s level of the advanced countries. At present, China produces 7,000 kinds of toys, a fraction of the world total. China now has more than 1,000 toy makers, but only one such major in institutes of higher learning. So it is no wonder that all students are snapped up every year upon graduation, Wang said.
