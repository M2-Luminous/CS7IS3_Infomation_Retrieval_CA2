It renewed its rejection of the "undertaking statement" which the occupation forces want the detainees to sign before they can be released from detention centers. A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's Damascus bureau has received, says: [passage omitted] "We condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment and undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government responsible for anything that may happen to him." The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that their detention will lead only to further escalation and resistance against the occupation."
