FBIS3-54590 "drnes019_q_94003" FBIS-NES-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Jan 1994 Bangladesh Involvement in Anti-India Activities Denied BK2501121194 Dhaka DAINIK INQILAB in Bengali 18 Jan 94 p 5 BK2501121194 Dhaka DAINIK INQILAB Language: Bengali Article Type:BFN [Editorial: "False Propaganda -- Indian Style"] [Text] The Bangladesh Rifles [border security force of Bangladesh] has termed as totally false, malicious, and calculated the report published in a section of the Indian press saying that a Pakistani intelligence agency is operating its bases in Bangladesh with the consent of the Bangladesh authorities with a view to carrying out subversive activities in India. Commenting on this propaganda made by the Indian media, a spokesman of the Bangladesh Rifles said that there are three objectives behind publishing this report. These include 1) confusing the Indian citizens, 2) diverting the attention of the international community from the fact that India is providing assistance to the Chakma rebels of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and 3) obstructing the development of friendly ties between India and her neighbors. Except for Pakistan, all the other countries of the subcontinent are very weak in comparison to India. It is superior to these countries from all points of view including wealth, manpower, army, and weaponry. Almost every country of this subcontinent is aware of the superiority of India. Hence, the question does not arise that they will make any move to challenge India. These countries do not even dare to think of making any such a venture. Each of these countries wants to preserve its independence, sovereignty, national identity, history, and cultural traditions. For this reason, the fundamental principle of the foreign policy of Bangladesh is "friendship with all and malice toward none." Since its independence, Bangladesh has abided by this policy. However, it has not been possible for Bangladesh to live in peace despite its sincere desire. Its immensely powerful neighbor, India, is continuing with its repression against Bangladesh and subjecting it to various injustices. India's aggressive designs have created tension along the border of Bangladesh. With a view to disintegrating this country, India is providing shelter and providing arms training to the secessionist forces of Bangladesh known as Bangobhumiwallahs. These militants often intrude into the country and carry out subversive activities. Apart from this, by unilaterally withdrawing the waters of the Ganges River, India is causing immense hardship to Bangladesh both in the dry and the rainy seasons. It has also allured and provoked the Chakma tribals living in Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh to leave the country and take refuge in sanctuaries in India. It has also imparted arms training to the Chakmas who repeatedly carry out raids in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This has threatened peace and stability in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region for a long time. Every move made by Bangladesh to find a permanent solution to the Chakma problem has been frustrated by India through its illegal intervention. Under these circumstances, the Indian media has launched a campaign saying that Bangladesh is collaborating with the activities of a Pakistani intelligence agency in India. What can be a greater farce than this? In fact, the rebellion, tension, disturbances, and secessionist movements in the northeastern states of India is an old problem. With the passage of time, this problem has worsened and has become more severe. It is getting out of control and threatening regional stability. This is, however, an internal affair of India. A small country like Bangladesh never had the time to ponder the problems of a neighboring country. Moreover, the question of assisting any other country against India does not arise. Despite this, a section of the Indian media has leveled such allegations against Bangladesh. This is called the Indian style of false propaganda. It is entirely fabricated and malicious. This is their habit. They do not feel ashamed to do such things. However, it is true that they will gain nothing by doing so. By digging a ditch for others, they will fall into it themselves.
