The agreement was reached at a meeting among South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa here today. The three diplomats said that sanctions against Pyongyang were inevitable now since the opportunity for measurements from DPRK's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor is damaged, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Earlier, the DPRK refuted the allegation that the measurements had become impossible, saying discharging fuel rods at the reactor was always under IAEA camera screening. The three sides agreed that close Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation is necessary in dealing with DPRK's nuclear issue, the spokesman said. However, there was no report on any statement by Tarnoff and Kakizawa themselves after the meeting. The spokesman quoted Kakizawa as saying that Japan will take responsible actions "within the limits of the Japanese Constitution" when the U.N. Security Council decides to act. Tarnoff and Kakizawa arrived here over the weekend for key talks with South Korean officials on the nuclear controversy. Strongly opposing sanctions, DPRK has stated that its nuclear program is peaceful. It warned that imposition of sanctions will be an act of war.
