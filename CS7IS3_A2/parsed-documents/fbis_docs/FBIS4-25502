Tsou and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Paris, June 10 (CNA) -- French Engineering conglomerate the Bouygues Group is interested in tapping the Taiwan and Asian markets through cooperation with Taiwan counterparts, a firm spokesman said Thursday [9 June]. Michel Derbesse, managing director of Bouygues' Construction Engineering Department, said in an interview that his company is seeking appropriate partners in Asia to explore the dynamic Asian regional [words indistinct]. Bouygues, [words indistinct] leader in infrastructure engineering technology, boasted an annual business turnover of US$14 billion last year. The company recently completed construction of the Channel Tunnel linking France and Britain using its self- developed plate drilling machines. The French engineering giant entered the Asian market a few years ago. Its recent achievements in the area include a colossal open- air all-purpose stadium in Hong Kong, and a new city in Thailand which is regarded as an engineering marvel. Bouygues is also a veteran builder of nuclear power plants. Commenting on the recent controversy over the proposed fourth nuclear power plant in Taiwan, Derbesse said France had also experienced similar problems. Opposition, however, died away gradually as the people were convinced of the safety of the plants. Derbesse said Bouygues volunteered its technical assistance to the Chernobyl nuclear plant after the plant exploded in 1986. Michel Demarre, manager of the company's Asian operations, said that Taiwan can serve as a springboard to other markets in the Asia- Pacific region. Demarre added that he hopes Bouygues can begin business in Taiwan by working on projects related to the Six-Year National Development Plan. Demarre said Bouygues is ready to offer its services in freeway, bridge, tunnel and seaport development, and in other fields including oil drilling on seabeds, water treatment, telecommunications, industrial pollution prevention, foodstuff processing, and motion picture and television film production.
