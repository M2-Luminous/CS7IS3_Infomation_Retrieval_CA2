To sum up, there is no change. The fighting is continuing in the streets of the Rwandan capital. Press correspondents on the spot report, I quote, that fighting is raging and that UN officials fear that Hutu-Tutsi clashes may spread beyond the capital. There is also confirmation of the involvement of the Rwandan opposition in these hostilities. Yesterday the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front left the location where they were taking cover and are involved in exchanges of fire with the regular army troops. The toll of the clashes is particularly high, according to a UN official. In Kigali, fires are raging at certain points, and hand-to-hand fighting has been witnessed on the streets of the capital. In Brussels, a first review of the situation was carried out yesterday evening and continued into the early hours of the night. At midday or perhaps early this afternoon, the government is going to resume its review of the situation in the presence of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who has returned from abroad. Foreign Minister Willy Claes will return later today. Any decision concerning evacuation that might have to be made will probably be announced in the afternoon. In any case, since yesterday, paracommando troops have been preparing for every eventuality. There appears to be a general mobilization this morning in the Belgian paratroop camp, and the paratroopers of Flawinne barracks were recalled very early this morning. The situation is exactly the same at Stokkem barracks, where the soldiers have also been recalled. [passage omitted]
