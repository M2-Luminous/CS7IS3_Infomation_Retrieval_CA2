Netanyahu was elected party chairman and candidate for prime minister when he won the Likud primary by a landslide last March. Sharon withdrew from the race, but it was clear that he had not relinquished his ambitions for leadership and was only postponing his challenge. The Likud rules make a new primary impossible without a 75 percent majority. Sharon suggested this rule be amended. He further argued that the primary result is "not valid or relevant any more because it was held at a very difficult time for the Likud. By the time new elections are scheduled, things will be even more different, hence the need to re-consider who is to lead the party to the polls." Taking Netanyahu's leadership to task, Sharon charged that "the Likud is not prepared to wage any struggle and it has yet to even crystallize its own policies and alternatives. The Likud simply does not appear now as the leader of the opposition." The remedy for this, according do Sharon, is that rather than entrust the leadership to Netanyahu, "the Likud be lead by a team."
