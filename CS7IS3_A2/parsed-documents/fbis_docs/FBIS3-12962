In the name of the Cultural and Information Bureau and on behalf of the comrade bureau directors and members, I am pleased to extend our congratulations to you on the conclusion of your 28th session. In as much as it is an occasion to express your joy, it is also an occasion to recall your experiences during the short period of this course and to conclude lessons for the future. [passage omitted] "Hope and Challenge" is the title of a strategy that stems from historical awareness of the events in the present phase -- crucial events in rare and extraordinary circumstances. This historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and political theories that judge events in the superficial traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western propaganda. They portray the Arab situation as a vacuum that cannot be filled by a nation with history or created by struggle. Therefore, the comrade graduates of this course are called upon, now that they have acquired qualitative ideological weapons from the spirit of the Mother of Battles, to face these political and ideological challenges with historical logic backed by scientific thought, struggle spirit, and cultural heritage. The speech by the comrade leader on the third anniversary of the 30-state aggression crowns all the intellectual efforts exerted after the Mother of Battles to provide full answers to the questions presented by Arab destiny and the national, Arab, and international future. You, comrades, are humanity's vanguard on the path of straightening out ideology and cleansing souls and spirits of all the corruption in the universe, thereby declaring the inevitable downfall of the cultural structure, which lacks moral bases and human spirit. You are the builders of a new civilization, just as your forefathers were the first builders of civilization. As in the dawn of human history, Iraq today is a great teacher of history, civilization, and struggle. It is a living embodiment of the spirit of the vision, and the immortal meanings of patriotism, nationalism, and humanitarianism. This is a starting point for a decisive, historical transformation in the life of the nation and the modern world. Congratulations to you and to Iraq for alerting mankind to the reality of a changing conspiratorial world, foiling the electronic war game, and exposing U.S. victory claims by preventing the evil 30-station aggression from undermining our great principled steadfastness, cultural struggle, and material and spiritual reconstruction whose miracles have been achieved on the land of Iraq under the leadership of the hero of Iraq and the nation comrade leader Saddam Husayn. [passage omitted] Comrades, the theorization taking place today about the superior American way of life, "the Zionist era," and "the American age" or "Americanism" is only a distortion of civilization and an expression of delusions based on half truths. This is in addition to its inherent weaknesses, moral regression, and cultural alienation . "Americanism", which seeks to generalize the American way of life, is founded on three bases: 1. Superiority, challenge, and violence as reflected by the cowboy mentality, to quote Quincey Wright. 2. Bigotry based on race and Protestant religious values. 3. Expediency which believes in the relativity of values and uses success as a standard for truth. These bases make the American feel he is the master of standards. The double-dealing that permeates U.S. morality, the exploitation of freedom as applied to money matters and the media, and the compromise of values make everything in the American way of life, even honor and sovereignty, subject to bargain and compromise. Under such pragmatism, life itself becomes a series of deals. Thus, war is a deal; peace is a deal; persuading others to surrender and accept established facts is a deal;, publicizing and marketing liberal democracy and human rights to turn political and economic institutions into annexes for the U.S. capitalist system is a deal; considering religion, patriotism, and nationalism as fundamentalism which must be avoided; publicizing Western secularism and internationalist trends; opening up fronts against nationalism, Arabism, and Islam; advocating common strategies to fight Arab awakening and to Americanize and Judaize life in the world are all deals. There is only one starting point for facing this aggressive American model which serves Zionist aims: namely, the Mother of Battles' spirit, rationalism, renewed unity principles, true democracy, and socialism based on lessons learned from world experiments which express true human tendencies and address the needs of national awakening. The Mother of Battles embodies the alternative Arab cultural model which can, in a balanced and integrated manner, interact with ideology and technology, revolution and wealth, and Man and his humanitarian mission, because the Mother of Battles is a spark from the mission's spirit, the Ba'thist spirit. You, the sons of the Mother of Battles, have the responsibility to build this new cultural model and to defend it with intellect, struggle, construction, creativeness and by raising the nation's struggle power to the point where it can settle the historic confrontation in favor of Arabism and human civilization. You are qualified to assume this responsibility. I congratulate you and wish you great success in your struggle tasks under the principled historical leadership of leader comrade Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him. Peace be upon you.
