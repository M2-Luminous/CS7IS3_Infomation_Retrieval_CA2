FR940318-1-00024 FR940318-1-00007 The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class E airspace at Juneau, and Dillingham, AK. The Alaskan Region Flight Standards Division is preparing to conduct tests and establish IFR approach and departure procedures using DGPS at the Juneau Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface within an area beginning at lat. 57 ○50 ’00 ’ ’ N, long. 134 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ W; to lat. 58 ○20 ’00 ’ ’ W, long. 134 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ W; to lat. 58 ○39 ’00 ’ ’ N, long. 134 ○47 ’00 ’ ’; to lat. 58 ○33 ’00 ’ ’ W, long. 136 ○36 ’00 ’ ’ W; to point of beginning, in addition to the existing 1200 foot transition area, is needed for IFR operations for the airport. Two DME holdings fixes (INDRA and POWEE) have been developed for holding at the Dillingham Airport. Additional controlled airspace from 1200 feet above the surface within a 22-mile radius of the Dillingham collocated very high frequency omnidirectional range and ultra high frequency distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) extending clockwise from the 308 radial to the 059 radial, 1200 foot transition areas, is needed for IFR operations. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and in its place uses the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 and 1200 foot transition areas. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as 700/1200 foot transition areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that these proposed regulations only involve an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(l) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
