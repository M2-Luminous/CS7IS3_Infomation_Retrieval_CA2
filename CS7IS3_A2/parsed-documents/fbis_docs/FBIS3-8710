The British general, head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, spent two hours at the base which was handed over to UN control last week by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army after being closed since May 1992, shortly after the outbreak of the war. Peacekeeping troops have been clearing the airport area of mines left by a succession of Yugoslav, Serb, and Bosnian forces. Rose had been "pleased" by the advanced state of repairs on the runway, base commander Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Jorgen Nielsen told journalists Monday. Asked about the date of the first flight into Tuzla, Nielsen said it was a "question of days." "We have been ready (...) for four or five days. It will come when the politicians have taken a decision," he explained. The first arrival will be an UNPROFOR flight bringing technical material to prepare an airlift of humanitarian aid for the people of northern Bosnia, who are surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces.
